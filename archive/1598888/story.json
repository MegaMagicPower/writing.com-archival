What exactly that is probably has eluded most of you, but it\u2019ll be made clear soon enough and you\u2019ll no doubt thank whoever suggested you take this class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor motioned towards three young ladies that stood lined up by the wall next to the chalkboards in front of the class. \u201cTo my aid I have these three talented women, who have taken this class earlier and are here to help you. Please introduce yourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Jessica Wilborough and I took this class two years ago.\u201d Said the fist girl of the three, who happened to be a fairly tall and busty blonde in rather tight clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m Stacey Taylor and took this class last year.\u201d Said the svelte redhead standing next to Jessica, who was of more average height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m Julianne Defoe and I too took this class last year.\u201d Said the last girl, who was a little black haired cutie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright class, I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019ve been told, but I\u2019m fairly certain that most of you have little clue as of what this class is all about so we\u2019ll start with the basics.\u201d The professor continued. <br>\r\n\u201cVore. Doesn\u2019t say much does it? Well the fundamentals is that the human female body is capable of quite a few feats that has for some reason been forgotten or perhaps not even discovered until fairly recently, probably because most research has ever been done by men and with male subjects. Vore could thus possibly be summarised as the study of these strange biological features that separate many of us from men. I say many because there are quite a few women that don\u2019t have these biological traits either and as cruel as it may sound not all who have them possess\u2026\u201d <br>\r\nThose that were seated close enough thought the professor looked almost smug as she finished. \u201cLet\u2019s say: the same talent for them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk! There\u2019s plenty of theory to divulge in later but to give a solid example which actually also happens to be a very good place to start, I want you all to take a spoon as the TA\u2019s hand them out.\u201d Which cued the three ladies to start doing so and soon enough boxes with spoons were travelling between the rows of students who \u2018armed\u2019 themselves before passing the boxes along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve no doubt heard of countless ladies claiming to have no gag reflexes at all and I\u2019m not talking about women devoid of humour, those are a dime a dozen as well but are not necessarily the same. No I\u2019m talking about the lack of gag reflex that seems to get nigh every boy\u2019s attention.\u201d The professor paused as she saw that she did indeed have every girl\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n\u201cIt is this reflex that we\u2019ll start with teaching you to overcome.\u201d As she said that she could almost feel the heat in the room go up a couple of degrees as more than a couple of girls blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease ready your spoons and look to the Teacher Assistant closest to you for how to do, those of you up front and those who for some reason can\u2019t get a clear view of a TA please look my way and hopefully you can see how I\u2019m doing it. So first we four will give you a demonstration and after that we\u2019ll walk around and give you pointers on how to succeed.\u201d Blainey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst though she drew a simple picture on one of the chalkboards of the mouth and throat and how to insert the spoon. Giving the theory behind it, but theory and practice are two different things, which was why she and the TA\u2019s then demonstrated how it\u2019s supposed to be done and then offered their aid in making the young students succeed in getting the spoons into their throats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot surprising was the cacophony of gagging that followed, though only one or two girls managed to throw anything up. And after a while the disturbing sounds lessened especially after the first few girls got the hang of it and in turn could help their friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while many had succeeded to some extent and most had made very good progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClass remember that you\u2019re not using a technique to avoid gagging, you\u2019re using a technique to teach your body that gagging is unnecessary. Hence it is essential that you practice this until next time, because we can\u2019t really continue with what I have planned if you don\u2019t, so for those who doesn\u2019t manage this by the next class will be stuck with theory alone and a little practical application is just so much more fun.\u201d With that the professor dismissed the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could tell by the buzz as the students left that it had gone well, so smiling she thanked her TAs and went back to her office. New semesters always mean a lot of useless paperwork. <br>\r\nThough with a bit of luck she hoped that in the future she\u2019d be able haul some of it over on the new professor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d been in touch with a professor Hawthorn whom she\u2019d met several times before and they had agreed that it would be beneficial to both their work if Hawthorn relocated her team and research to this University. In fact some of that research was already up and running, though not all if it just yet. The professor is still overlooking the last dismantling of her old lab and won\u2019t arrive until that\u2019s done, meaning in fact quite a bit of extra paperwork for Blainey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the time might not pass too quickly for the professor things are quite different for most of the students, in fact for some a couple of days pass before they \u2018have time\u2019 to practice and it is time for the second lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor had argued with herself and decided that she would make a gamble, why not show the girls what the class really is about? Quite a few of them had seemed to know already and seemed eager for her to get to the good parts and it\u2019d only be fair to everyone if they all knew what to strive for, now wouldn\u2019t it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind she decided to ditch the business suit for something more casual, yet more revealing. Opting for a pair of jeans and a tight yet stretchy shirt, that\u2019d be useful in showing off her abdomen and a look in the mirror confirmed that she kept herself in good enough shape to be allowed to wear such clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast time the students had been so well behaved, but now when she\u2019ll throw a little madness into it Blainey gets that uncertain feeling again, but she just smiles to her own mirror image and convinces herself that it\u2019s uncertain in a good way, before picking up her material and walking off to the classroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is something odd with the class, everyone is in time to it, well in time and as the Professor arrives the class falls quiet and wait for her to begin. This is very odd indeed, even more so considering that the class consists of only women. Still it reassures the professor, they are ready for a little madness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving the students a warm and honest smile the professor greets them. Some of the student\u2019s are a bit surprised about the professor\u2019s appearance. Last time she wore strict clothing, but today she wears more casual clothes, but she still appear at least as intimidating as she did last time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor is wearing a pair of blue skin hugging jeans, rather low cut such, and a rather tight blue-purple top that matches. The ensemble leaves her lower tummy and bellybutton bare, showing the students that she\u2019s in fact in good shape and well curved too. She actually looks very good for a lady in her late thirties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to see that you\u2019re all eager to start and are sitting comfortably in your seats, which makes it a little sad that I have to ask you to rearrange. But I think it\u2019s for the best if we pair up right away. I want you all to look around you and find someone close to your own size and pair up. Don\u2019t worry this is a great opportunity to make new friends who ever you pair up with will be your new practice partner and I assure you that the two of you will have some great fun together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke a bit of rustling had emerged as girls turned in their seats to see who was sitting nearby, some were clearly not into the whole \u2018making new friends\u2019 mood at the moment while others were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk! Please pair up, will you? The sooner you do the sooner we can start.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the girls started changing places in a rather noisy fashion, everyone asking each other questions, even though the ones asking why they had to pair up with someone their own size never got a good answer. Still most did pair up as they had been told and the TAs only had to separate a few pairs where good friends had paired up despite of large size differences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of girls looked a bit lost specifically two, so the professor called for the TAs to lead them to the front of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to interrupt ladies!\u201d Blainey called out and managed to calm the room down somewhat. \u201cBut these two need help in finding a partner, I guess I don\u2019t have to explain why.\u201d She said as she motioned to the two girls standing next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo we have anyone who\u2019ll be Gia\u2019s partner here?\u201d She asked the crowd motioning for the extremely short girl next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGia just barely topped four foot and despite generous curves, even by Latino standards, at least by proportion she had wide hips with a big behind held up thick toned legs and a surprisingly large chest on each side of a fairly slender waist. Despite this there was no denying that she remained a very small woman, a fact not less accentuated by the girl standing next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd do we have a partner for Beatrice here?\u201d Blainey asked as she looked up at the girl in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhereas Gia had trouble finding someone as small as herself Beatrice had exactly the opposite problem, in flats and with the rather tall professor in shoes with a bit of heal she still stood a full head over the professor, unfortunately she wasn\u2019t lanky either. Not that she was fat, in fact she seemed in pretty good shape which probably was the reason as to why she was rather thickly built. Stacey the TA who had escorted her down looked downright scared of the auburn Amazon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take too long before Gia was called up to a girl who matched her size well enough, Beatrice had more trouble and only with the help of the TAs found a slightly reluctant girl who were only a few inches shorter and a little on the soft side, even so the girl still weighed less than Beatrice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that everyone had found a practice partner and a seat. So as the noise level settled the professor silenced the last few conversations with a gesture and addressed the class again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToday we will demonstrate a few things. I know you\u2019ll be better motivated to study if you see there is progress to make. Once you have managed to repress your gag reflex at some point your body will find it unnecessary and you won\u2019t have a problem with gagging any more. Don\u2019t worry this usually happens in the first couple of weeks. Remember practice makes perfect, so the more you practice the faster it will go away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToday we\u2019ll show you what\u2019s possible if you don\u2019t have a gag reflex.\u201d Again she could tell quite a few girls were blushing. \u201cAhh yes, I can tell some of you are have a few naughty thoughts.\u201d Something that didn\u2019t make the girls blush any less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough with the deepthroat I had in mind your boyfriend would be begging to be let out.\u201d That caused most of the blushing girls and a few others to take on a more stupefied than embarrassed look. \u201cYes this is biology from a feminist point of view is it not?\u201d the professor chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA murmur arose amongst the students but the professor seemed to ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell when you have managed to overcome your gag reflex then there is still the problem with getting a large object down your throat. Everything is easier if you get help that is why we have paired you up two and two. So that one can help the other and comment on her progress, tell her what she is doing wrong and assisting. Eventually you\u2019ll be able to swallow large enough objects to practice on each other. Don\u2019t worry if your companion gets to this point before you do, who better to tell you what to do than someone who just crossed over the last barrier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral students conversations got noticeably louder and surprised, Blainey just raised her voice some and with the TA\u2019s gesturing the students fell somewhat silent again as the professor continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever hesitate to ask the TAs for help, they are more than willing, they are here to help. But you might have to be ready that they might prefer giving you a physical example, rather than just telling you what to do. Once you manage to swallow people you\u2019ll understand them, it really is a special thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor had to pause as the students tried to come to grasp with what she had just said and the TAs tried to quiet them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich brings me to the point of extra clothing. It really is necessary for you to bring an extra set of clothes to the class. Even though it might take several weeks before you are swallowed by your companion, someone else might show you what it is like long before that, and I like to pick my \u201cvolunteers\u201d at random, so that it is fair to everyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I hear that many of you are a bit confused so why don\u2019t we just show you. Stacey would you come over here?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redheaded TA made her way to the professor looking like she expected Blainey to eat her as soon as she got there. When that didn\u2019t happen she sighed a visibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou there what\u2019s your name?\u201d Professor Blainey pointed at a cute brunette in the front row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKristin.\u201d Came the answer from a smooth and pleasurable voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you be so kind and come up here and stand next to Miss Taylor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman put her pen and paper to the side and made her way to the TA. She was an average sized girl, she still had that layer of fat on her face that most people loose when they reach twenty, making her look cute. A lean body, sort of soft and nicely curved equipped with a perky set of breasts and a full round bottom that swayed seductively as she walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristin stopped next to the TA and gave the professor a confused look. She was about a couple centimeters taller than Stacey at one hundred and seventy and probably nearly ten kilos heavier with her sixty-six kilos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Taylor is going to show you a couple of skills that comes in handy when swallowing large things, especially if they are unwilling.\u201d The professor said and turned towards Stacey and Kristin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Stacey would you please take Kristin\u2019s hand in your mouth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristin looked a little scared but offered Stacey her hand, who took it and plunged it down her throat, stopping at Kristin\u2019s elbow. Kristin\u2019s lower arm made Stacey\u2019s throat bulge and the professor resumed speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow as you can see Miss Taylor has no trouble breathing as she has learned to breathe with items in her throat. This skill is essential, since swallowing most large things take time and the first times it can take a very long time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow with a large meal in your stomach you\u2019ll be pretty eye catching and it is cumbersome to get around. Should you just swallow a person, it isn\u2019t even sure that you\u2019ll fit through the door. This is why Stacey is going to show us that you can squeeze your meal tight and it will take up less space, this is something that not only comes with practice but also develops with your body as it learns to handle large meals. It is also a matter of technique.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you see Miss Taylor\u2019s throat is bulging and looking rather deformed, please show us what you can do about that Stacey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! It\u2019s so tight!\u201d Kristin yelped as Stacey\u2019s throat almost returned to normal, even though Kristin\u2019s arm was still in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKristin is right, it is tight, something that is useful when keeping struggling meals in place. It is a very effective measure to prevent your meals from escaping. Stacey would you please swallow Kristin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristin said something, but it was muffled as her head quickly disappeared down Stacey\u2019s throat. Stacey held Kristin\u2019s remaining arm to her side and continued to gobble up the young beauty. When she reached Kristin\u2019s waist she lifted the girl off the ground so that Kristin\u2019s legs pointed at the ceiling. Assisted by gravity Stacey had no problem finishing Kristin off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well done Stacey. Now students take a look at Miss Taylor\u2019s abdomen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey pulled up her shirt and showed of her tight bulging tummy. It was large, but not a full grown person in there kind of large, she looked several months pregnant, but not more than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Miss Taylor is rather good at this, you should be happy if you can get away with looking nine months pregnant when you have practiced this as much as she has. As you understand it is a very useful skill, people don\u2019t notice a pregnant woman but if someone looked twelve months pregnant with triplets, then they would soon be on the front page of the local newspaper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell keeping people in you belly brings us to another skill you have to learn before I can let you swallow each other, namely swallowing air. The person in your belly needs air so you have to swallow some every now and then, and it is equally important that you burp out the old air in there. The person in your stomach doesn\u2019t just need oxygen, he or she, also can\u2019t tolerate too high concentrations of carbon dioxide. If the carbon dioxide levels gets too high the oxygen atoms won\u2019t be able to bond to the hem-groups in the blood and the person in your stomach will slowly suffocate, regardless of how much oxygen you give them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hands came into the air and the professor pointed at a curly redhead with a palette of freckles adorning her nose and cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes you said that we probably wouldn\u2019t get as good as Stacey at hiding our meals during this class, but not that we couldn\u2019t become as good or even better as we continued practicing after this course. So my question is how small a bulge can a full grown person become?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly grin spread across the professor\u2019s face as she turned to Stacey. \u201cWell I guess I could show you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey only managed a short yelp before she disappeared down the professor\u2019s throat. The professor used her skills so Stacey hardly showed as she travelled down the professor\u2019s gullet. When she settled into Blainey\u2019s stomach a few seconds later there was no bulge at all in the professor\u2019s stomach to tell of her presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo does that answer your question?\u201d Professor Blainey said as she gently rubbed her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI now have two full grown people in here and there is no bulge at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mumbling \u201cCool\u201d spread across the classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree with most in here, that is cool, and yes it was the answer I was looking for.\u201d Said the now smiling redhead as she stared at the professor in shock and disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny more questions?\u201d Blainey asked the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain several hands appeared and the professor motioned for a little girl with short hair dyed in some sort of purple and piercings in both her ears and nose. Regardless of the style, which usually comes with an attitude problem, she looked like a really sweet girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell first the TA ate Kristin and now you ate the TA, meaning that both of them are in your digestive tract. You haven\u2019t said anything about digestion?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh they are fine in there.\u201d The professor said patting her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are a few things you can do. The first one being doing nothing, and thus leaving your stomach to do what it is designed to do. When you can hide your meal sufficiently, that is usually a good option, since you don\u2019t have to worry about anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecondly you can try and prevent digestion. That is slowing it down. If you are as good as me or a few of the girls in my research team, then you can completely stop the digestion process. Something that might be good should you want to keep a friend in your stomach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe once again stroked the surface of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is what I\u2019ve done now, so I could keep Miss Taylor in here as long as I wanted without hurting her. However I don\u2019t think she can stop her digestion tract, so sooner or later she would end up digesting Kristin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor gave the students a look of mixed emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I should let them out soon, but you will come to learn that having someone in your stomach is a very nice and special feeling indeed.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe paused and smiled mischievously. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll keep them just a little while longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe straightened her pose before she continued. \u201cThe third thing you can do is to speed up the digestion process. This is as you understand very useful, especially if you can\u2019t hide your meal properly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSlowing your digestion can be achieved with a few different techniques and a few different substances. Yes there are a few different pills so far that can help you as well as a couple of potions. All these do concentrate on preventing the stomach to do what it is made to do. Slowing the digestion process after the meal has been passed into the intestines seems a bit pointless, but there are those who study that too, should the need arise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeeding the digestion can be accomplished in lots of ways, and that is also why the diversity of pills and potions that does this is much greater that those that slows it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor starts a little PowerPoint presentation. Mainly it shows cut view of a woman so that you can see her whole digestive tract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirstly you can stimulate the stomach, so that it produces more gastric juices and more effective gastric juices. Don\u2019t underestimate the churning of the stomach, the larger the surface, the more of the meal comes into contact with and can thus react with the gastric juices. It is therefore essential that your stomach is effective at ripping your meal apart. Maybe I should say pulverizing, because in the long end that\u2019s basically what it is trying to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe book takes up several ways to achieve this, a couple of massage techniques and a more concentration based technique that is meant to control your inner muscles and organs. To say the least, this is much harder than any massage. There are of course several other techniques that are not covered by the book, and I won\u2019t go into them. This course is just covering what is in the book. I might start a continuation course to this one, but currently there are none.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen as the meal has been reduced to a nutritious soup there are several ways to amplify the efficiency of the continuing break down of the meal and the absorption process, not to mention the dehydration process. The book covers a few tricks, and I might take up a couple more, but the ones I take up in addition to those in the book won\u2019t be on any tests. It is just going to be for those who wants too improve a little bit more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI almost forgot, you can if you like just hurry the progress of the meal through your intestines, this will give you diarrhoea, sometimes even a lumpy case of such since your meal isn\u2019t digested. It can be useful at times. Fortunately I don\u2019t have to use this solution any more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only drawback as I see it with speeding up digestion is that it usually gets quite noisy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA black haired suntanned girl waved her hand vigorously. She was the only one holding her hand up so the professor addressed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have a problem with a fly, or do you have a question?\u201d Professor Blainey displayed that she too was equipped with the awful sense of humour most professors have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember if I heard it or read it somewhere in the book. But what is power digest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPower digest, is a rather loose term. As you get by its name it is about accelerated digestion. Generally if digestion takes place at such a speed that you can see the process as it occur, then it is considered power digestion. As you see the definition is rather loose, there is no lower end and the upper end is diffuse, maybe digestion within an hour could still be considered power digestion, I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere have been a few power digest competitions among the girls in my research team, I never stayed around to watch, but I think they measures the time it took from first part of the meal entering the mouth until the last of the meal exited at the other end. In other words a rather gross scene to behold, but I guess drunken people can come up with all sorts of weird and gross things, even young researchers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor finished talking and shut down the computer. When she looked up at the class again she saw a waving hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you please show us some power digestion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow you? For that I\u2019d need a meal to digest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell don\u2019t you all ready have two in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to see power digestion I\u2019ll be happy to show the class if you\u2019d come down here and be my meal, but I\u2019m not digesting Stacey and Kristin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor calmed down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, you\u2019d not see much of it anyway, since I won\u2019t relieve myself in here all you\u2019d notice would be my belly rumbling a little. No, the striking part would be hiding the meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Blainey looked down at her tummy and poked it slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStacey I\u2019m going to relax my stomach so that you should show again. I need you to wiggle a little so that my stomach loosens up a bit and the bulge becomes bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey did wiggle more than just a little, she knew the professor was asking her to trash about as much as she could, and she did. Meanwhile the professor tried to relax her stomach as much as possible, so that the bulge should get as large as possible. The result however wasn\u2019t great, a bulge did appear, but it could probably only be seen by the girls on the first row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh. Maybe I should let the TA\u2019s show you this instead. It seems my body prefers to keep my meals in check. But those of you who can see the little bulge I got, watch now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd instantly the bulge disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor took a bottle of orange coloured liquid of her desk and held it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you see this liquid is orange, it is actually colourless, but since it is so important we have decided to colour it. It is what we will use in this class to regurgitate our meals. If you see an orange liquid in here it should be this kind of liquid. I don\u2019t want to catch anyone bringing other orange liquids into my class is that clear? And I don\u2019t want to see any practical jokes with this liquid, because the consequences could be dire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might argue that three are lots of orange sodas and such and that it therefore is a bad choice of colour. I beg to differ. It means you can get a canister for you liquid at the local store that is inconspicuous.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe took a few mouthfuls of the liquid and in seconds she was bringing Stacey back up her throat. Stacey appeared head first and looked to be alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor bent over and let Stacey slide out of her mouth as soon as she had touched the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWet and slimy Stacey got to her feet and took the bottle of orange liquid that she was handed by the professor. She mimicked the movements Professor Blainey had just displayed and soon Kristin was lying on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome Kristin, there are showers back here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the TA and Kristin walked out of the classroom to get themselves showered off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will try to fit in a practice session at the end of each lesson, so that you can benefit from the TA\u2019s and my help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TA\u2019s spread out across the room carrying several bags each with them while the professor continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is very important that you first manage to repress your gag reflex. I hope you all practiced at home, but if you still don\u2019t feel comfortable with the spoon, I suggest that you repeat what we did last time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you are somewhat comfortable with the spoon, then give it to your partner and let her handle it. This is much harder, but if you get the hang of it, it won\u2019t matter what is shoved down your throat. Which is the reason as to why we practice this first, it is hard to get anywhere with vore if you keep gagging on everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn other words practice this as much as you can. You won\u2019t get anywhere unless you spend some serious time with this at home. When you are able to keep from gagging the TA\u2019s will instruct you as how to proceed. As you can see they have brought a lot of fruit with them in all sizes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ta\u2019s held up a couple of different fruits differing from plums too large watermelons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will notice that you have to practice stretching your mouth and throat, so begin with small things and move to larger things as you make progress. You don\u2019t have to throw the fruit back up. I don\u2019t think anyone wants to eat it once it\u2019s been in your stomach. Consider it a free meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students waited until the professor finally got quiet before they started. Most had tried keeping their gagging at bay at home with mixed results. Many hadn\u2019t practiced at all and it showed, they still had problems with the spoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there were others who had showed good progress already during the last session. Still some of those were struggling now because they hadn\u2019t practiced much at home. Never the less many were ready to let their partners handle the spoon for them and soon had no problems with that either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore interesting though were some of the girls who had been practicing a lot at home and in the two days since the last lesson had made serious progress. Amongst the more noticeable were Samantha, Sally and Gia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha had always been a bitch and liked pushing people around. So now that vore presented itself she had every intention of becoming good at it. With an object in her mouth to practice at not gagging she had read as much as she could from the book and had already read what would be covered during the first month and looked at a few more bits as well. She was among the first ones to try the fruits today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGia the little exotic beauty from earlier, she has black healthy hair both straight and thick and it comes down below her shoulders. Her naturally dark skin tone looks like a pleasant tan. One would perhaps expect a little girl like her to be cute, but truth be told she\u2019s got the more sultry and perhaps bitchy appeal common amongst her Latino sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the smallest girl in class she\u2019s gotten a few remarks that she didn\u2019t like. It started already last class with girls saying she\u2019d choke on their pinkie and with the development of this lesson, some girls are saying that they could probably eat her without much practicing. They had been smacking and licking their lips and patting their tummies. This had made Gia determined to practice a lot, she was not going to become someone\u2019s snack without a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally the girl who last time had been the last one to manage anything wasn\u2019t quite as small as Gia but still felt awfully small, not to mention humiliated after really having been last with everything last time. She had actually skipped a few lessons to practice and she hadn\u2019t seen any of her friends since last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had gotten home that day the first thing she did was to get one of her spoons she used for making chocolate milk, it sort of looks like a teaspoon with a really long shaft. Then she had spent most of the evening sitting in front of her toilet shoving the spoon in and out of her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact the clock had become two in the morning before she went to bed. This lead to that she missed her first class but before she went to her second she tried the spoon move again and she hadn\u2019t much problem with it any more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had still continued to practice though, which meant that she was ready to start with giving her practice partner the spoon right away and quickly moving on to fruits and getting help from the Julianne the dark haired TA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the book close at hand to get the techniques right she first tried a pickle, it took a while for her to feel comfortable with it in her throat and something she wanted to before she swallowed it. She then took an apple. This was much more difficult. Though her mouth gave her little trouble her throat stretched slowly to accommodate the fruit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she was most surprised about was that she didn\u2019t have any trouble breathing with the apple in her throat. She guessed the professor had mentioned being able to breathe as something essential because breathing is essential and not because it was something the students would have to learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first apple she had a couple more, and after she had downed her sixth apple she had no problem with her gagging reflex any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considered trying an orange but she spat it out after just a few minutes and decided that she\u2019d rather spend some time stretching her mouth, her throat could wait until tomorrow. So she picked up the largest thing Julianne had brought. It was a yellow melon, bad with names she didn\u2019t care what its correct name was, it was going to help her stretch her mouth and the damn thing weighed at least two kilos.<br>\r\nBut as she turned to go back to her seat Julianne stopped her and gave her some pointers one of which were to ask her partner to help push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJolly she returned to her seat with the golden fruit like it was some sort of treasure while<br>\r\nTiffany just stared at Sally as she returned with the large fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are kidding, you can\u2019t seriously be considering that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure I can and I need your help to push it down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell don\u2019t blame me if something goes wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter consulting the book several times she asked Tiffany to finally help her and she agreed even though she looked a bit shocked at the aspect. <br>\r\nRubbing her jaws Sally\u2019s mouth popped open and she stuffed a good portion of the melon into her mouth. Then Sally grabbed one of Tiffany\u2019s hands and put it on the free end of the melon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany snapped out of her trance and started pushing. It didn\u2019t work very well because Sally was still standing up. So Tiffany got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSally sit down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally did as she was told and Tiffany stood in front of her, or more appropriate would probably be calling it standing over Sally\u2019s lap, since Sally\u2019s thighs were under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany then forced Sally\u2019s head against the back of the seat as she forcefully tried to cram the fruit into Sally. Because Sally couldn\u2019t give the fruit had no option but to slowly disappear into sally\u2019s mouth and down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha! It\u2019s working I knew it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany exclaimed almost as happy as Sally about the progress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the whole melon was inside and Tiffany wondered whether she should continue pushing or not. She tried the not pushing option first and quickly came to the conclusion that Sally still needed her help. Not wanting both her arms in there Tiffany rolled up her right arm sleeve and resumed the pushing, just using her right hand this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany was amazed that Sally could do this.  Slowly her hand disappeared from view as she shoved the melon down Sally\u2019s throat. And eventually her elbow was in Sally\u2019s mouth too. Then with a wet plop the resistance went away and she almost toppled over as the melon finally entered Sally\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEww.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany said as she felt her fingers inside Sally\u2019s stomach and her arm enveloped in Sally\u2019s warm and wet throat. She slowly pulled her arm back out and felt Sally\u2019s tongue taste as much of her as it could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, you\u2019re yummy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally said when Tiffany pulled her hand out of Sally\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany smiled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you mind helping me with another one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally asked, but before she got any answer Tiffany was already halfway to Julianne and shouted at the poor TA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me a melon dammit! I want it yesterday!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, just calm down, the melons aren\u2019t gonna run away you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne said and gave the girl what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen wide\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany teased as she came back to Sally with another yellow melon. Sally playing the good girl did as she was told and was soon feeling her mouth and throat stretching once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis melon went down a little bit easier, it might have had to do with Tiffany pushing harder this time, but it still took quite a while. And Tiffany was pulling her arm back out of Sally\u2019s mouth when the bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you Monday\u201d Sally said. As she and Tiffany went their separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally was rather pleased with today\u2019s practice, her mouth and throat were quite sore, but she had been the only one using melons and she had made up her mind, she was going to sleep with a melon in her mouth until next lesson which would be on Monday, leaving her the whole weekend to practice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Monday morning meant it was time for the third lesson of v101 and a little surprise for the students. The professor was early and waiting for them as the first students arrived to take their seats. So it was with some nervousness that the rows got filled today, luckily it didn\u2019t seem like she was going to start ahead of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne early student seemed pleased to find the professor already here though. She had hoped to get hold of the professor before the class started so this was a perfect opportunity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me professor Blainey?\u201d The young blond said as she approached the professor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d Came the answer as the professor noticed the rather tall athletic student that approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Meghan, I\u2019m new here and I was told to ask you personally. The thing is that I already know vore and would like to make some sort of test so that I won\u2019t have to come here and listen to something I already know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit perplexed the professor took a close look at the young girl standing before her in a pair of beige hotpants and a short tanktop, thus leaving a toned stomach in plain view. Like most athletic girls she has a behind to be envied or admired and breast that might be a bit on the small side, but in return are firm and perky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou already know vore? Well if you do then I see how this class could be rather boring, seeing as it is designed for those that have never heard of vore before. There\u2019s still about fifteen minutes before class starts, so can you tell me a little about yourself and maybe more importantly how you\u2019ve come to know vore. I will try to come up with a test in the meantime to test the skills needed for this class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlad to hear this Meghan broke into a smile. \u201cWell I just moved here, I think you know my mother professor Hawthorn. They decided that it would be better if both your and her research teams were at the same university. That way you could work together more closely and they hoped that any pride loss for loosing a discovery to the other would go away seeing as you now work for the same university.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlainey hid her surprise well enough, she didn\u2019t know Hawthorn had a daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I know Professor Hawthorn. We have been working together on several occasions, that\u2019s then reason why we choose to try this. If it works well, then there will probably come another team in two or three years time. I didn\u2019t know when Professor Hawthorn would come here though since she said she had to overlook all of the dismantling of her old lab. Your mother and I have gotten along very well in the past, it has slipped by me that she had a daughter though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe has three actually, though I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll run into any of my sisters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy older sister is done with college and unfortunately didn\u2019t move here with us, I guess I won\u2019t see her very often now. And my younger sister is only fifteen, so you\u2019ll probably meet her when its time for her to go to college. But then again mom occasionally brings her to her laboratory, so you might see her there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how come your mother haven\u2019t given you these grades already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell she didn\u2019t hold any vore classes on her old school. She concentrated on research and got her PhD hungry students from other universities. As you probably know she\u2019s not going to be holding any classes here either. Somehow I think that the students would rather be eaten by you anyway, you look great. My mother looks good for her age too, but she\u2019s still fifty, if you know what I mean. And you\u2019re the one with the experience at handling students.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell thank you! I guess she won\u2019t cheat me on any meals then.\u201d The professor chuckled and licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you might have guessed my mother taught all of us sisters vore at an early age, I wasn\u2019t even five years old the first time I swallowed my older sister, mom supervised the whole event. And she continued to teach us stuff as we learned more. Now we have all reached the point that mom often ask us to help her try something. Though Hailey is usually volunteering before she has time to ask me or Kim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose growing up with vore has made us a bit different than other girls, which is one of the reasons mom likes to study new theories on us. Most that learn vore do so after they have reached adulthood, often after they have stopped growing. Even so the body adapts, changing a little with each meal and the overall change over a period of time can be enormous. The thing that\u2019s different with me and my sisters is that because we grew up with vore our bodies were still forming when vore made its mark on us, meaning that our bodies are adapted to handle vore like no other my mother has ever seen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan paused for a moment. And the professor raised an eyebrow interested in what this could mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said, my older sister was my first meal, luckily she and I have always liked each other, and we have been the best of friends for as long as I can remember. I believe mom is as glad for this as me and my sister, otherwise one would undoubtedly have digested the other long ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes that would have been my worry with teaching children vore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs it is me and my older sister have always looked out for each other and have also enjoyed eating each other. Do you have any idea how many times two playful children can eat one another in a day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can imagine.\u201d The professor chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then I have to give you some sort of test before I can sign any paper. I\u2019m also a bit interested in seeing what you can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor thinks for a while before she walks off to a bag near the wall and picks up a large water melon. Returning to Meghan she hands her the melon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about you swallow this, and keep it in your stomach until it is time for practice at the end of the lesson. Keep in unharmed because keeping your digestion tract at bay is one of the skills my students must have. Frankly it makes practicing on people all the much easier and I want to see you swallow students later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, no digestion it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan easily pop the melon into her mouth and shows the professor that she knows how to hide a meal, because once the melon is inside her mouth isn\u2019t stretched at all, her cheeks doesn\u2019t even bulge. And as she swallows the melon it makes neither a bulge in her throat or her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep it safe for you.\u201d Meghan said and patted her flat tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I come down here when it\u2019s time for practicing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo that.\u201d The professor said and smiled. Meghan took a seat near a walkway a few rows up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter listening to Blainey telling her stuff she already knows for an hour and a half, Meghan is glad when the professor tells them that it is time for practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TAs take over monitoring and guiding the girls practicing and Meghan comes up to the professor as they agreed she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout the help of any potion Meghan brings the melon back up and spits it out into her hands and gives it to the impressed professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you are. See it\u2019s not even slightly burnt and there is no pressure damage from my stomach either.\u201d Meghan says excited at the aspect of swallowing some people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good. Very good indeed.\u201d Blainey says and puts the melon away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you said you said that you had some talent. I would like to see what you can do, but keep the digestion off, I\u2019m foremost interested in seeing you swallow people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause we are an odd number I don\u2019t have any partner for you, but it sounded like you\u2019d prefer swallowing more than one anyway. And since you\u2019d pass the class we would have an odd number anyway once you\u2019ve proven what you can do had we had a partner for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry if I know anything, it is vore. I would have been more nervous had it been a math test or so. So who\u2019s on the menu?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let\u2019s get some volunteers and you can choose whom to swallow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor turned to the girls at the front rows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you girls please come down here, Meghan says she already knows enough to pass this class and I want to give her an opportunity to do so. It would be really tiresome to force someone to listen to things they already know inside and out, not to mention being in Meghan\u2019s place and be the one listening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the girls had stopped their practicing and listened to the professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo would you please come down here and let Meghan show us what she can do, she has already proven that she can hold of digestion, so don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls that had been listening to the professor were intrigued. So about thirty girls made their way down and stood in a single group in front of Meghan and the professor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead Meghan take who ever you like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Meghan hesitated and asked the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh\u2026 are you going to keep your clothes on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes why should we take them off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause even though there are no gastric juices in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan poked her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is still awfully wet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor answered in the girls\u2019 place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone in the class has been asked to bring extra clothes along to use in the eventuality that they should get swallowed. So anyone not having clothes with them have only themselves to blame. But they could probably borrow clothes from a friend who hasn\u2019t got swallowed anyway so there is no problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan said and approached the group of young ladies. She had proved earlier that she could hide her meals, but this was something quite different from the melon to behold. Meghan looks like she is going to give Kristin a kiss, but without making Meghan\u2019s mouth bulge Kristin\u2019s head disappear in between her full lips. Meghan easily sucks in the rest of Kristin and swallows her in one go. Kristin like the melon earlier doesn\u2019t even make a lump in Meghan\u2019s neck as she travels into her toned stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next girl vanishes just as easily, this time it is Felicia\u2019s turn. Meghan picks her up off the floor and crams her straight down her gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan kept at it quickly wolfing down one girl after another, obviously enjoying herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the fifth girl entered her stomach and it is still as flat as ever, the gathered girls around Meghan began to back away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only made Meghan speed up her efforts and two minutes later she and professor Blainey were the only ones left at the front of the classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor simply stared, sure she too could manage to get that many girls into her stomach, but they only made a small bulge in Meghan\u2019s stomach. So she just looked on dumbstruck as Meghan decided to move up to the girls who were practicing with one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene that had played out at the front of the classroom had gone completely unnoticed by the rest of the class. So Meghan made her way through the rest of the students unhindered, if someone said something or noticed what she was doing then they were the next one to travel down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had managed to put three fourths of the class into her stomach before the rest finally noticed that it had become rather quiet in the classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few shrieks brought everyone\u2019s attention and soon the girls were stumbling over each other to get away from Meghan. She however skilfully used the fact that no one wanted to be close to her and had soon herded the remaining girls into one on the upper corners of the room, far away from any door. Naturally she had swallowed who ever got within her reach as she did so, thus there wasn\u2019t all that many girls left in the corner when she closed in on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf a minute later she was alone in the corner and turned around to walk back down to the professor. She walked down the steps with a spring in her step. Even though she had swallowed the whole class she didn\u2019t look more than nine months pregnant or just slightly more than so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw that the TA\u2019s had gathered along the wall further down the walkway she was using. They looked at her with fear and awe as she casually walked towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got close to them they started to back away from her, she had previously shown no interest in them, she hadn\u2019t even looked at them as she walked towards the front of the room. But now she took a few quick steps and caught up with them. Three loud swallows followed and Meghan was alone in the large classroom with the professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, that was wonderful! I seldom eat more than one at a time and I have never gorged myself like this.\u201d Meghan moaned as she stopped in front of professor Blainey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you take the time.\u201d Megan excitedly said and handed the professor her digital watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have never eaten this much, so it might take a while to digest. My guess is seventy three seconds. Ready?\u201d Meghan said and put her hands on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO! NO! STOP!\u201d Blainey yelled at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you digest any of them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThrow them up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan giggled. \u201cI was just kidding with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor sighed loudly and then joined in the giggling. \u201cOk it was a little funny, I give you that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo is there anything but throwing them back up I have to do to pass your class?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I believe there is no need to test your skills any further, just throw them up and I\u2019ll make sure you get the highest possible grade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks! Ehh\u2026where do you want them? Here on the floor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that will have to do, we only have seven showers in the back, but I guess the sooner they get out of there the sooner they will be showered and dressed.\u201d The professor said and pointed at Meghan\u2019s large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan walked off to one wall and started bringing the girls back up. She spat them out four or five at a time and backed away so that they wouldn\u2019t just end up in a big pile and be unable to move. Soon the classroom was filled with chatter. Everyone seemed to have something to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Meghan reached the wall on the other side of the room she stopped bringing more girls up and waited for the ones that were out to get themselves together and out of her way. She then repeated what she did before. All in all she had to cross the room three times before all the girls were out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TA\u2019s gathered behind the professor all quite taken by the experience. Only Julianne seemed to be able to keep from staring at Meghan. She on the other hand had a bulging belly almost as big as Meghan\u2019s was moments ago. This the professor noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJulianne don\u2019t you have some throwing up to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, but they feel so good in there.\u201d  Julianne pouted her lips and rubbed her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor gave her an orange potion. \u201cI don\u2019t care. Just get them out of there now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne drank the whole bottle and was soon bending over as the first girl emerged from her mouth. She was soon followed by a second and then a third. The girls gave Julianne a couple of annoyed looks and then ran off to get their clothes and towels to stand in the forming shower line. After they had gone the professor spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you swallow them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe first one shoved her elbow in my face so I sort off took my revenge on her. The second one managed to get her hand into my mouth, I just helped her the rest of the way.\u201d Julianne giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swallowed the third one because the two already in my stomach felt so good and I thought they could do with some company.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you did.\u201d Blainey snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDry yourselves off and keep an eye on the students. One never knows when one has a nervous breakdown.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TA\u2019s had not expected to be swallowed and thus hadn\u2019t brought clothes to the classroom, they did however always keep a spare set of clothes in their locker in case they would need it. They would have to wait till the class was over and the students had got out of there before they could go get them though.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After letting everyone out Meghan went up and took a seat. Everyone stayed clear of her as she walked pass them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t been seated very long when a cute little girl stopped a few feet away from her. The young woman was Sally, and she looked at Meghan in fear. Sally\u2019s problem was that Meghan had just taken a seat at random and had chosen the seat next to where she had her belongings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan looked up at her and smiled at the still wet girl, who had obviously been one of the first to get showered off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? I don\u2019t bite.\u201d Meghan said giggling.<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t get any response from Sally though, who just kept staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026Am I in your seat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh\u2026no. No you are not. My seat is the one on your left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why don\u2019t you come and sit down then?\u201d Meghan said and patted Sally\u2019s seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally looked both confused and terrified as she slowly walked closer to Meghan, who stood up so that Sally could get past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally slowed down once more though and came to a halt just out of Meghan\u2019s reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here, I\u2019m not that bad once you get to know me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally finally got the courage to get past Meghan and they both sat down in their seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally shoved her used clothes and towel into her bag and started gathering her notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down.\u201d Meghan tried to make her relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name? I\u2019m Meghan.\u201d She said and held out her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally stopped and looked at the outstretched limb, then she looked up at Meghan and forced a smile on her face. She shakily took Meghan\u2019s hand and shook it a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you Sally, do you mind if I sit here and talk with you? We\u2019re not supposed to leave the classroom until class is over, and somehow I sense that there\u2019s not going to happen all that much before the bell rings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a free country.\u201d Was the best Sally could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that, but forcing once presence on others isn\u2019t the best way to make friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFriends?!\u201d Sally thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis word seemed to break through her wall of fear. Meghan really seemed like a nice girl, she could always do with another friend, and somehow it felt less likely to get eaten by Meghan if she called you friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease stay. I\u2026I guess my first meeting with you wasn\u2019t as pleasant as I would have liked it to be.\u201d Sally finally said, she only paused for a second before she added. \u201cWhy did you eat everyone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the professor wanted to see what I could do so first I swallowed the volunteers, I wasn\u2019t full, and you\u2019ll come to know that eating people is really nice. So when the professor didn\u2019t tell me to stop I continued and then all of a sudden there was no one left to eat but the professor. I didn\u2019t want to push my luck so I didn\u2019t try. I believe the professor can eat me any time she wants to, I might have a big gut and appetite, but I\u2019m not so sure my swallowing techniques are as good as hers. I\u2019ve learnt everything I know from mom and her research team, and they have mostly been concentrating on getting large amounts into the digestive system and through it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I never told you that professor Hawthorn is my mom did I? She\u2019s a professor in vore just like Professor Blainey. She just got her research team moved to this university and managed to transfer me to this school so that I could move with her. I prefer living at home to getting crammed into a little dorm, besides I didn\u2019t have many friends back home anyway. All my old friends moved to different colleges than the local one and I guess I never made many new ones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see how you could be so good at vore if your mom\u2019s a professor in it. That is awesome! I wish I had a mom like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it is cool, she gives me and my sisters access to a lot of her work too and that\u2019s really cool. I hope to become a professor like her one day, the problem is that I have to learn a lot off math and chemistry though, foremost organic and biochemistry.\u201d Meghan said as she crooked an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I guess you need to know what happens to be able to improve it.\u201d Sally mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe. Enough about me. I was busy eating people in the practice session, what have you done so far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe started with a long spoon and tired to overcome our gag reflex, most of us managed that last week so today most tried to swallow objects to stretch their throats. Most tried apples and pears and other fruits, some used oranges, and a few of us used melons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way you said it I take it that you were among the ones using melons.\u201d Meghan smiled. \u201cI could teach you a few tricks if you want too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would? I\u2019d love that!\u201d Sally said showing honest joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Meghan continued. \u201cSo should we meet after school, I still have a biochemistry class to go to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure where should me meet? We can be at my place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine by me. You don\u2019t have any more classes today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo so I\u2019ll go home and study until you get there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally wrote down a few scribblings, tore the paper off and handed it to Meghan. \u201cCan you read that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou write like a machine, there\u2019s no way I can get this description wrong.\u201d Meghan giggled. \u201cI\u2019ll be there at four, is that ok with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you at four.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Meghan went up to the seat where she had left her bag earlier. She saw that there were still lots of girls who hadn\u2019t made it to the shower yet. Then the bell rang and professor Blainey let the students go. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHi! Please come in!\u201d Sally said as she greeted Meghan and stepped aside to let her enter. Sally didn\u2019t think of it before but now it was clear, Meghan with her hundred and seventy nine centimeters was a full head taller than little Sally and now that Sally stood in her bare feet and Meghan still had her shoes on, she felt really small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bit of small talk followed as the girls settled in Sally\u2019s couch. Sally had a small apartment it was basically just a square room large enough to fit a bed, a couch with a small table in front of it, and a desk at one end into it. She had of course a bookcase at one wall for her books and a chest of drawers upon which she had placed a small fourteen inch colour TV. Out of the square room a corner had been taken to make room for a bathroom and beside it a waist high bench stretched out a bit to make the kitchen area look somewhat like a room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their talk Meghan got to know that Sally usually hung out with a couple of girls, who both were quite a bit bigger than Sally, both a bit taller and a little thicker.<br>\r\nShe was also told that they had had it much easier than Sally and were also practicing on melons even though they hadn\u2019t practiced anywhere near as much as she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what is the largest thing you\u2019ve tried so far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally went to the kitchen and took out a nine kilo watermelon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI almost got this into my mouth last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how did you approach it? Did you just cram the thing into your mouth and using the pressure to make your mouth stretch?\u201d Meghan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, basically that\u2019s it I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell put it away and I\u2019ll try to help you stretch that mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally put the melon back in the fridge and returned to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you want me to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust sit down straight and try to relax, I\u2019ll do the rest for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Sally sat back down and made herself comfortable and Meghan seated herself in Sally\u2019s lap so that they were facing each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow open wide.\u201d Meghan demanded and shoved her hands into Sally\u2019s mouth instantly dislocating her jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally unable to speak anything coherent as long as Meghan was doing her stuff decided that she could just as well try to enjoy the sensations and Meghan\u2019s taste which she realised was very good. Meghan on the other hand didn\u2019t find talking all that fun when she didn\u2019t get any response, so she just kept at what she was doing and only gave Sally the occasional comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour Meghan had both her forearms into Sally\u2019s mouth sideways and massaged, pulled and rubbed as she slowly stretched Sally\u2019s mouth wider and wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is much easier to swallow something that isn\u2019t stretching you to the max, so you should try to stretch it as wide as you can.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Meghan had her forearms spread the width of her own shoulders, sort of making Sally\u2019s mouth look like a square with the side length of one of Meghan\u2019s forearms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that melon of yours shouldn\u2019t be a problem, but I have only stretched your mouth. Should I stretch your throat some too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally said something incoherent and nodded her approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan took her arms back out and let Sally\u2019s mouth relax some as she instead shoved her hands down Sally\u2019s throat. Meghan squeezed and pushed and pulled and massaged the opening, slowly stretching it wider and wider. As she did she also moved her hands further and further down Sally\u2019s throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally was amazed at the transformation she was going through and that Meghan never seemed to tire. She closed her eyes and let Meghan keep at it for as long as she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Sally felt something tickling her mouth and it quickly moved into her throat. When she opened her mouth she saw that Meghan had shoved her head and shoulders in after her arms and that her breasts were just outside Sally\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally could feel that Meghan had stretched her throat wide all the way to her stomach and was now starting to stretching it even wider, this time beginning at the lower end of Sally\u2019s throat and going upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she started to stretch Sally\u2019s throat really wide at the bottom of her throat, Meghan pulled in more of her upper body so that her head was at the opening of Sally\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally was now holding Meghan\u2019s waist in her mouth, and because she was holding her mouth upwards to make the path to her stomach straight, Meghan was more or less standing up in the sofa, bending down into Sally\u2019s throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something happened. Meghan lost her grip on the sides of Sally\u2019s throat and she sort of fell into Sally\u2019s stomach. Because she had done such a good job stretching Sally and because Sally was so relaxed her hips and thighs quickly went into Sally\u2019s throat. The sudden movements triggered Sally\u2019s swallow reflex and thus without thinking of what she did she swallowed the rest of Meghan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThrow me up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan shouted from where she was, curled up in Sally\u2019s painfully stretched stomach. Sally hadn\u2019t learned yet to hold her digestion at bay so all the while Meghan had been working in Sally\u2019s throat juices had accumulated, waiting for the meal to arrive. Meghan even when she had been stretching the lower end of Sally\u2019s throat had been out of reach for the acids and enzymes. But now she was covered in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow? I don\u2019t have any orange potions!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meghan was a bit surprised that Sally had managed to fit her inside her stomach, though it figures if any organ is greedy enough to manage more than it should without coaxing it\u2019d be the stomach. Still judging by Sally\u2019s groaning it was a rather painful experience to have such a large meal straight away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it was tight, the stomach didn\u2019t put much pressure on her, no doubt it needed a bit of practice first and possibly some instructions, same thing with the juices, Meghan was covered in them and as far as she could tell the only bad thing about them was the smell.<br>\r\nEven so she didn\u2019t intend to find out what any prolonged stay in there would bring, no doubt Sally didn\u2019t know how to swallow down air so she should get out of there before she ran out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell enough she could orientate herself in there so she knew where the opening to the throat was. Luckily for her she proved strong enough not to have much trouble moving around in there. Sally on the other hand found it rather unpleasant as every movement meant that some part of her already poor overstretched stomach got stretched yet a little bit further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus Meghan placed her feet under her and more or less stood back up Sally\u2019s throat. Sally found out the hard way that eventhough her stomach opening might stretch well enough to let a big meal in, it really doesn\u2019t want to stretch to let it back out again. So when Meghan forced it open from the inside it was actually quite unpleasant. Um, downright painful is probably a better description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the opening to Sally\u2019s throat was open Meghan had no problem getting out. She simply stood up in Sally\u2019s stomach, and because Sally hadn\u2019t learned how to hide meals once Meghan was standing up, Sally\u2019s lips were curled around her thighs, just above the knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan leaned forward and fell onto the floor as the rest of her pulled out of Sally\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry! What happened?\u201d Sally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI lost my hold and the rest you know. Do you have any clothes that might fit me? I seriously need to get into the shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Go take a shower and I\u2019ll see what I can come up with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan hurried into Sally\u2019s bathroom, she then removed her clothes and dried off as well as she could using a towel, then she jumped into the shower and didn\u2019t come out of there until the warm water was running low. She put her clothes and the towel she had used before into the sink and filled it with water. Then dried herself off with a new towel which she wrapped around herself and went back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was as I thought I don\u2019t really have anything. You can forget about underwear and the only thing that might fit you is a t-shirt someone forgot here. I would have returned it if I knew whom it belongs to, I guess we\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t. <br>\r\nAs for your lower body I can only offer you this sarong, but as you can see it\u2019s very transparent. My clothes are all tight on me so there is just no way you\u2019ll fit into any of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally looked really ashamed, but then brightened up a little as she got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have anything against staying here for a bit longer? I could go down to the laundry room and wash your clothes. Hopefully they won\u2019t take too long to dry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks that would be great! And if they won\u2019t get completely dry it won\u2019t matter, it is warm outside anyway so a little moisture wouldn\u2019t kill me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally took Meghan\u2019s clothes and went to get them washed up. Meanwhile Meghan put on the t-shirt and wrapped the towel around her hips. She watched a little TV while she waited for Sally to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally soon returned and they spent some time chatting while waiting for the clothes to dry. They also ordered pizza and Meghan had more than half a mind of eating the pizza delivery boy and letting Sally have the two pizzas, but she let him go and settled for a calzone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they talked the subject went from this to that and Sally finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what is the largest thing you\u2019ve eaten?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swallowed a car once, I didn\u2019t digest it though. Just after that I tried our family\u2019s SUV but it was too much. That was four years ago so I might be able to swallow it now if I tried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan made a face. \u201cTake it from me, cars don\u2019t taste very good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally just giggled. \u201cI guess they are hell to digest too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan got a chill running down her spine as she recalled something that happened last week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not so sure. I think you can digest anything as long as you know what you are doing. My scary sister proved this too me just before we moved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally was rather intrigued about the thought of a whole family specialized in vore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah you said you had sisters. I\u2019m the only child and my parents are in my hometown so I don\u2019t see them much. How many brothers and sisters do you have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have two sisters. Kimberly my older sister turned twenty four last month. She\u2019s always been my best friend but she\u2019s done with collage and is looking for a job back in our old town, she had a few interviews booked already, so unfortunately I won\u2019t get to see her much from now on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have always been together, often with one being inside the others tummy. She\u2019s great! Ohh, I miss her warm stomach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about your other sister? Don\u2019t you fool around with her too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaley is just turned fifteen, I\u2019ll be twenty two this year. I believe that was why Kim and I never played with her much. She\u2019s just so much younger than us. And besides she\u2019s always been a little weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that anyway to talk about your own sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you haven\u2019t met Haley yet so you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. Because Kimberly and I never played with her and never did anything vore related with her, mom spent lots of time with her. Haley and mom go along great, but I can\u2019t remember seeing Haley with any friends.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe also has the bad habit of digesting everything she eats which is one of the reasons why Kim and I never spend much time with her. I can actually count the occasions that I know she threw something back up on one hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo years ago Kim and I thought that if we swallowed her and kept her in our stomach for a while, then maybe she\u2019d realize that she wouldn\u2019t have to digest everything she ate. So we planned to ambush her as soon as she got home, who swallowed her wasn\u2019t important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe waited Kim behind the kitchen door and I behind a corner and as soon as she got inside the door we jumped at her. Somehow she fell to the floor and Kimberly got a hold of her feet. So Kim sucked her in, but when she had Haley\u2019s waist in her mouth she suddenly couldn\u2019t get any more in, Haley was preventing her from swallowing any more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured that I could help by pushing Haley in, but it didn\u2019t seem to work either. Then Haley surprised us both. She took my hands and shoved them into her mouth and sucked me up like a piece of spaghetti, in two seconds flat I was inside her stomach. Then she managed to get herself out of Kim\u2019s mouth and soon Kim fell on top of me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuckily mom got in just as she swallowed Kim and told Haley not to digest. Kimberly and I spent the whole afternoon and evening inside Haley\u2019s stomach. It was just before she was going to bed that mom told her to throw us up, mom had come to the conclusion that I had to be inside Haley\u2019s stomach too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Haley went to the bathroom and unceremoniously spat us out on the floor, and without a word went to bed. Kim and I just laid there for a while, we both realised that had mom not got in at the moment she did we would have both been Haley shit a long time ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally finally spoke after listening to Meghan\u2019s story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have cared that you were her sisters?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, she sure didn\u2019t act like it would have mattered. Needless to say both Kim and I have left her alone since then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I would have too.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally was interested in Meghan\u2019s sister, Meghan had swallowed the whole class but she looked like she feared her little sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does she do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess she goes to high school, mom probably helped her get transferred like I did. But she always seems to be at home. Usually she\u2019s studying, don\u2019t ask me what, but I\u2019ve found her reading my books and Kim\u2019s too and as mom\u2019s favourite guinea pig she gets a lot from mom to read too. She\u2019s damn smart so I don\u2019t know how much she understands of it. I still would be happier if the would come home with a friend for once and seem like a human being.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo when you said your scary sister earlier, you meant Haley, right?! You said she did something just before you moved here. What was it she did?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan told Sally the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week ago just before they moved, Meghan took the buss home from school, and just as she stepped off the buss, it disappeared behind her. When she turned around she saw her younger sister rubbing her bloated and gurgling tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan realized how close it was that she got eaten for real by her sister. Four other people were supposed to get off the buss at that stop, but only Meghan did. Had Meghan not been the first person at the door she would now be churning in her sister\u2019s gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbfounded she stared at her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi sis!\u201d Haley said as she looked up from her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026you almost ate me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that, luckily I didn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister looked down at her tummy again and kept rubbing it. The lump had now moved lower into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut there\u2019s plenty of room in my stomach now if you want me too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan just stared at her sister for a while before answering. She watched as her tummy settled down and heard it stop making noises as it was now done with its meal. In about a minute Haley had eaten a whole buss full of people and completely digested it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026no thanks I can do without visiting that pit of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan had relaxed some when it got to her that she was really alright and that her sister wouldn\u2019t eat her on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never tried digesting anything other than food, people and clothes. Do you get any problems with all the other stuff the buss was made of?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I did get an upset stomach the first couple of times I ate a car, and even when those problems went away I got the same problems when I tried a plastic boat. I guess you have to let your stomach learn to handle new things. While I did manage to digest them, I got mild diarrhoea from doing so. I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have those problems any more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley started walking and then stopped and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell should we go home, or do you prefer standing here? Our toilet is the only one I know that can handle the kind of load I need to unload.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter listening to Meghan Sally admitted:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour little sister really does sound scary! Has she ever eaten any guests at your house?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe ate a few of my friends when she was younger, but she\u2019s left them alone for quite some time now. Still I always recommend too keep a safe distance. You know, just in case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what does she look like in case I\u2019d drop by your house?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe actually looks a lot like me. Long naturally blond hair, a very athletic well shaped body and she\u2019s kind of cute. The main difference would be that she\u2019s bigger than me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026but\u2026your\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a hundred and seventy nine centimetres tall, Haley was that when she was thirteen, and she\u2019s still growing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh. Are your mom and Kimberly amazons too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazon?!\u201d Meghan snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah. Mom might be, she\u2019s a few centimetres taller than me, but Kim is just of average height, perhaps even slightly shorter.. They are both quite fit though, if that\u2019s what you were referring too. By the way you don\u2019t think my clothes would be dry by now? It\u2019s getting late and it is Tuesday tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDry or not, I\u2019ll go get them.\u201d Sally said and soon returned with Meghan\u2019s clothes that were both dry and clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Meghan had got dressed and ready to go, Sally asked: \u201cWill you come to vore class on Wednesday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Professor Blainey said that I\u2019d get my grades anyway and I\u2019m actually more interested in what her research team is up to. V101 is very basic compared to what I think Blainey is researching on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHopefully I\u2019ll see you at school tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls swapped phone numbers before Meghan went home, just in case.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>During Tuesday morning Meghan finds that she has an hour without any scheduled activity, and decides that she should try and find Professor Blainey. She does, the professor is in her office, so Meghan knocks on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnter!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Meghan opens the door she finds Blainey leaning over some papers on her desk. But she isn\u2019t sitting behind it she\u2019s standing in front of it giving Meghan a good view of her behind which once again has been squeezed into a pair of tight jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hi Meghan!\u201d The professor says as she turns to face the young student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour grades are done!\u201d She pauses for just a moment and adds: \u201dIt was quite a show you put on yesterday, your mother laughed when I told her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d Meghan smiles. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t come here because of the grades.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s on your mind then? I\u2019m all ears!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I talked with Sally yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSally\u2026I remember that name. Yes it was the girl who had such problems at the first lesson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes she said she had. She asked me to help her so I followed her home, and eventually she managed to swallow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are kidding! That is what I call progress! No one has improved that quickly before!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I helped her a little and she very well be the most dedicated student you ever had, she has spent every free minute practicing and was already swallowing melons when she asked for my help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it is a big step from melons to people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue but still. Anyway she made me realize that I still have a lot to learn. It is not going to be covered in v101 that\u2019s why I come to you. You have the knowledge I lack so I want you to start a continuation class to v101. Seeing how popular v101 is I doubt you\u2019d have any problems finding students even though the semester has already started. At least if you make it an evening class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue enough, I bet some girls would even skip classes to come to that. Not that I could encourage such behaviour though. What makes you say you need my teachings then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy skills are based on what my mom has taught me. Which have been to swallow large amounts of stuff as well as hiding and digesting it, since that\u2019s more or less what she\u2019s was studying as I grew up. My swallowing skills on the other hand could most likely get a whole lot better and so could my pinning skills, not to mention that I have no idea of how one is supposed to get out of someone\u2019s grip or her stomach. And I bet there are tons of other things that I could learn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, those are important aspects as well, true enough. Though my schedule is pretty tight as it is.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI realize that, but now that mom\u2019s team is here on the school too, you should have enough professionals to use them as TA\u2019s instead of the upperclassmen you are using now. Heck, I bet some of them could even hold some of the lectures. So you should be able to hold such a class now, or am I wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you are right, I\u2019ll talk to your mom about it and we will discuss it with the school council.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor straightened herself before she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was quite a sight to see you down my whole class yesterday, so when you say your techniques in swallowing are lacking I find that a bit hard to believe. Would you mind attacking me? Naturally I\u2019ll defend myself. And no digestion ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell ok, I don\u2019t see what good it\u2019ll do but as long as there is no digestion I guess I could.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen attack me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan lunged for the professor, only to find a wide open throat waiting for her. A bit of adjusting on Blainey\u2019s behalf made Meghan practically fall straight into the professor\u2019s stomach, which had no problem concealing her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are right, that was clumsy.\u201d The professor said to her stomach. \u201cNow try to escape from there, I\u2019ll give you a little help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor made the insides of her stomach glow with an eerie light. Meghan usually hadn\u2019t light with her when she visited someone\u2019s stomach so she usually didn\u2019t see what it looked like. And she had never seen anyone make their insides glow before. The new experience was in itself a bit distracting, not that it mattered much, she really had no clue as of what she should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I can at least try.\u201d Meghan thought to herself as she looked around in the huge stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to try and hit the professor\u2019s diaphragm and thus making her throw up involuntarily, but it was no use, the professor didn\u2019t feel any discomfort at all. So Meghan decided that she should try and force the entrance to the professor\u2019s stomach open. Had she not been so tall she wouldn\u2019t even have reached it, but it was still no use, she couldn\u2019t even bulge it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do better than that! What if I decided to digest you?\u201d Blainey said. And Meghan screamed as she suddenly saw juices flowing heavily down the sides of the stomach, but the juiced disappeared as soon as they had appeared and never touched her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I was just teasing you.\u201d The professor said and soon an orange liquid joined Meghan in the professor\u2019s stomach. After a few seconds the stomach forced Meghan back up Blainey\u2019s throat and she landed with a wet sound on the floor of the professor\u2019s office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are right. You have a lot to learn, and I wouldn\u2019t mind learning the throw up without potion trick, these aren\u2019t the tastiest concoctions you know. I guess I\u2019ll have to talk to your mother about that.\u201d The professor smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas there anything else you wondered?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I guess not.\u201d Meghan answered and got herself off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll see what I can do about starting another class, if I can it will hopefully start next week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you!\u201d Meghan said and left the professor alone to deal with her work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving risen to the very top of Meghan\u2019s to do list was finding a shower and getting into her extra set of clothes that she had brought with her today. Always keeping a spare set in the locker really did seem like a good idea. She\u2019d have to thank the little TA from v101 for the advice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sally felt really happy this morning as she gingerly crashed into her seat next to Tiffany. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t seen Meghan yesterday, but the effects of what Meghan had done to her on the Monday afternoon had still lingered on Tuesday. So Sally had stuffed herself silly when she got home from school. The large melon she had shown Meghan had been no trouble at all, so she had sent another couple of melons down after it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with a bumpy and bloated gut she had sat down to do some reading. Looking ahead at what the professor would cover. Sally had figured that she could probably start to swallow people, but it wouldn\u2019t be very safe. The professor had mentioned swallowing down air to the person inside and keeping the digestion at bay and she didn\u2019t know how to do those things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book did cover the issues she had though, but once again it was down to practice, as best she had tried to convert the theory of the book into practice she couldn\u2019t tell if she actually managed anything. Hence she had realized that having the professor explaining how to do wouldn\u2019t hurt, maybe she could share a few tricks with them? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow as Sally sat in her seat she had this mischievous smile on her face whenever she looked at Tiffany. She knew she would have to practice keeping digestion at bay and swallowing air first, but she couldn\u2019t help thinking \u201cNext time Tiffany\u2026next time\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany hadn\u2019t noticed Sally\u2019s gaze and never did, for when the professor entered she got everyone\u2019s attention and the class fell silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard yesterday that someone has managed to swallow their first person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low mumble spread across the room, but died out when the professor dropped her notes on her desk with a bang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the shortest time I can remember it has ever taken someone to learn to do so. Because of this I will jump ahead a little so we can cover the skills needed for someone to start practicing on people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlainey plugged in her laptop computer and started a display program.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo to start with today I will go through the basics of preventing digestion. This includes limiting the production of acids and enzymes as well as stopping the churning of the stomach. I will then go on to how to swallow large amounts of air and the process of keeping the air in your stomach somewhat fresh. Then I will go back to where we were, should we still have some time left before it is time to practice. It is no loss if we don\u2019t, all of you will need to practice this sooner or later anyhow and you need to learn to do both before you can practice on people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then.\u201d She said and turned to the projected image above her. \u201cAs you can see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor seemed to talk without end and then she demonstrated different techniques, while the TA\u2019s repeated what she did for those who had problem seeing the professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell maybe you should all practice getting air into your stomach now that it is fresh in your head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a short pause and then a choir of burping. It was fairly tricky. Swallowing down air wasn\u2019t that hard, swallowing down lots of air proved a bit tougher. Neither was burping up the air hard, it was actually the normal reaction when air got into the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor let them keep it up for a while before she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will soon learn to do this without sounding like you escaped from a Simpsons\u2019 episode.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe motioned towards the TA\u2019s<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is now time to continue practicing, and once again the TA\u2019s have all sorts of fruits. And just as usual you can always come to me or them with questions.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She then tossed the fruits into her own seat before sitting down in Tiffany\u2019s lap, her bulging belly poking Tiffany square in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not so sure we should start with the fruits.\u201d Sally said as she took of her watch and placed it in her purse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeghan used her hands on me to widen my mouth and throat, so I\u2019ll see what I can do. It seemed really tiresome so when I tire you can continue with the fruits ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I wouldn\u2019t mind to get a taste of you.\u201d Tiffany snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Sally had a short top on leaving her arms free, so she didn\u2019t have any sleeves to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have practiced at home I hope?\u201d Sally asked before getting ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure I have. Now get started already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally put both her hands into Tiffany\u2019s mouth which made Tiffany\u2019s jaw pop out of place. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now they just had half an hour at best, and Sally wasn\u2019t as sure about what she was doing as Meghan had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she did her best, and was getting results. Soon she could fit one of her hands into Tiffany\u2019s throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was tiring, she just couldn\u2019t imagine where Meghan had gotten her energy from. After fifteen or twenty minutes Sally was totally exhausted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up an apple and shoved it into Tiffany\u2019s mouth and Tiffany swallowed it without problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah! I couldn\u2019t even get it into my throat yesterday!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany opened wide an accepted the second apple.

After a minute of pushing from Sally it slowly entered Tiffany\u2019s throat. And as the bell rang five minutes later Sally had her whole forearm down Tiffany\u2019s throat. A few more moments and Sally pushed the orange and her hand into Tiffany\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell fun\u2019s over, time to get out of here and to the next class.\u201d Sally sighed as she withdrew her arm.</span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t really know why, maybe she just wanted to see if she could get something out of the class anyway, or maybe she was just drawn to the professor somehow and her knowledge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the bell rang and she was startled by the loud noise and ended up standing there in the middle of the hallway as the rumbling of lots of feet drew ever closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Meghan. I\u2019m sorry but I haven\u2019t had the time to talk with your mother quite yet.\u201d Blainey says as she comes to a halt in front of the young student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walk over to the side so they can talk more privately and also not block the hallway as lots of students make their way past them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, the result you got out of Sally was quite impressive. Stacey confirmed what you told me yesterday. She said Sally didn\u2019t have any trouble at all to swallow even a very large melon. I wouldn\u2019t have expected that from someone who initially had such troubles this early, perhaps by the end of next week, or possibly the one after that. You wouldn\u2019t mind joining the class as a TA?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I mean that I haven\u2019t really shown anybody before, with Sally I went down dirty, I didn\u2019t show her much at all. And if you could manage to start a new class, I\u2019d rather spend my time practicing new stuff, than teaching others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlainey thought for a while, but then she got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how about this? You assist me in v101 until an eventual continuation class, and I\u2019ll introduce you to the ladies in my research team. I can\u2019t have anyone running about down at the labs on a regular basis, but I\u2019ll give them permission to show you what we are working on. So if you manage to befriend some of them I\u2019m sure they can teach you some nifty tricks, and I might let you come down there again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor smiles as she adds. \u201cAnd after seeing you at work, I\u2019m sure you could teach them a little too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan was all exited after hearing the professor\u2019s proposal. \u201cDeal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Come down to the labs on Friday, let\u2019s say four a clock. Use the back entrance and I\u2019ll be in a room to the right, just a few doors down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there! Is there anything I have to practice before the next lesson?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, we are going to continue practicing stretching mouth and throat, so if you have any idea of showing people what you did to Sally, then practice that. Otherwise I\u2019d like to see you help some girls like you helped Sally, you might just have to start it and then their practice partner could take over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk! I\u2019ll see you Friday morning then!\u201d Meghan said as she and the professor parted.</span></div></div>",

Welcome to the club.\u201d The three TAs say in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello\u2026Eh I\u2019m sorry ladies, but I never got your names.\u201d Meghan excuses herself, but is at the same time glad that the girls seem to accept her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Jessica.\u201d Said the blond TA squeezed into a revealing outfit of black leather and shook Meghan\u2019s hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you can call me Jess, many do and I don\u2019t mind.\u201d She added as her jiggling large breasts almost escaped her short tight vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStacy.\u201d The redheaded TA said as they shook hands. She looked hungry somehow, fitting one might think seeing as this was a class about eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan had to look down a bit when talking to the last TA, who had long lovely dark hair and stood five foot tall at most, definitely not taller than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJulianne, somehow people actually say Julianne, I guess Jul just sound silly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll call you Julianne if that\u2019s what you like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan gave the little woman a warm smile, before she added somewhat perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do you keep the students in line, if you don\u2019t mind me asking? You look about half the size of Jess of Stacey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne smirked. \u201cI use that to my advantage, I was the best in last year\u2019s class, so I think I\u2019ll be able to handle any problematic student we have. At least until they get a whole lot better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jessica cut in.<br>\r\n\u201cI think we should be quiet now, the class should start any second, judging by the professor.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Well I said most of you since I believe that there\u2019s at least one person here that should practice on something tougher, but might not be ready yet to start practicing on their partner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy not ready I mean that even though we have potions to stop the churning of the stomach and prevent nasty juices from forming, I\u2019d rather have you capable of keeping them down on your own before you start. And let\u2019s not forget that I want to be certain that anyone swallowing someone is able to exchange the air in their stomach efficiently.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor went behind her desk and bent down to pick something up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I have brought these!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said and held up a big rubbery ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all seen these before, and wondered what the heck they are for, not to mention why they are called medicine balls and why they are so damn heavy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor set the ball down on the desk with a thud, before she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s obvious if you take vore into account isn\u2019t it? They are called medicine balls because you are supposed to swallow them whole, just like medicine pills. They are large because they are meant to help someone widen their mouth and throat. The different sizes come in handy so that you can make progress. The weight is helpful to get it crammed down, so are the fact that they are somewhat soft and that once wet they get really slippery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor bent down and picked up another ball, this one noticeably larger than the first one and showed it to the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you swallow these, you have to throw them back up. They are made in an acid resistant material and we coat them from time to time in different chemicals so that they should remain unharmed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the new ball down next to the previous one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce you think that you are ready for this step, then we will let you take one of these babies of an appropriate size home and give you some regurgitating potions so you can practice alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping a hand on each ball she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want a ball, then come down here at the start of the practice session and I\u2019ll have one ready for you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Not quite as beautiful as Samantha, but still quite a looker with similar build and statue as her practice partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I am. The name\u2019s Victoria.\u201d Came the friendly reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then Victoria, would you come over here so that you can see what I\u2019m doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria didn\u2019t say anything, but stood up and placed herself so that she could see over Meghan\u2019s shoulder and down into Samantha\u2019s now wide stretched mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we\u2019ll see how far we can stretch this mouth of yours.\u201d Meghan said as she tried to pry as much of her forearms as possible into Samantha\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVictoria, would you please hold here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria did as told, and that was all the assistance Meghan needed to fit both her forearms into Samantha\u2019s mouth. She had her elbows on Samantha\u2019s tongue and her hands in Samantha\u2019s palate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggling and rhythmically rubbing Meghan spread her arms further and further apart, a little surprised that she didn\u2019t get the resistance she had expected.  But that wasn\u2019t a bad sign was it? At least it showed that Samantha was making really good progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan stopped when she had her arms a bit further apart than shoulder width, clearly Samantha was ready to take on medicine balls. But then again to do that she had to have a throat that would stretch as well, so Meghan moved on to make sure she had just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it feels unnecessary to stretch your mouth further. You should start practicing on the medicine balls the professor showed before.\u201d Meghan said as she withdrew her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Victoria could you get up in the seat and hold Samantha\u2019s mouth open. I figured you\u2019d get a good view that way and I am gonna show you how to stretch a throat, so look carefully.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria got up in the seat next to Samantha and stood on her knees holding the sides of Samantha\u2019s mouth in her hands. And with one arm stretched out so that as she was leaning over Samantha she staring right down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, this looks kinda scary.\u201d The brunette said as she had her face only inches from the wet cave that was Samantha\u2019s mouth. Samantha replied by opening her throat so that Victoria got a good view down her gullet. Victoria yelped and pulled away before returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan giggled a little before she put her hands back into Samantha\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSamantha you can relax now, I\u2019ll do the stretching. And Victoria look closely now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha\u2019s throat closed and Meghan began pulling on its edges as well as massaging making it ease up. Meghan was a little bit less surprised to notice that Samantha\u2019s throat stretched very well just as her mouth had done before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see what I\u2019m doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, because Samantha\u2019s throat stretches so well I feel it is kind of pointless to continue up here. Now this is a little trickier but hopefully you\u2019ll get what I am doing, I\u2019m not very good at explaining it so I hope you can see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Meghan shoved most of her arms down Samantha\u2019s throat, bumping her head into Victoria\u2019s as she did, not painfully though, just that she blocked Victoria\u2019s view a little since her head was under brunette\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she started stretching Samantha\u2019s throat trying several different things, and Victoria got an occasional glimpse of what she was doing as well as an occasional view right down and into Samantha\u2019s wet stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would seem Samantha was quite stretchy even this far down her throat so:</span></div></div>",

Meghan left Samantha behind and met up with the blond halfway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan smiled at the young lady as they closed in on each other. The girl in question was very slim, well she was downright skinny. Her hipbones didn\u2019t poke out much or anything, she wasn\u2019t that starved kind of skinny, she just didn\u2019t have much meat on her bones, or that much hips. She wore a tight top that showed that she had at least some fat on her body because something made it poke outwards in chest height. Well not much, but there was something perky there. Had Meghan been able to see her back she would have noticed a tight little round bottom too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Meghan wasn\u2019t checking her out so she might not had looked that far down, she was more occupied with the sweet pretty face of the girl and her tantalizing blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d Meghan asked as she looked up at the pretty girl. Because she was so slim the girl looked really tall, so Meghan was surprised that she didn\u2019t have to look up that far. She was only a little taller than Meghan, but Meghan had almost expected her to be a head taller or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m interested in learning to hide meals, and the TAs said that you were the one to ask about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but isn\u2019t that to jump ahead? Shouldn\u2019t you practice swallowing stuff first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, but the girls are teasing me. You see how skinny I am, it shows even if I just swallow an apple. The girls laughed out loud when I swallowed a melon. They thought I looked really silly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison turned to Stacey who happened to be just a couple of meters away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have a melon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, just please give me one would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave Allison a watermelon. It probably weighed close to five kilos. With it Allison returned to Meghan as she dislocated her jaw. Then she slowly pushed it into her mouth and down her throat. Meghan watched as the fruit stretched the girl\u2019s throat and then traveled down into her torso. As it settled in her stomach Meghan could see what Allison had been talking about. She could clearly make out the shape of the melon that made a tight and surprisingly large bulge in the blond girl\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that does look a bit silly.\u201d Meghan giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo could you help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell sure! Let\u2019s sit down over here.\u201d Meghan said and motioned for a few empty seats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe showed Alison a few things and told her others and before the bell rang Alison had managed to make the bulge a little bit smaller. She was about to ask for an orange potion so that she didn\u2019t have to walk around looking this silly, when Meghan stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to digest meals while you try and hide them, that way your stomach learns to handle the task you give it. That is true for most techniques, so if you can digest the meal you should. And a melon sounds like something you could digest to me. Maybe you should bring some less revealing clothing if you feel uncomfortable with showing off your belly bulge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan patted the lump in Allison\u2019s tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow if you practice this, you soon won\u2019t have to worry about looking silly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d Allison said and to Meghan\u2019s surprise gave her a kiss on her cheek before she went up to her old seat to collect her belongings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass is over and Meghan realized that it had gone rather smoothly. Even though she had just managed to help a couple of girls she figured that it was good enough.</span></div></div>",

Luckily most of the distance consists of crossing a park, so at least the scenery is good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing that close to school there\u2019s quite a few people in the park, mostly students. Even so it almost seems empty being so large. Still there are lots of people around, mostly just relaxing in the sun and talking or reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considers doing the same, but only for a fleeting moment, if she wants sun then they have a pretty decent back yard, even if the pond she walks by looks rather pretty as she catches an occasional glance of the waters through the thick lush growth surrounding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops for a moment to take in the scenery, moving over slightly to get a better view and then sees that there\u2019s a cleared patch by the shore on the other side of the lake, A shaded spot with a bench overlooking the pond and surrounded by bushes, making it both the place with the best view and a bit secluded as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone\u2019s sitting there reading, studying no doubt, but Meghan feels like taking a closer look and makes her way around the waters and finds the dirt path leading into the thicket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the bench is a young male student, he looks up as he hears someone coming and sees a very pretty blonde coming his way. He scoots over to make room for her on the bench and adjusts his glasses hoping to look his best and that she\u2019ll take the seat next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn\u2019t though, but she does come to a halt right in front of him, giving him a good excuse to look up from his book and take a good look at her before raising his gaze all the way up to her pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I help you Miss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn\u2019t get an answer she just leans on closer, so close he thinks she\u2019s about to kiss him, not that he\u2019d mind, certainly not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then darkness and warmth covers his face like a soaking wet blanket and as he stiffen in surprise he feels a strong suction pulling him upwards and the weird sensation quickly spreads down his body until it covers all of him. Just then the pressure drops and he quickly moves forward and then plummet downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan felt the boy enter her stomach and thought to herself, not wanting so speak out loud in case someone would hear her. \u201cYes you can.\u201d And let her stomach have at the poor guy, crushing and melting him at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you just move into my intestines you can help me with a nutritional need of mine.\u201d  She thought grinning to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around her and by the side if the bench found the guy\u2019s bag, a quick glance revealed that it contained nothing interesting, so she tossed it down her throat to face the fate of its owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting her trim flat belly she enjoyed the feeling of him sating her hunger somewhat while she admired the view. It really was pretty here, she\u2019d have to remember this place. Who knew perhaps it\u2019d offer more meals as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan didn\u2019t linger there for too long, so when she finally gets home she is a little surprised to find that Haley is home too, even though it is in the middle of the day.

Is it maybe so that she already knows what they are covering in her classes? Meghan doesn\u2019t find the concept unlikely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell time to relax, Meghan feels like doing nothing useful and what better way to do that then by watching some TV?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts by releasing the poor sod she ate at the park. She might be able to hide away her meals to the point that she isn\u2019t bothered by them at all, but unfortunately they might be insignificant in her gut and even in her colon, but not on the way out, which is why she rarely eats more than a few people between bathroom visits.<br>\r\nLuckily they have special toilets at home that can handle larger loads so to speak. Using a normal toilet she\u2019s found out, is either a very tiresome business with lots of flushing and waiting for the water container to fill, or a really messy ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved of her burden Meghan throws herself on the couch and flips through the channels. They have cable so there are a few to look through. She goes through them a second time, and then a third. Who was she trying to kid, finding something worth looking at in the middle of a workday? No there\u2019s not a chance regardless of how many channels you have, that kind of thing just doesn\u2019t exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks outside she sun is still shining, maybe she should relax in the sun instead and better on her tan a little? Yeah, that sounded like a good idea. Maybe even take a dip in the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother had bought a fairly large house with a decent backyard with high enough fences so that none of the surrounding houses got a view of it. And right by the house they had a fairly large pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan went upstairs to her room and changed into a white little thong bikini that accentuated her form nicely. She also picked up a pair of sunglasses, a book and a towel, before she headed for the patio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpreading the towel on a sun chair she sat, well almost laid down, on it and started reading her book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough she felt like turning around to lay on her stomach instead, but instead of folding the chair down she decided to use her old air mattress and float around in the pool instead. She looked at the book, well it wasn\u2019t that good, and it wouldn\u2019t be catastrophic if it got a little wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo carefully as to not wet the book unnecessarily much she managed to get on her floating device and drift of into the calm waters of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized there was something unusual, the water didn\u2019t smell like it used to. She put a finger into the pool and tasted the water. Yeah, Haley was probably to blame. She had filled the pool with fresh water before and not added the things she should. At least the water was still fresh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, maybe this isn\u2019t too bad.\u201d Meghan thought. \u201cThis way I don\u2019t have to go after something to drink. I can just sip some of the pool water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then returned to the pages of her book.</span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t even notice when the water started to drain away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the drainage started getting a little noisy it got her attention. She found that she was slowly traveling backwards. She turned around and saw that her sister had jumped into the pool too. She also saw the reason as to why the pool had been filled with freshwater. Haley was holding her mouth open letting the water flow down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan threw the book onto the lawn and started paddling away from her sister. Haley realized that she had been found out and opened her mouth and throat wide. The torrent was tremendous and Meghan couldn\u2019t possibly hope to out paddle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily she realized that right away and got an idea. She rolled into the water and dove for the bottom and as she had hoped the deeper she got the less was the water flow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long before she once more felt air around her as she lay with her belly pressed against the pool bottom. She got to her feet and faced Haley, who pouted her lips and feigned sadness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water was just up to her ankles now as she was in the more shallow end. But before she could say anything Haley spat her air mattress at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you jump off? You\u2019d gotten a nice warm waterslide into my tummy, where it would have been nice and warm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley said with a more mischievous look on her face and patted the bulge in her middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know why I don\u2019t want to get in your tummy? Man I\u2019ve never seen you let anything out undigested without mom telling you too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley raised an eyebrow. \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know it was that bad. I can play nice too you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grew silent and then looked around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess I should go and put the water back on, no point having a pool if there\u2019s no water in it is there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley still rubbed her tummy and Meghan saw how the bulge diminished as it went lower into Haley\u2019s belly and got absorbed by her. With only a small lump in her belly and possibly a very full bladder Haley climbed out off the pool and turned the water on before probably heading off to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the new water wasn\u2019t as warm as Meghan would have liked it to be she too got out of the pool.</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve told us to take care of unwanted visitors, so I wasted no time.\u201d Tamara said as she stood back up and looked over to the professor, who seemed to let out a sigh of relief rather than being angry with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I know, I just never thought someone would be that fast. I\u2019m just glad you didn\u2019t digest her, I would never have been able to explain that to Hawthorn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamara raised an eyebrow and looked at Meghan, whom she extended a hand to too help her get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHawthorn? What does she have to do with it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlainey motioned for Meghan, who said nothing but let the professor speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Meghan Hawthorn, the professor\u2019s daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamara raised the other eyebrow too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh, I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she turned her eyes back to Blainey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what is she doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe wanted to learn more about vore, and I offered her to come down here and meet you girls. I figured if you got along you could teach each other some things. But before I let you exchange knowledge I have to get Hawthorn\u2019s permission, seeing as it is her work Meghan has studied. But I figured none the less that I\u2019d give her a tour of the lab and show her what some of you girls are up too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamara turned to Meghan whom she was still holding hands with, even though Meghan was standing up now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh\u2026Pleased to meet you Meghan, I\u2019m Tamara.\u201d Tamara said and shook hands with Meghan. She then whipped some of the slime off of her and added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that. At least I didn\u2019t have any acid in my stomach, so that\u2019s just mucus and some other slime, nothing that\u2019ll hurt you or ruin your clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan brushed herself off and forced a slightly disgusted smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to her that, but how come you didn\u2019t have juices in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see I\u2019m studying the small intestines, or more like ways of making them more effective. This has made me start to shove my meals directly into the intestines and not let the stomach do its work first. But that is no problem for my intestines they are capable of handling it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a pause and looked a bit awkwardly at Meghan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be glad that the professor got in when she did, because once in my intestines, I can\u2019t throw anything back up and since I started here I have never hurried anything through, so I don\u2019t know how you\u2019d handle the trip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan didn\u2019t really know what to say to that, but felt she should say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you don\u2019t mind I\u2019ll pass any offer of finding out.\u201d</span></div></div>",

We have a large bathroom over here.\u201d Blainey said and lead the way. Meghan and Tamara followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was indeed a large bathroom. I guess if you study the digestive process the way they do, then there has to be room enough for an audience as well as test subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn it was a shower in one corner, a weird looking toilet as well as two sinks, one normal and one big one, the kind that you often find in laundry rooms. There were also a shelf with fresh towels and different bottles. Meghan noticed that there seemed to be quite a supply of the orange ones she\u2019d seen before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toilet though nothing new to Meghan, she had one at home just like it, but for anyone else the large gaping hole that was where the bowl usually was would look weird. For anyone capable of digesting large meals and who did so on a regular basis these specially constructed babies were wonderful. Because it was made to handle massive loads, so that the user wouldn\u2019t have to worry about plugging up the plumbing, or have to spend a lot of time in there squeezing out a little at a time. At least not if the user were like the ladies here, who could more or less push out all the remains at once and have it over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan washed her arms off and the slime from her hair, then Tamara helped her removing the worst of the rest using a towel. It wasn\u2019t like Meghan had been soaked in yucky stuff, it was just that the stuff was indeed a bit yucky, so she wanted it gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering if there were any of these toilets in school! You know what a pain it is to get a meal down a regular toilet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan turned to Blainey. \u201cProfessor are there any like these up in the usual school buildings?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo not like these, but almost all the ones around school are of a custom sort we invested in a few years back. They look like normal toilets except possibly that they look a little wide directly under the bowl and if you look down inside it you\u2019ll see a thin line, like a seam going round the inside of the bowl. \u201c<br>\r\n\u201cWell not like, it actually is a seam. You see, if enough pressure is exerted on the bottom of the bowl the seam will open and the bottom swing away allowing the contents to plummet into the sewer below before it closes again.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSince the meal lands first in the bowl before plummeting after a large meal one sometimes need to be a little careful and it does at times soil the bowl. You know how new toilets have two buttons for flushing, one big and one small? Well if you push both at the same time you get a real flush that should clean out the bowl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlainey changed her pose, tone and subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are we done here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan nodded and Blainey turned to Tamara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I took Meghan here so that she could get to meet you girls, so if you\u2019d do me the favour of showing her around and introducing her to the girls, then there\u2019s no need for me to tag along. It tends to get rather stiff when I\u2019m around anyway, somehow I get \u2018Yes professor!\u2019 a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamara giggled and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best. Or should I say \u2018Yes professor!\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d Blainey said and poked her tongue out at Tamara before she left the two girls alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where should we start?\u201d Tamara mumbled as she thought for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow dumb of me. I have already started, well you know what I do I already told you and since you didn\u2019t want a closer demonstration I guess we\u2019ll move on.\u201d Tamara said smiling and led the way.</span></div></div>",

The buzzing of machines can be heard everywhere, doubtless mostly computers. There is also the tapping of keyboards, the clapping of walking feet and the occasional groan and moan. Even talking can be heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would seem most doors here are open, or at least ajar and as Meghan walks past the doors she sees either an office or a laboratory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamara and Meghan walk by several unoccupied rooms, well unoccupied in the sense that no one is there at the moment, there seemed to be something going on in most rooms and the light is on in every one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tamara stopped and knocked on a doorframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan saw a young woman turn around away from her computer to face them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeghan this is Patricia\u2026\u201d Tamara paused for a moment and looked closer on Patricia\u2019s stomach, which was left bare between a short dark skirt and a matching short top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cand that is Evelyn.\u201d Tamara added and pointed to Patricia\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleased to meet you Meghan\u201d Patricia said and extended her hand, but before Meghan had a chance to shake it a voice spoke up from Patricia\u2019s tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPatricia would you let me up so I can greet the lady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me Meghan.\u201d Patricia said before she took a deep breath and leaned over to one side. Her stomach started wiggling around and soon her throat started stretching wider and wider. Two hands emerged from between her lips and grabbed hold of the sides of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in a few massive jolts a woman\u2019s upper body emerged from between her lips. The new woman, placed her hands onto the floor did a handstand as the rest of her body slid out from between Patricia\u2019s lips. She then gracefully placed her feet on the ground and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime covered woman than now stood before Meghan who was just dressed in a bikini, extended her hand and shook Meghan\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi I\u2019m Evelyn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan crooked an eyebrow feeling the still warm slime wetting her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow delightful, I\u2019m Meghan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan then turned back to Patricia and shook her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d apologize for the slime, but since it\u2019s yours I won\u2019t.\u201d Meghan said smiling and poked her tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell a little slime has never hurt anybody. When you work here you need to get used to handling much more disgusting things, and dangerous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me ladies, I\u2019m just gonna go wash this off, I\u2019ll be back in a flash.\u201d Evelyn said and disappeared around a corner and soon a shower could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo who are you?\u201d Patricia asked Meghan as soon as Evelyn had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m professor Hawthorn\u2019s daughter. I guess that\u2019s the main reason as to why Blainey let me come down here. Initially she offered to show me around and meet you all, but Tamara accepted the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn hadn\u2019t been far away so she had heard them speaking and burst back into the room, she had got rid of the slime, but she was still wet and dripping water all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey if you\u2019re the daughter to a professor then you should know some vore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I guess I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn almost ran into Meghan, she didn\u2019t though, but stopped just in front of her and poked her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo can you hold of digestion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! Why do you ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas all the answer she got before Evelyn had pushed both her hands into her mouth and down her throat. Meghan got the idea and neutralized her stomach as she took hold of Evelyn\u2019s hips. Meghan lifted Evelyn off the ground and slurped her up like a piece of spaghetti, that Evelyn helped just made the process even smother and faster. In no time Evelyn was gone, as Meghan\u2019s stomach didn\u2019t show any sign of Evelyn\u2019s presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamara looked at Meghan\u2019s stomach and so did Patricia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan looked confused. \u201cHuh? What did you say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even show that she\u2019s in there.\u201d Patricia said and pointed to Meghan\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh\u2026 what you mean? There\u2019s just one girl in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one girl? Not all here can do that, and we are study vore as a full time job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia pointed to Meghan\u2019s stomach again. \u201cShe can\u2019t do it. She looks pot bellied when she has someone in her stomach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell how many of you actually study hiding meals then? My guess would be not that many. Am I wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but everyone practice it more or less with every meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the same thing and you know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan changed the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you study? Tamara said she was into digestion in the small intestines, but since Evelyn was in your stomach I guess that\u2019s not what you do, unless you two were just fooling around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia smiled. \u201cNah I guess we were doing a bit of both working and fooling around. You see I study how to keep someone in your stomach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia pointed once again at Meghan\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvelyn studies how to get out of one, so we compliment each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia looked a bit confused. \u201cI\u2019m surprised that Evelyn hasn\u2019t made her way out of your stomach yet. Do you know techniques of how to keep someone inside?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan giggled and patted her stomach, feeling how Evelyn squirmed around in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, I don\u2019t know anything about that. I guess she\u2019s just enjoying herself in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan looked down on her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell maybe it is time for her to get out of there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan crouched down and brought Evelyn back up her throat. She leaned forward and let Evelyn slide out of her mouth and onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamara addressed Evelyn \u201cThat was about time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Patricia filled in. \u201cWe were getting worried you\u2019d lost your touch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn had her eyes wide open in an almost chock-like expression as she pulled herself off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t break out, she spat me out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you didn\u2019t want to leave? Was it really that nice in there?\u201d Tamara giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No! You don\u2019t understand. I did try to get out of there, but it was like a big freaking banquet hall. Man her stomach has to bigger than the professor\u2019s and Tracy\u2019s put together! I just couldn\u2019t get out of there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn turned to Meghan. \u201cYou have to let me practice getting out of there sometime!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! Maybe you could instruct me on how to get out of yours too? I wouldn\u2019t mind learning some of your escape techniques.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn broke into a huge smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a deal.\u201d She said and grabbed hold of Meghan and opened her mouth wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have had Meghan halfway into her stomach before Meghan would have had an idea of what was happening. Tamara however had a feeling of what was about to come as well as fast reflexes. So she broke in before Evelyn got Meghan\u2019s head into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot now Evelyn! You can do that some other time! I\u2019m supposed to show Meghan around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn released Meghan and pouted out her bottom lip as she patted her belly, bumpy by clearly defined abdominal muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd my stomach isn\u2019t part of the tour?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not today it isn\u2019t. She\u2019s already been in mine and that\u2019s enough spelunking for one day, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Who shook her hand and forced a smile on her face. Her stomach rumbled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you too. Although I thought Tamara had brought me a snack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you greedy guts, don\u2019t you eat enough as it is?\u201d Nicole\u2019s stomach emitted a few noises to tell that it didn\u2019t think she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess not.\u201d She said and patted her belly trying to calm it down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what is it you study?\u201d Meghan broke in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI study ways to avoid getting digested.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how do you do that if I may ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCurrently I\u2019m trying to make my body secrete different things to keep stomach acids and enzymes and stuff from getting to me and also to neutralize them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned away from Meghan and made a motion towards a number of containers inside different laboratory fume hoods. Inside each container some slime was being attacked by different mixtures of acids and enzymes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe reason as to why I walk around here half naked is that when I need a new sample of goo, my body secretes the stuff all over. This way I can easily take a shower afterwards and wash it off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo does it work this slime of yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does in theory, the problem is that most who are experienced in vore start producing things that the stomach normally doesn\u2019t, so it is hard to make a universal slime that protects you from everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a pause and rubbed her tummy. \u201cI haven\u2019t tried it out yet so I don\u2019t know how well it would work in reality. Besides, I don\u2019t like being in other peoples\u2019 stomachs, I prefer having them in mine. Well you have to excuse me ladies, because now I just have to get something to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked by Tamara and Meghan and disappeared down the hall, even though her body had dried off by now her hair was still dripping wet and she left a trail of droplets on the floor behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamara spoke to Meghan as soon as she thought Nicole couldn\u2019t hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow she\u2019s always ravenous. I think it is weird that someone who studies defensive measures eats so many people and is always on the attack. I\u2019m quite sure no one here eats half the number of people she does. But then again she needs building materials for that slime of hers so maybe it isn\u2019t so weird, just ironic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan nodded her head. \u201cI guess it is. But there\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t get. Is she going outside to hunt someone like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo she\u2019s just going over to our storage. We always keep some snacks around and we often need test subjects. That was why she thought I was coming with a snack because they most often have no idea of what we are going to do to them and as she\u2019s always hungry I\u2019ve brought her some before.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The lights are out inside the room so she turns them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess Daniela has gone home then. Too bad I would have liked you to meet her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan looks inside the room and is surprised to see the things she sees in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA car? And a boat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you never know what to find in here.\u201d Tamara giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see Daniela studies swallowing large objects. It is quite a sight to behold when she\u2019s in action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess it adds to the fear factor when you see something huge go down one\u2019s throat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamara turned off the lights and closed the door again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell she\u2019s not here to give us a demonstration, so I guess we could move on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next stop was at a little fancier office. Tamara knocked on the doorframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me Doctor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside sat a tall brunette bent over her keyboard, and she didn\u2019t look up when she answered in a rather playful tone. \u201cDrop the formalities Tamara, you know I don\u2019t like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Tracey, it\u2019s just that I\u2019d like you to meet someone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracey looked up rather surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeghan this is Doctor Tracey. Tracey this is Meghan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracey got up from her chair and greeted Meghan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo who might you be? You look a little young to be a post graduate student.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m professor Hawthorn\u2019s daughter. Blainey offered me a tour of the place and Tamara agreed to show me around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracey giggled a little and got confused looks from both Meghan and Tamara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I just can\u2019t imagine our professor with kids. So a professor with children just seems a bit weird to me. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m that interested in getting any myself. But I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had an opportunity to learn vore like few have. Or haven\u2019t your mother told you what she\u2019s been working with until you were quite old?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo she showed us at a rather young age. I was about five the first time I swallowed Kimberly my older sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow old is she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwenty four. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, then it\u2019s not the same Kimberly. She\u2019s just twenty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame as who? And I\u2019m twenty one, but thanks I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKimberly is the name of a girl who volunteered last semester to be test subject for a study we run along with some ladies over at the faculty of physics.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mischievous smile crept over her pretty face. A large lovely mouth and blue tingling eyes framed by long black hair made her look very sexy as it did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWell it\u2019s more like I give them information they need and study their results and they do all the hard work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cContinue, tell her what you do.\u201d Tamara ushered on as Tracey grew silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh isn\u2019t it little Miss nosy?\u201d Tracey poked fun at Tamara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess it is harmless. Mostly just monitor the work going on around here and the project I told you about. Other than that I\u2019m always looking for a vacant professorship to fill. I have been studying a few things, but now I don\u2019t concentrate on anything particular, I pick up a subject as I feel like it, meaning that I have a few unfinished things lying around that I can work on when I have time to spare.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you do Meghan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell currently I\u2019m just studying math, biology and chemistry. Basically so that I can join a research team like mom\u2019s or yours when I\u2019m done. I don\u2019t feel that v101 has anything new to teach me so I asked professor Blainey if she could start a more advanced course, and that was more or less the reason as to why she offered me to come down here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I\u2019ve heard about that, your mom and the professor spoke to me about it, they have been to the school council and are awaiting their decision. Or maybe they got word today, I don\u2019t know. They just asked me if I would consider holding a few lectures for such a class and I told them I\u2019d be delighted to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great! I didn\u2019t know if Blainey took me seriously or not. Hopefully I\u2019ll see you in class then.\u201d Meghan said giddily as the stepped back outside since Tamara had motioned that they should continue.</span></div></div>",

I mean, you can say what you want about the Japanese, but they never do anything half assed. Look at their craftsmanship everything is body and soul a way of life that\u2019s either done to perfection or not at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t say, I honestly don\u2019t know much about the Japanese.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan admitted and looked sort of confused as to why they stopped here if there wasn\u2019t anyone here.

But then again there is something business like about the woman in general, who is a curly redhead with a full body, a bit thicker than average not plump or fat, but somehow there seems to be more of her than of the average woman.

I\u2019m Professor Hawthorn\u2019s daughter, so you don\u2019t need to worry about espionage if that\u2019s what the problem is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you\u2019re the professor\u2019s daughter!? Why didn\u2019t you say so at once? I almost turned you into a midday snack!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I thought you knew, I didn\u2019t want to state the obvious. Like I said, Professor Blainey showed me the way down here so I thought I\u2019d take a look in here and see if mom was around if nothing else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you really are Hawthorn\u2019s daughter then I don\u2019t see any harm in giving you a little tour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am, don\u2019t worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, we are all working on different ways to absorb more of a meal. In the end we will combine our techniques and experiences and hopefully get a great result.\u201d Alectra said as she started walking down a hallway and Meghan could see people behind some of the doors, strangely enough most doors seemed to be left open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe whole idea is that if you can absorb more of the meal then you can go for longer periods of time without eating and also decrease your number of meals. As an added bonus there is less waste to get rid of when the meal has passed through your body, something that I believe most would appreciate. At least us experienced girls who tend to digest our meals in one go and not over a period of time. What I mean is that normal toilets usually can\u2019t handle the kind of strain we often put on them. When we are done with this we hopefully won\u2019t have to worry about finding a custom made toilet for our needs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they had walked a bit Meghan understood why the doors were open, the people here used them too much for there to be any meaning in closing them again. Women seemed to pop out of every opening only to disappear into another, often carrying something with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t you just grow fat, if you absorbed more of the meal?\u201d Meghan said as she came to the conclusion that even though there was a laboratory behind almost every door, the equipment in them had to differ, thus all the running about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you could if you didn\u2019t get your body to handle the meal properly. Again it is a matter of knowledge techniques and hard work. This obstacle we have managed to get past though, so our bodies handle it much like it hides meals, meaning that you don\u2019t look any different if you are good enough at it or unless you eat more than you can handle.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I actually thought you had shown your researchers who your daughters were so they wouldn\u2019t try to eat us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I never saw a reason, you were never at risk before and Kimberly haven\u2019t ever been close to my team and they have all met Haley so they know to stay away from her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom I\u2019m attending the same school as your team is on, I really would appreciate if you told them to keep away from trying to eat me\u2026And why is it they know Haley?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve brought Haley to the lab on several occasions, she\u2019s even been here since we moved. Now you wonder why I always do things with Haley instead of like I did when you were younger and use all of you girls.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is because you and your older sister have had a whole lot more to do with your studies than Haley has, so she\u2019s been free to help me. On top of that she is still growing, which has proven to be a big bonus and she has a talent to learn new things. Sorry to say it but she\u2019s always been much better at learning new things than both you and Kimberly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan can\u2019t really argue with her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell at least you are honest, but I\u2019m not so busy I want to miss out on learning new cool things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you are right, maybe I should let you in on Haley\u2019s and my little discussions at home, but please don\u2019t come down here before I tell you it\u2019s safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan nodded. \u201cYou know I\u2019ve asked Professor Blainey to start a new class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I actually thought it was a good idea, that way we get better trained researchers from the beginning. And seeing how popular v101 is, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a hard time finding students for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the status of it?

Why? If I may ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I recently realized that I have quite a bit still left to learn about vore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? With a professor in it as a mother I would have thought you\u2019d have learned quite a bit and then some. Actually I would have thought that you wouldn\u2019t want an advanced class since it\u2019d take away your advantage over the other hungry girls around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026didn\u2019t think of it like that. It\u2019s just that mom\u2019s research has always been pretty specialized and Blainey\u2019s seems to be more general so she\u2019s covered topics mom never has, so I figured with an advanced class I could get some of Blainey\u2019s tricks as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat explains a lot and yes, I guess you are right. Know of anything nifty you know she can teach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yes, Blainey made the insides of her stomach glow, that was pretty cool, but mostly I\u2019m just interested in more useful things, like escaping from a stomach and such.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat could come in handy I suppose, there are after all quite a few girls around here with an appetite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose there has to be, unlike home where I\u2019m guessing we might have been the only ones. Never did run into anything that put up a fight anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost sounds boring, then again I suppose a fight is only fun if not too much is at stake, or if you\u2019re winning.\u201d Arectra smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever tried it much, only really had Kimberly to fool with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKimberly? Don\u2019t you mean Haley?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no, Kimberly is our older sister. The two of us never really did much together with Haley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not, if I may be so bold?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan looks around before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell at first she was just too young to play with, I mean she\u2019s almost seven years younger than me. And when she grew older, she started to simply creep Kimberly and me out, so we never really got that sister bonding with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry to hear that, she\u2019s good you know. So what\u2019s so bad with just having sparred with Kimberly? If I got it right you\u2019ve been practicing for quite some time by now, it shouldn\u2019t matter much that it\u2019s just been the two of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne would think so, but we usually just let each other swallow the other, so there wasn\u2019t ever much fighting practice. The only such I ever really got was when finding someone to eat, but you know how easy normal people are to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s almost silly. Can\u2019t help but wonder, was I really that helpless once?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan giggle as she opens the steel door that she\u2019d come through earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you probably were.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlectra raise an eyebrow and steps outside after Meghan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo have anyone jumped on you here yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not yet, well Tamara did, she certainly took me by surprise, but Professor Blainey intervened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. Would you like to try your skills against me?\u201d Alectra says as the door shuts behind them.</span></div></div>",

It is closed now and Blainey is obviously not there, so she figures it is time to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan realizes that she doesn\u2019t have any idea off how long she\u2019s been here, with no clock and with no windows she\u2019ll only have a vague idea when she comes back outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she opens the door Meghan is surprised to find that it is still bright outside, the sun probably won\u2019t set for another few hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clock in her car reveals that her visit only took a little under three hours, meaning that she might still be able to make plans for tonight. But then what to do, what to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving home she\u2019s determined that whatever she\u2019s supposed to do, she\u2019s got to take another shower and get some new clothes. She brushes of some of Tamara\u2019s mucus, that\u2019s formed a dry crust at places before she goes into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanders about idly for a while, should she call someone? Sally maybe? Should she stay home and maybe go out and get someone to eat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer steps takes her to the backyard, where she finds the poolside empty apparently Haley is done with whatever she was up to and a glance at the pool tells that it is without water again and that it is not refilling, that makes a little fun by the pool out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan continues to walk around, figuring that it is better to make plans before getting ready, so that one knows what to get ready for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TV room is empty. No damn it not TV on a Friday night, at least not alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitchen, also empty. Meghan looks at her tummy, yeah she should probably eat something, but in that case she\u2019s more interested in eating someone. Going outside to get someone to eat isn\u2019t exactly something that takes the whole evening so even though she should probably do that, what should she do after that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now it\u2019s clear that Haley is probably upstairs studying something, maybe something interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan figures that it is probably a good time to come to better terms with her little sister. \u201cHaley did say she could play nice too, didn\u2019t she?\u201d Meghan thought to herself as she continued to ponder what to do.</span></div></div>",

Sure there was a large cosy bed, maybe unusually large since it was square and so big that Haley could lie in either direction and she was a bit taller than most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a desk with a computer, so far so normal. But then there were two more desks both covered in books and papers. On both sides of both these desks stood bookshelves packed with every sort of book normal teenagers would stay away from, as far as Meghan could remember she\u2019d never seen Haley with your average novel in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one of these book laden desks was where Haley was seated, still wearing the bikini from before, but she had also put on a pair of tight low cut jean shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Haley, what are you up too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley lifted an eyebrow. \u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan rolled her eyes as if to say \u201cDuh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you are studying, but what are you studying, there are quite a few things one could look into in the world.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figure it has to do with vore one way or the other though.\u201d Meghan added and stepped into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but why are you interested in what I\u2019m studying? You\u2019ve never shown any particular interest in it before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell they teach vore at school here you know and I realised that there were aspects of vore that I have never really given much thought and some I never heard of.\u201d Meghan said as she walked up to where Haley was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she added: \u201cToday for example I visited mom\u2019s lab and Alectra told me how they studied ways of absorbing more of a meal, that way there would be less waste to get rid of too. You do realise how convenient that would be? No more need to find special bathrooms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley looked even more surprised than before. \u201cFunny you say that. It is Alectra\u2019s and a few other of mom\u2019s researchers most resent reports that I am studying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost resent? So you know her techniques?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t go that far. They\u2019ve been at this absorption task for a while now, but all I get is reports to read. It\u2019s not like they are any good step by step manual. Luckily I\u2019m familiar with the terminology, but it is still rather frustrating. I do visit the lab every now and then and talking to them gives much more than any report does. But yes I\u2019ve made progress from what I\u2019ve been told and read.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you know all the girls takes on developing absorption techniques?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how does it work?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJump in and I\u2019ll show you!\u201d Haley said and opened her mouth impossibly wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan who stood just next to her felt like she would fall into the gaping hole which was large enough to take her on standing upright and instinctively she found herself jumping a good meter backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks Haley, I think I\u2019ll pass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley closed her mouth and gave Meghan a mischievous smile. \u201cI was just kidding. Though come to think of it I am a bit hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mentioning of the \u2018Hungry\u2019 word Meghan\u2019s stomach rumbled signalling that she was getting a bit hungry as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I am too.\u201d Meghan said and rubbed her stomach lightly as if to hush it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you please bring something back for me when you go out?\u201d Haley said and fluttered her eyes in a pleading fashion, trying her best to overdo the cuteness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, when you said you were hungry I hoped you\u2019d come with me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Please!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell alright, don\u2019t expect too much, I\u2019ll probably just take the first ones I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley didn\u2019t seem too happy to hear that, but mumbled in agreement as Meghan turned to leave. \u201cWell I guess beggars can\u2019t be choosers.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be right back then.\u201d Meghan said and soon she walked out the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t that many people out so after having walked down the street Meghan was happy to see that shaded by a couple of big trees was a bus stop and at it stood the only two people she could see except for herself. This was just too easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys at the bus stop noticed her too, in fact they were eyeing her quite thoroughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan when she got closer saw that the two people were in fact two boys, rather average built for highschool seniors such as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you\u2019re not riding the bus away from me now, are you boys?\u201d She said succeeding quite well in both getting their attention and surprising them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had figured she was way out of their league so when she approached them in the manner she did they had both trouble finding words, so Meghan continued for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh, you\u2019re not the threesome kind? Well I think my sister would get miffed if I tried to keep you both for myself anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan could see their eyes and crotches bulging ever wider, their brains overflowing with information that they couldn\u2019t quite handle. Hence the boys still found no words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, she looks quite a lot like me, so if you like me you\u2019ll like her too.\u201d With that said Meghan had stepped right up to the two boys that stood almost shoulder to shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind if I make you miss that bus of yours and take you home with me instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan didn\u2019t wait for a reply, but instead put her hands on their sides and pushed the boys together while she opened her mouth wide and quickly swallowed up their heads and shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother push and they were forced face to face and also made easier to swallow. In one motion Meghan had them in all the way to their waists. Then she lifted them up over her head and sucked in the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith them positioned correctly in her mouth she swallowed them down. They made a small lump travelling down her throat, but once in her stomach there was nothing showing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan looked around and made sure no one had seen her before she started walking back home, enjoying the boys pathetic struggles in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan walked back into Haley\u2019s room with a weird expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel like a bird mother about to puke up some food for her chick.\u201d Meghan said giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this little chick of yours is mighty hungry so come on and feed me.\u201d Haley mocked back.</span></div></div>",

Try it again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan waited until Haley\u2019s huge mouth had reached a less intimidating size before she stepped up to her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her stomach she started forcing one of the boys to the entrance of her throat. The other however tried his best to hold on and get a ride out of there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had them both back in her throat she could feel that one was clamping on to the other ones legs. It took some concentration, but she managed to make her throat work both ways at once forcing one guy up and the other one back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her powerful muscles the boys stood no chance and the one holding the other soon lost his grip and plunged back into Meghan\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley was getting inpatient when a she heard a short shriek, that got muffled as something impacted on her tongue. Then she felt the rest of the form enter her mouth as the first of it slid into her throat. A little swishing around as she closed her mouth behind her meal informed her that she had gotten a young man, and unfortunately he still had his clothes on which made him rather tasteless. Since he was no fun she promptly swallowed him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Haley had him in her stomach Meghan looked at her intensely. \u201cNow can you tell me how to do some absorbing tricks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, it\u2019s not that easy. All the techniques involve controlling several muscles and making your body produce different things. So no I can\u2019t just like that tell you how to do it. Besides the first thing you\u2019d have to learn is to handle the extra mass so that you wont just end up getting fat, and that\u2019s a chapter all in its own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan looked rather put down by that and let her stomach have at the boy she had trapped inside. Needless to say it didn\u2019t take long before her body was finished with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley on the other hand was taking things a bit slower with her meal, if she was just getting a little boy she was determined to absorb every crumb of him that she could.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what to do, you\u2019d be better of reading and asking me what you don\u2019t get.\u201d Haley looked down on her tummy and added. \u201dI could give you a demonstration of the results though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks, I\u2019m not interested in watching you take a crap.\u201d Meghan frowned and then changed her tone. \u201cSo how long have you studying this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 A couple of months I think, maybe a little more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would explain a bit. I always wondered how you got that bus down the drain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah these techniques helped a bit, but you\u2019d be surprised at what those toilets can handle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan senses that this was getting nowhere and is considering finding something else to do.</span></div></div>",

There were Becky, mistress of the house and then Gina. Both Becky and Gina were a about as tall as herself and a little softer, Gina being a little broader than Becky and having lighter and shorter hair than Becky\u2019s dark brown that went to the middle of her back in wavy curls..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith dark hair even longer and curlier than Becky\u2019s, Madelene was a size bigger than the rest, standing a few centimeters taller and being a bit broader than Gina, both shoulders and hips and to her chagrin even belly, well Gina didn\u2019t have one, but Madeleine was a little soft around the middle, not fat or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly was this slender girl with a nice tight body called Annette, she did look a little frail compared to the other three, being really cute probably didn\u2019t help in that aspect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell of course let\u2019s not forget Sally who like Becky was pretty average, just standing about a head shorter than the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes the girls had gathered in the living room, drawn the curtains so that the last fading sunlight would be shut out, littered the place with mattresses, blankets, pillows and all other sorts of sleeping gear. They had also managed to decide what movie to watch first as well as gotten into their \u201cpyjamases\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit hard to tell what the girls were wearing really for everyone except Meghan was wearing an oversized T-shirt, so what the girls wore under or didn\u2019t wear under it only they themselves knew. As for Meghan, she had just wiggled out of her tight jeans and settled for sleeping in her panties and small top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they had all snuggled up to watch a\u2026</span></div></div>",

If we are gonna watch a lousy movie we have to have snacks!\u201d Madeleine said giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky got up to head for the kitchen when Meghan stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you going the snacks are right here.\u201d Meghan said with a waving motion and then reached out for Gina who kind of gracefully managed to lung herself up in the air and land in a pile a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was only kidding!\u201d Meghan managed through a fit of giggling, the frightened look on Gina\u2019s face was priceless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to collect herself, and avoiding looking at Gina she added. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any fruits at home do you Becky?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have a look. What do you have in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh never mind, maybe it\u2019ll be better than this movie.\u201d Meghan said with a mischievous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Becky had gone into the kitchen Madeleine spoke up, she clearly could care less for the movie that was running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on Meghan, tell us, please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, you\u2019ll have to wait until Becky comes back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for the next few minutes the girls waited and hardly even commented the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen finally Becky came back.</span></div></div>",

I dunno about that, but Gina is my type of snack.\u201d Meghan replied and burst out laughing as she looked at Gina who once more pulled away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeleine couldn\u2019t keep her mouth shut anymore when she saw Gina\u2019s reaction. \u201cWell you know Gina, you do look real tasty.\u201d She then licked her lips and rubbed her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not funny Madeleine!\u201d Gina whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Meghan cut in. \u201cBut Madeleine did put her finger on what I had in mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got everyone\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I wanted the fruit to check if you girls had done your homework.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHomework?\u201d Madeleine interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! You have all been told to try and keep your digestion at bay, so I figured everyone would swallow a fruit and keep it in there while we watch the movie for a bit and then check on how the fruits are doing. If they are ok, then we could try a bit of swallowing each other. How does that sound?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked at each other, well Becky looked at Sally and licked her lips, wile Gina looked thoughtfully at her tummy. It was the rest that exchanged looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds great to me!\u201d Becky admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too!\u201d Madeleine continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally just nodded and Annette ended the discussion with: \u201cThen let\u2019s do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan took the fruit basket from Becky. \u201cHuh? This is a lot of fruit, and you\u2019re calling me a diet freak?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t blame me! It\u2019s mom that\u2019s trying to get the whole world to eat fruits.\u201d Becky said and poked her tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well then. Here seems to be a lot of pears, so why don\u2019t you all have one?\u201d Meghan said and tossed a pear to everyone. \u201cRemember that you\u2019re supposed to avoid digesting it. Now swallow it whole.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one seemed to have any problem swallowing the drop shaped fruit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how long should we wait?\u201d Annette asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno, let\u2019s just watch the movie for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour, no one could stand the movie anymore, it was just down right dumb, it wasn\u2019t even funny to complain on it anymore, so Gina turned the video off. \u201cOk, I admit, this movie was no fun.\u201d</span></div></div>",

That\u2019s only fair don\u2019t you think?\u201d All nodded except Annette who studied the girls gathered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Becky and Sally snuggled up against each other just waiting to see who Annette would choose before beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Annette you can choose anyone, even Becky or Sally for that matter.\u201d Meghan said as she looked at the svelte girl, who in return nodded that she got the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan then looked at Becky and Sally who looked like they were about to start the action. \u201cHey girls, are you gonna keep the clothes on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Becky and Sally looked at her dumbfounded. \u201cYeah. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell for once Sally\u2019s shirt is going to tear up front if she keeps it on, same thing with her bra. And a naked meal tastes a thousand times better than a clothed one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, but I don\u2019t wanna be the only one naked around here.\u201d Sally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen lets all get naked!\u201d Came a little too excited voice from Annette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gave her a puzzled look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s the only fair thing to do, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one could disagree with that and almost simultaneously all t-shirts were removed only to reveal a wide display of bras and panties, as well as the fact that Annette had been stark naked under her shirt.

And popping her mouth open Sally started in on Becky\u2019s head. First the forehead, then the whole top of the head and finally Sally\u2019s lips slid down the sides of Becky\u2019s head, all smooth and apparently easy, but Sally does come to a halt at the base of Becky\u2019s neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky let out a sigh of relief, she remembered the troubles Sally had in the first class and didn\u2019t expect thing to go so easy, she actually hadn\u2019t thought Sally could take her on. Then Sally proved that she was at least determined to try as she using her hands pulled her mouth wide open so that she could fit Becky\u2019s shoulders in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did the same thing when she reached Becky\u2019s chest. A tug and a wet slurp and Becky\u2019s breasts filled out Sally\u2019s bottom jaw. By now Sally finally tasted some real flesh and not just a lot of hair and makeup and she realized that Becky was indeed quite tasty. So even though it was a little embarrassing with Becky\u2019s naked breasts sliding over her tongue she still enjoyed it while she gently sucked on Becky, trying to get the girl down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky on the other hand got a bit surprised at first, then she realised that it felt really good so she figured she shouldn\u2019t mind so much, she\u2019d probably have done the same to Sally and still might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sally sucked Becky deeper into her throat both of the girls were starting to moan Becky because it really felt quite nice with the wet warm slimy massage she was getting and Sally a little in response to Becky and because of the taste, which she couldn\u2019t complain about.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWith Becky\u2019s breasts going down her neck, Sally started cramming belly in front of her into her ravenous mouth and she seemed to be more interested in getting it into herself than tasting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Becky\u2019s hips entered her mouth Sally slowed her pace down again, but didn\u2019t quite come to a halt despite the added girth, luckily Becky had nice rounded hips so there were never a point of where an obstacle had to be tackled as much as a gently increasing width that her throat had to be stretched to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she took hold of Becky\u2019s legs at the knees and started pushing Becky down her throat. Swallowing did little difference it was the pushing and pulling that made Becky slowly curl up inside Sally\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally didn\u2019t want to take the chance of teasing Becky, so she took new holds on Becky\u2019s ankles rather than her feet. Soon all that was left outside were those feet. She tickled them a little before she forced them into her mouth, and Becky wiggled her toes as best she could in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally made a couple of forced swallows, but she managed to get the last of Becky into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBuuurrrp!!!\u2026Too big for me aye?\u201d Sally said giggling as she patted her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I admit my error of judgement.\u201d Giggling Becky adds: \u201cWhat I wouldn\u2019t give to see your little frame bloated with big ol\u2019 me in it. Eh, speaking of little who\u2019s gonna eat Annette?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally looked at Annette, who was more or less staring back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo, Annette who\u2019s gonna eat you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette snapped out of it, at least for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadeleine is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am?!

Like a rip peach that\u2019d almost melt in your mouth.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it Meghan, I don\u2019t wanna get eaten.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette who was now sitting beside Madeleine in the couch also happened to currently be behind Gina, gave Gina a push in the back, thus making her fall onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOofhh.\u201d Was all Gina managed as the hard surface slammed against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan took the opportunity to get a good grip on Gina with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, let me lick your wounds for you and make it all better.\u201d Meghan said as if speaking to a little child. Before putting Gina\u2019s head into her mouth and suck the girl in, which didn\u2019t take many seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan\u2019s cheeks bulged hugely at first, but as soon as her lips were sealed behind Gina they returned to normal rather quickly and it just looked as if she had something in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette like the other two girls looked on in astonishment as Meghan took her time tasting Gina and doing so licked Gina all over again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool! Is she really still in your mouth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan nodded and a smile crept over Annette\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo if I kissed you, could you pass her over as like when one shares a gum? Annette had to swallow she was salivating like mad and she licked her lips. She could almost taste the tiny little helpless Gina on her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan shook her head and the smile drained from Annette\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Meghan leaned her head back a little and gently swallowed. Gina didn\u2019t make much of a bulge going down and once past Meghan\u2019s collar bones she made none. With her mouth clear Meghan seemed to collect the lingering tastes of Gina in her mouth and licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you see Annette, it has to do with your hiding capabilities. I have never tried anything like that, but I guess if someone who could also hide meals fairly well would have kissed me, then I guess that would have worked. I sort of doubt your mouth could handle all of Gina at once, at least yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Annette could respond Madeleine butted in and smacked Annette on her right ass cheek to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatching you all eat has got me all hungry, so can I have my meal now?\u201d </span></div></div>",

A meal?\u201d Annette asked as she poked Madeleine\u2019s tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, you know I\u2019m just teasin\u2019 ya.\u201d Madeleine said poking her tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo which way to you want to go in, head or feet first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeet! I definitely want to see you eating me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette stood up in the couch and put her hands up against the wall in front of her then lifted one of her feet to Madeleine\u2019s lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen up! I\u2019m coming in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeleine got the idea and leaned her head back a bit so that Annette could more or less step right into her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as her first foot started sliding down Madeleine\u2019s neck Annette brought her other foot up and shoved it in next to the first. She almost fell over doing so, but luckily her strategy of leaning over Madeleine and stabilising herself against the wall worked like a charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeleine couldn\u2019t complain as the delicious flesh of Annette worked itself over her tongue and down her throat. She didn\u2019t even have to swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Madeleine\u2019s stomach couldn\u2019t stretch anymore downwards into her lower belly, so Annette bent her knees to continue her travel downwards, something that resulted in Madeleine\u2019s stomach getting an odd lump in it that surged outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette squirmed as she thoroughly enjoyed the attention she was getting from Madeleine\u2019s body. And she squealed as she sat herself down and had Madeleine\u2019s rippling throat muscles massaging her breasts in an effort to get the last of her into the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeleine then tried to help her throat and pushed Annette\u2019s head into her mouth and down her throat as far as she could with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeleine released a sigh of pleasure as she relaxed in the couch while the last of Annette entered her stomach, pulling the usually a little flabby skin taunt as it stretched to accommodate the large bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh, they have to start selling these meals somewhere, so that a big hungry girl like me finally can get something filling.\u201d Madeleine said caressing the respectable lump in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Not funny!\u201d Annette protested from within, only Madeleine heard her though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Annette. It\u2019s just that I doubt you know what it\u2019s like never to be able to eat as much as you\u2019d want to, either for not being able to afford that much, or because it\u2019d cause you to gain too much weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make it feel any better when you say you finally found something to satisfy your appetite and it\u2019s ME!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Urp* \u201cSorry I just can\u2019t help it. You just feel wonderful in there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like you talking like that! Now I want out!\u201d Annette yelled and started struggling. It was still only Madeleine that could hear her though, but her struggling was visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer struggling didn\u2019t hurt Madeleine any, quite the opposite, Madeleine thought it felt wonderful and hugged her tummy tight and the aspect of the helpless girl in her gut was strangely stimulating.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette could feel the strong muscles around her clamp down on her hard, thus forcing her to curl up into a tight little ball and she heard Madeleine moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeleine\u2019s gasping for air made the other two girls watch her closely which was a little embarrassing, so as soon as she calmed down her muscles relaxed somewhat and Annette resumed her struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh, Maddie. It looks like Annette wants to come back out.\u201d </span></div></div>",

Then Gina felt it force it\u2019s way down her throat as Annette hurriedly got her right foot up and shoved it in and down beside the other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few moments all below Annette\u2019s knees had been forced down Gina\u2019s throat and Gina could taste the back of those knees as they eased down her throat, forced down by the pull of gravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina started moaning. Apparently Annette didn\u2019t taste all bad. And slowly she took in more and more of Annette\u2019s thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette just like with Madeleine curled her legs up and when she did her decent went faster again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everyone was alerted by a weird sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally was the first to react and she got to Gina\u2019s side in moments and let Annette rest her weight against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeghan could you lend a little help here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, she\u2019s too big a meal for you?\u201d Meghan asked a bit taken back. \u201cI forgot most of you haven\u2019t tried anything as large as a person before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina didn\u2019t answer, but instead frenetically motioned for her stretched neck and made some noise that could only be interpreted as something she was experiencing was painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan crouched down before Gina and inspected her. Gina\u2019s mouth seemed to stretch fairly well, even though it didn\u2019t look like it could handle much more. The problem seemed to be that her throat didn\u2019t want to stretch enough to accommodate the swell of Annette\u2019s hips and tight round rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do Gina, it just might be that you\u2019ll have to give Annette up.\u201d </span></div></div>",

She isn\u2019t really complaining about having her crotch in Gina\u2019s mouth either, though Gina isn\u2019t eating her out something like Annette would have wanted her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Annette starts edging down Gina\u2019s throat, but after she\u2019s gotten a few centimeters Meghan stops her ministrations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey why did you stop?\u201d Annette demands to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t working Annette, you\u2019ll just have to get eaten by someone else.

I\u2019ll go for Sally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Gina interrupted. \u201cWho\u2019ll I eat then?

It looked to me that it was the width of Annette\u2019s little tush that was your problem, and Sally isn\u2019t smaller than her in that department. Looks like you\u2019re on the none-eating side today just like Annette. I guess you\u2019d better practice more till next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina looked like she got the reasoning and looked around in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it I at least get to choose who eats me this time then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d Came replies from around her.</span></div></div>",

But Sally\u2019s gonna eat Annette first, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sure hope so!\u201d Sally says looking at Annette who gets the point and make her way over to the large recliner Sally is sitting in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally takes Annette\u2019s hands and put them together so that Annette looks like she\u2019s preparing to make a dive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her mouth as wide as she can Sally feels Annette plunging her arms down her open throat and thrusting her head in after in an attempt to actually dive down there. She doesn\u2019t get her shoulders in though and Sally pushes down as best she can while also swallowing whenever she can, trying to get the girl down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette finds that her slender form doesn\u2019t offer much of a problem, Becky was more than a bit bigger and stretched Sally further than it is going to be necessary to get her slender form down. She notices that Sally\u2019s throat and mouth doesn\u2019t hold her very tightly, except whenever she swallows, making Annette enjoy the warm tender hold Sally has on her as she is massaged down the small girl\u2019s throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally found Annette quite delicious, there was a significant difference in taste between Becky and Annette and she couldn\u2019t help but get a little disgusted by the fact that Annette hadn\u2019t washed off after being in the other two girls, though Becky had probably not been all clean either. Then again maybe a little sweat just added a little saltiness to the flavour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sure about one thing though, they both tasted great and she would probably in time get to taste them again, both sweaty and after they\u2019ve been inside others, so she would get the chance to get philosophical on the reasons behind different tastes if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette\u2019s erect nipples told her that she wasn\u2019t the only one enjoying the ordeal. She didn\u2019t linger there though and the slim stomach that followed vanished in merely two swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen to her surprise she felt her mouth fill with another quite pleasant taste and she realized it was Annette\u2019s juices. Sally had a hard time not to swallow the spasming girl, but it was worth every second to fight the urge and relish the movements in her mouth and throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Annette\u2019s spasms made it impossible for Sally to keep her in place any longer and regrettably had to continue to swallow her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Annette\u2019s hips stretching her throat open and most of Annette\u2019s weight pulling on downwards, the slender thighs didn\u2019t offer much of a resistance and Sally tried to taste them as much as she could before they slipped on down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette curled up in Sally\u2019s stomach once she got there and as her thighs started entering she rolled over and pulled her legs inside, ending up with her head between her knees, a little twitching made her able to bend her knees and pull her lower legs in under herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally in turn got a bit of a chock as she tasted Annette\u2019s knees when all of a sudden they disappeared along with what was left of her meal. There was a slurping sucking noise, finishing with a wet plop as the feet entered her throat and it sealed shut behind Annette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that was a show!\u201d Gina announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally blushed as she suddenly realised that everyone had been watching as she had eaten Annette both up and out. \u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t know she\u2019d cum in my mouth like that! Though I have to say it didn\u2019t ruin her taste...she was very delicious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh and I wasn\u2019t!?\u201d Becky said in mock anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Becky, but Annette was tastier I\u2019m afraid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s great, just encourage them to eat me!\u201d Annette complained and tried to punch Sally from the inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoo\u2026\u201d Sally stopped herself, \u201c\u2026Hey! I shouldn\u2019t have to excuse myself, it\u2019s not my fault you\u2019re so damn tasty Annette.\u201d She said and put her hand were Annette had punched her, though it hadn\u2019t hurt at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh\u2026Annette can you do more like that you did? It felt kind of nice. Could you struggle a little for me?\u201d Sally asked her tummy.</span></div></div>",

But don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll be nice.\u201d Sally said and tried to give Annette a teasing squeeze with her stomach muscles. She managed to do just that and Annette yelped and struggled on pure reflex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot funny!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I was just teasing you, but I won\u2019t do it again if you just do a little more of that you just did, that felt really good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit odd just hearing one side of the conversation and Meghan figured she was promised a snack and that she wanted it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny special preferences Gina?\u201d Meghan said and walked up close to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026well not other that that you take things a bit slower than last time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Meghan opened her mouth wide, thus giving Gina a spectacular view of where she was going. That moist warm and dark cave slowly came down over Gina were she stood waiting shivering with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan closed her lips just below Gina\u2019s breasts, then taking hold of Gina\u2019s hips she lifted the girl seemingly quite effortlessly, so that Gina\u2019s slightly flailing legs were from time to time brushing against the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan continued to stabilise Gina\u2019s body as she let Gina start to slide down her throat, this time taking it slow enough to enable her to taste every inch of her, this time around, willing meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one thing the other girls in the room could see that seemed odder than just a girl swallowing another her own size. And that was that Gina seemed to disappear as she entered Meghan\u2019s throat, making Meghan look normal in exception of her only somewhat overstretched mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attention seemed to be much appreciated by her meal and Gina kicked occasionally as a reflex to her body experiencing one jolt of pleasure or another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo slowly the wiggling body and then lightly trashing legs eased their way down Meghan\u2019s throat and no one took their eye\u2019s off the show in fact Madeleine stared open mouthed until Meghan sexily licked her lips after having swallowed Gina down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026much better if you take your time. Same meal, but still so much better this time around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! That was something.\u201d Becky admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? You like that huh?

And I want to go feet first I think.\u201d Madeleine said and laid herself down on the couch and offering her feet to Becky as she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great, cause I wanted to eat you feet first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky sat herself down on the floor and took Madeleine\u2019s feet and placed them together. Then she gently leaned forward letting her mouth relax and stretch around her meal. It seemed to be a functioning approach, since the feet easily made their way down her throat too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one problem though, as she started closing in on Madeleine\u2019s knees there was a couch in the way. Becky first grabbed Madeleine\u2019s thighs and tried to pull the girl towards her, but the angle was all wrong and she didn\u2019t get much of a grip either and besides, Madeleine is the biggest girl in the house so there was probably something with her weight involved too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Becky got the solution. She stood on her knees, that way she lifted Madeleine\u2019s legs off the couch and she could once more resume her tactic of leaning forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, I thought you were giving up there for a minute.\u201d Madeleine teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky couldn\u2019t answer but gave her a look as if to say \u201cI\u2019m not done with you yet!\u201d and redoubled her efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeleine actually thought it felt really nice as her body was slowly enveloped by the wet slickness of Becky\u2019s tight clasped mouth and throat. She could even feel her feet entering Becky\u2019s stomach and wiggled her toes in there just to be silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Becky\u2019s mouth was pretty stretched as it was and now she looked ahead and those thick thighs of Madeleine\u2019s were going out in all directions. She didn\u2019t let that daunt her too much though and thrust herself forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did however slow down even though she was struggling more than ever to get more of Madeleine\u2019s tasty flesh inside of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard work, Becky\u2019s breathing was forced and after claiming another couple of inches of thigh she took a pause to gather strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I too hard to swallow, aye?\u201d Madeleine teased. \u201cQuite a mouthful even?\u201d She continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky would have none of it and resumed the task at hand. She didn\u2019t get anywhere though and Madeleine laughed out loud at Becky\u2019s comical face expressions as she tried with all her might but still failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaddie, now you\u2019re just mean.\u201d Sally said poking her tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Becky backed down and Madeleine felt her wet flesh getting a bit chilly as it was once more exposed to the open air. It was much easier this way, so it only took her half a minute or so to get all of Madeleine out again. She could probably gotten her out much faster, but she wanted to linger a bit on Madeleine\u2019s taste, she was after all quite tasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell looks like I get to eat you after all then.\u201d Madeleine announced with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just rub it in would ya!\u201d Becky said with a mockery of grumpyness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I could rub ya all over once you\u2019re in here, if you\u2019d like.\u201d Madelene said rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky raised an eyebrow. \u201cWell now, that doesn\u2019t sound so bad. Is that a promise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou betcha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets get started then I\u2019d like to go\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Though I\u2019d prefer it if you tried Annette\u2019s standing into my throat technique. It just seemed a whole lot easier and faster than your way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m no acrobat, but I\u2019ll do my best to keep my balance. I wouldn\u2019t mind a bit of help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno what help I can be, it is after all me you\u2019re going into, I bet I need to keep myself fairly steady on my own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I got two free hands.\u201d Meghan announced \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Madeleine leaned herself back in the couch with her head tipped back and Becky stepped up so that she was standing in the couch. The couch groaned a little, but it didn\u2019t sound too serious, so they continued from there. Becky leaned against the wall behind Madeleine and Meghan took a hold of Becky\u2019s sides to keep her steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady Maddie?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure am! Just step on in!\u201d Madeleine said and opened her mouth as wide as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a wobbly ordeal, but thanks to Meghan\u2019s assistance it went well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky\u2019s feet and calves forced their way down Madeleine\u2019s throat and she couldn\u2019t help but moan. Then Becky bent her knees and Madeleine got to taste her thighs as they quickly slipped into her mouth and down her throat. Even Becky\u2019s fairly large bottom didn\u2019t bring her to a complete halt, but instead edged its way ever downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the widest part in her throat Madeleine took hold of Becky\u2019s shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what are you doing?\u201d Becky demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrmghjh\u201d Madeleine responded, she didn\u2019t actually try to say anything, she was just being silly, then she pulled Becky down into herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she stopped soon enough and took Becky\u2019s arms and tried to force them down her mouth alongside Becky\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I can do that part Maddie, keep pulling me down instead.\u201d Becky said and Madeleine did just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky tried to look at Madeleine\u2019s belly as it swelled to accommodate her, but she was facing the wrong way. That didn\u2019t stop her from trying though, but as Madeleine ate more of her up her restraints did stop her and Madeleine\u2019s right hand on top of her head as it pushed it into her mouth finally made it impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYummy! You filled me up even better than Annette! But then that\u2019s to be expected, she\u2019s so skinny.\u201d Madeleine giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you promised me a good rubbin\u2019!\u201d Came Becky\u2019s voice from Madeleine\u2019s stomach, so loud that even Sally and Meghan heard it and they both giggled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Madeleine joked but did start to rub her belly which once more had lost its softness as Becky pulled the skin tight. It was hard to tell who liked the rubbing best Becky or Madeleine, for Madeleine was looking rather pleased and Becky squirmed in delight.</span></div></div>",

Then we shouldn\u2019t swap partners just yet right?\u201d Sally asked Meghan and Madeleine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess not.\u201d Meghan answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you want to put on another movie?\u201d Madeleine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we could do that, but I was wondering. It looks so cool, Gina is in there and it doesn\u2019t show at all. Could you teach us some hiding tricks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess.\u201d Meghan said and went over to Sally and took her hand. \u201cCome I\u2019ll help you over to Madeleine.\u201d And she practically carried Sally across the floor to the couch where Madeleine was reclining. The two stuffed girls filled the couch quite nicely, but Meghan squeezed her way between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere all cozy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that.\u201d Madeleine said \u201cSix people, or five if you ain\u2019t counting Gina in a couch for three isn\u2019t my idea of cozy.\u201d Madeleine said \u201cBut I\u2019d love to hear you out on this hiding thingy. Like Sally said it\u2019s kinda cool that you look no different with or without Gina in there.\u201d Madeleine said and poked Meghan\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo should we do this? I could put on a movie while you practice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds perfect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally and Madeleine were all ears as Meghan instructed them on this and that letting them try out one thing at a time and then jumping to the next telling them that they should try and do all the things at the same time and they would get good results, but that they could do that during the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would seem that all the girls inside the stomachs had fallen asleep after Meghan had settled down between Sally and Madeleine and Gina and Annette continued to sleep. Becky on the other hand was woken from time to time by Madeleine\u2019s stomach clamping down on her too hard or turning her about a lot, she did however drift back to sleep rather quickly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was over an hour later maybe closer to two that Meghan finally got up and put the movie on. This time they took something that sounded like a good movie, but it wasn\u2019t among the films Gina had rented, but rather on one of the shelves by the TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Sally and Madeleine had split concentrations trying both to follow the movie and to get all the things Meghan showed them to work at the same time, not minding getting them to work properly too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan on the other hand could enjoy the move, or almost she did get a few questions from time to time from both of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally was making good progress, after half and hour Annette didn\u2019t block the view of the TV at all anymore, though the bulge she made was still almost as large as Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeleine wasn\u2019t shrinking her stomach any though, but it was mainly because she was still trying to get a hang of the individual techniques and wasn\u2019t trying to put them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat changed during the second hour of the movie where her progress was clearly visible first combining two and then adding another after another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally\u2019s stomach didn\u2019t reach beyond her knees anymore, but it was still very large. Madeleine\u2019s stomach shrank noticeably as she watched it, neither Sally nor Meghan noticed though before the movie was over a good hour later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan got up to get the movie out of the DVD, but halted herself as she didn\u2019t feel Madeleine\u2019s stomach squeezing against her anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoah! You hid her completely?\u201d Meghan asked Madeleine who was idly rubbing her now once more pudgy tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot quite, I don\u2019t normally have this kind of tummy.\u201d It was true, but with her size and normal softness the bulge could easily be passed off as natural flab. Still it wasn\u2019t much of a bulge, just a few extra inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it that my tummy is all flabby again though. Could I swallow you too? I bet Sally with her bulge would be a bit of a problem.\u201d Madeleine asked, it wasn\u2019t true, her belly wasn\u2019t flabby, it was a little soft again though and it did look flabby with the bulge in it, but that was just because one doesn\u2019t expect a girl to have a big solid lump in her gut.</span></div></div>",

Don\u2019t mind that I\u2019ve already hidden Gina, you\u2019ll have to hide me and thus the both of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh\u2026sure\u2026\u201d Madeleine didn\u2019t quite follow but motioned for Meghan to step up into the couch and do like Annette and Becky had done before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan did and Madeleine got a shock as Meghan\u2019s calves forced their way down her throat, they were freaking huge! It would seem that because Gina didn\u2019t show Meghan took up the space both of them would have done otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Meghan started entering Madeleine\u2019s stomach her hiding techniques helped some, but Madeleine still had to struggle with those hips that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been a problem, but now were enough to make her sweat as her mouth and throat stretched to their limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan did taste heavenly though so Madeleine was determined to get all of her down. Once more she did the pull on the shoulders trick and Meghan helped by shoving her hands down Madeleine\u2019s throat and trying to curl up in her stomach. It worked like a charm and Sally looked on in astonishment as Madeleine\u2019s mouth closed behind Meghan\u2019s head and the blonde hair slipped in between those lips and followed the bulge travelling down Madeleine\u2019s neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh, now my tummy is all taunt again.\u201d Madeleine cooed and rubbed the big bulge in her belly, it wasn\u2019t quite true though it was still a little soft and not quite as stretched as it had been even with just Annette in there, actually it was a lot smaller than when Annette had been in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you managed to eat her too!\u201d Sally said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I did think I could manage her, I just had no idea that because she had hid Gina that she\u2019d take up the space of both her and Gina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that so? That\u2019s cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, about taking up space, I\u2019ll see if I can\u2019t make this bulge a bit smaller.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeleine said and patted the round dome that was only a little bigger than the bulge Sally had in her tummy, only that on Madeleine any bulge would show less than on Sally, she did after all weigh twice as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Madeleine closed her eyes and concentrated on the things Meghan had told her and sure enough her stomach shrunk a little, not much but still progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued for a few minutes trying different approaches and then she found something, her stomach shrunk noticeably and the bulge was down to the same size as Sally\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoah! Chill it Maddie! That is so tight!\u201d Meghan called from inside Madeleine\u2019s stomach, Sally couldn\u2019t hear her though and Madeleine didn\u2019t stop right away she managed to shrink her tummy by another three inches before she quit and had she continued she wouldn\u2019t have made anymore progress for all she had done was to squeeze her meals so tight they couldn\u2019t move and anymore squeezing might push the breath from their lungs but accomplish little less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis big girl\u2019s stomach obviously knew how to handle meals. Inside her Becky was awake of course, but she couldn\u2019t find herself getting enough air to say anything and at the moment neither did Meghan.</span></div></div>",

She never would have thought that a beginner could do this, but this big girl\u2019s stomach obviously had handled very large meals before, even though they might not have been the wiggling kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeleine could feel her meals moving around, somehow Meghan had found the strength needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026that\u2019s so nice.\u201d Madeleine found Meghan\u2019s squirming quite delightful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started gently rubbing her bloated middle, but then the movements within suddenly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey don\u2019t quit! That was wonderful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she felt a tugging inside, it actually was a bit uncomfortable. She realised that one of the girls in her stomach had managed to force the sphincter to her throat open and shoved her head back up her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you girls want out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell yeah! Right now!\u201d Came from inside, though she barely made it out through the sounds coming from the television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeleine poked Sally who was startled, she had almost nodded of to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I need your help, it seems Meghan and Becky wants to come back out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeleine could feel something continuing to work its way up her throat as Sally made herself ready, moving her bulging tummy before her to get into a kneeling position in the couch in front of Madeleine, who had gotten herself into a similar position, though she was sitting on her lower legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally then leaned over Madeleine and shoved her right arm down the big girl\u2019s throat while placing her left hand on her shoulder. It felt weird, it was wet and tight and she got her arm down so far that she had Madeleine\u2019s upper lip against the base of her neck before she had gotten her hand past Meghan\u2019s head and gotten a hold of her armpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about the same time that Meghan had finally managed to get both of her shoulder into Madeleine\u2019s throat and she had her arms pinned at odd angles, had gotten them so while prying the sphincter open. But with Sally\u2019s help she now managed to get her legs under herself and stand up against the bottom of Madeleine\u2019s stomach. This made her practically explode up the girl\u2019s throat, ending up with Madeleine\u2019s lips curled around her waist and leaning over forwards onto Sally who had fallen backwards, luckily not off the couch though it was close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecky, get a good hold of one of my legs and I\u2019ll try to pull you out along with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally gave her a weird look. \u201cHow are you gonna do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh get off the couch.\u201d And Sally did as she was told piling onto the floor instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Maddie, would you be so kind as to lay down on your stomach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeleine did so and Meghan worked her way in front so that she could lie down properly, thus ending up with Madeleine taking up most of the couch and what was visible of Meghan mostly hanging over the side of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot put your hands up against the armrest and brace yourself so that I don\u2019t just end up pulling you along with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan then put her own hands on the other side of the armrest and pushed hard and in a jolt pulled her hips free of Madeleine\u2019s mouth and some of her thighs too. She then leaned towards the floor and repeated the push though against the bottom of the couch this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t get quite the same good results since Becky was holding her back as she was holding onto Meghan\u2019s right leg, which in turn made Meghan swing in that direction. Though that meant that her left leg got a little further than her right, enough in fact that as to get her knee into Madeleine\u2019s mouth and with a bit of effort she pulled the rest of the leg out of Maddie\u2019s mouth and placed her foot on the girl\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow pushing of with her leg Meghan brought her other leg up into the open and with it Becky from her chest and up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching up between her legs Meghan took Becky\u2019s hands and placed her feet on Madeleine\u2019s shoulders before she heaved and got all of Becky out in one go, though that meant that she ended up under the girl as she hung over the edge of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky rolled off her though and got to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should probably get Annette out now too.\u201d Becky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s getting rather late.\u201d Meghan agreed, looking at the clock which told her it was in the middle of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she and Becky shoved an arm each down Sally\u2019s throat and pulled Annette out of there. She was woken up by their actions and looked sleepy as she took in her surroundings all the while slipping out of Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh, why you woke me up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I dunno if she could, but I figure that Sally might not be able to hold back digestion if she fell asleep. Now you don\u2019t want to come out of that tight little butt of hers do you?\u201d Meghan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh I dunno, it\u2019s a fine looking one. You think it\u2019d really be that bad?\u201d Annette joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess that\u2019d be up to you, I know I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just kidding, I\u2019m not that fond of the thought of becoming someone\u2019s poop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, you got my hopes up for nothing.\u201d Sally teased. \u201cNah, I\u2019d never eat you for real on purpose.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Reluctantly she figured that she should and took the opportunity to start tasting Gina properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette\u2019s tongue worked itself over as much of Gina\u2019s skin as she could get it to and Gina was delicious so she let herself moan a little to show her appreciation and maybe to get Gina to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Gina had starting to get restless and Annette had her in to mid thigh. Figuring she could make things a bit scarier she took hold of Gina\u2019s hands and placed them on the thighs in front of her, then she started swallowing as much as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis finally brought Gina out of her slumber, but she was still a bit groggy. She did notice though that something was holding her arms in place and that something was creeping up over her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the?!\u2026mmmm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette paused to taste that snatch that had just entered her mouth, apparently Gina liked the gesture, though she still hadn\u2019t looked below yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping at it Annette managed to bring Gina over the edge and while she was withering Annette continued to get more of the girl down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks! That is surely one of the nicest ways to wake someone up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Gina felt her breasts being pushed under Annette\u2019s upper lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh I\u2019m not sure I want to get swallowed again, can\u2019t we wait until the morning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the swallowing continued and Gina opened her eyes to look down and finally saw Annette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!

Annette is ehmph mmh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette paused as her lips had settled over Gina\u2019s nose, her body still pulled Gina down though, or maybe it was gravity, but Meghan managed to catch the terror in Gina\u2019s eyes before they slipped into Annette, Gina never saw her though as she could more or less only look in one direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan thrust her hands into Annette\u2019s mouth and worked them past Gina\u2019s head and down to her armpits where she took hold and started pulling Gina back up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you!

So while the others continued sleeping they set about preparing breakfast which now stood ready on the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky got a few sleepy eyes turned her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so what are you up to now?\u201d Gina wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust breakfast, come with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all got up, Madeleine last of them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where are we going?\u201d Meghan wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh\u2026to the kitchen?\u201d Becky said wondering why that had not been obvious and started walking in that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all gathered around the table and started digging in, all but Meghan who looking a bit sceptical took a glass of juice. Becky noticed after a while that that was all Meghan was having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh what\u2019s wrong Meghan? Are you dieting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess you could say that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess? Is it the food?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s not wiggling. I kind of like it kicking about down there.\u201d Meghan said and patted her stomach. This made all the girls stop eating as they realised that Meghan actually ate people, by the sound of it, almost only people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm sorry I don\u2019t have any of that\u2026 kind\u2026 of food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a problem, I ate before I got here yesterday. If I don\u2019t waste my energy I can go a few days on one meal, though running about with hidden but undigested meals is draining and apparently so are such things as forcing your way out of someone\u2019s stomach.\u201d Meghan said shooting a look at Madeleine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeleine hadn\u2019t been listening still fighting the fog sleep had cast over her. She noticed Meghan glaring at her and her unconscious mind put what was going on together for her to some degree. \u201cOh, I can\u2019t unswallow people the way you do, Meghan, sorry about that. Besides you felt so good in there I can\u2019t really hold it against my stomach that it tried to keep you.\u201d She teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but I bet you wouldn\u2019t like me swallowing and keeping you in my tummy because I know you\u2019d feel great in there?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrumpy are we?\u201d Becky wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I guess I should get something to eat, one would think that I should be able to go hungry as well as anyone, but I can\u2019t help getting a bit touchy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, I know the feeling\u201d Madeleine admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Both Becky and Gina agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo anyone have any plans for the day?\u201d Sally wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky answered her right away. \u201cWell I had thought that maybe we could\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

I just gotta go get a bathing suit.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh I don\u2019t think anyone of us brought that Gina, but it\u2019s not far for anyone to go fetch that either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo any beach you\u2019d like to go visit in particular?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, anyone have a preference?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I\u2019d like to go to the official beach, they have a nice seaside shop there and I think I\u2019m in the mood for some ice-cream and there\u2019s also the rocks on the north end where you can lay down a bit more undisturbed. Besides I might be silly, but I think it\u2019s more fun to jump in from a large rock than wade out.\u201d Becky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo lets all meet up by those rocks then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone agreed and helped Becky clean up before they took their belongings and headed home to fetch sunscreen, towel, bikini and what else they might need for a day at the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan hurried thinking that she might get there first and get herself someone to eat before the other girls got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was just a little over twenty minutes later that she was leaving her house, walking at a brisk pace towards the beach and another fifteen minutes before she could read \u201cSunside beach\u201d on a big sign at the parking lot that covered the area between the beach and the town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne might have been surprised that there were so few cars there, but then the beach was at a walking distance from the town. There were quite a few bicycles and mopeds though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan walked onto the beach area and saw the shop Becky mentioned and at the side of the building there were some renting service where you could hire surfing boards and jetski machines and the like. And at the southern end so that it would be somewhat secluded and get all the evening sun there was a restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at the other end of the beach though that she should meet up with the girls, so she headed that way. The beach was fairly large, well depending on what you compare it to, but about four kilometres long and between a hundred and three hundred meters wide left enough space to not make it crowded even on a day where most people wanted to go to the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTough most of it stretched north from the entrance Meghan had used. She could see that there were quite a few people scattered over the beach and even a decent number of people up where Becky had said that they should be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan could see people climbing over the rocks and jumping into the waves rolling past, she couldn\u2019t tell who they were quite yet though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping up her steady pace she soon approached the rocks and saw that Sally, Annette and Madeleine were already there and Becky came from the woods behind that part of the beach and Meghan saw that there were at least ten bicycles there leaning against different trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi girls!\u201d Meghan called as she got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi\u201d Madeleine responded as she struggled with changing into her bikini while keeping her large beach towel on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the girls just waved and Sally and Annette ran for the rocks seemingly racing each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Becky and Meghan tossed their things on either side of Madeleine and Becky began to change too also having a bikini with her. Meghan on the other hand had already changed and just removed her short light brown skirt and small white top to reveal a striking tiny lime green bikini that accentuated her curves perfectly. Then she too headed for the rocks following the trail of Annette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently you had to leap from some rocks to get to the next and you could take different paths, well you could choose different goals too there were quite a few large rocks out there that offered different thrills. Annette stood on a low large rock that the waves broke against sending cascades of water over the girl and some of the waves even flowed over the rock, that\u2019s how low it was, which of course made for an unsteady footing. That didn\u2019t seem to bother Annette though who was looking like she was enjoying herself to the fullest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan could see that Sally was just a few meters away from Annette, but she on the other hand was standing on top of a tall steep rock, looking like she was about to make the probably five meter jump to the waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they weren\u2019t the only people there, there were at least ten guys as well, of who two has trouble keeping their eyes off of Meghan and then probably another five girls. Though how many the waters contained Meghan could not guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what should she do?</span></div></div>",

She still needed to eat though and looked in the direction of the boys who had been eying her, not that they weren\u2019t still occasionally leering her way, that would be easy enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then she caught sight of Gina crawling her way out of the water at one side of the rocks, apparently you didn\u2019t need to swim back to shore to get up again. But what caught her attention was that Gina was talking to two guys there and one of them was helping her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe eating people here wasn\u2019t that good an idea, how could she tell who were and weren\u2019t friends with her girls?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell then, she was out here she might as well enjoy it like the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Sally jumped into the water, not making much of a splash since the waves covered her impact site almost instantly. \u201cOh, if she can make that jump, then so can I!\u201d<br>\r\nMeghan thought and headed in the direction of that tall steep rock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing both quite tall and athletic as well as endowed with the extra strength vores seem to posses she easily made her way to the rock and climbed on top like it was second nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she got there a guy had also made his way up there. He was probably a year or two younger than her and fairly fit. He tried to offer her a helping hand to get up, but she had sprung up beside him before she had time to notice his gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh, thanks.\u201d Meghan smiled. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you though, but I still need help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy pleasure, so what can I help you with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been here before so, are there any rocks or something I should avoid jumping on? And where can I climb back up again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d The guy looked around and pointed to another high rock from which two guys were just about to jump. \u201cOn the other side of that rock is a rock just a meter below the surface so everyone who jumps there jump in this direction, that means you gotta be careful so that the waves doesn\u2019t bash you against the rock though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed at a spot between that rock and the one Meghan was standing on. \u201cThere is the easiest part to get up here, but it\u2019s quite a bit to swim, so most who jump here climb up there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he pointed to a rough spot just a couple of meters away the base of the rock they were standing on and Meghan saw that Sally was sitting there and waving up at her apparently waiting for her to jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if you jump from that rock over there.\u201d He again pointed towards the other jumping rock. \u201cThen there\u2019s a rope attached to the side of the rock that you can easily access from the shallow rock I mentioned that you shouldn\u2019t jump on. Though I\u2019ve never seen a girl jump from there, so I\u2019ve never seen one climbing the rope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh is that so? You sound as if you doubt a girl could do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you are naturally weaker than us guys and I dunno, maybe many are scared of the twelve meter jump too, I know most guys are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then I just might have to prove you wrong then. See you at the bottom.\u201d Meghan said before she leaped off the rock, landing feet first and disappearing deep beneath the waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started swimming towards the spot where Sally had climbed up and broke the surface just a couple meters away from it. Sally saw her and came down to give her a helping hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2026you know...?\u201d Sally made a forced swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no. He\u2019ll be here any second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally let out a sigh of relief. \u201cI was worried there for a moment, I kind of like Robert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRobert is his name aye?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Robert broke the surface behind her. \u201cCould you ladies make room for me up there too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Meghan went down and offered him a hand, he took it and got quite a surprise as she practically lifted him out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! You\u2019re strong aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you shouldn\u2019t underestimate us girls like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, obviously not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you still up for jumping that other boulder?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey I never said I was gonna jump\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChicken are we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh what the heck, I\u2019ll jump if you do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen lead the way, I don\u2019t know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally looked at the two if them. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna jump that cliff?\u201d and pointed towards the high rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Robert said he\u2019d never seen a girl do it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh so you know my name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, sorry Sally told me. I\u2019m Meghan, Meghan Hawthorn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert took her hand. \u201cA pleasure, I\u2019m Robert Freimann.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGerman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not that I know, but I bet some ancestor on dad\u2019s side aught to have been.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, most likely, I like the name though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks I guess.\u201d He then started picking a trail towards the large rock. \u201cWatch your step!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew his way and Meghan had no trouble following. To get up on the rock there was a rope attached at the top and at the bottom as assistance to get up the rough steep slope. But because it was there the climb was an easy one, it might be a lot worse trying to go down though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert went over to the edge of the rock and pointed. \u201cThere\u2019s the shallow rock I told you about, and there you can see the rope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, that doesn\u2019t look too bad. Now are you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned around he saw Meghan leaping off the rock on the safe side and he found himself hurrying after her, not to be outdone by a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut by the time he got to the underwater rock and the rope, he found that Meghan had already climbed up the rope and was looking down at him as she stood on the rock the rope went to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are\u2026I thought you\u2019d never come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gave you too much head start didn\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah, that\u2019s what you call it? I guess you still haven\u2019t seen a girl climb this rope of yours, that\u2019s what you get for being a slowpoke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t be so slow next time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but I got to go now. I\u2019ll be back later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Wait!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan turned back to face him. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot far, but I\u2019ll be back in half an hour.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she hurried out of there, trying to put some distance between them so that he wouldn\u2019t follow, she didn\u2019t really feel like she could share the secret of vore with him, him being a boy and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting back to the beach she headed for the main area of the beach, where people were playing volleyball and wakeboarding and stuff. There she was sure she could find something that\u2019d suit her tastes.</span></div></div>",

Then there were the senior citizens residing under their parasols enjoying a good book, sometimes with their grandchildren playing in the sand next to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were more interesting things\u2026boys playing Frisbee or volleyball, but only the Frisbee guys ever went into the water, and something told her that their friends would notice if their pal just went up in smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were quite a selection of tanning people too some looked really appealing, but then again, she could be waiting a long time before she\u2019d get an opportunity to pack one of them away without causing a stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t that many people in the water here, just the occasional kid playing catch with the waves and a few wakeboarders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead there seemed to be a more shallow area though, so that you could reach the bottom at least fifty meters off the shore and there, there were some more action in the water, there were even a couple of those floating platforms. The one closest to shore was obviously meant for kids and had a slide and a little house and stuff where as the others were empty, except on people, most of them were pretty crowded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo figuring that one of those could be a good place to look for a meal, or rather in the water near one, Meghan entered the water and headed for the closest one, figuring that it\u2019d be a little more secluded seeing as it\u2019s on the edge and on the northern edge too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan soon found herself swimming instead of walking on the bottom, it was further out than she had thought at first, all the better she figured, she also realized that it wasn\u2019t on the shallow patch, but rather a distance from it. It had to be at least three meters deep where she was now and probably four or more where the platform was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t far now, just another thirty meters or so, so Meghan looked up to spot any potential victims\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And judging from the ones she could see they were in their late teens or early twenties and fairly good looking. Apparently some were tanning topless too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of those top-less girls was about to jump into the water and Meghan thought she looked scrumptious. Long slightly curled brown hair and a fit curvy body, Meghan couldn\u2019t tell if she was pretty or not, but figured that she probably was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d have to hurry though if the girl wasn\u2019t to climb up again before she could get her stomach around her. Actually thinking \u201cDun-dun dun-dun dun-dun\u2026\u201d Meghan figured she\u2019d make a better monster than any ol\u2019 shark and dove down continuing her approach beneath the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing good at hiding her meals, also meant that she could hide quite a bit of air too, so she could stay down quite a while, hence she headed for the bottom. There were all sorts of little sea critters and plants down there, so she didn\u2019t go all the way down, but stayed a meter or so from the bottom and from there watched the girls as she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer choice had obviously been hesitating, because she still hadn\u2019t jumped in the water, Meghan could tell that she hadn\u2019t chickened out though, she was still standing there but the water and the rough surface of the water blurred the image a lot so she couldn\u2019t look her over more. There were three other girls in the water though, all of them just next to the platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan looked them over instead as she waited, they were all fairly good looking, one had a teasing tiny yellow bikini that had dug itself in between her cheeks nicely, Meghan thought, but what\u2019s that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s got a bulge in her belly? But she\u2019s too fit for a potbelly. Then Meghan realised that one of the other two also had a potbelly, even larger than the first girl\u2019s and she too looked too much in shape to have any belly flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Meghan realised that unlike her home town, quite a few girls here ought to know vore, seeing as it was being taught at the local university. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the placement of those bulges, Meghan figured that their meals were pretty digested by now. It was quite obvious that the girls were friends and so they probably all knew vore\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the girl Meghan had been waiting for dove into the water, she sailed a good one and a half meter down and let herself glide away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan looked at her, her thoughts a bit split now when she knew the girl probably knew vore too, so she made the decision:</span></div></div>",

And she did outswim the girl before too, didn\u2019t she? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother look at the girl convinced Meghan that the girl probably weren\u2019t even that eager to continue following her, so Meghan angled her head towards the bottom and started kicking away, picking up speed as she headed back towards the shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had gotten in over the shallows and put a hundred meters or so behind her she ventured a look behind her and found no pursuer, so she went up for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe racket behind her caught her attention and she turned around to find herself looking at the platform she had just visited and found that all its occupants were crowded in the middle of it, all standing close together and looking into the water. She thought she made out the word shark, but the water got in her ears all the time as the waves rolled by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, they definitely were shouting something about a shark. Getting an involuntary scare she pulled in her legs under herself and plunged her head under water to frantic look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her stomach\u2019s occupants got her attention again. \u201cOh, I\u2019m the shark\u201d She thought. \u201cRight\u2026real smooth of me to grab a snack so discreetly\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a hand on her stomach as if to use it to feel what happened to her meal as they gave their final futile struggle against the suddenly very unfriendly stomach that closed in on them, Meghan kicked her way back to the surface and started swimming in towards the shore like normal people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too far ahead she could see a cascade of water approaching and as it abruptly ended she saw a blonde girl in a bright red bikini dive and disappear below the surface. It took Meghan a second to realise that the girl was heading towards the platform with the frightened people. Lifeguard? Meghan wondered and continued her swim towards land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take her long before she reached the place where the lifeguard had dove into the water and Meghan stood up, figuring that then she could probably walk on in from here and realised that the water came up to her waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe ran all the way here?!\u201d Meghan\u2019s mind reeled, both as it explained why there had been such a cascade of water and by the feat it was to run through that deep water, clearly this lifeguard girl had to know how to eat people and probably be quite good at it, it'd be no pushover that could run in water this deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver of fear trailed down her spine as she looked back towards the platform as she realised that the blonde girl that had pursued her might not have been as much of a threat as Meghan had made her out to be, but she felt pretty sure of the outcome of a fight against this lifeguard girl, she guessed it\u2019d end with her ready to come out of a red bikini covered bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up her pace more eager than ever to get back on land and felt much more at ease when she finally got there. She took in the view of the diverse lot of people scattered over the place, the shouts of shark didn\u2019t seem to have caused much of a stir in here, in fact it looked like no one had cared, or perhaps they hadn\u2019t heard over the swell of the waves, looking back she could tell the platform was quite far out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a relief she thought, glad she hadn\u2019t caused something that\u2019d go into the newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother issue troubled her, but the sight of the buildings up ahead calmed her some there appeared to be toilets behind the dressing rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell assaulted her senses as she entered the building with stall doors lined up in a long row opening one she found herself surprised, in a positive way, it explained why the smell was so potent, but at the same time made it worth to put up with. She had expected a water closet, but instead found the sort of toilet they often have at music festivals, a bench like box built into the walls of the booth with a hole in it covered by a typical toilet seat, the hole leading to a large open container that\u2019d be emptied regularly rather than the sewer system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Meghan there had actually been normal toilets there before, but due to a problem of them clogging up all the time and people leaving real messes that baffled the ones who had to take care of them, the management had decided to go back to this cruder set-up and it had strangely enough solved their problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt solved Meghan\u2019s problems too, she had feared she\u2019d be spending some serious time in there struggling to get her meal down the drain, especially since circumstances ended up granting her two. As it were now she could just unload them and with a disturbing barricade of wet noises they emptied into the container below, leaving Meghan ready to clean up in moments, not that she seem to need it, but she felt dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact as she got out of there she headed back to the water to wash off. A quick dip later she felt much better and glanced out over the water, chance drawing her to the platform she had been at earlier and its occupants still looked nervous, it was a bit hard to tell over the distance, though It made her recall the girl that had headed out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a bit uneasy, she\u2019d only ever really feared her little sister and even that fear was not the same, her sister wasn\u2019t evil, she was sure, she\u2019d only really eat her by mistake, but considering her appetite it was only healthy to have enough fear of the young girl to be cautious enough around her that such mistakes didn\u2019t happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was totally different, this girl Meghan was sure would be like the blonde that had followed her, quite willing to send her on a one way trip through her digestive tract, possibly even eager to hunt her down to get the opportunity of doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized she was deep enough in the water to not really have a good view of the bottom around her and headed back into the wet sand part where the waves rolled in only to recede again and leave only soaked sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis she felt was fear like she never had felt it, what her mind told her, if she\u2019d stayed out there? And she fussily remembered the instant when the cascade of water had turned into a glimpse of a woman in a red bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came to an unsettling conclusion that once again ended with a red bikini-clad bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t get much of an image though, just another shiver of fear running through her and pumping some adrenaline into her flight ready system. She\u2019d never needed to flee before though. It was a strangely thrilling sensation. Not looking upon another woman and wondering what she\u2019d taste like, but instead being the one that should avoid notice so not be turned into a snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind lingered on the girl that so occupied her mind, but she had never really gotten a look at her, she was both curious to how this girl looked that\u2019d put such a scare in her just for the sake of curiosity, but realized it might be good to know what she looked like in the future, this might not be the last time she has to avoid getting eaten by the girl. A rationalization that led to a train of thought once again ending with that bikini-clad butt, what did it look like? Oh, did I just think that? She caught herself.</span></div></div>",

At first she scanned aimlessly as if she was lost, then she mentally slapped her forehead and turned towards the closer one of two outlook towers as she was quite certain that the girl hadn\u2019t come from the other one, finding it to be too far down the beach for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it looked empty so she turned her eyes back towards the water and did spot a blonde head poking out of the water, bobbing up and down with the waves. At first she couldn\u2019t tell if the girl was swimming or walking and merely jumping up at times not to be washed over by the waves. A little while later she could tell it was the latter as more and more of the girl emerged from the waves. She didn\u2019t seem to be in much of a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing she was staring Meghan abruptly turned towards the shore again and made her way up to the beach store where things were a bit more crowded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way amongst the people here although avoiding the queues to the different parts she worked her way towards the outlook tower, or rather behind it. Occasionally casting a glance towards the water to determine how far the girl had gotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she stopped in the shade of one of the buildings waiting for the girl to return to her tower, whereas she had been quick on the way out she didn\u2019t seem in much of a hurry now, in fact she only lazily climbed the steps of the wooden stair leading up to the outlook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan waited for her to turn her gaze back towards the sea before she casually started her own lazy stroll towards the tower, keeping far enough out from is so that the floor of the outlook wouldn\u2019t block her view of the girl, well to some point it was inevitable. It meant that she had to walk up pretty close to the tower to be close enough to get a good view of the girl though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first she could make out was that the girl had fairly broad shoulders and a strong back, moving further out from under the tower she saw the well developed back curve into a waist that then buckled out where a pair of muscular thighs were complemented by a fairly large and firm set of glutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving forward a bit Meghan keeps to the side as she edges in front of the tower to see what the rest of the girl looked like and she finds a set of six-packs leaving bumps over an otherwise flat belly that\u2019s crowned by a rather modest set of breasts. To her surprise the girl is really cute, somehow she hadn\u2019t expected a round young face with big eyes and blonde playful curls going down to just beneath her shoulders, the wet strands clinging to her face and glistering in the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost feel like going up and introduce herself, but then the sullen look on the cute girl\u2019s face gets to her, clearly she didn\u2019t get anything out by the platform and Meghan knows only too well what being tricked of a meal feels like and her eyes goes to the lifeguard\u2019s strong looking abdomen. No, introducing oneself at this moment is definitely a bad idea Meghan decides and\u2026</span></div></div>",

At least that was how Madeleine interpreted it and she had this longing for meat.</span></div></div>",

Besides I thought you were friends?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see and no we\u2019re not friends I hardly know him, said \u2018hi\u2019 a few times is all. I suppose Sally and Becky knows him though, I\u2019ve seen the two of them talk with him a bit.\u201d Madeleine said and she felt a little embarrassed \u201cIt was just that seeing him is what got me all worked up, that\u2019s why I said I wanted him, honestly, I wouldn\u2019t eat friends.\u201d She defended herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Meghan said a bit sceptical. \u201cBut you\u2019re the one who knows who the friends are, so you still need to come with me and pick one out.\u201d The Meghan said and gave Madeleine a hand. It looked a little weird with the tall svelte blonde helping the brunette almost twice her size up, the odd part being that the slimmer girl almost picked the large girl up using only one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey watch it!\u201d Madeleine yelped as she struggled to get a stable footing. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so rough!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Meghan snickered, but instead of letting go she started dragging the big brunette along with her towards the water. Madeleine needed a few steps before she caught up and only then did Meghan let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them quickly reached the water, there wasn\u2019t much sand here as the waves crashed in, it was a much rougher passage from land to sea, with shallow cliffs and rocks either continuing out to the rocky peninsula Meghan had visited earlier or directly into a rough sea which clearly became quite deep straight away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting in here?\u201d Madeleine said confused and looked at the waves that battered against the rocky shoreline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, I was going to make a stealthy approach\u2026\u201d Meghan said and continued. \u201c\u2026not good to let anyone see you neither before nor after you grab a meal.\u201d She said as she found a spot that she felt comfortable diving from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her gaze outwards she could make a couple of guys out on the tall rock, they were really the only ones she could see from where she stood. \u201cAre those two friends?\u201d She asked motioning towards the two boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeleine shielded her eyes from the sun, but they were really quite far away, she couldn\u2019t really tell\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh forget it.\u201d Meghan said as one of the boys made the jump. \u201cThey aren\u2019t gonna be there when I get out there anyway.\u201d She sighed and motioned for the large brunette to move. \u201cGet on out there and be ready to nod or shake your head as I get out there.\u201d Meghan said and dove into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe currents were quite strong, luckily so was she and with a bit of effort she managed to get clear of the worst parts, diving a little deeper she managed to avoid the pull of the waves as well. She didn\u2019t know her surroundings well enough though so when she came up to take a look she found that she was already pretty close to the high rock. She had to wait several minutes before Madeleine arrived on a nearby ledge, during which time she struggled to avoid getting detected, she thought she succeeded, if for no other reason than that the people jumping didn\u2019t seem to look around much, mostly they just looked down and then at the spot where they were going to land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the jumpers seemed to be jumping in pairs or more, one urging the other in a competitive or dare-like manner, occasionally there were single jumpers though, if they didn\u2019t want to wait up there being all wet and exposed to the wind or if they were eager to jump before their friends got up and beat them to it, or if they were indeed there on their own to enjoy the thrill of the jump. It didn\u2019t matter in the end, the result was the same, they were jumping alone and that made them all the better target because no second pair of eyes would be looking for them right after their jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing one such jumper Meghan got into position and looked for Madeleine\u2019s signal. She was nodding, so Meghan dove and swam closer to where the jumpers usually impacted the water. She didn\u2019t have to wait more than just a few seconds before the boom-like sound reached her ears and a pillar of bubbles formed right in front of her. <br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t waste a moment, instantly she thrust forward into the bubbles and as the jumper came to a halt and started back towards the surface she intercepted. The bubbles blocked most of her vision all she could see was movement in the waster and the creamy colour of bare skin, luckily it was all she needed, opening wide and sucking in quite a bit of water she got most of the person\u2019s upper body in her mouth before she closed it around them and sucked the poor jumper into her throat, swallowing the person quickly and without much problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around before more jumpers arrived and swam away as quickly as she could. Having gotten a fair distance she approached the surface and did her best to force the water out of her stomach in the process and succeeded well enough. It didn\u2019t leave much air in her stomach either though so she quickly swallowed some down to her captive before heading back to the shore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the sea she could tell that she had chosen one of the lousiest parts to enter the water, not feeling like climbing slippery rocks with waves crashing in around her and currents pulling at her she swam further north were things turned more beach-like again although it was more rocky and the sand more like smooth gravel rather than sand, which explained the lack of people here. <br>\r\nThe detour did make her journey quite a bit longer though, taking her long enough to get back on land and head back to their camp for Madeleine not only to get back but also tiring of waiting and going up the shore to meet Meghan halfway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan could hear Madeleine\u2019s complaining gut even before she could hear her steps rustling in the gravel and figured the girl must be quite eager to get her meal into it, so Meghan started to bring the one she had caught back into her throat and edging the person slowly upwards, getting ready to feed Madeleine like some bird mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to hide as much as you can.\u201d Meghan said to Madeleine and grasped the girl by her shoulders stopping the girl from saying anything by placing her lips tight against the other girl\u2019s lips and opening the brunette\u2019s mouth with her tongue, turning the contact into a strange kiss as she started to bring the meal back up into her own mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt struck her as a little odd, she hadn\u2019t gotten a look at the meal at all, she didn\u2019t even know if it was a boy or a girl. At least she figured she\u2019d get the answer to the latter once they started sliding over her tongue.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The head entered her mouth and she could tell the hair was cut fairly short, moving her tongue around a bit to feel and keeping the meal pinned she could tell the shoulders were fairly broad and as the chest started to slide across her tongue she could feel that there was no garment there and if it was a girl then she didn\u2019t have any breasts. The narrow hips covered in shorts convinced her that it was a boy, not that it mattered, she was just mildly interested just because she didn\u2019t get to see the meal first and as it was entering Madeleine\u2019s mouth and disappearing down her throat as quickly as she brought it up she wouldn\u2019t get to see it after she had brought it back up either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert hadn\u2019t jumped the big rock before Meghan challenged him earlier, but after he had the smaller one just seemed boring, he couldn\u2019t get Sally to try it out though and as Meghan didn\u2019t return he finally went there on his own. Standing on the high rock looking down over the sheer cliff it took him quite a while to gather the courage to jump, it had really helped when Meghan had just jumped and forced him to do the same without thinking. Now he didn\u2019t have anyone to dare him or encourage him, so he stood there watching several guys make the jump before eventually doing so himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was even more thrilling than the first time, the first time he had just jumped without thinking this time he really experienced the thrill, adrenalin pumped through him, it was quite a rush and he was shaking as he climbed back up the rope, waiting for a moment once back on dry land before deciding to climb to the top and make the jump again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time he didn\u2019t hesitate, he just threw himself out over the edge almost as soon as he had climbed up there and felt the air rushing past him, chilling his wet body before the shock of the impact jolted his body and water rushed up all around him as he plunged several meters into the warm waters, finally coming to a halt and feeling the bubbles formed by the air that got carried down along with him tickle his skin as they stopped going downwards and floated back to the surface faster than he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then something dark came over him and he felt a strong pressure clamp down on him, he thought for sure a shark had attacked him, but he felt no teeth and just he started struggling the creature swallowed, to his surprise all of him. He quickly slid down its throat and entered what he knew must be its stomach. To his surprise there was ample room in there even air and he took a breath of it as his lungs were aching from holding his breath and struggling, that it was breathable surprised him a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t see anything, it was pitch black in there so he struggled at random while he sensed the creature swimming away. The initial panic eventually mixed with enough confusion so calm him down just a little bit. For one he realised he wasn\u2019t hurt, he had been swallowed whole without getting as much as a scratch or bruise. Then there was the air in the stomach and the room, what creature is large enough to have that much room inside and keep air around? A whale? He realised that the air didn\u2019t smell strange, he\u2019d have expected a vomit like smell or something and came to the conclusion that the liquid he was sitting in wasn\u2019t acids, but seawater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the stomach walls closed in on him and pinned him so he couldn\u2019t move and he felt the air and water being pushed out, this was more what he had expected from a stomach, was this the end? He thought so and was surprised again as the stomach relaxed once more and filled back up with air, even fresher than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe manoeuvred himself in the dark, beating the walls clearly didn\u2019t help him much and soon enough he found the entrance to the creature\u2019s throat, it was shut, he couldn\u2019t get the sphincter to budge, even though he several times felt it open slightly only to have air leave the stomach and then feel the wind of new air rushing in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite abruptly that he fell head over heals as the creature changed direction or posture, he fell away from the opening tumbling along the side of the stomach until he came to a halt with the opening somewhere in the darkness over his head and well out of reach. Then the stomach started swinging and regular jolts shook it. It confused him a lot and had he known that Meghan had stopped swimming, stood up and started walking instead it would have made so much more sense to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of failing to climb the walls and fruitless punching and kicking at them the walls once more closed in on him, luckily they didn\u2019t crush him and he didn\u2019t feel himself being covered in any acid, instead they rhythmically brought him upwards towards the opening he had found earlier and forced him through it. He couldn\u2019t believe what was happening, the creature was regurgitating him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms were pinned to his sides, in fact all of him was tightly held in place by the strong muscles of the throat that was slowly bringing him back up, until he finally felt the angle and surroundings change, he felt the rough taste buds of a giant tongue against his face and squirming to get some air he managed to twist his head enough to have the rough slimy surface slide along his right ear instead and managed to exchange the contents of his lungs in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more of him was brought up he tried to struggle but it was no use, the more he did the stronger the creature clamped down on him and that was not only uncomfortable, it also left him with very little air. So he stopped struggling altogether and let himself be brought up feeling the tongue of the creature move him around, if he\u2019d have to guess he\u2019d have said it was tasting him. Then he saw up ahead that the creature\u2019s mouth was open and a little bit of light sipped in breaking the total darkness he had been in. He couldn\u2019t see much of the mouth he was in, but he saw that there was another one lined up outside it, illuminated by an eerie red light as the sides of it wasn\u2019t thick enough to block out all of the light but colouring what sipped through to this red shade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat surprised him the most was that it looked like a human mouth. That was as much as he had time to take in before his head entered the second mouth and he found that it wasn\u2019t nearly as spacious as the first one, whereas his entire body had fit on the tongue of the first mouth his head alone filled the second mouth. A quick swallow forced his head into the throat at the back of the new mouth and he began struggling again. This caused the first mouth to clamp down on him again and he felt it push him out of it, effectively forcing him down the throat of this second creature. Once it started doing that the process didn\u2019t take long, just a few seconds and he felt the new creature\u2019s not so roomy stomach stretch as he was crammed into it while the lips closed around and then behind his toes before a couple of swallows forced his feet down the throat to join the rest of him inside the cramped and groaning stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was seriously scared, this stomach clearly contained acid and hardly had any air in it, it was also churning him rather painfully. When he thought that was bad enough it felt as if the churning was getting harder and like the puddle of juices he was resting in was getting deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh thanks Meghan\u2026\u201d Madeleine moaned softly after their lips had parted and she had swallowed the last of the boy down, while she rubbed her bloated gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHide girl before someone sees you.\u201d Meghan hissed between her teeth trying not to make to much sound while still emphasizing the urgency. She used her hands and body to try and cover as much as she could of the bloated girl pressing herself up against the girl\u2019s front in a strange hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m working on it! Don\u2019t pressure me! I\u2019m trying to get the techniques straight in my head\u2026\u201d Madeleine whispered back. To Meghan\u2019s relief she felt the huge ball that she was holding and also happened to be Madeleine\u2019s belly, shrink away under her touch. It felt really interesting and she tightened her embrace on the larger girl so that she could continue to feel her shrinking belly against her own until the girl she was hugging had no more of a bulge than that it could be passed for normal flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a step back and took in the view, she had never really watched a stranger eat someone before their harmless practice last night didn\u2019t really count. That there was someone in Madeleine\u2019s stomach helplessly trapped was strangely exciting. Madeleine\u2019s pleased expression as she caressed her shrinking middle certainly didn\u2019t change that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped and Meghan saw her look down at her stomach between her ample breasts and realised that Madeleine\u2019s belly was down to a size that she didn\u2019t believe even her friends would notice. Just then Madeleine stepped up to her and whispered in her ear.<br>\r\n\u201cWould you teach me how to digest him quickly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome desire in Madeleine\u2019s voice and the concept made Meghan\u2019s knees quiver, she felt herself get a little wet right there and then. The thought of the poor boy trapped in Madeleine\u2019s big gut as it quickly turned very unfriendly and turned him into quick snack appealed to something sinister inside her. She couldn\u2019t quite trust her voice so she just gave Madeleine a mischievous smile and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forward and whispering in her ear Meghan began to explain a few things, for one she was quite certain that most of the techniques would get a lot better as the girl\u2019s stomach learned to produce acids and enzymes, as many of the techniques were based on making the stomach do what it could faster where as the others were teaching it to produce new things which took time and practice. Still she had a few hints to give and then she felt the stomach rumble and squirm as it churned its meal under her grasp and she realised that she was fondling Madeleine\u2019s belly. She hadn\u2019t done it on purpose, but it had just happened, Madeleine didn\u2019t seem to mind the belly rub though and just smiled as Meghan stopped, looking a little surprised and embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis seems to take a while\u2026\u201d Madeleine said rubbing her belly. \u201cLet\u2019s head back before the girls wonder what we\u2019re doing out here.\u201d She smiled and Meghan nodded her consent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir camp was still empty, but that was probably just luck on their part so they hurried back and lay down again like nothing had ever happened. It was more pleasant this time though Madeleine liked the full feeling and Meghan found the quiet gurgling sound of the big girl\u2019s stomach soothing and she fell asleep just minutes after having put her head down on her sand-padded beach towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Meghan slept Madeline returned to her v101-book, it unfortunately didn\u2019t cover much that involved speeding up the digestion, just a few techniques, together with the couple Meghan had described to her it\u2019d have to do for now. Turning around so that she was lying on her back instead made reading harder, but it felt better and she couldn\u2019t help but gently rub her belly as she felt the boy inside slowly liquefy and drain into her intestines. While still on her back she tried to read what the book had to say on the intestines, which wasn\u2019t much. Or rather it was quite wordy in describing the reasons and workings but there were amongst all the pages of text only a couple of techniques. Clearly it was called 101 because it was basic. Frowning a little she put the book away and concentrated on enjoying the feeling of reducing the boy to mere nutrients, her body seemed to crave them and if she didn\u2019t think eating a fully grown person was quite enough she\u2019d have said that she\u2019d want more, several more\u2026 </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Abby felt a lot better now that the work was done. She and several of her classmates had come to school today despite it being a Saturday to finish their reports, they only worked in pairs of two, but seeing as the assignment had been the same there was always strength in numbers and they had agreed to go downtown for some shopping afterwards. Six girls had showed up, none of the guys seemed that enthusiastic about going shopping, she suspected that was the reason to the no-show, they\u2019d still had to finish their reports as everyone else though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill that was none of her problems anymore, she had just turned in the report and felt pretty confident that it would pass without much of a hassle, that was the big win in teaming up, other teams often saw when your thoughts had pulled you in the wrong direction and together one could weed out many if not most of the red marked pointers the report would otherwise contain when one got it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook the worries from her mind, it\u2019d be fine, in fact she\u2019d probably get an A. Now was not the time for school anyhow, now was the time for making up for having to come to school, she and the girls were going to have a great time she was sure. She gave a smile to her partner in crime who walked by her side as she thought about their upcoming shopping orgy and heard the two other girls giggling behind her as they left the school grounds and turned down the road leading through the residental blocks that separated them from the city center and all the fancy stores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to see the two girls who had ran ahead she shaded her eyes, but saw nothing. They had been in quite a hurry, both of them out of cigarettes and the only smokers around. She couldn\u2019t help but giggle and at the same time be thankful she never started smoking.<br>\r\nWell she was certain they\u2019d catch up with them later, probably finding them standing by the road further down choking on multiple smoke sticks to make up for the ones they didn\u2019t get earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noise behind her made her look over her shoulder, but she didn\u2019t see anything out of place, just a young black American woman following in their direction, so she kept on going before she realised she hadn\u2019t seen the other team and put her hand on her friend\u2019s shoulder while she stopped and turned around to look for where they went. As she did the woman behind her almost walked right into her, almost\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman\u2019s smile was the only thing Abby saw before she was staring down her throat. She hadn\u2019t stopped walking either, so Abby found herself shoved straight down into it and with a suck and swallow the woman sent her on her way down, without missing a step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strong muscles of the woman\u2019s throat somehow surrounded all of her, it seemed impossible that all of her could fit inside just the woman\u2019s throat, but then it seemed impossible to be swallowed by someone in the first place. <br>\r\nAs she was squeezed downward, toward a place she didn\u2019t want to think about, she found that she was held way too tight to even move. Her mind reeling from what was happening, she was finally shoved into a giant stomach, inflated it would seem as the walls didn\u2019t hold onto her and instead she fell a short distance. That was all she managed to register before her friend crashed down on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands grasped her from all around and helped her get up. Or as much as that was possible as not only did the walls and floor move, but they shifted and the entire stomach rose and fell and swayed as the woman who owned it kept on walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby looked around and found that people were using their cellphones as flashlights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone of us seem to be able to get a signal\u2026\u201d a boy told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scrambled for her own and so did her friend, but it was the same. \u201cNeither do I.\u201d They said in near unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around in the dim light she could tell that the six of them hadn\u2019t gone shopping, but gone to this black woman\u2019s stomach instead, all six of them were in here as were nearly a dozen others. The only positive thing she noticed was that the air seemed fine although clammy and warm, but there was no indication of any acids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorena rubbed her slight potbelly and felt the people inside it wiggle about. Just a few more and she would have done her share, a few more and she could just sit back and enjoy the feeling of them squirming in her belly for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching people had been her task because she was good at it and she wasn\u2019t half bad at hiding them either, which was pretty essential when you were catching many. She\u2019d not been the only one getting this task luckily, though it seemed only girls from Hawthorn\u2019s team had been given this task. Didn\u2019t Blainey have any girls that could chase down a crowd? They\u2019d know where to find one anyhow, which would have been useful, she on the other hand had just got to this city and not knowing where to look had tried the grab people off the street approach, which surprisingly had worked well enough. She only hoped the other girls were as successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned as her stomach complained a little, hauling this many people around sure worked up an appetite and the thought crossed her mind of digesting them all herself right then and there, but then she\u2019d have to start over and brushed the thought aside, concentrating instead on catching up to the couple that just stepped out of a house a few meters ahead of her, they seemed to be going for a car, but if she could help it she\u2019d be the one giving them a ride instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a Saturday the research ground was a pretty busy place, the buildings encircled a nice well trimmed lawn with just a couple of trees and the sun was shining. Things looked as good as they could hope for, with any luck they wouldn\u2019t have to take the party indoors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around the yard girls from Blainey\u2019s research team were busy doing something while several of the girls from Hawthorn\u2019s team stood around looking fairly lost trying to help as well as they could, but not really knowing what to do or where to find what needed to be fixed, clearly it had been a smart move to leave the catching snacks to the Hawthorn team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it were tables and chairs and music and all the usual stuff were slowly coming to place as were a couple of other none typical party items such as makeshift showers, the girls had brought water out from a few windows to fuel them what they were for Lorena couldn\u2019t tell as she stepped out the door of one of the buildings and slowly walked down the steps leading onto the lawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were starting to look pretty neat she admitted, lights were being brought up for later and she heard a click as someone just finished installing the sound system and a soft sweet beat filled her ears. No sooner did she hear half of the girls shout \u201cTurn it up!\u201d and the beat started pumping into her veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around as confused as most of the other Hawthorn girls she saw several of the girls from Blainey\u2019s team start to assemble something, she couldn\u2019t really tell what it was, looked a little like a small stage with stuff on it. Were they plugging in a pipe to it? She thought she saw a girl walking towards it with what looked for all the world like a toilet, but she didn\u2019t get to confirm that as someone grabbed her shoulder and swung her around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice, you\u2019re back already!\u201d She heard the busty blonde girl say as she felt a hand place itself on her swollen middle and stroke it. \u201cLet\u2019s get them ready for tonight shall we?\u201d The girl smiled at her and with a firm grip on her arm led her away to a place where a number of garbage cans were lined up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stopped in front of the row and the girl turned to face her again, reaching behind the cans to a table the girl grabbed a bottle and shoved it into Lorena\u2019s hand. \u201cBe careful, just take small sips, we don\u2019t want all of them to come up at once.\u201d The girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorena eyed the bottle with the yellow-orange contents sceptically. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d The girl looked surprised. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever throw people you\u2019ve swallowed back up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure I do, but we don\u2019t use some witches\u2019 brew for that.\u201d Lorena said and shoved the bottle back to the girl. \u201cI\u2019ll bring them up one at a time. You ready?\u201d She asked and saw the girl scramble to put the bottle back on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I\u2019m ready.\u201d And as soon as she had said that Daniela saw the wet brown hair of a girl\u2019s head start to emerge from Lorena\u2019s ample lips, she gave the black girl a quick kiss as she sucked the head into her own mouth and stepped away so that part of the woman\u2019s body was exposed between them. She started tearing the clothes from the girls body, with her mouth full she couldn\u2019t say anything, but Lorena seemed to get the idea and soon the naked skin of the girl was sliding down Daniela\u2019s throat as quickly as she emerged from Lorena\u2019s, her clothes ending up on the ground in tatters during the transfer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this fashion they continued to transfer people from Lorena to Daniela, sometimes it was a boy and some came up feet first, but it didn\u2019t make much difference they were all stripped naked and transferred without as much as a hitch. The only pauses came from the girls gathering up the clothes and stuff and tossing it into the trash bins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Daniela halted Lorena. \u201cDamn! How many have you got in there?!\u201d she asked forcing Lorena to swallow the girl she had in her throat back down in order to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know exactly, I had a bit over twenty to start with, I lost count\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll just take one more, then we have to find someone else to take the rest.\u201d Daniela groaned holding onto her swollen gut, she was sure that she could take all of them, but then she\u2019d be so swollen that she\u2019d waddle around like a pregnant woman. The ten people in her stomach made it bulge out as far from her skinny waist as her enormous breasts did from her chest and she was front heavy enough under normal circumstances. Admittedly she was impressed, this dark skinned lady hadn\u2019t sported as big a belly as the one she had now, when she had fist come back from her hunting and according to the woman she hadn\u2019t even transferred half of them yet. Daniela thought she was good at managing a crowd, that\u2019s why she usually had to work as storage during these parties and it was also the reason that she\u2019d been put in charge of the clean-up transfers, but clearly this ebon damsel was much better than her at this, she didn\u2019t even need the vomit juice, that made things a whole lot easier too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela swallowed one last time and felt the girl settle in her stomach, before helping the girl if front of her gather up the scattered clothes and items at their feet and shoving it into a trash bin.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d She excused herself and extended a hand. \u201cI guess I was so busy thinking about what had to be done to remember introducing myself. I\u2019m Daniela.\u201d She said and was rewarded with the other girl\u2019s full lips spreading into a big smile as she took the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t fret it. I\u2019m Lorena.\u201d She said and then looked down on the slight bulge in her smooth ebon belly. \u201cSo who should I give these to then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d Daniela started as she looked around. \u201c\u2026There seems to be a few girls from your team that doesn\u2019t have anything to do, if one of them is half as good as you they\u2019d be able to hold the rest.\u201d Turning back to Lorena she added. \u201cSo you tell me, you know them better than I. Come to think of it, would you mind helping me clean all the catches up? There are after all more girls out hunting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure I\u2019ll help!\u201d Lorena smiled and looked around. Daniela was right there were several girls standing around doing nothing, she noticed Sophia was one of them and got the girl\u2019s attention as she walked on over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised.\u201d Lorena stated with all sincerity. \u201cWhy weren\u2019t you one of the hunters Sophia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Latino beauty struck a pose for her and smiled. \u201cHonestly I\u2019m not that good at it, I tend to draw too much attention to be able to snatch anyone.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t bragging, Sophia was the type with a long slender face, hard eyebrows, piercing eyes, a slender uppity nose and pouty lips. But despite her striking and pretty face her body was more enticing. <br>\r\nLike many Latinos she has a thicker build despite not having any fat that didn\u2019t look good on her, fairly broad shoulders curving into a slender waist make for a nice chest topped with ample enough breasts even if they wouldn\u2019t pass for large. Then there\u2019s the other side of her waist, wide hips endowed with a large firm butt that\u2019s attached to thick shapely thighs making her a prime example of Latin curves and beauty. She does indeed draw the attention of many around her, which to her dismay means that she can\u2019t eat anyone until those around her are limited to those going down and her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see how that might be true.\u201d Daniela admitted a little taken, but forced a smile on her lips, she shouldn\u2019t be jealous, she couldn\u2019t complain on her own looks and the whole idea of this was to make friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re here, we kind of need your help getting the snacks naked. Come with us.\u201d Lorena said and headed back to the trash bins with Sophia and Daniela in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them soon had the last people stripped naked and transferred to Sophia\u2019s stomach and to Daniela\u2019s dismay she realised that Sophia was at least as good as Lorena as the bulge she got wasn\u2019t large enough to take any appeal away from her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also came to the conclusion that it was handier to have Sophia carry the snacks than Daniela seeing as she didn\u2019t need purge juice to get them back up, making the transfer was a little tricky though as Daniela literally vomited them up instead of regurgitating them in the controlled fashion Lorena had done, she also got several up at a time instead of one after the other which also made things messier and more hectic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough all twenty-four people that Lorena had initially caught were trapped inside Sophia\u2019s bulging belly.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go and sit down then.\u201d Sophia said and looked for an out of the way place to sit. \u201cSee you girls later.\u201d She smiled as Daniela and Lorena waved a girl over who had just returned from hunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela felt a little intimidated by the girl, especially as she herself had Barbie like traits, but this girl pulled it off even better, she was taller, had a more athletic build and was at least as pretty, so it was with some satisfaction Daniela noticed that at least she had the larger breasts, not by overly much, but on her smaller frame the difference looked greater, hers looks huge while Lauren as the younger woman was called only looks like she has large ones because of her taller frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they moved the catch from Lauren to Lorena and then when naked back to Lauren again the booze had finally started flowing, Blainey\u2019s team had managed to acquire more alcohol than Lorena had ever seen and they were still bringing in various containers containing a clear liquid that she was certain was more pure alcohol. At one table they were mixing it with various sodas to make strong sweet drinks that left the table as quickly as they could make them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of alcohol\u2026\u201d Lorena said and motioned towards the booze tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll need it. I take it you haven\u2019t tried getting hammered after learning how to swallow people?\u201d Daniela said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, come to think of it, I\u2019ve had quite a bit to drink, but it\u2019s never really gotten me tipsy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell there you see. Then there\u2019s the fact that one tends to sober up quite a bit when you digest a meal, it sort of cleans up your system somehow. Trust me, you\u2019ll see some serious heavy drinking tonight, especially once we start digging in on the snacks.\u201d A smile spread across the blonde\u2019s lips, clearly she was looking forward to at least one of those things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was the next girl to come in with a catch, she sported as large a bulge as Lauren had and Daniela felt relieved when she had handed them over to Lorena, with her body back to normal, she could see that this girl was more human, an average smooth gentle build and a pretty face made this brunette quite attractive but not as intimidating as the other two she had just met from Hawthorn\u2019s team even if she was just as tall as Lauren, at least she had just carried ten people and not over thirty like Lauren had, once stripped she got them back too, which meant that they were only waiting for one more girl to return with her catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela and Lorena decided to get something to drink in the meantime and Lorena was surprised when she got her drink, they weren\u2019t fooling around, by Daniela\u2019s earlier tone she had expected fairly strong but sweet drinks and that it was, but she hadn\u2019t expected to get it served in a bucket rather than a glass. Then Daniela bumped her bucket into hers in a cheers-like manner.<br>\r\n\u201cBottoms up!\u201d The blonde challenged and tipped her head back as she emptied the bucket down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorena was a bit sceptical, but several girls started to cheer her on and she copied Daniela\u2019s feat and handed the bucket back to one of the bartenders who took all of five seconds to refill it. A little daunted by a new bucket-load of alcohol she took her bucket and stepped away before she was coaxed into downing it again, fearing a bit how the first bucket would affect her once it kicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long after that that Emily returned, another blonde Barbie-girl Daniela noted, much the same build as Lauren, though noticeably shorter, her long straight hair was really pale blonde too instead of Lauren\u2019s auburn, just as pale as Daniela\u2019s own long wavy blonde hair. Emily didn\u2019t look like she had been very successful. She did sport a bulge, but nothing as big as any of the other girls, cleaned and counted they made for another sixteen, which by Daniela\u2019s standard was actually pretty good, all in all they had at least twice as many snacks as she had counted on getting which she really couldn\u2019t complain about, perhaps they wouldn\u2019t need to raid the store rooms\u2026heck who was she kidding, emptying out the store rooms was one of the best parts of a party\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mingling had started quite a while ago, not long after the booze arrived actually, but once they were done with the snacks it was actually beginning to seem like a real party, dancing and chatting everywhere. Lorena went to see if Sophia needed a hand with the snacks seeing as she couldn\u2019t really drink anything with them in there, but she found that they had already helped each other, by trading them back and forth, a rather intimate ordeal that loosened the girls up all the more. Lorena got a few \u201cYou go girl!\u201d, \u201cWhoohoo!\u201d\u2019s and \u201cUse more tongue!\u201d when she took the snacks from Emily so that she could get something to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sun having set Lorena was decidedly having a good time and was getting decidedly tipsy. She had traded snacks all evening but only with her own team, she tried a couple of times with girls from the other team but they only gave her a kiss or only accepted one snack, it took her a while before it got through to her intoxicated brain what she had heard earlier, the word being spread around that holding the snacks was a task for those that didn\u2019t need the vomit potion. It made sense enough even if her ability to determine what made sense had become seriously impaired, she hadn\u2019t even reflected over the fact that some girls had actually accepted one of the snacks when they weren\u2019t accepting all of them. As a result there were fewer and fewer snacks being passed around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point Lorena noticed that girls had started gathering at one end, getting closer she could tell that many lights had been turned in one direction, illuminating a spot fairly effectively, people were standing in the light, but there was too much in the way for her to see so she went over and joined the crowd making a semi circle around the stage like structure she had seen being put together earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting closer she could hear the crowd cheering someone on and when she got close enough to see she saw a girl walk down from the stage as she received a small applause. Still on the stage stood a smiling Sophia, idly caressing her middle, which didn\u2019t look like it was bulging much anymore.<br>\r\nThen another girl bounced up on the stage and bowed to the spectators. While she did Sophia regurgitated a girl who protesting as much as she could, looked like she was so tired that if Sophia hadn\u2019t held her upright in front of herself then the girl would collapse onto the stage floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeating her foggy mind Lorena  tried to remember the girl\u2019s name, they had spoken earlier, she was a joyful energetic girl, that smile of hers quite contagious and Lorena couldn\u2019t help but smirk as she watched the athletic girl bounce across the scene then up into the air and come down on the struggling woman in Sophia\u2019s grip and with a graceful rotation in the air she twisted Sophia\u2019s arms out of the way and got her feet back on the floor while sending the meal\u2019s feet skywards, but a swallow sent them down her throat and removed the woman from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot quite Lorena corrected herself as she watched Evelyn, that was her name, looking quite pleased and rubbing her slightly bulging belly, the music drowned out the noises coming from it and had it not, then the spectators would have, but she could tell that the girl was busy digesting the snack and slowly the bulge move lower until it all but disappeared and Evelyn\u2019s belly looked flat but trim once more between her halter top and low cut pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Lorena found herself asking, not quite realizing that she\u2019d spoken aloud until the woman next to her leaned in closer so she wouldn\u2019t have to shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who came up with it, but this is sort of a tradition we have. Well since we can\u2019t binge out, this is sort of a way of making the most of the snacks we can get our hands on and at the same time provide\u2026ehh\u2026entertainment\u2026and a friendly competition. Though most just try to better their own time. Evelyn for one, I doubt she\u2019s trying to beat someone else\u2019s time, she\u2019s not that good, though I must say she probably puts on the best show. I just love the way her belly bulges and then shrinks away as she digests\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I see\u2026\u201d Lorena cut off. \u201cBut what\u2019s she doing now?\u201d She asked as Evelyn was pulling her pants down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s letting the snack back out again.\u201d Patricia said and Lorena noticed that Evelyn had taken a few steps towards the back of the stage where the toilet had been placed. \u201cYou see Tracey there?\u201d Patricia pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorena looked but didn\u2019t see anything at first then she saw a brunette at the back of the stage behind the toilet. The lights didn\u2019t illuminate that area so she wasn\u2019t easy to spot especially not when you\u2019d been looking at the very bright part of the stage. \u201cUm..yeah, now I do\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she takes the time and makes sure the snacks are properly digested so that people don\u2019t cheat, plus if you don\u2019t digest properly then things can get really messy and this is pretty borderline nasty as it is.\u201d Patricia said. \u201dOh, she won\u2019t reveal the time to anyone but the one who\u2019s time it is.\u201d Seeing Lorena\u2019s still puzzled look Patricia added. \u201cThe time in question is from the time the first of the snack goes into the mouth until the last of it comes back out. So I don\u2019t really envy her back there by the toilet\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saw that Evelyn was done as she was giving a bow and heading for the steps.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give it a try?\u201d Patricia said and gestured for Lorena to head up to the stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, maybe later. I still have a few passengers.\u201d The dark girl smiled and patted the soft curve in her middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, didn\u2019t see that, but you should try it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Lorena said sceptically. \u201cBut now it\u2019s your turn\u2026\u201d She added with a challenging grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026well\u2026\u201d Patricia tried to avoid getting up there, taking a crap in public was more her idea of humiliation than fun, even if the rest was quite enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I thought you\u2019d show me how it\u2019s done so I don\u2019t make a fool of myself up there.\u201d Lorena challenged. \u201cJust trying to get me up there? I thought you said this was fun.\u201d She added, the booze making her bold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright!\u201d Patricia blushed, she couldn\u2019t be accused of being sober either, which probably had something to do with her actually heading up the stage, getting a little confused look from Evelyn, but it changed into a supportive smile pretty quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one of the dark corners of the courtyard the buildings made, a tall blonde girl had come out of a door. Her eyes had quickly fixated themselves on the nearby stage while she absentminded slowly let the door close behind her. What were they doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stage wasn\u2019t far, she was just a dozen or so meters from one of its edges though the half circle of people around it was in-between. Standing on top of the stairs she was at the same level and actually had a pretty good view, she probably didn\u2019t need it tough, as she was taller than most, but the action had her attention captured and feet immobilized as a result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as a young woman took engulfed the head of a man that was being held in place by another woman and then sucked the rest of him down her throat. She watched as the girl cheered on caressed her belly, obviously she was digesting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes left the woman\u2019s flat belly for a moment and got a glimpse of the woman who had held the man. Wasn\u2019t that Sophia? She was certain it was and almost started over there before she noticed that the woman digesting the man was unbuttoning her pants and sliding them off as she sat down on what she realized was a toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later she stood back up and the tall blonde watching noticed a woman behind the toilet with a stopwatch in her hand say something to the woman who had just given the man the grand tour and came to the conclusion that this was some sort of competition, she just had to try and started down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotion in the corner of her eye caught Tamara\u2019s attention, turning her head she saw a young blonde well dressed, in a tight white top covered by a short stylish white jacket and short matching white skirt with long slits at the sides. She was dressed for party, but she looked way too young to be part of Hawthorn\u2019s research team, clearly this was a student, if she was old enough for that even, that had happened upon their party. She looked absolutely delicious, she may be young, but she had all the curves and Tamara felt herself salivating as she hurried to intercept the interloper before someone else beat her to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl had hardly left the stairs before Tamara was rushing at her, she noticed that the girl was quite a lot bigger than she had thought, but she determined that that only meant that there\u2019d be more of her to enjoy as she opened her mouth wide to engulf the girl, figuring that she could use both of their momentums to get her down as the girl was hurrying in her direction as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith just the final step in-between them Tamara opened her mouth as wide as she could, to her surprise she found herself looking down a throat and the next second how a mouth closed all around her, leaving just her feet sticking out, she tried to struggle and kick but if was futile, only her feet fluttered about. <br>\r\nIt took her a couple of seconds of feeling the girls brisk pace as she walked, before she realised that the girl was just holding her there, she hadn\u2019t been swallowed, what was up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding the edge of the semi-circle of people the blonde with long quick strides made her way to the stage and with a single leap jumped on top of it and made her way to the Latino girl sanding in the spotlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorena noted how the girls from Blainey\u2019s team all tensed up at once confused by this sudden intrusion, then got all the more confused as most she and most of the girls from her own team recognised the girl, \u201cHaley?\u201d she wasn\u2019t alone wondering what she was doing here. The word had a calming effect on Blainey\u2019s team though as they noticed that their new friends seemed to recognise the intruder and not be alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophia stood on the scene and gave the tall blonde girl a puzzled look. \u201cWhat are you doing here Haley?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley pointed to the wiggling feet sticking out of her mouth and mumbled \u201cMuh tuuhrn!\u201d around them, which seemed to make sense to Sophia\u2019s tipsy mind, so as she gave the girl an understanding nod, the twitching feet were replaced by a sinister smile as Haley swallowed Tamara down, she then accompanied the bulge travelling down her neck with her right hand, sliding it down her chest even though the bulge was gone and then down her stomach and further down her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her finger dance across it, not that many of her drunken spectators understood that she was still trying to outline the position of her snack as the girl made her way though the depths of the young blonde\u2019s guts. As her finger passed low enough to leave her bare midriff and slide across the front of her skirt more girls got the idea and when she slid her finger back up again in what could only be the outline of her ascending large intestine most had got the point and that\u2019s when she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of quick steps took her to the toilet, standing with her feet wide apart she pulled down her panties, stretching them to the limit, then leaning over so that her bum was over the bowl, lifting the back of the skirt she gave the girl back there a good view as she tensed and the tightly shut sphincter between her spread cheeks began to open and hard packed solid not even foot long turd emerged and dropped into the water below, leaving her butt as clean as ever and not even making a smear where it had impacted the porcelain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly pulled her panties back up and adjusted her skirt before turning to the baffled brunette behind her. \u201cSo what\u2019s my time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Tracy started, this was the first time someone had flashed her like that and had she really digested that quickly? \u201c\u2026rules say that you have to let all of her out.\u201d And who was this white clad blonde anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was all of her!\u201d Haley said a little miffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a small\u2026well\u2026\u201d Tracey said and looked into the bowl. Seriously she couldn\u2019t have reduced a girl to that little thing? \u201cYou\u2019re sure that\u2019s all of her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley took a look as well, \u201cWell yeah, she wasn\u2019t that big to begin with\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a look at her stop watch, Tracy realized she hadn\u2019t even started it in the first place. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t get your time.\u201d She said with some reluctance as she looked the girl over, she was as trim as Evelyn, only she was a head taller than herself and she\u2019d just not only beat their record time, that much she could tell without a stopwatch, but she hadn\u2019t left the normal load, no just a small turd was all that remained\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho the hell was this girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYoung woman, get your ass over here this instant!\u201d A voice boomed, making itself heard over music and all the other noises, even into the most drunken brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley wasn\u2019t the only one who turned towards the source, but she was the only one blushing and the only one looking straight into the piercing eyes of Professor Hawthorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I told you not to go out tonight!\u201d The older woman said with her arms firmly crossed in front of her as she watched her daughter make her way over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re leaving now!\u201d She said and motioned for Haley to step through the door through which they had both come, once the Amazonian blonde had entered the building the professors voice took on a wholly new character. \u201cSorry for the interruption girls, we won\u2019t bother you anymore.\u201d She said and left after her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterruption, yeah that it was, most of the girls sobered up quite a bit after the commotion, many had the same questions as Daniela who grabbed hold of Lorena.<br>\r\n\u201cWho, what?!\u201d She said, looking stupefied into the depths of the brown girl\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe woman who yelled was our Professor Hawthorn\u2026\u201d Lorena started. \u201cAnd the blonde is her daughter Haley\u2026 I haven\u2019t seen her\u2026 um\u2026 put up such a display before though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the pause almost all the girls went for another round of drinks\u2026or two\u2026after which the party started to get back on its feet again, after a while they even resumed their weird game although with a smaller audience, at one time or another most of the girls went up there though, if for no other reason than that they were pressured into at least trying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on!\u201d Patricia ushered and a few girls around her giving her the typical peer pressure \u2018you have to do it\u2019 kind of looks with many motioning with a jerk of their head for her to go to the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorena still wasn\u2019t sure about this, Patricia and Daniela had managed to get her quite tipsy, so she stumbled as she tried to shake her head, but luckily Patricia caught her and gave her a helpful push back to her feet, which strategically also brought her a few feet closer to the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Patricia complained \u201cyou made me do it, now it\u2019s your turn\u2026\u201d playing the guilt-card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Lorena sighed and stumbled towards the stage as she was cheered on her decision applauded by the girls who\u2019d been busy coaxing her into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stairs brought her to a halt, but then she stumbled forward and didn\u2019t get her feet back under herself until she came to a wobbly stop well onto the stage.<br>\r\nA hand grasped her arm and turned her around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you up for this?\u201d A blurry girl asked. Lorena tried to focus on her and rubbed her eyes in the bright light, her stomach answered for her with a demanding growl. \u201cOh, I guess you are then.\u201d The girl smiled and let go of Lorena as she stared bringing a snack up her throat for the ebon woman to dine upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorena had just had a snack early on to sate her initial hunger, but carrying lots of people around all day had made her burn off a lot more than that and when she had started being really reluctant to go up on stage Patricia had helped some in keeping the snacks away and the drinks coming\u2026with the current result, with Lorena on the stage she had avoided and hungry enough to go through with what was supposed to happen on the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes had adjusted somewhat to the light as the other girl on the stage, whom she realized was Lauren, thrust a limp boy at her, probably in his early twenties and barely even awake as he was totally spent, he managed to look more confused than afraid as he hung there from Lauren\u2019s outstretched hands, ready for Lorena to take him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady?\u201d Her tall colleague and friend wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Lorena smiled, her stomach letting out another grumble in confirmation and she reached out and took hold of the guy, lifting him carefully from Lauren\u2019s hands and off the ground, the extra off-center weight he provided doing little good for her footing. A quick reaction from her friend brought a stabilizing hand to her shoulder, but not more as Lauren didn\u2019t want to be in the way for anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u2026\u201d Lorena managed as she shifted her gaze from her meal to her friend and back again. Then decided she should probably start\u2026speed was it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t been fast anywhere on the stage and her condition was probably to blame, she was still determined though and shoved the guy\u2019s head into her mouth, cramming him in quickly with the accuracy of your average drunken, spun around and blindfolded pi\u00f1ata-basher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst she shoved his head into her windpipe\u2026which caused her to cough him back up, but she quickly crammed him back in again in an arm over back, no control sort of way and managed to almost choke on him again and then possibly gag a reflex she shouldn\u2019t have but which her drunken fortitude managed to overcome and with a few strained swallows she managed to push the guy in and back until he finally came into a workable position and started down her throat bottoms first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat he wasn\u2019t in the shape that he could bring his feet over his head just meant that despite his body\u2019s reluctance to comply the ebon woman eating him was strong enough to force him into that position anyhow and he got the most uncomfortable stretching session ever out of the deal as her muscles rhythmically worked him down her throat until he finally entered her starved out and alcohol sterilized stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach actually smelled quite nice when he arrived, the alcohol having washed out any unpleasantries while the fruit sodas had added a new sweet fruity smell to the place.<br>\r\nAs her came to a halt from his drop and tumble down the side of her stomach walls, they started to press in on him, the air leaving quickly and the pleasant smells leaving with it, being replaced instead by a nauseating one and the cause of it he found out hurt a lot. Luckily not for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorena couldn\u2019t help it, she burped, bringing a hand up to her mouth reflexively. \u201cSorry, must have been someone I ate\u2026\u201d She excused, causing a few giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach felt great for once, she hadn\u2019t realized how hungry she had really been and getting to wrap her stomach around him and squeeze the yumminess out of him felt great, but as she pushed his liquid form into her starved intestines she realized that sucking the goodies out of his dwindling form was even better and she closed her eyes to revel in the feeling of having him sate her hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer greedy guts being all too pleased to drain him both quickly and thoroughly like she wanted them to and she found out as he slowly ceased to give her any more nutrients that she really wouldn\u2019t mind seconds and hurried him the rest of the way though her intestines who in vain tried to get something from him as he passed on by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found as she opened her eyes that Lauren had guided her to the toilet, already there she fumbled with her pants and sat down only there to find out what Daniela had said earlier, she was still tipsy, but the fuel from the buy had clearly helped her body to clear much of the poison out of her system and she felt refreshed as well which also aided her awareness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting there taking a crap she felt like having gone into one of those portable toilet and start her business only to look up and find that someone has taken the top off. That she looked around and saw at least a dozen faces smiling at her didn\u2019t really help either. They weren\u2019t laughing at her though, but rather cheering her on, which made the feeling all the more unreal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her sudden stage-fright she forced herself to finish, realising that she sooner she was done, the sooner she\u2019d be out of there. So she pushed hard hurried to wipe and got up and flushed, in doing so finding herself eye to eye with a confident brunette who was giving her a supportive smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad,\u201d the brunette who had been keeping a too close for comfort eye on what she had been up to said before she leaned forward and whispered a time in her ear. It took Lorena a moment before she remembered what she\u2019d been told earlier and gave the brunette a nod, signalling that she had heard the message, before she hurried off the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela and Patricia caught her in a hug before she had the chance to get very far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did great!\u201d They both said, not helping with her embarrassment, Lorena felt like her face was red, but luckily because of her dark complexion she wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl handed her a drink, which she emptied quickly, she cold beverage helping her to calm down some and accompanied by the other girls giggles they made their way further from the stage as other girls were being talked into going up on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow it wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d Daniela queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding? It was horrible, snack excluded though.\u201d Lorena giggled. \u201cI know why you prefer just to watch Pat.\u201d She said to the other girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not much of a spotlight person\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I just remembered I forgot to ask. What\u2019s a good time?\u201d Lorena said looking from girl to girl. \u201cYeah I remember you said you don\u2019t make times public, but you have a record, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, I suppose someone\u2019s got to have the best time, I could ask Tracey, not sure if that\u2019s public either, though perhaps she could tell us the time, even if she keeps the name secret.\u201d Patricia said and started towards the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah you go ask her, now I\u2019m curious too\u2026\u201d Daniela called as Patricia went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what did she say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh\u2026totally not the answer I was expecting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe said she didn\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know? I thought she kept tract and was good at it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m sure she is, but she said that that blonde girl earlier\u2026 Haley was it? \u2026totally shattered the old record, but she didn\u2019t get the time as she wasn\u2019t prepared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that was pretty fast wasn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party kept on going and most of the girls had a great time. <br>\r\nIt was a little later that Lorena noticed that the stage wasn\u2019t the only place with a bit of a gathering. Closer to the main music setup there was another crowd where disco lights hanging from the trees flashed on and off in many colours, it looked like they\u2019ve made themselves a dance floor, as she was already groovin\u2019 to the beat, she motioned for the girls to come with her, which they did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? I thought Lauren was on the stage?\u201d Daniela pointed as the three girls made it into the thick of the dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah, from behind I guess it can be a little hard to tell her and Gemma apart.\u201d Lorena shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Daniela acknowledged just as Gemma changed direction enabling Daniela to see that Gemma had the same build as Lauren and hair, but perhaps a little more softness to her and definitely a totally different face, there was no mistaking the two from the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with that?!\u201d Lorena shouted as she pointed towards another black girl being pestered by several girls from Blainey\u2019s team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that could be fun, stay here with Daniela, I\u2019ll be right back, hopefully with some good news.\u201d Patricia said and was off, heading towards the commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough it didn\u2019t take long before she was back, waving to get Lorena\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you want to miss this.\u201d She said and Lorena heard someone change the music and gave Patricia a confused look. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty good at dancing, just watch.\u201d Patricia said as she got out of the way and gave Lorena another helpful push in the right direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see a bit of a circle forming around the other black girl, she hadn\u2019t seen her before, but it was obvious that she was from Blainey\u2019s team. The girl was slowly warming up the dance, with slow deliberate and sensual movements and Lorena took the opportunity, as the lights allowed it between flashes, to take a better look at the girl. <br>\r\nShe was of average height, well fitted with nice soft curves, not overly busty, as few black girls are, but endowed with nice thick enough build to give her good shape above as well as below the waist, a flat but soft belly left exposed between a glittery pink top and a matching tight skirt which showed off her strong thick legs and held her bum in an enticing embrace, a bum quite big, but not the ghetto booty type that\u2019s just \u2018out there\u2019.<br>\r\nShe had let her hair loose so it hid her face often enough, but it wasn\u2019t a face that needed hiding, like her body it was smooth and soft at the same time, those eyes as captivating as those full lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround Katrina everyone was still moving to the music as she started her thing. The girls had come to her begging she give the other team a bit of a show. She had told them that she was too drunk to do that, but they wouldn\u2019t stop pestering her, so eventually she gave in and with the alcohol in her body she was more than bold enough to give it a good shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no pole here to use as she often did\u2026but there was always people, a good enough substitute and often more fun, she admitted as she reached out into her audience and pulled a blonde girl in with her, she didn\u2019t recognise her, so it was probably one from the other team then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl reacted like she wanted to too, standing stiff and confused as Katrina started circling around her slowly bumping and grinding in a most erotic form of dance, which drew much cheer from the crowd. Yeah using people will work great she decided, it wasn\u2019t the first time she did that, but she was more used to a pole, it wasn\u2019t like she could jump up and do pole-dance tricks on a person though, but moving the crowd around was always fun and useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she exchanged the slightly embarrassed blonde for another member of the audience as she started getting into her routine, she had to get warm and feel the music and just as important the light. She moved about within her circle, bringing her human pole with her and struck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina\u2019s field of study was catching prey without getting caught, which meant that she was one of the two girls who supplied Blainey\u2019s team with most of their test subjects. This dance of hers was something she had started a long time ago, she always liked dancing and not long after she started working for Blainey she came up with the idea of dancing while sampling her audience, preferably without getting caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time she had performed this with her friends which was why the girls from Blainey\u2019s team were standing behind the ones from Hawthorn\u2019s team, saying that they had already seen it so many times that it was only appropriate if those who hadn\u2019t got the better seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it were Katrina timed it perfectly, she struck when the lights weren\u2019t on her and most people\u2019s attention were on her lower body anyhow, she also took the opportunity to change pole which shifted the audience about enough for no one to notice that one girl disappeared. In the blink of an eye Katrina\u2019s mouth was around her torso and with a strange sucking she was pulled straight into the dancing beauty\u2019s throat and sent on her way to the stomach below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina pulled this stunt off several times more, before she let her human pole go and started working her way into the circle, grinding and groping as she went, causing less people to see her and shattering the circle a bit, this enabled her to snag another couple of girls before she went into the middle again and started dancing more vigorously, using all the circle in a much quicker fashion, though nearly as sensually as before. It was harder, but even during this she managed to catch a couple without those around catching her in the act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a nice finale, so she started to end the dance, something that didn\u2019t sit too well with the crowd, or rather the girls from Blainey\u2019s team, who could tell that she was ending the show. So they tried their best to cheer her on and the few girls from Hawthorn\u2019s team also joined in the cheering, that was, the few of them not currently trapped and tossed around inside the dancing girl\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lorena watched the girl, she could move, in fact she could most likely get a job as an exotic dancer should she want to. Though she wasn\u2019t good enough to win any prizes, that Lorena was fairly certain about. Still, Lorena found it pretty funny to watch the reactions of the girls she pulled in with her, to use as human dance poles of sorts. Some were embarrassed and others were enjoying themselves to the fullest, in various ways\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorena didn\u2019t notice that girls went missing, not even when Serena, who had stood next to her became the next dance pole and Gemma who\u2019d been on the other side of Serena disappeared.<br>\r\nThe cute dark haired brunette laughed as the thicker dancing girl swung her around with little effort, enjoying the short while she remained the black girl\u2019s toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as the dancing girl let go of Serena she didn\u2019t look for another, or perhaps she wanted a specific one Lorena pondered as the pink glitter disappeared into the audience and danced its way between them. Lorena saw that she was making her way around the dissolving circle as people moved out of position to see what Katrina was up to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorena tried the same to some extent but figured she\u2019d come to her soon enough as she was heading her way. <br>\r\nSome girls seemed to make room for the dancer, while others just about humped her as she passed, though the dancer groped quite a bit herself, not to mention bumping and grinding that juicy behind of hers in to this girl and that.<br>\r\nAnd soon enough she came by Lorena, enticing the girls nearby and Lorena awaited her turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was taken totally by surprise when everything suddenly went black and a strong suction enveloped her, it wasn\u2019t until she felt throat muscles all around her, squeezing her on down, that she realised that she\u2019d been swallowed. By whom she wondered and realised that she\u2019d been all the way into the throat before the girl who ate her had even swallowed for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey south didn\u2019t take long though and when she pushed into the air filled stomach she found it pretty filled with girls as well and as a result pretty cramped. The constant swaying of the stomach and stirring of its contents made it not only horrible difficult for Lorena to get back to the sphincter, leading back to the throat, before she was tossed away as a result of the movements, but it also made it pretty clear that this was the stomach of the dancing girl. She had to admit, she was quite impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen clearly the dance changed and as it did so were the contents inside the stomach tossed around all the more, with all the movement Lorena almost didn\u2019t notice when new girls arrived, almost, it got a little more cramped each time, which felt almost good when the dancer was moving about this much, as it lessened the stirring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she settled down to a slower pace and eventually stopped, Lorena could hear the cheer she got from her audience and the applause as she bowed.<br>\r\nShe got quite concerned though when she felt the girl\u2019s hands start rubbing her stomach, clearly the dancer had put on a bit of a belly from swallowing all these girls, now came the question; what she intended to do with all of them? They were too entangled to escape, unless she gave them some serious time in which to do it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina thought it was always nice to have a stomach this full, though it was something special this time. Normally her prey could hardly move when this many were piled onto one another, not to mention that it had to be pretty cramped in there, but that was the delight of this occasion. The girls in her stomach were obviously strong enough not to care much about either each others\u2019 weight nor the crampness, though it wasn\u2019t like her stomach was trying to churn them\u2026 that might hamper their movements some more. As it were though, their milling about inside her stomach felt wonderful, a satisfying meal that could really squirm\u2026not something a girl got every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she realized as she felt small hands starting to force their way into her oesophagus that she couldn\u2019t keep them in there much longer and reached for a flask of orange liquid. The horrible substance making her retch almost as soon as it hit her tongue, still she forced herself to get a decent amount down and felt her upset gut forcing the girls back up her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt pretty undignified to stand there and cough up girl after girl in a big slimy pile and she hoped they weren\u2019t too pissed about her little trick on them, doubtless she\u2019d ruined all of their make-ups and all of their clothes were soaked by her different internal slimy substances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it were no-one seemed to hold a grudge, at least they didn\u2019t showed it, perhaps that was just the same way they didn\u2019t show the relief of her not trying to digest them, which at least Lorena hid fairly well as she tried to laugh the experience off, poking both Daniela and Patricia in the ribs, making sure to leave a smear of goop behind on their clothing in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, girls, you tricked me right into that one!\u201d She laughed and quickly dried off her forearm on Daniela\u2019s back before the girl had time to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Why you do that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly fair, you covered me in the stuff. I reckon a third of this is yours...\u201d Lorena said and managed to scoop up half a fistful of mucus or something, which she then flung at Patricia, resulting in a splat on the girls thigh. \u201c\u2026and a third is yours\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop that!\u201d Patricia chuckled as she failed to avoid the missile and noticed how Lorena was collecting slime for a second one. \u201cThere are better ways to get that stuff off you know\u2026\u201d She said as she ducked for cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorena had to admit that despite a couple of unnerving moments, the party clearly was a success and she stayed well into the night.</span></div></div>",

They\u2019d talked about getting together for something to eat later, but Meghan had declined, saying that she had to catch up on her homework and pointing out that none of the places served her favourite dish anyway. Which had brought a chuckle from Madeline and caused Annette to bite her lip with the other girls trying to let it slide while avoiding to think about what she really meant. That she really ate people was a little unnerving for them and they were glad they hadn\u2019t actually seen her do it so they could at least try and convince themselves that she was just joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the evening turned out, she didn\u2019t do all that much studying, just a little, mostly she just relaxed, even so it turned fairly late before she hit the sack and was busy sleeping in when her cell phone buzzed her awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d Meghan queried, too dazed by sleep to be annoyed by the rude awakening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t wake you did I?\u201d she heard a semi-familiar voice ask at the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you did\u2026\u201d Meghan realized and looked at her alarm clock which glowed with angry red numbers in the gloomy room, the blinds and curtains keeping most of the light from the bright day outside from seeping in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that, didn\u2019t think you\u2019d sleep until noon\u2026\u201d The girl on the other end apologised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh\u2026well neither did I\u2026\u201d Meghan admitted and rubbed the sleep from her eyes as she swung her feet out of bed. \u201c\u2026I guess I should thank you for not letting me sleep the day away\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood to hear. I suppose this means you haven\u2019t had breakfast yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026I guess it does\u2026\u201d Meghan answered, a bit confused by the odd self answering question. \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026um\u2026I was wondering if we could grab something to eat together\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is this?\u201d Meghan, wondered now that she\u2019d gotten to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadeline\u2026I got your number from Sally\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, need help do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah\u2026I hate to bother you, but I really think I do\u2026 can you help me again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026well\u2026\u201d Meghan said and rubbed her empty stomach. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right, I need to catch something anyway, so I guess you can tag along\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d Madeline almost screamed in Meghan\u2019s ear, relieved that the girl would help her. \u201c\u2026so where should we meet? At school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026\u201d Meghan interrupted before Madeline had time to list any more options. \u201cJust give me half an hour will you and I\u2019ll meet you at the south entrance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline kept a hand on her stomach, trying to calm her angry middle. She had thought Robert would fill her up but after eating him she hadn\u2019t felt that full, she had been quite amazed that she had actually eaten a whole person, her mind couldn\u2019t quite accept that that wouldn\u2019t be enough. After she\u2019d digested him though she had realized that she could have gone for seconds and thirds as well\u2026 by that time she didn\u2019t want to bother Meghan about it though seeing as how reluctant she\u2019d been the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting him out had been something different too, she was a big girl and she had eaten a lot before, though she couldn\u2019t remember needing to flush twice more than a few times earlier and certainly not\u2026she had lost count\u2026 there had been quite a lot of him going out, right then she was pretty glad she\u2019d just eaten one boy, even if her belly told her otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she awoke this morning she\u2019d felt great, better than ever, there\u2019d been a spring in her step and she felt like she\u2019d lost a lot of weight, a look in the mirror made her doubt that though and the evil bathroom scale had told her that she had rather gained a pound. That didn\u2019t change the fact that she felt lighter. <br>\r\nWhat she didn\u2019t know was that she had in fact grown a bit stronger as her body had put her meal to good use and was begging her for more building material, giving her a gnawing hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline had ignored it for a while, then she\u2019d eaten a bowl of cereals\u2026her hunger had reacted as if it had been insulted, so she finished the whole package and what was left of a loaf of bread. It hadn\u2019t helped and a couple of hours later her hunger was worse than ever, so she had called Sally and asked her for Meghan\u2019s number\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a move that had paid off, now she stood by the south entrance to the school, one hand on her stomach and waving to the tall slender blonde with the other as the girl came down the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat bad huh?\u201d Meghan said shooting a glance at the hand on Madeleine\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt responded with a growl \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Madeleine confessed, \u201c\u2026probably worse\u2026 can\u2019t remember ever being, this, hungry\u2026\u201d she emphasized, then in an effort to take her mind off of it she asked. \u201cSo you live on the south side then?\u201d realising she didn\u2019t have a clue as of where Meghan lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh\u2026 not really, I just didn\u2019t want to walk through the park if that\u2019s where we were heading, it\u2019s a pretty bad idea to be seen just before someone disappears.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh\u2026point taken\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather try something a bit further from home, now that I\u2019ve got the time though, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell\u2026I suppose beggars can\u2019t be choosers.\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cI do see why you wouldn\u2019t want to eat too close to home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, perhaps, but mostly I need new hunting grounds, so to speak. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve taken the time to explore this city\u2026I suppose if you help me, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d Meghan winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Madeline smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that decided Madeline acted in parts as a tour guide, she didn\u2019t know the city that well either, but she\u2019d been to a few places and she had a somewhat blurry picture of the city outline, which was a whole lot more than Meghan did.<br>\r\nHence she led the way and Meghan followed while they made small talk, though Madeline\u2019s stomach had her picking up the pace, so it wasn\u2019t long before they had abandoned the leisurely Sunday walk pace to a more determined one that had them hurrying towards another park that Madeline thought might provide them with enough cover to up and grab someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right, it wasn\u2019t nearly as big as the one by the school, but it had been designed to shut out the busy city around it and provide a bit of an oasis, so that once you entered it the surrounding streets and buildings were soon blocked from view by dense bushes and voluminous trees. The vegetation didn\u2019t do much to dull she sounds, but somehow not seeing the causes behind the commotion helped shutting it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could tell the center of the park contained a more open space, which really didn\u2019t suit their needs so Meghan stopped Madeline as she was about to head on in. She could hear that there were quite a bit of people enjoying the sun in the grass in there too, another reason not to go in there.<br>\r\nThe paths running along the edges were more their area, the thick foliage limiting the line of sight severely, which was what they were after, the respite from the burning sun wasn\u2019t unwelcome either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline looked a tad confused, but Meghan took her by the hand and led her on a leisurely walk along a path down amidst the denser growth. It was perhaps a bit risky, she knew a lot of people were using this park, being this close to the City Center, so she knew they\u2019d run into people, she was just fearing to get caught in the act.<br>\r\nThe amount of people coming through here was not made less apparent by the fact that they hardly got their feet moving again before they spotted a well dressed young man coming towards them down the path they\u2019d chosen. He was carrying a couple of shopping bags and his pace spoke as clearly as anything else that he was just cutting through the park on his way to wherever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan released Madeline and got in the man\u2019s way. \u201cExcuse me sir.\u201d <br>\r\nShe got his attention and he came to a halt, judging by his slightly surprised reaction as he looked her over she could tell he wasn\u2019t in any real hurry which was good, it was always so much harder when they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you tell me the time? My damn phone died on me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, certainly\u2026\u201d He said while shifting both his bags to his left hand and used his free right to pull his sleeve back. But as he did she got closer to him and as he looked down at his wrist to acquire the information his eyes left the blonde girl in front of him for one fatal moment in which she reached up and made his slight bow of the head into a full on bow, ending with his head in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock made him drop his bags, unfortunately for him it was too late to scream. He brought his hands up to push away and free his head, only to find them grasped by slender female fingers who with and unyielding strength brought them under their control and he found his hands shoved in next to his face as she took a mighty swallow, a swallow that sent his head into her throat and most of his torso into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got his hopes up when he felt another pair of hands grasp his ankles, but it was trashed the second after when he felt them lift his legs up and push him down the way he was going. Meghan too was a little surprised by the assistance, not that it was unwelcome, quite the opposite, she wanted the man out of sight as quickly as possible and with her friend\u2019s help that happened slightly quicker that it otherwise would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his feet disappearing into her mouth and looking into Madeline\u2019s pleading eyes Meghan took a moment before she decided to swallow him down. Madeline\u2019s growling middle spoke perhaps even more clearly than the eyes what she wanted, but Meghan ignored her and looked around, as far as she could tell no one had spotted them, for she couldn\u2019t see anyone and she couldn\u2019t hear anyone hurrying away, so she turned her attention to the bags, figuring she should get rid of them when she noticed the logo\u2019s, one reading Victoria\u2019s secret and the other one looked feminine as well, probably some local shop because she didn\u2019t recognise it, other\u2019s might so she shoved it into the Victoria\u2019s secret bag, could be fun to see what he\u2019d bought later, no reason to throw away a good cover, that she and Madeline were out shopping was as good as any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand on her arm, grabbed her attention as well and she looked into Madeline\u2019s eyes once more. \u201cPlease\u2026\u201d the girl asked, though she sounded rather irritated, though not as much as her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah sure\u2026I just wanted to make sure it was safe first.\u201d Meghan apologised before she engaged the much larger girl in what was supposed to look like a very deep kiss, not that it wasn\u2019t, but it wasn\u2019t the main purpose of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe worked the man back up her throat, he came up the same way he went down, so Madeline winced a bit as his wet shoes was the first of him she got to taste, the pants that followed were better, but still nothing she cared for much and the clothes on his upper body did little to change her mind about the tastelessness of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Madeline accepted that he was a meal, she couldn\u2019t exactly ask for a naked one, he might not taste very good, or much at all, but he still felt great as he stretched her mouth and throat. His squirming legs and finally arms as they were the last of him to slip on in and down, before Meghan broke off their kiss, were thrilling.<br>\r\nShe felt dazed, it was great feeling him settle in her stomach and having him wiggle around in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d She exclaimed as she felt Meghan\u2019s hands on her bulging middle and realised she couldn\u2019t walk around looking pregnant and started to apply what she could remember of the hiding techniques with fairly quick and visible results, quickly reducing her belly to a mere potbelly. Still she realised that her belly was growling as hungry and angry as ever, which puzzled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m still hungry\u2026\u201d She whispered, so that no one would overhear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you need to digest to sate your hunger.\u201d Meghan explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Madeline mentally slapped her forehead. Naturally that would be the case. So she started concentrating, Meghan hadn\u2019t given her much hints on this and while she\u2019d always fancied large meals having had quite a few, especially since she started this new class, she\u2019d only had one this big before, luckily whereas hiding a meal doesn\u2019t come naturally, digestion does, though she wouldn\u2019t mind hurrying the process some\u2026or a lot.</span></div></div>",

She did realise that Meghan was taking a while, in fact the guy had completely left her stomach before her friend returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are\u2026I was getting worried\u201d Madeline said as she got up, her belly back to more or less normal and fairly quiet, she wasn\u2019t done with her guy yet, but he was far into her intestines by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a little tricky to get alone with one when things are this busy.\u201d Meghan explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I got lucky then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much. How\u2019s he doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline rubbed her belly as she tried to determine the answer. \u201cActually he\u2019s feeling lonely.\u201d She wasn\u2019t quite done with him yet and he had eased her raving hunger, but she did realize that she did still feel hungry, more so than after Robert yesterday and Meghan didn\u2019t seem as unwilling to help her just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan raised an eyebrow, not the answer she was expecting. \u201cLonely as in\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, he needs a friend\u2026do you mind? You said you wanted to have a look around town, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose.\u201d Meghan said and picked up the bag Madeline\u2019s meal had left them with. \u201cSo shall we get to it then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both of them having gotten a meal, they could stroll about more comfortably and enjoy the day, they even did a bit of window shopping, even if they decided against actually going into the shops. Every now and again Madeline\u2019s belly gurgled loudly and Meghan couldn\u2019t help but look when it did, though it did become less frequent and less noisy as they continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost an hour later they found themselves at an ice cream bar, Meghan bought a large cone while Madeline made use of their facilities, apparently the gentleman at the park had insisted to be let out, which left Meghan with the awkward prospect of trying to look like she was eating an ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had opted for the use of a plastic spoon, the brightly coloured ones usually provided, she\u2019d first picked a yellow one, but had been to greedy and broken it before she\u2019d managed to get her first spoon full and gone back for a blue one, settling with more cautious small scoops, careful not to crush the damn thing each time she pulled it from her lips. She couldn\u2019t really say that she tasted much of the ice cream, her body was all too efficient in hiding her meals on its own to let her enjoy the otherwise common delicacy, leaving her with a most frustrating task. At least it kept her occupied for Madeline took her time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the Madeline was out they swapped, with Madeline going for the ice cream and Meghan using the cramped bathroom. Meghan had more experience and hence more success in getting the remains of her meal down the inadequate plumbing. Likewise Madeline had more success with the ice cream, even though she was barely halfway done by the time Meghan came back, she was at least able to enjoy the treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large meal topped off with desert, should be enough one would think, at least Meghan did, so she was a bit surprised when Madeline\u2019s belly started grumbling again. She had half thought Madeline had been joking earlier and half being greedy, that she just wanted the nice full feeling, but half an hour from the ice cream bar she had to admit to herself that the sounds coming from the big girl\u2019s middle really sounded like growls of hunger.<br>\r\nThat in itself she found a tad intriguing, she wasn\u2019t that fond of helping anyone hunt, it was a task she most of the times found tedious enough, it could perhaps have something to do with all the times she\u2019d been asked to get something for her mother or little sister, her big sister always came along\u2026well Madeline was here with her, perhaps\u2026a well\u2026she confessed that this wasn\u2019t like watching family eat, heck this girl hadn\u2019t even thought of people as food only a couple of days ago and now her body craved who knows how much? <br>\r\nMeghan pondered why the girl needed so much, true enough Madeline was probably close to twice her weight, could that be a reason for twice the food? She honestly didn\u2019t know, still it intrigued her, yeah, she\u2019d help her get another one.</span></div></div>",

She couldn\u2019t help that she saw people as food, she knew most girls chatted about boys, she\u2019d never seen the interest other than to sate her appetite and not that of her lower lips, heck she\u2019d rarely gotten comfortable befriending anyone and even when she had her little sister had showed most of them that they were indeed just food. She was a little ashamed to admit even to herself that she had sized the girls up back at the slumber party, even if she\u2019d had no intention of eating anyone of them it didn\u2019t change the fact that she had thought about it. Now one of them had managed to flip a switch in her brain, looking at Madeline she didn\u2019t see a scrumptious snack anymore, what she saw scared her a little, which was thrilling in its own sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline prodded her belly, \u201cAww\u2026 she stopped struggling.\u201d the large amounts of digestive juices sloshing around inside as she tried to coax the girl into moving again, but it was no use, she was already breaking up, diluting the liquid surrounding her, soon she\u2019d be part of it.</span></div></div>",

She nudged Meghan\u2019s shoulder and motioned towards the voices, the alley being desolate and gloomy enough to warrant a closer look. Walking down it they looked around a bend and saw two women. Their conversation was hard to follow, the younger one was on the ground snivelling, she seemed quite desperate whereas the older one, perhaps in her mid thirties was pacing on and off shooting the odd glance at the other woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo which one do you fancy?\u201d Meghan whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one on the ground.\u201d Madeline answered barely loud enough for Meghan to hear. The one on the ground showed considerably more skin than the pacing woman, who was fully clothed, even wearing a thin jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan didn\u2019t really know how they should play this, as far as she could tell the snivelling girl was hooked on something or other that the other woman could obviously provide, but apparently didn\u2019t, so she hoped that meant they didn\u2019t want to attract attention anymore than she did.<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t much of cover though once around the bend, a large dumpster on one side was more or less it, the debris that littered the alley, no doubt mostly having been pulled from the dumpster by various birds and rats, provided no cover, although it did hide her scent in its own odour, stepping on any of it would rather make her reveal herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dashed from the corner to behind the dumpster leaving Madeline behind and narrowly avoiding kicking a rusty can on the way, finally forcing herself to stop just short of stepping on a plastic bag filled with semi-fresh trash that had probably never even made it into the dumpster in the first place.<br>\r\nMeghan didn\u2019t know what came over her, she didn\u2019t know what to do, so she just figured screw it all and stepped forth into plain view and stared walking towards the two women, quickly covering the distance between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you so mean? Can\u2019t you see you\u2019re making her cry?\u201d Meghan said as she approached and watched as the sitting girl looked over her shoulder and the pacing girl swirled to face her, eyes beaming and her whole body tensing up. The woman quickly saw that Meghan was too young to be a cop, a random girl stupid enough to interfere in her business?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d Meghan calmed the sitting girl as she placed her hands on the girl\u2019s shoulders and ran them down her arms as she leaned on closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made the dealer get angry again, was this girl going to steal her customers? She really didn\u2019t expect to see Meghan\u2019s mouth open incredibly wide and then descend on her customer, she watched transfixed in chocked horror as Meghan leaned all the way to the ground and closed her lips beneath the girl. She continued to watch as Meghan stood back up and with a casual swallow sent a lump down her throat, a lump that disappeared entirely, just that quickly her customer was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Meghan started walking towards her, she backed away and her hands flew to her right pocket, frenetically she fiddled for a bit before producing a stiletto knife.<br>\r\nMeghan didn\u2019t know how that item could hurt her, she wasn\u2019t that keen to find out, so she stopped and kept her distance as the woman started circling her, once she was facing back the way she had come she saw Madeline moving out from behind the corner and started circling the other way, making the woman stop and with a slash of the knife through the air step back. Meghan saw that it worked and moved slowly and deliberately, making sure to keep the woman\u2019s attention on herself and the woman\u2019s back towards Madeline while the big girl snuck up on her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single blow to her head sent the dealer flying, she hadn\u2019t seen Madeline coming, nor seen her blow before it sent her into the wall of the building and knocked her out cold. Madeline watched shocked, she had expected the girl to topple over and hopefully drop her knife, not fly several meters through the air and into a wall movie brawl style, with the exception that she didn\u2019t look like she was going to get up again any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice punch!\u201d Meghan giggles, laughing mostly at Madeline\u2019s stupefied expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh, thanks\u2026\u201d Madeline manages as she takes in the scene one more time, a slight grumble from her belly instinctively sets her feet in motion towards the limp form on the ground. She wraps her fingers around the woman\u2019s upper arms and starts to lift her up when Meghan interrupts her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might want to empty her pockets first, wouldn\u2019t want to oh-dee on whatever she was selling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, kinda got lost in the moment.\u201d Madeline mumbled and searched the woman, she found a bit of cash which wasn\u2019t bad as well as a few small bags of something white, she considered throwing them away, but then realised her fingerprints were all over them, so she put them in her own pocket, figuring she\u2019d determine what to do with it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that the woman was safe to eat, she mashed the head of her meal in between her lips and used her hands to slowly cram the torso in as well and down her throat, it was a lot trickier than being fed by Meghan, the experience differed in other ways as well. For one the taste was somewhat dirty, it wasn\u2019t the cleanest clothes the woman was wearing, partly due to her stay on the alley floor, the clothes also soaked up her saliva, Meghan had lubed up the other ones nicely for her even if it made them taste a bit like Meghan spittle. <br>\r\nShe had to admit the thing she missed most was the movement, the woman was still alive, but out cold, Madeline couldn\u2019t get even a wiggle out of her, no amount of pinching and groping made her slide on down any other way than like a limp sack of meat, which was surprisingly unsatisfactory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that was a let down\u2026\u201d Madeline said looking down on the soft bulge in her middle, the only movement coming from it was the slight jiggle as she rubbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Not much of a belly filler either?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh\u2026\u201d Madeline hadn\u2019t considered that, but realized it to be the truth. \u201cNo, I guess not, but I didn\u2019t realise how much I liked the struggling, she doesn\u2019t even flinch in there\u2026but now that you mention it, I did call dibs on the snivelling one.\u201d Madeline smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, you\u2019re claiming both?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, you didn\u2019t call dibs on either, though I\u2019m not that greedy, you can have the limp one, though you\u2019ll have to reach in and get her, but I really do want the other one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d Meghan wasn\u2019t hungry, so there wasn\u2019t that much of a point in her keeping the girl just because it\u2019d be fair. \u201cYou can keep her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl might not have heard the discussion, for she seemed to get her hopes up as she was forced back up Meghan's throat. Hopes dashed as she realized she was being crammed down a second throat, which triggered frantic desperate struggles, much to Madeline's liking.</span></div></div>",

I was too eager to start in on the one I knocked when you said I could keep her...so when I held back to enjoy the squirming one...it was apparently already too late.\u201d Her belly let out a content wet gurgle to emphasize her point. \u201cShe's already stopped struggling.\u201d Madeline pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that's one greedy gut you have. I thought you said one a day was much? What's your count?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I spoke too soon didn't I? Think it'll pass? I mean I'll be quite busy if I need to keep eating this much. Then again I did eat a lot before.\u201d Madeline said patting her slowly shrinking pot-belly, causing the extra softness there to jiggle in return. \u201cCould it just be that my appetite scaled up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know.\u201d Meghan admitted, thinking for a while in silence if she could recall overhearing any discussion about it. \u201cSorry, can't remember hearing anything about it. There's class tomorrow, right? I guess I could check with the Professor then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease do.\u201d Madeline smiled, though her expression still showed that she was a bit concerned over her appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two soon parted ways. Meghan excused herself that she really needed to catch up on her homework, which was true. The main reason she'd gone out had been to get something to eat, as well as postponing said homework, something the digital numbers on her cellphone told her she'd done for too long already, which left her with a long tedious evening of hard studying.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meghan was fairly late, her mathematics class sometimes overlapped Blainey's class, something that would have been problematic had she needed to take the class, but her mother had assured her that wouldn't be the case, which was true enough and Blainey didn't mind that much, she just needed Meghan for assisting, so it was fine with her if the girl showed up late, as long as it was before the practice part of her lesson commenced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking in the door, not without getting a few glances, but smoothly enough to not really disturb, Meghan was glad to see that there was still a few minutes before practice and joined the other TA's as they gathered close to the back door, getting ready to bring forth the necessary items once the Professor gave the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting she studied the class, there were too many, she could never keep track of that many, which was probably why it took her a while to pick out her new found friends. It probably didn't help that they weren't grouped together, apparently not even two of them were even practice-partners, so they were scattered all across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she should have paid attention to what the Professor was saying, but she only really heard her when she said it was time to practice, which brought a loud rustle from the class as they adjusted themselves in their seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter setting up and getting everything out, Meghan found that although most girls seemed to accept her presence they were still nervous enough to not ask help of her, leaving her not nearly as busy as the other TAs and with ample time to survey the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe followed Madeline with some amusement as she saw the girl toil with her urges, first pondering whether to help herself to her practice partner, or to help the girl, for which she opted for the latter, but shortly after changed her mind and gulped the girl down, only to struggle with her greedy gut's desire to digest the delicious thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally sported a sizeable pot-belly when Meghan first found her in the crowd and was helping her partner tackle something round and leathery, she didn't care what it was as she kept on looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concept was fairly odd, but she couldn't help pondering it. These girls were at least potentially learning how to eat people, seeing how many were struggling with fairly small objects, it was at times fairly hard to see them as ones doing the eating. Still she tried to view them as predators, even if some looked simply delicious, Meghan put such thoughts aside even if she got the deer in headlights look staring back at her and forced herself to move her gaze to the next girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't the only one looking, many kept an eye on her when she was close by, but what they were thinking she could rarely tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were girls who were really hard to imagine as predators, looking simply helpless, not seldom innocent or dainty, whereas others of thicker build, or more sultry complexion Meghan found needed less imagination, but then she watched as one of those she thought looked predatory stop helping her partner and trying on a practice sphere and failing miserably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe failure shattered Meghan's impression and she wondered if they really were going to become predators. Looking further up she couldn't help halt at a cute slender thing, who looked helpless, unable to stop herself from salivating. Thinking that there was one who  really looked like a delicious morsel and not a predator, so knowing she couldn't very well up and eat the girl, she at least gave herself the time to watch the girl for a moment and indulge in the daydream of doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched the girl who was in the middle of class patted the bulging middle of her friend, which Meghan thought would be herself in a few lessons, for her partner looked like she had potential at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a short girl called out at the side which caught Meghan's attention, she was struggling with a huge practice sphere, so large that she was lacking at least half a meter from reaching around it, but she had no intention of doing that, standing in the aisle she set it down on the head and upturned hands of the girl sitting closest, who then with her help rolled it to the next and the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan was surprised when her morsel waved to the girl in the stairs and thanked her, before she accepted the huge ball rolling at her.<br>\r\nSitting back down and with the help of her pot-bellied partner the girl hoisted the sphere above her and leaned her head back under it, then slowly the orb spread the girl's lips wider and wider, until it could fit in her mouth no more and started spreading her neck and then torso as well and a minute later the girl closed her lips for a brief instant before she turned and gave her partner a cute toothy grin, who laughed back amazed and patted the huge dome in front of her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps they could become predators after all, perhaps she just shouldn't try to judge them already, they have after all not had that many lessons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned to her duties, there weren't many that asked her for help, but there were still those who did, for one she took the time to help Becky get a sphere down, though she hadn't asked for assistance. <br>\r\nPerhaps that was an approach, to help those that needed it instead of just the ones that asked?</span></div></div>",

Or rather she saw the head of the girl, who was talking to her partner of whom in turn only hands and hair was visible as she struggled to cram a melon into her  mouth that was roughly the size of her face. She didn't look like she was making any progress at all though, so Meghan turned her steps in that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan went on around the back and jumped over the seats so she landed in the middle of the patch of upturned empty seats between the girl failing to eat the melon and the next pair of girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stopped by the sudden noise as she jerked the fruit away from her face and looked up at Meghan who'd suddenly appeared next to her.<br>\r\nInstantly Meghan realized both why the other TAs hadn't come to help the girl as well as why there were a few empty seats next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was intimidating, sure she was looking up at Meghan, but she didn't feel like that was the case, even though she was sitting down and Meghan being fairly tall, it still wasn't that much of a height difference, a difference made totally irrelevant when the width of the girl was added to the equation. Even Meghan couldn't help instinctively taking a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice was easily the largest girl in class, though unlike her plump practice partner who was the closest one to her size and motioning feverishly for Meghan not to help Beatrice when she thought her partner wasn't looking, she wasn't fat, or even slightly soft, just an overgrown and surprisingly pretty powerhouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpressed by the build of the girl, she noted with some awe that her arms were probably thicker, than her own thighs and she couldn't help catching a glimpse of the bulging abdominals protruding from the girl's otherwise flat belly, realising why the girl's partner wasn't that into actually helping the girl learn, since that'd mean she'd sooner or later end up going inside there during their practice, heck Meghan got half a shiver down her spine looking at it and figuring that she could almost fit in there without the girl needing to learn any hiding tricks to keep her hidden. That wasn't quite true, but even though it was flat, the girl possessed a lot of hungry looking belly, but on a thickly built and well over two meter tall frame it wasn't as if it stood out, there was a lot of every part of her, except perhaps breasts, which looked mostly like muscle instead of fat.<br>\r\nStill despite the lack of feminine softness Beatrice still possessed a very feminine build, it was all female muscle and not the otherwise typical square cut steroid frame so common in 'females' packing muscle.</span></div></div>",

She was after all here to help girls to learn to eat, what the meals though of it she didn't care and somehow the image of the big soft girl struggling helplessly inside that tight powerful belly invaded her mind in a way that intrigued her, it was something she actually wanted to see, even if she realised that unfortunately it probably wouldn't happen while she was watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of dumbfounded silence, Meghan gathered herself and forced a smile on her lips. \u201cHi, I'm Meghan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah we know.\u201d The girls answered in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...well you looked like you could use some help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes please!\u201d Beatrice lightened up, while her partner did the opposite. \u201cI guess I've stopped trying to get the TAs' attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what's your name?\u201d Meghan wondered and extended her hand in a formal greeting, noticing with some surprise that the big girl actually hesitated a bit before taking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeatrice.\u201d She got for an answer, trying to put the name on file, failing to notice the girl's eyes alternating between Meghan's middle and her mouth while she tried to get her hand back as quickly as possible without actually jerking it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn contrast Meghan failed to even register the \u201cAbby\u201d she got as she shook the other girl's hand while the thought crossed her mind whether or not greeting her was a waste of time. The smile on Meghan's face unnerved both the girls as she pondered if she should eat the plump one right then and there, but decided that she shouldn't rob Beatrice of her future meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill watching the girl quiver was nice as well. Then she realized that she didn't know how the Professor would take to her eating a student in class, seeing as how she seemed quite protective of them during their first encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAl-right, show me what you were up to. You stopped before I could get a good look.\u201d Meghan told Beatrice, who brought the miserable melon back to her face, for Meghan noticed that it had become half mashed by the girl's efforts to cram it into her mouth. Watching the girl struggling and failing again didn't help the health of the fruit any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy girl.\u201d Meghan interrupted her, causing Beatrice to lower the fruit. \u201cI think I know what your problem is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you're too used to flexing all that muscle. Not that muscle is bad, but now you're tensing up in the wrong way, like you're trying to do a push-up by pulling yourself into the floor instead of pushing away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure one can use muscles to accomplish what you want. Like this...\u201d Meghan said and opened her mouth wide, wide enough to give the two girls a view that caused them to nearly wet themselves. But the mouth closed quicker than it had opened and once more Meghan appeared to them as just a pretty blonde girl, which released a sigh of relief from the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's a bit tricky though...\u201d Meghan continued \u201c...so I think you should just try relaxing for now. Perhaps you could think of it as relaxing at the top of a push-up in order to get back into position for another one.\u201d She said motioning for Beatrice to have another go at the fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeel this? Tense as a spring.\u201d Meghan said prodding the girl's face. \u201cTry to relax here and here.\u201d She instructed and the girl managed to do so, which caused the melon to slowly slide into the girl's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you can tense up like you did before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she had passed the critical point, this caused the rest of the melon to get squeezed into her mouth. Getting the large fruit into her throat presented a similar problem, but Meghan got her around that hitch as well and as Beatrice worked the fruit into her throat the corded muscles of her strong neck tensed up as she swallowed, crushing the fruit downwards and mashing it into a pulp in the process. <br>\r\nShe felt the melon shoot down into her stomach, but at the same time her mouth filled up with fruit-juice that she frenetically swallowed down as it felt like it continued to bubble up her throat, which it didn't, the initial squirt had been it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, seems like you're back on track.\u201d Meghan smiled and with a hand on the top of the back row of seats half jumped, half hoisted herself over it, to land in the pathway leading behind the seats. \u201cKeep practising.\u201d She winked at Beatrice before turning away, while purposely ignoring her practice partner that was struggling to find the words to ask for help for herself, she didn't need to, her body language made her intention abundantly clear, but Meghan had absolutely no interest in helping her, except down Beatrice's throat, that would be help she'd gladly give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hurried down to the front of the class in case the plump girl would start shouting after her, she couldn't wipe that smug grin off her face, which granted her a few puzzled looks as she walked on by.</span></div></div>",

What caught her attention was that the girl was helping her partner with a fairly small fruit, she didn't know if she should add 'yet another' to that or not, but every time she'd looked at the couple the raven haired one had been aiding her brunette friend at times nearly standing up in her seat in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided she should investigate and headed back up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...\u201d Meghan interrupted the two, and was met by a scared gaze from the brunette and a bewildered one from the raven haired girl, who gave her a wide smile, as wide as her dainty pink little mouth could go naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi.\u201d she got from the smiling one, whom she noticed, was looking her over a little too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you done any practising?\u201d Meghan addressed the girl she'd come to check up on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh...sure.\u201d She got back, the girl looking surprised that Meghan was talking to 'her'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? When I've looked over here I've only see you helping your partner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah, I guess I haven't done any today, but it's just because it's so cool watching her swallow stuff down.\u201d she excused while her friend blushed and tried to cover her bulging and Meghan noticed, quite lumpy middle. \u201cNot nearly as cool as what you did, though.\u201d the girl finished with a smile and what appeared to be a look of idolizing wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see...\u201d Meghan squirmed, she was certainly not used to this kind of attention, the girl was really pretty though, so she didn't come of quite as creepy as Meghan feared one such person  would have. Well her task was to help these girls so she figured she'd do that, it wasn't at least as if the girl disliked her, which she assumed would be worse.<br>\r\n\u201c...well, the class is supposed to teach you to swallow stuff like that too, so I think it's your turn to practice. By the sound of it you might need my help to catch up.\u201d Meghan said dutifully, realizing only the second after she said it, that she'd offered a fan a one on one and bit her lip hoping she wouldn't have to regret that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally!?\u201d The girl beamed like a sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Meghan sighed, not quite as enthusiastic about it as she perhaps should be. \u201cSo where were you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right...\u201d The girl fiddled with her bag and to Meghan's surprise produced a spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh...from what I heard that was something everyone was using the first lesson to overcome the gag reflex. Please tell me you're not stuck there.\u201d Was this girl serious, hadn't she practised anything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not stuck...\u201d the girl said and put the spoon in her mouth before sliding the larger end into her throat. \u201cThhee noo gaghrefheesch.\u201d she called with the item there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her eyes Meghan reached out and grabbed the girls shoulder , she wasn't quite sure herself if she was just giving the girl a patronizing pat or if she just wanted a hold so she could lean in and get a closer look. The result however, was that the girl jerked, not quite expecting Meghan to actually touch her. This surprise caused her to swallow the spoon, which went down without causing any trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOps.\u201d The girl said as she stared up at Meghan, bringing a hand up to cover her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAl-right, don't panic.\u201d Meghan calmed her. \u201cI'm not sure you're quite ready to digest a spoon, but we'll get it out, don't fret.\u201d she tried giving the girl a warm smile, it actually came quite natural, for the girl looked both cute and silly as she sat there staring wide eyed. \u201cSo what are your names?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKim.\u201d The brunette said, who was quick at the chance to get in on the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBryci...\u201d The black haired girl followed, removing the hand from her mouth in the process and instead lowered it to her belly, which she poked to see if she could feel the spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Bryci, what was pretty cool too wasn't it? Swallowing a large spoon, like any other mouthful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess.\u201d The girl smiled back. \u201cBut how do I get it out? It's metal, which like you said I probably can't digest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I'll try to get it out, but if I fail, I'm sure the Professor knows a way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, first things first.\u201d Meghan said and rubbed her hands, she'd chosen a sleeveless top today because she figured she'd only get them soaked in spittle with this class on the schedule and all. <br>\r\n\u201cTurn and face me...\u201d Bryci looked puzzled but did as told. \u201cNo, your whole body.\u201d Meghan instructed, which made the girl sit sideways in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow sit straight and lean your head back.\u201d Which the girl did, which made Meghan realise that the short girl was quite busty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl struggled to keep looking at Meghan, which was a bit hard with her head turned skywards, but became easier as Meghan stepped in and straddled her legs. She still looked a slightly confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it's easier if I have a straight path to your stomach.\u201d Meghan explained \u201cNow open wide...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Great!\u201d Meghan complimented as she felt the tension in Bryci easing up. With her hands in the girl's mouth she could even feel her pulse which at first had been quite high, but which was quickly coming down to what could be passed for someone in a relaxed state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, lets see if we can't massage your throat open enough to let me reach down and get that spoon...\u201d Meghan said as if it was some sort of team effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did notice that the mouth wasn't tight around her hands any more, but she was still surprised when the throat didn't offer any serious resistance as she eased her fingers into it, in fact there were no resistance at all, not even when her hands followed, both of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... It seems to be working...\u201d She said, just to say something, not that she had done anything so far, but she leaned on down. Perplexed herself by the lack of resistance she continued with both her hands, even so when her fingers poked through into the girl's stomach and her elbows entered the mouth. <br>\r\nShoving her arms down further she found the spoon and grabbed hold of the object, but not retreating back the way she came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her elbows against each other in the girl's throat, her upper arms were already stretching Bryci's mouth quite a bit, but Meghan couldn't really feel any real tension anywhere, so on a whim she spread her elbows apart and grabbing the spoon in her right hand, did the same with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazed she watched down the girl's throat, all the way to her stomach as she slowly stretched open a hole, that got wider and wider. Realising she couldn't stall anymore without it being more awkward than it was already, Meghan quickly stood up and brought her arms out, making a mental note that she'd been spreading the girl open almost the width of her shoulders and she was sure she could have gone further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh...here!\u201d Meghan stumbled with the words and handed the spoon back to Bryci. \u201cDon't swallow it again. Ok?\u201d She joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I won't.\u201d Bryci smiled. \u201cOh, I mean, I will, if it means you'll help me again.\u201d she joked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I might be able to help you without you doing that. For now though, I think you should go down and get one of those spheres to practice on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Bryci gaped and Kim too looked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Really.\u201d Meghan emphasised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you girls later.\u201d Meghan said as she excused herself and headed down the stairs, she really needed to talk to Blainey.</span></div></div>",

For one I was a little surprised by a girl I just helped. She had apparently not practised much beyond the spoon and yet I had little...No...I mean, no trouble, stretching her open enough to pull the spoon up out of her stomach sideways, after she had accidentally swallowed it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, well don't let them fool you. We have them sign a paper of non-disclosure regarding the contents of this class, as we don't want the public to know. But you know that. However most that sign up do already know, but feign ignorance to keep their sister, mother, cousin, or childhood friend, from getting into trouble from having told them, or often even taught them. I don't mind, it'd be hard to get a full class if this wasn't as common as it is. The important thing is that the public doesn't know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor shifted her footing and nodded towards the students, not wanting to point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at the third row for example, the girl on the far left in the black leather jacket. Her sister took this class last semester. The dark girl a few seats to her right...\u201d Blainey referred to a girl with a deep natural tan, with a hard placed complexion that should she'd chanced a guess spoke of middle-eastern heritage.\u201c...her older twin sisters took this class three or four years ago. The blonde in the pair after her almost swallowed her practice partner just before you got down here, but then remembered to fake learning and picked up a melon instead. The two you see that's not practising much, but quite busy talking instead both know and and are just stalling, because they find practising on objects boring. The blonde at the right end also knows, I'm pretty sure she's had family here before, but I must have had fifty students called 'Smith', so I've got no idea which one taught her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I didn't know. I thought you were guarding this secret rather intensely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I am. Why do you think I stand down here looking like a damn stuffed bird watching over the class instead of being up there with the TAs helping? Not all girls are capable of learning and those that are not have no incentive to keep their mouths shut, which means I have to fail them.\u201d Blainey said and to Meghan's surprise patted her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I don't mind failing students.\u201d Kelly said with a wink. \u201cIt's partly therefore I prefer to have a class of two hundred and thirty, rather than one of just thirty, which would probably be the case if girls didn't spread the word.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot capable of learning? You mean they don't study hard enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes that might be the case, but most often girls find the subject fascinating enough to study enough. It would seem that many girls just can't, sure they may think it's cool that they can swallow an orange or a melon whole, but as far as I'm concerned if they can't put someone in their belly, then they belong inside one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe girl you helped the first day? The short dark haired one...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I thought I'd have to fail her, I was pretty sure actually. I still am pretty sure she'd have failed if she hadn't gotten your help, about as sure as I am that she's reached her potential.\u201d The professor noticed Meghan's perplexed expression, so she continued. \u201cYou see, girls are not equal, some like you can learn to swallow insane amounts and some, like Sally can never get beyond fitting a single person in her gut and probably never learn to hide even that one to any great extent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere's also a great range of talents, even when learning the same skills some have a much easier time handling certain aspects. For one, I remember a girl a few years ago that had no problem getting four...or was it five?...girls into her throat, but she couldn't fit even the smallest of them inside her stomach. Another girl on the other hand had a hard time getting even a slender girl down her throat, but she had no trouble hiding anyone she managed to get down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo when you said Sally's reached her potential... You mean she can't improve anymore?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, sort of, she can still learn new skills and improve in the use of the ones she already knows, but this is an unfair game, skill isn't everything. One needs a natural disposition and yes, it usually takes a while to find out what that is. But as I had initially placed Sally in the 'lost cause' category, I doubt that she'll manage anything that'll impress me, even with your help.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Well it totally depends on what 'hunger' means. What did she eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh...four...or was it five?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, I feared it'd be normal food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, and that was just yesterday. Possibly more if she grabbed something after we parted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that's quite a bit. Well the body does adapt and a bit of huger as it does is normal, she might get even hungrier before it subsides though, She'll never get back to being content with a cheeseburger, if that's what she was wondering though.\u201d Blainey snickered even as she listened to the girl in question retching in the room behind the classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd turned on a couple of showers and the splattering noise of water against tiled floor did help some in covering up the less appealing sounds she was making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as the afterthought, for which it truly was, Blainey added: \u201cShe doesn't need to stuff herself silly, if that was what she feared. The hunger will pass eventually and her stomach will be content with a lot less than her stomach currently tells her that it would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh...\u201d Meghan managed, a little confused by the way Kelly blurted that out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I mean is, that if she can put up with being semi hungry for a while, she'll see that this is just a phase, she doesn't really need to eat as much as her stomach tells her and after a while it'll realise that as well. It's normal to be 'extra' hungry in the beginning. Tell her not to worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will. Thanks!\u201d Meghan said as she headed towards the back room to help her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly had been a bit surprised by the amount Meghan had said the girl had eaten. She didn't know how much that had showed or if it really mattered if it had shown. What she didn't tell and didn't want to let on was that she was a firm believer of the theory that one could to some degree influence one's potential while ones body adjusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe theory was basically that one's body and thus potential adopted to the challenges it was faced with and that it needed building material to do so. In essence that if one didn't eat enough one would stop developing and fall short of one's full potential and likewise if one continued to present serious challenges to one's body it'd continue to develop beyond what it would most likely have done otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't alone on this or similar theories, many had come to similar conclusions, but no one ever voiced them, as they had no interest in the theory being either spread or proved, for just like Blainey, the others that had formed such theories had also reached their potential. And as much as Kelly liked her students, she preferred that they remained her inferiors.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, girls usually found the aspect of eating other people, not only daunting, but also a moral threshold that was difficult to handle and thus often went hungry, to the point that they usually didn't develop their full potential. Many girls had the help of friends and relatives to coax them, but they usually showed restraint. The times that girls had no such qualms Blainey tried to discourage them, even if it was just by saying that they looked like they had put on weight or something, which wasn't always true.</span></div></div>",

It was not unlike a dressing room, even if there was no sauna, not that most would want one considering that they'd just been in a hot sweltering place anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd gone back there to check up on Madeline and assist her if need be, but the girl was standing back up with the support of a shower stall wall, just as Meghan closed the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slimy practice partner looked a little taken as she twitched about before collecting her knees beneath her and shakily got to her feet, obviously pretty exhausted by the ordeal, but she looked otherwise unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan fetched a towel for the girl, but she declined it as she instead stepped into one of the stalls in which Madeline had turned on the water earlier and began removing her clothes. Meghan was a little surprised as she realised just how big the girl was. She stood there looking and hardly even noticed as Madeline took the towel and used it for a napkin before heading over to a sink and did her best to rinse the wretched taste out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did know that they had paired up according to size, but unconsciously she hadn't accepted it, that the small bulge in Madeline's gut had been this big lass, which was just as tall as Madeline and certainly softer, she wouldn't be surprised if the plump girl had a few pounds on Madeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising that the girl was getting naked and by the glare she got from the girl that an audience wasn't welcome, Meghan trotted over to Madeline, with a grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite a mouthful that one, huh?\u201d She said, trying to keep her voice down so that the girl wouldn't overhear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, not bad at all...\u201d Madeline admitted. \u201cI could have done without this part though.\u201d she said and spat into the sink before trying to scrape the taste off of her tongue with the towel again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand, but that would have left her with only one other way out.\u201d Meghan teased, patting Madeline's ample behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big girl was a a bit taken by surprise by that. \u201cUm...yeah.\u201d Before she could form a sentient reply, her stomach spoke what she really thought for her, with a deep long demanding growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe thought crossed your mind, I hear.\u201d Meghan snickered to which Madeline nodded somewhat ashamed, as well as afraid that the girl in question would hear her, if she spoke her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower was turned off and the girl asked her partner if she could fetch her bag, since she had her spare clothes in it.<br>\r\nMadeline agreed and left the room, while the girl re-entered the shower and Meghan produced a fresh towel for the girl, before leaving as well.</span></div></div>",

Come over here will you?\u201d The professor called to her as she left the back-room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Prof...Kelly?\u201d Meghan blurted as she went on over to the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI forgot to tell you earlier.\u201d Blainey said as she turned towards her desk and retrieved a piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI took the liberty of bringing a form. Fill this in and put it in the white letterbox by the school reception desk.\u201dA smug smile grew on the woman's lips as she watched Meghan's emotions toil when she accepted the paper, wondering what it was. \u201cClass starts on Friday.\u201d She added before stepping away, leaving Meghan with her dumbfounded look and the application paper for the advanced class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOgling the sheet up and down, Meghan tried to determine if the professor was pulling her leg, but she decided pretty quickly that it wasn't the case. There wasn't much information on it though, just a few paragraphs of mumbo jumbo that required a few signatures. There wasn't even any information at all what the class was about, not even it's name, just a time and place to be and the course code, which was apparently: GI8U2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan was brought back to her senses by the class gathering their things and leaving. So she put the paper away in her own bag and headed for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waited for everyone in front of her to mill out of the classroom, she realised that after Wednesday's class, she'd no longer be a TA, she had after all only agreed to be such up until an advanced class would start and now that was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing taller than most, Meghan looked out into the hallway beyond the blocked door and saw Bryci standing there against the opposite wall, half sitting in the narrow windowsill, apparently waiting for someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the girl, made Meghan remember that she'd sort of promised to help her. It also made her recall what the professor had said about girls faking ignorance. <br>\r\nNo it had seemed genuine, either Bryci is one hell of an actor or she has to fall in the 'natural talent' category. How was it the professor had said, high potential?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly she thought it'd be more fun with a friend that could develop some skills than a 'lost cause'. Meghan hadn't realized that the professor's speech had affected her so much, but then again she had assumed Sally would get better, if she can't then it'd be almost like hanging with a normal person and she knew her sister would eat any such she brought home, unless...someone of these girls got Sally first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a strange thought, most of these girls would start eating people soon enough, or at least she felt pretty sure they would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she made it though the door and outside things moved along much better.</span></div></div>",

But she had to admit she had never had many and most of the ones she'd gotten her little sister had shown what she had considered to be their proper place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if what Blainey said was true, then that's most likely the scenario that'd play out with Sally and her friends if they were ever to come on over, not to mention that if Madeline opened her mouth she'd likely get swarmed by request of helping them hunt as well. The thought felt like a ton of bricks on her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Bryci, she had seemed friendly enough... and then some...<br>\r\nSure she'd probably need to help the girl out at first, but after that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question led her thoughts to a scenario she found appealing, as admitted were the looks of the girl as she now got a much better look of the short pretty raven haired girl. Had she been starting to check girls out? The thought perplexed her, but she pondered it for a while and settled with accepting that she did find Bryci more attractive than Sally or any of her friends, the girl had an interesting look and a face somewhere between cute and sultry with a dainty little mouth that still retained nice full lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeck she'd like to see her eat someone with that little mouth. A realisation that made up her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi! Bryci, was it?\u201d Meghan said trying the, at least to her, unusual name while trying to keep out of the milling crowd still flooding the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...hi!\u201d The short girl replied nodding, almost glowing despite her pitch black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan considered how to approach the subject, but figured she might as well get straight to the point, she did after all have to get her ass to the next class pretty soon.<br>\r\n\u201cWell you see, I just learned that I don't have to be a TA any more and I'd hate to go back on my word. So what say you, of a little private lesson later?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci, didn't quite follow, or rather she didn't really believe what she had just heard, so all she managed was an open mouthed \u201cW-what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, me, in private, later?\u201d Meghan clarified over the rustle and chatter of all the milling students. \u201cOk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d Bryci smiled back when she came to the conclusion that it wasn't a joke on Meghan's part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter school ok?\u201d Meghan wondered and received a nod. \u201cHere\u201d she added as she fished out her cellphone and pressed to get a new entry for a contact. \u201cType your number and I'll call you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci, adapt with the item still managed to fumble a few times before getting the number right and handing the phone back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, see you later then!\u201d Meghan said as she merged with the crowd and headed for her next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci felt all giddy, should she tell Kim? No, she decided this would be her little secret. <br>\r\nKim could swallow large oranges...Meghan could...her mind swooned at the thought.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meghan hadn't really thought this through, at least not at a conscious level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with her classes done for the day she started SMS:ing Bryci, that her own classes were over didn't mean that the other girl's were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also gave her an excuse to wander about looking occupied and sneak up closer to people, she had a few attempts spoiled as other people emerging at the scene, but eventually she found a guy to satisfy her nutritional needs for the day. Though she paid her cell phone more attention that him, even if he caused her to take a break in her typing in order to find the location of the ladies' room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her message exchange she gathered both that Bryci was on her way home and that she actually lived pretty close by, she got the address and code for the apartment-building\u2019s front door too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the guy out of her system, she realized that she should probably bring something for later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few minutes she'd stayed at school had really thinned out the residents, so now she found getting alone with a straggler wasn't that hard, in fact as she looked around she found several targets sitting alone, two of the computer-labs in this corridor alone offered such and looking around a bend she saw a guy up ahead, sitting alone on a couch studying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing footsteps behind her she turned to see a tall blonde, having just exited the stairwell and was walking away from Meghan. Opening the door separating the stairwell and the corridor had caused the girl to nearly drop the books and papers she was carrying, so she was walking pretty slowly as she tried to get her stuff together again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Meghan there was no hesitation, with confident strides she set a pace that would cause her to quickly overtake the other girl. <br>\r\nApparently the girl didn't sense any danger, she didn't turn as Meghan closed in on her, in fact she didn't react at all until Meghan's moist lips had closed around the girl's trim middle. The sight of the girl had made Meghan salivate, in a short dress that left her arms and most of her legs bare she had as far as Meghan was concerned looked delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSucking in those long smooth struggling legs, didn't disappoint, the girl was nice and clean and wore a tasteful perfume that gave her a delightful fragrance, she had probably used some moisturising cream as well, which added a pleasant taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all Meghan could do to keep from Mmm:ing as she rolled the girl around in her mouth, it even took her a moment before her brain slapped her and told her to leave the scene of the crime and swallow the girl before she got caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo reluctantly she let the girl slide down into her cavernous stomach, at least she'd get to enjoy the girl's struggles for a while, she didn't usually keep meals around, but there was certainly merit in holding the digestion at bay for a while first. But then she usually only ate when she was hungry and the hunger didn't dissipate until the meal did. Keeping people in the stomach did absolutely nothing in regards of relieving hunger, or worse hunger pains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only minutes later that she rounded a corner and saw the building up ahead where Bryci supposedly lived.<br>\r\nThe code opened the door and standing in the quiet entrance she could make out music reverberating from the walls, apparently someone a floor or so up was playing very loud music, but it still barely registered down here, still a sign that this was a building for student apartments, the floor chart on the wall was another implication, simply by the sheer number of apartments, indicating that they had to be pretty small to fit that many in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, floor and apartment...she looked at the chart realising that she didn't have Bryci's last name, still that was an unusual first name, by any luck they had spelled it out. As she read she saw that there were both kinds listed, both with the full first name and the kind with just the first letter and a dot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding her thumbs she scanned the floors on the chart and found a Bryci Collin on the fifth floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she was at the right place, looking over her shoulder she noted that there were both stairs and elevator to choose from, perhaps not surprising for an eleven story building. Still she'd had to choose which to use.</span></div></div>",

The apartment was certainly not big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her right was a narrow opening into a small excuse for a kitchen.<br>\r\nMost of the remaining wall on the right was taken up by a large desk, encumbered by a computer and piles of school books, on top of which rested a shiny practice sphere, the smallest version if she guessed correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe far wall, the only one with windows, though the blinds were closed, had a queen-sized bed protruding from it, taking up a large part of the room.<br>\r\nLeaving the wall on the left full of wardrobes, most of which had their doors covered in mirrors, making the room seem a little larger than it actually was. The last door in the row, directly to the left as one entered, was the one leading to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to my humble abode.\u201d Bryci greeted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan could tell that she'd made a rush cleaning, the bed was probably not usually made and the books on the desk looked like they had been hastily piled according to size rather than content and relevance. She supposed that she appreciated the effort, though not quite sure if she actually cared as long as the place didn't smell or looked dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d She said removing her shoes and setting her school-backpack down by the side of the door. \u201cI see you brought a sphere home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you told me to get one, but I haven't tried it.\u201d Bryci blushed, ashamed that she hadn't followed up on Meghan's instructions during class, but had made Kim try it instead and she had failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don't fret.\u201d Meghan calmed her, it was not the type of sphere Meghan had had in mind anyhow, this one was no bigger than a kid's basketball and Meghan realized that she had neglected to mention the size to Bryci, she had meant something the size of a large medicine ball, or possibly larger. She was uncertain as to how much Bryci could handle, but it seemed that her ignorance was genuine, possibly for the better, she decided that a humble Bryci was certainly better than a cocky one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat on the bed as the only chair available seemed to be the office chair by the desk that Bryci was sitting in, Meghan pondered out loud. \u201cI'm not quite sure where to begin... Have you read the book?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! Many times...\u201d Bryci started enthusiastic, but waning \u201cbut ...I haven't practised much...more like ehm...imagined.\u201d she managed, in lack of a better word, she did manage to fool Meghan though. Who took it for theoretical practice rather than fantasizing about the ordeal in general and going by the blush on the short girl's face and averted eyes, probably Meghan in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci had found the book very interesting indeed and helpful too in visualizing what happened inside the body and the fate of the unfortunate food, so she wasn't lying when she said she had read it many times, at least the parts with descriptions and action, there was a lot of rules and warnings and mumbo-jumbo in the book that she admittedly had only read in order to make certain that she hadn't missed out on anything essential or interesting, as a result her book was now clearly marked so she knew what parts to skip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAl-right, then we just need to put that theory into practice then.\u201d Meghan smiled. \u201cFirst thing first, you need to open your mouth really wide.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci looked dumbfounded and opened her pink little mouth as if at the dentist, revealing a healthy pink inside and pearl white teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I mean really wide, I'm sure the book covers that.\u201d She didn't actually know if it did or not, she had to admit that she hadn't actually read it. \u201cLike this.\u201d Meghan said and opened her mouth, making it stretch wider and wider in a weird way because things seemed to be proportionally enlarged to some extent on the inside so it wasn't just strangely extended lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci in turn only looked on in awe at the display, she had indeed read about it, but not really considered applying the techniques on herself, the thought was a bit awkward, not that she had anything against doing the eating herself, she had just not looked at herself as the one doing the eating.<br>\r\nThe feeling of not being the predator intensified as she realised that she could easily fit inside the pink cavern Meghan showed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan noticed that the girl was leaning forward, looking into the depth of her mouth, so she leaned forward as well, standing back up as she loomed over the girl and closed her lips just inches from the seat of the chair, trapping most of Bryci's body inside her mouth. She quickly sucked in the jean clad legs and once those were gone her mouth was almost back to normal proportions, a moment later it was and no one could have guessed that she had a full grown albeit short girl sprawled out on her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling the girl around in her mouth, Meghan didn't get much to taste, jeans might look good, but they are a really boring fabric to eat and Bryci hadn't shown much skin at all, only her arms more or less were exposed by the short sleeved top. She hadn't even shown a cleavage, which was probably why Meghan hadn't noticed that the girl was busty at first. Okay, busty was perhaps misguiding, she didn't have huge breasts, though they were certainly larger than Meghan's, and on her five foot soft little delicate frame they did look quite large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little annoyed by the lack of taste Meghan gently let her throat open and leaned her head back causing Bryci to slide on into the darkness leading into the depths below.</span></div></div>",

The flesh held her in place, but it wasn't uncomfortable. It rippled and undulated in strange ways, the result being that she was moved ever downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had first been moved into the giant chasm that had opened up, that was Meghan's  oesophagus, she had expected and feared to fall down flailing into the darkness, but the ride was slow and steady. She wondered where she was, baffled at the thought that she was really just a little snack for this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heartbeat of the giant girl filled her ears, but then she thought she heard something else.<br>\r\nShe couldn't tell what at first, but the sound grew louder, or rather she moved closer as she continued moving ever downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like cursing, then begging, then just sobbing and it sounded like a feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Bryci reached a hard surface. With her hands she examined it, probably the sphincter leading to Meghan's stomach and the sounds were definitely coming from the other side.<br>\r\nShe was perplexed why it was closed, why she wasn't moved through it. Just then the walls around her started rippling again and she was moved back up the way she came, this time much much faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no-time she was back in Meghan's mouth and the girl rolled her about with her tongue a few times before light hit her eyes again and she found herself sliding out onto the bathroom floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoaah! That was awesome!\u201d Bryci exclaimed as she scrambled to get to her feet. \u201cI feared that you were going to eat me.\u201d She said and stopped, leaning forward, eyes fixed on Meghan's slender middle. \u201cYou've already got a meal. That's so cool too.\u201d She said smiling up at Meghan. \u201cNo one could have guessed there was a girl in your stomach. Is that why you let me back out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no.\u201d Meghan assured before she realised that sounded weird. \u201cI brought this one for you.\u201d she added patting her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor me?\u201d Bryci looked stupefied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you need something to practice on and I figured you needed to eat anyhow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat...as in?\u201d Bryci looked doubtful down at her smooth belly. It would have been cute if she didn't look like she'd just been in a wet T-shirt contest and won, those tight jeans made even tighter by their soaked state probably gave her a few bonus points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, as in letting her out over there later.\u201d Meghan said nodding towards the only chair in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci glanced quickly in the direction Meghan had indicated and her legs almost gave way as the realisation hit home. The prospect of a girl, she had already heard her struggling and screaming, soon that girl would be reduced to nothing but waste, the thought was making her tingly all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should probably remove your clothes, unless you don't mind that they rip open, she's pretty big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci got the hint and started with the top, it came off easily enough, even if the wetness made it cling to her skin. \u201cAre you sure I can handle her?\u201d She said as she gave her bra a quizzical look before deciding that it'd probably be best to take it off as well, these things were  expensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn doing so she surprised Meghan a bit, not by the action, but because that she had expected breasts that big to sag at least a little, but there was no hint of that.<br>\r\n\u201cSure you will, I'll help you get her down and if worse comes to worse I'll eat her myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA statement that made Bryci admire the lower regions of Meghan's belly for a moment imagining the girl travelling through there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing she realized that Meghan was watching her and started tugging at her pants, they were indeed tight and the adhesive properties added by the moisture that soaked both them and the girl in question didn't help in the slightest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh... a little help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, sit down.\u201d Meghan instructed and took hold of the bottom of the legs as the girl sat down, then she tugged, not wanting to rip the pants, she tried to be gentle, but as she stopped tugging and instead just raised her arms slowly she lifted the girl off of the floor a couple of inches before the garment finally released it's hold on the girl and she spilled out onto the floor.<br>\r\nShe didn't seem hurt though, as Bryci quickly got up and adjusted her panties, that in their soaked state looked like they'd been painted on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, lets get started shall we?\u201d Meghan said as she looked the short and now shiny wet girl over, realising that she herself was more than a head taller, so they could probably do this standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure...\u201d Bryci said, awaiting instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, mouth open wide. I promise I won't swallow you this time.\u201d Meghan jested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci opened her mouth again, still nothing unusual though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you said you'd read the theory on this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but never put it into practice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell try, will you?\u201d Meghan said as she spread the girl's mouth open with her hands. \u201cOk, the mouth I can hold open, concentrate on the throat instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci did, but it didn't show much. A bit frustrated Meghan figured that as she'd seen what Bryci could do in class she should be able to to just force the girl down her throat and figured she could just as well move ahead anyhow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, here she comes.\u201d Meghan announced as she brought the tall blonde back up her throat and into her mouth, realising that she was still quite tasty, she seemed quite exhausted tough, but playing it safe she kept her mouth tight around the girl, lining her up so that she'd emerge head first and gently eased her forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head that seemed impossibly large at first as it was forced into her mouth surprised Bryci. Luckily she felt Meghan remove her hands and place them in her armpits instead, which was added stability she needed and allowed her to relax.<br>\r\nIn fact she couldn't help but close her eyes and concentrate on the girl entering her mouth, here was one of her fantasies, though she hadn't paid too much attention to who did the eating before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she followed the course as when she had read through the book for the class. Meghan shoved the girl's head into her throat and her body accepted it, in fact she swallowed, pulling more of the girl from her friend. Another swallow followed and then another, she had half forgotten about Meghan, her mind was focused on the girl and what was happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her stomach opened up to accommodate the girl and as the girl started to curl up in there and the final parts of her slid down Bryci's throat, Bryci couldn't help the smile forming on her face as she relished the thought that the girl was about to get digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book was quite thorough when it described a technique and Bryci had taken delight in every last detail, details that now replayed in her mind. And Meghan who was more or less holding the girl upright was a little surprised when she heard Bryci's stomach start to make noises, soon it was gurgling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, you're getting the hang of it. I told you you could do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci blushed as she was brought back to the real world and hurriedly pulled her hand away that had been moving towards her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had thought I'd leave you here to digest her in peace, but by the sound of it she'll want to come out soon enough.\u201d Meghan pondered this for a moment then added. \u201cEh, in fact she'll be a hassle when she does, you should probably take a shower, then we can head over to the school.\u201d She hadn't thought Bryci would live this close by, but as she did she remembered something rather important about normal toilets. \u201cI heard more or less all toilets there are...made for girls like her, unlike yours over there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I do need to take a shower...\u201d Bryci said a little uncomfortable, her belly had almost stopped gurgling and it wasn't because it was almost done with the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll wait outside.\u201d Meghan said as she saw Bryci pull off her socks and panties, then she stepped out and closed the door to the bathroom behind her. She didn't really know what to do, she figured that she could flick on the TV, but looking around the room she couldn't see one.<br>\r\nThe narrow opening without a door in it did beckon, kitchens were kind of strange to her, she did have this uncomplicated diet and it rarely took her in the direction of a kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she wasn't about to eat any of the contents she didn't feel like looking around in there could bother Bryci any. <br>\r\nStepping inside she saw that there was a tiny little fourteen inch TV on the opposite side of a counter as the microwave. But now she was more interested in poking around She found the fridge fully stocked and the larder overflowing, the huge sacks of rice surprised her the most, she figured economy pack was good, but finding twenty kilo sacks piled upon one another in the kitchen closet of a little girl that lived alone, was a little surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDone prodding, she turned her attention to the TV, even if she felt certain there'd be nothing interesting on, it'd occupy her for a while at least.</span></div></div>",

Something that reduced the bulge in her gut to the point that it was passable for something natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving dried up she emerged to find Meghan in the kitchen watching stupid commercials, so she turned to her wardrobes. Tossing the towel onto the bed she donned a pair of panties before giving the bulge in her gut a poke and looking through her pants collection, finding what she looked for, a pair that were a bit looser than most she had. She still didn't manage to button up the last two buttons in the fly, but that was a lot better than any of her normal jeans would have managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a look in one of the full length mirrors that covered the wardrobe doors, she half saw the girl pass down her naked torso again and settle as the little bulge in her lower belly, it made her go for a sports-bra, figuring it could hopefully handle the stretching. Over that she pulled a purple stretchy top with short sleeves. It didn't really want to stay down far enough to cover up the fact that she was unable to fully close her fly, but it'd have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, Meghan. I'm ready.\u201d Bryci called to the girl in the kitchen as she sat down on the bed and pulled a pair of sock on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, I was wondering if you'd fallen asleep in there.\u201d She said turning of the telly. \u201cI hope you don't mind that I took a look around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn't help noticing that your kitchen was pretty well stocked.\u201d Meghan said as the two put their shoes on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, the last couple of weeks I have just been so ridiculously hungry. It's like I'm hungry all the time.\u201d as on cue her belly let out a mild grumble. \u201cSee...I mean, you heard that?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan smiled. \u201cYeah, I guess she wasn't that filling...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sentence hit Bryci like a slap in the face and she almost lost her footing, she couldn't help the smile on her face or the moan that escaped her. \u201cMmm...I guess not...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReady to leave they:</span></div></div>",

She took a look into the bowl. Yeah, there was a faint line circling the inside that had to be the seam, she would never had spotted it if she hadn't been looking for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, she snickered, there was a girl who wanted to get out, so she should stop stalling and take up her place on the porcelain throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one thing that bothered her at first, and that was that she had never seen the girl, so she had no idea what she'd looked like before or how big she was, she'd had her eyes closed when she'd swallowed the girl and she wasn't experienced enough to tell the size of a girl from that action, she had been big, but that was because she'd been a full grown person, not very specific.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn another note, she realized that the girl was still quite big, her butt protested as the girl started edging her way back out and Bryci started understanding what Meghan had meant that the girl would be a hassle on the way out.<br>\r\nOut and out she came, just then the chair's special function kicked in and the bottom gave away, pulling the last of the girl from Bryci's system as the mass fell into the pipes below. She was glad she was were she was, because that'd been a nightmare to take care of had it been in her own toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was left with the feeling that it hadn't been that satisfactory to dispose of the girl, it'd been half and half like the meal getting some payback, she hoped there was something that could be done about that.<br>\r\nA meal shouldn't be a bother to it's predator, at least not in her imagination and certainly not leave them with a sore bottom. At least she found out that she was clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange, for the last week she hadn't needed to wipe even once, she'd checked of course, but she'd been clean every time. Not that she was complaining...hmm... hadn't the book said something about that if one bothered to digest the meals properly? It had been a boring chapter with general discussions and no action, if she recalled correctly, she would have to look that up again when she got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and took a look in the bowl, but it was clean...hmm...she didn't even get to see what the girl had been reduced to. Well there was always next time. <br>\r\nA thought that as she buttoned up her pants again caused her stomach to emit another grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah seconds sounded like a good idea in more ways than one, she'd really like to see the person first this time though. Oh delicious thought... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan while waiting for Bryci to finish up had decided to do some recognizance, not that she ventured far, just the corridor up and down.<br>\r\nShe'd found only a couple of people in two of the computer labs, but the third one, that was situated between those two was pretty much crowded and threatened to have students spill over to the others, worst case scenario while they were going at it. So she kind of ruled them all out and the main study center was a nightmare, with tons of people.<br>\r\nMost of the remaining rooms were classrooms, obviously empty by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe concluded that they'd either have to wait or go somewhere else, luckily the university had placed tables and chairs, or sometimes benches in just about every nook and cranny and the supposedly fancy architecture allowed for quite a few of those. There was method behind the madness as people usually like peace and quiet when they study, even if it's in group it's nice not to have to shout over the people sitting at the next table when working with your colleagues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough today she felt that design feature, might come in handy for a completely different reason, if the study center was that crowded, she had good hopes of finding people elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mind made up, she went back to wait for Bryci, though the girl was already done when she got there and discussed their options with the girl.</span></div></div>",

Meghan would have to agree, not that he looked like a total slob, just your average guy who'd been lost in a game or project for a few days too many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went through the building floor by floor and initially most of the labs were too crowded, but then they turned empty instead, by the fifth floor they'd almost given up when Bryci jumping up to peer through the small round window in the door saw that there were two girls in there, sitting side by side and opened the door without consulting Meghan first, who just followed along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interruption caused the girls to look up from their work for a moment, but they didn't recognise the cheerful girl that stepped inside, before the door could close though another one entered as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Meghan!\u201d One of them called, confusing Meghan as she didn't recognise the redhead, nor her slightly softer brunette friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Meghan answered none the less and walked over to the girls a tad confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were going through the assignments for Thursday's class, but we're totally stuck on 324, especially the B-part of the problem. Have you figured it out?\u201d The redhead continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I haven't gotten that far yet, but let me take a look, maybe I can figure it out.\u201d She said realizing that they must be in the same class for organic chemistry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls parted a little as Meghan stepped around behind them, so that there'd be room for her to lean on down between them and have a look at the problem. Thus they were a little surprised when her hands were placed on their outer sides and forced them together before everything went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan didn't really savour the two, she just quickly engulfed them all the way to the chairs' seats, then sucked the rest of them in as she swallowed repeatedly in order to get them down quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci was still smiling, having watched the show with interest and wonder. Still something bothered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou knew those two?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, can't say I've ever seen them before, but judging by this...\u201d Meghan said and held up a book on organic chemistry, \u201c...I'd guess they were in the same chem-class as me, but there's like two-three hundred students taking that, I've no idea how they knew my name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci nodded, accepting the explanation, before moving her eyes from Meghan's face, down to her trim and still flat belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShall we go somewhere more private or is this fine?\u201d Meghan asked, gathering the girls' things not wanting to leave stuff behind, but more importantly she realised that they had solved most of the problems for the assignment that was due Thursday and she herself hadn't even started on them yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's more private?\u201d Bryci wondered seeing as how few people had been around and now they were inside a room with a pretty well isolated door. Admittedly there was still the chance of someone coming along, she just considered it slim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell higher up for one, I'm guessing there's none above this floor as there's no students' rooms up there and the further up the father away will we be from anyone if these two decide to cause a ruckus.\u201d Meghan said patting her belly. \u201cI'm also pretty sure there's a handicap bathroom on each floor. They don't have windows.\u201d She added, nodding towards the small round glass-window in the door leading into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConvinced Bryci agreed to go further up the house and accepted the bag that Meghan had managed to cram both the girl's stuff into, despite that, it didn't bother her much, a couple of weeks ago she'd have complained about hauling something that heavy around.<br>\r\nEven the stairs didn't bother her, she knew they opted out the elevator because they wanted to see and hear if there were anyone around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the stairwell on the eighth floor even though there were a few more above that, they looked around before searching for the bathroom in question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hardly hidden, with signs in the ceiling and on the walls pointing the way and there was indeed a handicap bathroom amongst the half-dozen restrooms that clustered together.<br>\r\nFinding it unlocked, Meghan opened the door to find it:</span></div></div>",

It's fairly roomy, but these things usually are, Meghan guesses that it's at least three by two and a half meters.<br>\r\nShould give them plenty of room for what they have in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci follows Meghan inside and closes the door behind her and at a nod from Meghan she locks it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do you want to do this?\u201d Meghan asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci ponders for a moment, she did see them before, but she then realises that they are two and she want to see which one she gets. \u201cCan you hold her still while I eat her? Not feeding her to me like you did the other one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, shouldn't be a problem.\u201d Meghan says, feeling pretty sure there's little the girls can do. \u201cShe might kick about quite a bit though, there's nothing I can do about that.\u201d She adds as she realises that she probably needs one arm to hold the girl and the other to keep her silenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. It's worth a try. Otherwise you can just swallow her again, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is always that.\u201d Meghan smiles, already feeling around in her stomach, trying to get just one of the girls back up her throat, a little trickier business, but she's had plenty of practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the girl is back in her mouth and Meghan swirls her around a bit, she can't help herself to a little taste, as the girl is wearing a fairly short skirt, leaving quite a bit of soft smooth flesh between crotch and feet. It would seem the girl lost her shoes and possible socks somewhere in Meghan's handling of her, but then again the rest of her clothing isn't taking the experience too well either, the soaked formerly white skirt is threatening to come off at every lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan realised Bryci was watching her with both curiosity and anticipation and she blushed a bit for having gotten a bit carried away while her friend was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe straightened the girl out along the length of her tongue and started pushing the girl back out, letting her slide smoothly from her lips feet first. She took it fairly slow, so that she could control the girl as she emerged and keep her arms pinned. Giving Bryci ample time to realize and enjoy the realization that Meghan had had the girl entirely inside her mouth and sloshed her about in there like a piece of candy, a concept intriguing in its own right, but pale by the comparison to the fact that Meghan had just actually done it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci wished she could treat the girl the same way, but she knew she couldn\u2019t. That though didn\u2019t mean that she couldn\u2019t enjoy what she could do to the girl.<br>\r\nShe eyed her thoroughly while she emerged and soon enough Meghan had one arm around the girl pinning her arms and one hand around the girl\u2019s jaw, keeping it shut and the girl\u2019s screams and pleas to a muffled mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan swallowed the skirt that had come off in the process and motioned for Bryci to begin with the girl\u2019s feet, they were the only real moving parts of the trapped girl as Meghan had pinned her legs between her own knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci crouched down and carefully reached out, expecting the girl to break loose at any moment she feared getting kicked in the face in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat however didn\u2019t happen, instead she failed to grasp the girl\u2019s ankles a couple of times as the feet flailed to and fro, but then got a good grip on each and to her own surprise found that she had little problem stopping them and keeping them in place after doing so.<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t help but look up at the trapped brunette again. The girl was half a head taller than herself and thicker all around, probably too thick to dress like she had, but it all worked out for the better, now that the skirt was gone Bryci could see quite a bit of her soft flesh, still dripping wet and she couldn\u2019t help thinking that she actually looked pretty tasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought in her head, Bryci decided to stall no more and stuffed the girl\u2019s feet into her mouth.<br>\r\nShe was so used to fantasizing about the process, where she usually wasn\u2019t the one doing the eating either, that she had to stop several times to open her eyes again as she realised that she was missing out. She didn\u2019t have to imagine the ordeal, she could watch it, there really was a full sized girl slowly slipping down her throat and she was tasty too, really tasty.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSmooth calves were exchanged for soft thighs who were replaced by a juicy bottom and then a delicious midsection. This was when Meghan forced the girl\u2019s arms down Bryci\u2019s throat along the girl\u2019s body.<br>\r\nBryci had remained in her crouching position so Meghan was bending over some as she continued to guide the girl in and keep her mouth shut, all the while the girl bloated Bryci\u2019s torso out.<br>\r\nSoon the girl\u2019s own torso was gone, it\u2019d been covered by her top and her chest had been facing the roof of Bryci\u2019s mouth so it\u2019d actually been the least tasty and interesting part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt left only her head and Meghan guided it in between the little raven haired beauty\u2019s lips, before she withdrew her own hands with a wet noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shorter girl stood up as she did, apparently without much trouble, despite the bulge up front that was as big as the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci again concentrated on what the book had said as was routine when she was fantasizing and Meghan watched as Bryci closed her eyes and her belly started to make noises that wasn\u2019t caused by the struggling girl trapped inside it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was she?\u201d Meghan queried, breaking Bryci\u2019s trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, delicious...Thanks!\u201d She managed and like before the noises from her stomach diminished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d Meghan said. \u201cI did say I was to teach you a thing or two, but so far I\u2019ve just fed you...do you want a few hints?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I\u2019d love to...\u201d Bryci said uncertain, it was a bit personal for her the whole ordeal, but she really did want to learn more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell have a seat then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci turned around and then paused as she realized that there was only really one seat in the room. \u201cShould I, you know...make myself ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind, and that\u2019s the way she\u2019s leaving, is it not?\u201d Meghan said realising that she was quite looking forward to watching Bryci digest the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t plan on letting her out any other way.\u201d Bryci said as she struggled with her clothes and her moving belly. \u201cThough I think she\u2019s got some problem with that route.\u201d She said smiling as she seated herself and put her hands on her belly in a way that indicated she referred to the girl inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan thought for a moment and jumped in her head to a few quick tricks that she taught Madeline and began explaining them to Bryci.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no. Don\u2019t jump to quick fixes. I want to learn, please be thorough. I hadn\u2019t planned on going anywhere before this girl had left the building. Are you in a hurry?\u201d Bryci interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t what Meghan had expected at all, but she realised that Bryci was right, it was better to explore every aspect in the long run. \u201cWell..no I guess not, these girls have done most of my homework for me, so I suppose I\u2019m not really...Shall we try this again then...Alright...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci was positively surprised, Meghan, having to put a bit more thought into what she did herself and transferring that into words and in what end to start made her slow the pace and eventually she settled in a methodical droning while she kept searching her brain and her body for both the words, actions and things to say.<br>\r\nTo Bryci, this was terrific, she closed her eyes and focused on her insides, she found that Meghan really had a quite pleasant voice and once she got the hang of the telling part, Bryci felt like she had her own personal narrator for her fantasy, describing every last detail of what was happening to the poor girl inside her. <br>\r\nThe only real problem was That she couldn\u2019t very well start pleasuring herself so she kept her hands as busy as she could stroking her gurgling and diminishing belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only stopped Meghan when she realised that the girl was all liquefied and ready for her intestines, which made Meghan switch to describing that process instead and watched with some interest as the dome of Bryci\u2019s belly moved lower and really started to shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all Bryci could do to keep from coming right then and there when she realized that the girl was now reduced to that solid lump of waste ready to come out of her backside.<br>\r\nLast time she had been interested to see the end result, now she just wanted to get it over with before she embarrassed herself in front of Meghan. <br>\r\nSo she was actually quite relieved as the girl slipped out nice and quick and she heard and felt the slight draft as the toilet vacated its contents, for the girl had still been more than large enough to make the chair\u2019s special function to kick in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci started to clean up, but found that she was clean already and got up from the porcelain chair. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s your turn now.\u201d She said and motioned for Meghan to take the seat while she got her clothes back in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve already eaten. But I do realise we can only let her go that way.\u201d Meghan said pointing to the chair. \u201cSo sure I can take care of her, or if you\u2019re up for it...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci got the hint, She wasn\u2019t full, she wasn\u2019t even sure if she could get full anymore seeing as she vacated her meals in short order. She did fear putting on weight though and coming across as greedy. Though Meghan did offer her the girl...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s a bit eye-catching to walk about with a belly as big as yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, the book doesn\u2019t say much on the subject and well I\u2019ve only really eaten normal food before. You have to digest that anyhow, but it\u2019s not normally something you need to hide, so I haven\u2019t...\u201d Bryci excused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll go easy on you.\u201d Meghan assured as she started to bring the redhead up. Her clothes were truly soaked and luckily not too thick, she did have pants, but it was some thin fabric. <br>\r\nSo Meghan played rough with her on purpose, the poor girl getting beat up as Meghan sucked on her and tossed her about as a hard candy until her clothes tore, then biting down on the tearing fabric, she ripped the garments off of the girl\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while, but after that she swallowed the remnants of the clothes down and was able to taste the girl properly. She was tasty, but Meghan thought the other one had been tastier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci stood there waiting and watched, she did wonder what Meghan was up to, but figured that with her mouth full she couldn\u2019t form much of an answer anyway, so she settled for waiting, somewhat patiently. After all, she was the one getting a free meal here and some very nifty lessons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually two feet emerged from Meghan\u2019s lips and she motioned for Bryci to dig in, but she just grabbed the ankles instead and crouched down like she had before she started eating the brunette earlier. She wanted a closer look at this girl as well. And as the redhead emerged Bryci realised what Meghan had been up to, seeing as the only garment the girl still had on, were a pair of soaked and tormented red panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited until all the girl was out before putting the girl\u2019s feet in her mouth, this redhead might be in much better shape than her friend had been before Bryci gave her a new one, but Meghan\u2019s treatment of her had beaten all energy out of her and she hung limply in Meghan\u2019s grasp even though she was getting eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci didn\u2019t complain though, the girl still tasted great and without struggles she didn\u2019t have to worry too much, so she could let herself relax and enjoy this meal more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill without the rigidness of the struggling meals before, she had a slimy aspect to her, not in a distasteful way like eating a snail or anything, but gravity alone wanted to make her already wet and slippery form to just slide on down, so she did more or less just that. All Bryci had to do really was to relax and guide her on her way down. It didn\u2019t even take a minute before the girl was just a bulge in her belly, a very large one at that. Bryci had left her fly open and that was a good thing because it would have been forced open otherwise and her purple top was hiked up so high it didn\u2019t really cover more than her sports bra did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready.\u201d Bryci said and patted her huge gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d Meghan said and opened her mouth wide and bent down over the much shorter girl.<br>\r\nBut then Meghan pulled back, she\u2019d never even touched Bryci, but the girl had been head and shoulders inside that dark chasm, so it was perhaps not so surprising that she looked a bit taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that, but you do look nicely fattened up.\u201d Meghan giggled and patted Bryci\u2019s big belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci\u2019s brain struggled to process it all for a real response. She did know that that was another aspect of fantasy she\u2019d have to explore, finding herself getting a bit moist as well as eying Meghan a bit more thorough than was prudent, not that Meghan noticed as she wrote it off as just her friend coping with the shock of her prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh...was that a compliment?\u201d Bryci struggled. \u201c...No, you just called me fat, didn\u2019t you?\u201d She finally settled, crossing her arms on top of her bulging belly in a playfully miffed manner, trying really hard not to make as big a deal of Meghan\u2019s prank as it really was to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did in earnest find it scary and struggled to cope with the fact that Meghan could eat and digest her on the spot with little trouble, but at the same time she also realised that if Meghan would have had any intention of eating her, then that would have happened a long time ago. So she would have to harden her nerves and learn to accept this new world turned upside down and the morbid humour that did come with it, she did see the funny aspect of Meghan\u2019s joke, but that didn\u2019t mean she could bring herself to laugh at it just yet. <br>\r\nProbably didn\u2019t help that it had turned her on as much as scared her seeing as embarrassment and laughter don\u2019t play along that well either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Bryci remained standing and at Meghan\u2019s request tried to hold back digestion least she\u2019d digest the girl in her stomach before they were done. <br>\r\nIt actually proved harder than she thought, as she hadn\u2019t been interested in that aspect before, so Meghan had to start her instructions there before moving on to the actual task at hand. The bulging dome of Bryci\u2019s belly, which so happened to be under Meghan\u2019s hands, being prodded and poked as Meghan guided Bryci\u2019s attention to different areas, organs and ways to perform a technique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actual poking tended to break Bryci\u2019s concentration, causing her to drop all techniques previously applied and only focus on the one Meghan was currently telling her about, probably for the better in the long run seeing as it\u2019s a tad hard to listen when you\u2019re multitasking, but it did mean that the bulge in Bryci\u2019s middle moved about quite a bit despite its occupant hardly even flinching, as it shrank and re-grew and shifted this way and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Meghan slowed down and stopped the poking and instead just went back to repeat the things she\u2019d already covered while gently stoking the dome, she got as shocked as she had been earlier in class as she dome quickly shrank away and she found herself rubbing Bryci\u2019s smooth flat belly after just a couple of moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized she was gaping dumbfounded, but luckily she noticed that Bryci\u2019s eyes were closed, so she gathered herself together as Bryci\u2019s own hands came up to rub the belly as well. \u201cThat\u2019s the way girl. You\u2019re getting the hang of this.\u201d Meghan said, trying not to sound as impressed as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci, having had her arms at her sides while she concentrated, opened her eyes at those words and looked down surprised when her hands didn\u2019t meet the protruding bulge they expected.<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow...\u201d She giggled. \u201cLook at that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed the top of her belly and gave it a hard poke. <br>\r\n\u201cI can feel her in there...\u201d her smile faltered a bit \u201cNow I kind of wished she\u2019d move around some more...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t forgotten to give her air have you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell give her a bath then! That should wake her right up, I suspect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci didn\u2019t really answer, she just donned a smile that with her rather sultry appeal to begin with failed somewhat at being mischievous and crossed over to being rather scary. The ominous gurgles that followed from her belly didn\u2019t change that one bit and Meghan watched with some fascination as Bryci\u2019s belly-caressing hands moved lower, indicating the state of the girl inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Bryci undid her pants fully and retook her previous seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe much preferred this digestion to her previous ones. This time the meal was small and helpless and didn\u2019t feel like a strain...well up until the point where she had to expel it. There it ruined her experience, not painful, but not effortless and not insignificant either. The remains of the girl were barely less than the previous one and that size difference was most likely due to their original size difference.<br>\r\nLuckily the chair again bottomed out, so she wouldn\u2019t have to face the cause of her indignation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret, promise not to tell anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I promise!\u201d Bryci sounded surprisingly sincere for once, so Meghan didn\u2019t push the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Blainey is holding an advanced class, and well, I\u2019m in it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m quitting as a TA for you guys. Hopefully it will be covered there. My sister said something about something like that and she\u2019s kind of snoopy, and usually right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo she knows?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Meghan lied. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask her if I were you though as she\u2019d probably just try if she could, using you as a test subject.\u201d She added a bit more truthfully. \u201cThen again that\u2019s her usual way of greeting people, so you might not have time to ask in the first place, which is why I won\u2019t invite you over to our place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci looked both intrigued and a little paranoid.<br>\r\n\u201cIs she here at school too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...\u201d Meghan started, not sure if she should mention that it was actually her younger sister. \u201cSchool should be safe...from her...\u201d she added realizing that Blainey had been teaching girls to eat each other for years, who knew how many hungry girls were out there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do realise though that the class you\u2019re taking, the v101, isn\u2019t a new one. I don\u2019t know how many times Blainey has held that, or  how many of those girls are about, or how much of a danger they present. I don\u2019t know the code of conduct. Perhaps they don\u2019t eat each other? Perhaps there\u2019s some secret badge or something to tell who\u2019s taken the class and that\u2019s a way of leaving each other alone?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping her rambling for a moment, she concluded. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard of anything like that though, so you should probably keep an eye out. And if you do hear anything, please tell me right away, will you?\u201d She said making the \u2018call me\u2019-sign with her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you think there might actually be a lot of girls out there actually eating people and not just swallowing stuff, like we do in class?\u201d Bryci realised she hadn\u2019t actually thought about it as much as dreamt about it, fantasy and reality, tended, even for a dreamy girls such as her, to be two different things and she usually found the former more interesting than the latter, even if this evening was proving that she might have been wrong in that assessment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...\u201d Meghan started, remembering the girl she encountered under the water at the beach and the lifeguard...then her mind wandered to Madeline, whom she had fed herself and the way Madeline had talked about it, seriously doubting Madeline would stop eating people. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a few.\u201d She said realising that she had forgotten about her mom\u2019s and Professor Blaney\u2019s research teams, not to mention the ladies themselves...even though she avoided thinking about her mother\u2019s eating habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci just nodded and her mind started wandering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re done here right?\u201d Meghan said as she picked up the now flushed girls\u2019 belongings intending to see just how much of her homework the girls had done for her and stepped back out into the hallway, assuming Bryci would follow.<br>\r\nThat the girl did, but she sort of sneaked a bit paranoid about getting jumped by someone but mostly just wanting to try and sneak up on someone and catching them in the act, now that Meghan had convinced her that that was actually a real possibility and not just a scenario that could play out in her perverted mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t bad at it, Meghan didn\u2019t hear her, so she turned around to see if Bryci was coming along and found the girl moving suspiciously right behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSneaking\u201d Bryci whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I want to see what you saw, someone doing what we just did and we can\u2019t catch them if we make a lot of noise, remember how we tried not to get caught earlier?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I do...\u201d Meghan sighed... not that she wasn\u2019t intrigued by the idea. It was after all one of the main reasons she\u2019d taught Madeline and Bryci in the first place. Then again getting caught sneaking around like Bryci was, would be pretty embarrassing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t think my schedule is all that busy, so don\u2019t be a stranger.\u201d Meghan said as they waved goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really knowing what to expect from the girl, she was a little surprised to get a sms later with Bryci\u2019s MSN and email. She responded with sending a picture of herself poking her tongue out like Bryci had done before and a message with her YIM name, also stating that MSN was a total spyware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she wasn\u2019t so surprised when her computer blipped as Bryci had joined her preferred instant messaging service and sent her a message. School really had to take precedence at this point though so she kept the chatting to a minimum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Meghan had paid a bit too little attention to the actual assignments she\u2019d been given and felt a bit bad about turning Bryci down the next day, when she asked if they could meet up later. Apparently there had been a group assignment that she had totally missed and it wasn\u2019t helping that when she found a group that she could join, she just wanted to eat most of them, two of the guys for being so damn annoying and the other two girls for just looking so delicious. Not that the last guy wasn\u2019t rather tasty looking as well, but he didn\u2019t show nearly as much skin as the girls did... Perhaps it would have helped if she\u2019d gotten something to eat before sitting down and spending most of the evening with them.<br>\r\nHeck even after they were done she had to look at their finished assignment to get their names, because she couldn\u2019t remember them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, when they were done she did control her urges and went and found someone else to eat, some male student that ogled her as she walked by. He hadn\u2019t been hard to lure somewhere private, even if they had already been alone, she had decided against taking the risk of doing it right then and there.<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t learn his name either, nor his taste, as she\u2019d just been too damn hungry to get the clothes off of him. At least he\u2019d been a hefty guy and thus more filling than most and the highlight of her day, which was saying something, she really hoped tomorrow would be a lot better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started well enough. Even if Meghan couldn\u2019t help but feel that there would be some unforeseen task or assignment that she had missed that\u2019d jump her and ruin it as well.<br>\r\nSo she was relieved when school was over and she was only given half right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had been an semi-unforeseen task she\u2019d neglected, but it was one she could live with, as it was Bryci that had texted her, asking her to bring a few \u2018friends\u2019 over, like the one she had brought last time.<br>\r\nNot being able to help the grin on her face at the cute way she had phrased it, she had texted back that she would see what she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far the school was a pretty busy place though, so she wasn\u2019t sure what to do. Thinking that if she should carry some over to Bryci, then she should probably eat first, carrying people around tended to help you build up an appetite and she hadn\u2019t eaten since last night.<br>\r\nFrankly there\u2019d be one less to carry if she ate her meal first, plus with any luck the corridors wouldn\u2019t be so buzzing with people after she\u2019d taken care of her own needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t easy, people everywhere and all the skin showing didn\u2019t help either, it just felt like teasing. For some reason they always seemed to be in groups. Yes the girls seemed to always be in groups she corrected herself realising that her hungry eyes had focused on the bare delicious looking skin and neglecting the more covered up guys...whom she noticed were quite frequently moving about on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also realised that she was in the entirely wrong place. If she wanted to snag someone she should be in one of the less trafficked areas, like some corridor a few stories up where there\u2019d hopefully be the occasional comer or goer from a computer lab or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlan laid out she waited by the toilets as they offered a bit of an alcove into which she could drag her victim. There was also the possibility of someone coming to use it, to which she hoped she could decipher their intent in time. Meaning that she could let them do that and she\u2019d eat them afterwards instead, as she didn\u2019t really appreciate the mental image of her prey being scared shitless in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a look in one of the mirrors and adjusting her garb to help grab a man\u2019s attention she stepped back out and waited for a suitable target to entice, ensnare and engulf.<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long after that something caught her attention.</span></div></div>",

With them having decided to meet up at Bryci's place by five that did leave three quarters of an hour. So she could wait here and if nothing showed up go for a more aggressive approach, which she knew by experience was the harder way of doing things as it was hard to find the opportunity to strike. Admittedly it was the more fun way to go, even if it tended to leave one with a hungry belly more often than not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind she settled for waiting... the boring kind, where even the seconds seem to drag out, as was apparent by the fact that when she thought she had waited forever and got her cellphone out again it said only eight minutes had passed.<br>\r\nReturning it, with a sigh, to its place in the outer pocket of her school-bag of choice for the day, a shoulder-slung overgrown handbag-looking thing in black leather, before putting the bag back down on the floor again in order for it not to be in the way when she got busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped herself from humming a tune and only after having let her fingertips tap frustratedly on the wall did she bring herself from doing that as swell and struggled from doing any other such action of boredom while the minutes slowly crept passed, without a single soul passing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus when she heard girls talking down the hall and coming her way, she felt relieved and decided to confront them despite the fact that they weren't lone easy pickings.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was pretty obvious that by their conversation that the girls had just finished a session in a lab and were coming up here to write their report, probably the same as the guy she had eaten just before, but unlike him the girls seemed to be paying more attention to where they were heading. Making Meghan realise that she couldn't just stand there and stare at them while they approached, so she settled for faking finishing up a bathroom visit and stepping back out while they passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked pretty well, they paid her no mind and like with the guy before she quickly snuck up behind them and before they got suspicious she struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a spur of the moment she decided to try something. Thus reaching out, she put a hand on the side of each of the girls and squeezed them together, while her mouth opened wide and descended over their heads. <br>\r\nGlad to hear only their muffled protests and feeling their erratic struggles as she worked their shoulders and torsos down her throat. Meghan hence had them fairly pinned before the girls panic stricken minds came up with more creative and useful ways of resisting, but by then Meghan had a good hold on both of them and just crammed them both in a foot or more at a time, meaning that in just a few short swallows her lips closed behind their feet and she was able to swallow them down. Feeling with delight as they wiggled and squirmed, taking delight even in the small inaudible vibrations, once they had settled in her still flat stomach, that came from the girls screaming their heads off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would do nicely Meghan decided as she patted her belly and retrieved her school-bag, deciding to hide the girls away enough to give them ample of room to move about. She always did like it when they didn't just sit still and whimper and whine, these girls seemed pretty energetic and feisty, she hoped they kept a little spunk for Bryci, but that didn't mean she couldn't enjoy them first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the walk wasn't long it was just a few minutes later that Meghan rang the bell on Bryci's door, hoping the girl would be home despite her being twenty minutes early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lock of the door moved before the handle, apparently it was set to auto-lock upon being closed. Not that it mattered, Meghan was more focused on the warm eager smile of the short pretty girl that stood in the opening. She decided to give the girl a hug, barging on in without a formal invitation. Holding the girl in one arm she reached back and closed the door with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello to you too?!\u201d Bryci giggled as her feet dangled a foot off the floor in Meghan's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you were blocking the way.\u201d Meghan joked as she set the girl down in order to get her shoes and short jacket off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci put her right hand on her guest's belly as the girl turned around, spurring a \u201cYes, I brought you a little something...\u201d from Meghan, much to her delight. So with her initial question answered she trotted back into the main room, eager to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan soon made her company, taking a seat on the made bed opposite Bryci, who had claimed the only real chair in the room, the office chair by her desk.<br>\r\nThe short raven-haired girl had on the same pants she had changed into after her shower the day before yesterday and a similar top that would allow her belly to stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I have one right now?\u201d Bryci inquired. \u201cI'm soo hungry...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan hadn't noticed before, but her friend's belly was more or less continuously grumbling, perhaps that was why she hadn't, if it had just been the occasional roar, then it would have stuck out and grabbed one's attention.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I was figuring you should really be catching your own meals...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww... come on... Please!\u201d Bryci whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don't be such a miserable little puppy. I have an idea...\u201d Meghan smirked, looking quite pleased with herself and the idea she'd gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet undressed...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Bryci cut her off, repeating her earlier question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust listen...\u201d Meghan continued. \u201c... You don't want your clothes ruined and I very much intend to eat you and taste you while doing so. Once in my stomach...\u201d She said patting the flat expanse hiding the two people already inside. \u201c...you can eat the girls already there.\u201d She said not knowing how much of this the girls in there heard of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell al-right...\u201d Bryci said resigning to Meghan's request, or demand, not really sure which it was. She did however not find the idea at all as bad as she had let on. Meghan stating that she'd eat her had sent a shiver down her spine, in a good way.<br>\r\nSo she got out of her chair and started pulling her garments off, tossing them onto the bed, pausing only to see if Meghan wanted her bra and panties to go as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sports-bra did join the other clothes on bed, but her pink lace panties were only at her knees when Meghan grabbed her hips and shoved her whole bottom into her mouth in one go. A hard suck and she was folded over forwards, with only her shoulders, arms and lower legs sticking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan leaned her head back and Bryci tumbled into her mouth entirely.<br>\r\nThe short girl was delicious and hidden away inside the tall blonde's mouth Bryci was indeed short. Laying flat out on Meghan's tongue she wasn't even reaching from her teeth to the back of her throat, a position she found herself in after Meghan had tossed her about and tasted her some, the saliva covering every inch of the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot content there however Meghan continued to enjoy the flavour of her black-haired treat, who in turn was more or less forced to hug the giant tongue, but she wasn't forced to hump and grind herself into its pink slippery slithering flesh. Bryci didn't much mind the abuse, apparently she could handle the battering that would have left a normal girl bruised and beaten. Instead she had to struggle when she felt like she was going to cream all over Meghan's tongue.<br>\r\nLuckily Meghan swallowed her before she failed and she let herself climax in the girl's throat instead, spasming as the muscles around her rhythmically pushed her downwards in a controlled and effective manner and a moment later she was forced through a sphincter and to her surprise dropped into an open space.<br>\r\nShe had expected to be forced into a fairly tight slimy chamber with another girl, not falling some feet and land on a moist and fairly hard surface, but not slimy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe darkness made her incapable of assessing her surroundings properly though, there wasn't the slightest shimmer of light. It felt weird, in here with her in this darkness was someone else, yet all she could sense was the overwhelming heat and humidity of the chamber and the noises that surrounded it, most notably the steady thump-thump of Meghan's heart. Well there was the steady complaining of her own displeased gut, but that was about it.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't discern a single ripple going through the fleshy walls of the chamber she was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't far, she had hardly begun before her hands blundered onto something that yelped and struggled to get away, but in the dark and already pressed against the wall of her prison, the girl didn't get anywhere before Bryci had realised what she was and reacted. Putting her hands out to grab some part of the girl or other and as she was on her knees and the girl standing, she got one fist of calf and another of ankle, which served her just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tug on both revealed that she could apparently lift the girl with surprising ease and as a result the girl toppled over, falling away from the naked girl holding her lower legs and enveloping her futilely twitching feet, that she was unable to kick about as long as they were trapped in the iron grip of the unseen woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yelled for help, her friend was in the darkness somewhere, but no answer came. All she could do was struggle as best she could and continue screaming. Apparently it did her little good as she quickly felt her lower legs and calves follow her feet down her aggressor\u2019s throat and trying to hit her opponent with her balled up fists resulted in only a couple of glancing hits before they were pinned and crammed in along with her hips, only to be swallowed down quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot until her waist was sliding into her aggressor did she sense her friend, who apparently had a hard time making out where anyone were as in the pitch black darkness she had only her hearing to go by. A few uncomfortable impacts on her right shin and thigh through the skin of the girl eating her, told her that her friend was kicking her foe as best she could. It didn't seem to slow the girl down though, who just grunted and using her hands forcefully crammed the rest of her current meal into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around as she swallowed hard, Bryci fended herself, and managed after a couple of tries to grab the kicking leg, quickly cramming it into her mouth and as the other foot came up to stomp at her she shoved that in alongside the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling pretty satisfied with herself she decided to take her time with this girl and enjoy both her struggles and pleas for mercy, only when the girls fists came flying did she speed up enough to get them under control, but then she returned to her slow pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Meghan had first stood up pondering what to do, but had fairly quickly settled for sitting down again, this time in the office chair and have a swing around before leaning back and wait for Bryci to finish.<br>\r\nShe could feel the initial commotion, but then she'd been moving about herself and by the time she settled down and concentrated not much was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting some air out of her stomach would let it close in on the occupants and enable her to feel what was going on in there, but she decided against it, she did after all want Bryci to be able to move about. But not feeling much she did wonder if the girl was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBryci are you done in there?\u201d Meghan asked down to her trim middle. \u201c...punch once if you are and twice if you're not...\u201d she added realising that Bryci couldn't very well yell back. The girls had been screaming their heads of since she swallowed them at school and she hadn't heard a thing only felt some of it, kind of like she felt the two pokes in her stomach wall right now.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, just punch me again when you're ready...\u201d She told her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci was almost done by then, just the girl's shoulders and head outside and that close up her screaming was a real strain on the ears, so she pushed the last of her in to silence her, but then took a while savouring the feeling before she swallowed for the last time, sending the second girl down into her immense gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot able to see the expanse of her stretched out stomach, Bryci could only feel around with her hands and her newly acquired control of her organs. What she could tell was that she was huge and that she felt stuffed, but it also felt great. <br>\r\nThe weight was somewhat cumbersome though, each of the girls she had just eaten probably had a few pounds on her, even so she felt that she could probably walk around carrying them, if it hadn\u2019t been for the displacement of her center of gravity that their protrusion from her body caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey felt great in there, wiggling about, her body hugging them very tight indeed, so they could do little more than squirm. Despite the pleasure they caused she considered digesting them straight away, not being able to move without toppling over was bad enough, but her stomach also called for nutrition. <br>\r\nIt took some effort but she held the thought at bay while she enjoyed their movements some more. She was supposed to practice was she not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, she was. So putting the delightful sensations and her body's demands aside for a moment, Bryci concentrated on her insides and on the lessons she'd been taught so far, Meghan's voice had played through her head plenty of times as she had daydreamed about the night before dozens of times if not hundreds already. Not she tried to recall them again, this time focusing on the part where she hid her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands gently slid over her huge gut as she concentrated, trying as much as she could to make the bulge smaller, but nothing seemed to happen, when Meghan almost nodded off to sleep as she laid back in the office chair she felt Bryci punching her again. By then the girl had given up, if her belly had shrunk any she couldn't tell, she would require Meghan's help again and so she had called for being let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravelling back up Meghan's throat, she was somewhat relieved, she had expected to be let out this way, but her mind had struggled with Meghan's earlier choice of words, her blonde friend had said that she would eat her and not just that she would swallow her. Eating as far as Bryci was concerned involved the meal taking a different route when leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Meghan's mouth Bryci felt herself and her double bulged belly being tasted once more and as Meghan's mouth opened and blinding light flooded in over those giant teeth,  Bryci could see her giant gut for herself, but then she was more occupied by being awestruck from the sights surrounding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't last long though, Meghan leaned forward and she tumbled out of her friend's mouth finding herself caught in her hands and somehow back to normal size in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that was really something...\u201d Bryci managed as she felt herself beginning to shiver a bit in the to her cool air as her sticky saliva cover cooled her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her hands over herself for heat she realised that she came out to ask for help hiding her belly and looked down to find it having been reduced to merely a large potbelly. The sight caused her to check, just to be sure. No she hadn't started digesting, the two girls were still in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPondering if she should ask for help Bryci decided to wait a while and have a shower first, she wasn't that comfortable being naked, or at least the only one being naked in a setting. Sure she'd been so for a while, but then no one had been actually looking at her, it'd been pretty darn dark in Meghan's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll just take a shower...don't go anywhere...\u201d She said, waiting for Meghan's nod before actually heading for the only other real room of the apartment.</span></div></div>",

The skin wasn't tight enough around them to make any contours out, but one could tell it was sort of two separate bulges, each sitting like an American football in the girl's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrying off she returned to her main room, but didn't bother Meghan who was once again watching TV in her small kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan had decided to have another look around while Bryci showered and like last time she seemed to take a while. <br>\r\nThis time she turned her attention to the TV right away, but as there was plenty of commercials and not really anything to watch anyway she ended up having a look around as well, out of boredom more than any real curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she found surprised her, all those bags of rice were gone, she found an empty one in the trash, but that was the only trace, instead of Bryci's larder being filled to the brim, it now gaped more or less empty, as did her refrigerator.<br>\r\nApparently the girl did have a bit of an appetite, unless she'd thrown it all away after having tasted those girls, but that wouldn't explain the empty bags and cans and such in the trash.<br>\r\nNo she felt sure Bryci was hungry, now she just hoped the girl hadn\u2019t gotten carried away with those girls and was spending forever on the can trying to squeeze them down the probably insufficient pipes of this building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opening to the bathroom told her that wasn't the case seeing as Bryci also stepped through it, surprisingly enough still sporting a belly even-though Meghan could hear the gut complaining over the noise of the TV, begging to get the meat sitting inside it already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment for Bryci to get dressed was what Meghan waited before she turned the TV off and went back to the office chair, finding the entertainment of Bryci putting on a tight but stretchy top better than anything the tube had offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bit of a belly you have there...\u201d Meghan pointed out, the purple top stretched to cover it, but did nothing to hide the twin lumps in Bryci's gut. \u201cI feared you were struggling to get them down the drain in there and that I'd have to wait all night for you to come back out...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...yeah, the reason I saved them was really because I wanted your help with hiding them, but I think I'll have to practice on something else...\u201d Bryci said and the angry growling of her belly was replaced by wet gurgling as the two lumps in her middle merged into one, much smoother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that could be arranged, but I suppose we should be heading back to school...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, these two have to drop by for a final assignment...\u201d Bryci smirked rubbing her slowly shrinking stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long thereafter the girls were back at school, Bryci had dropped off her two passengers and Meghan eyed the girl curiously as the short girl's belly was still making noises, obviously demanding seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do you think you're up for catching them yourself this time?\u201d Meghan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...I think I'd like some assistance...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's fine, but I think you should know I can't help you every time...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I'm just gonna assist you, so you lead and I follow.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's not quite as late as last time, so there's more people about. Something that makes Bryci head for the fifth floor right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little miffed that Bryci just copy and pasted her own scheme from last time, Meghan stood back while Bryci looked through the small windows to the computer-labs, even though she could have easily done it, it was a little satisfying and a lot funnier to see the short girl jumping up and down only getting a brief glimpse each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she had to hurry up as Bryci decided that she'd found what she was looking for and stepped inside. Meghan noticed the hesitation and as she entered herself she found the reason, the guy in the middle of the room had been the only one visible from the door, but in the corner to the left two girls sat chatting, not paying as much attention to their homework as they maybe should have had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome Meg...we'll sit over here...\u201d Bryci called. Motioning to a set of computers to which the path would take them behind the backs of the other occupants of the room and Meghan noticed with a grunt that Bryci of course wanted her to take on the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Meghan turned her attention towards her charges, who looked puzzled as she came their way. She just hoped it wouldn\u2019t be as ugly as she felt it might become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so no element of surprise...\u201d She thought to herself. \u201cJust keep it together, first priority is to get a good grip on both so they can't flee, second is to quiet them up...I can do this...\u201d She just hoped that Bryci could handle the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan didn't want to turn and have a look if Bryci was ready, in fact she just hoped that the girl wouldn't start before she was and tip her two girls off. It was after all the guy that wasn't paying much attention, so she'd have her chance either way.<br>\r\nWith that in mind Meghan didn't want to take any chances and lounged at the two girls. Her arms reaching out and pushing the two girls together, while looking for an arm or something to hold onto, but she didn't want to wait for that, so she already had her mouth opened impossibly wide,  she was rather desperate to get the girls in already.<br>\r\nThey in turn had yelped and then screamed for a second before their voices got muffled by Meghan's mouth, but it had been enough to alert the guy, who spun around to face their direction only to find that he couldn't see anything, as Bryci's lips quickly settled around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her frontal assault, Meghan had little trouble with her prey, they had after all had no clue as to what she was up to, and they had been seated, so pinned between the table, the chairs and Meghan's gullet, they had no where to go except the way Meghan was ushering them, which was down into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci on the other hand had an awkward experience as the guy stood up, lifting the small girl with him as she tried to swallow his broad shoulders, finding her weight not that hard to carry around as it was less than half his own. But he couldn't see anything and running around wouldn't have done him much good anyhow, so he stood there and with his arms tried to pull his aggressor off of him. Only to find her, despite her by comparison frail looking and thin form, to be much stronger than himself and she had the advantage of positioning. <br>\r\nHis weight advantage was not that useful when she was already on top of him and had only to reach out and forcefully cram the next segment into herself. It was when she realised this that she overcame his shoulders and from there he disappeared quickly, strong arms being pinned to his sides by little girly ones and then they slid into her mouth and down her throat along with the rest of his bulky frame. He might not have had a six-pack, but he'd been a big guy without being fat. <br>\r\nWell he could still become fat, but first he found himself curled up into a pretty little girl's belly and even if he was supposed to be big, the bulge he made in her belly wasn't, just a few of inches of a smooth swell.<br>\r\nOkay, there was the occasional ripple in her soft skin, much to Bryci's delight, as he was a strong guy and was still putting up a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls were done more or less at the same time, so Meghan missed out on Bryci being carried around and working her way towards the floor again, a trip Bryci had found rather amusing, especially since she was now the one carrying him around. <br>\r\nMeghan didn't share the smirk on Bryci's face though, instead she was rather anxious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, snap out of it, someone might have heard that scream...\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right...\u201d Bryci said looking around. \u201cI guess we should clean up quickly?\u201d She said and hefted the guy's rucksack up, cursing a bit under her breath. Typical guy to carry around every book he could fit in there so that he wouldn't have to repack the bag every day. She could barely shove the stuff he'd littered the desk with, back into the rucksack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan had better luck, one of the girls had had a bag as big as the guy's, but neither of them had brought half the amount of crap, so some quick stuffing had it all stowed away in that bag, a shoulder slung thing.</span></div></div>",

This is your show!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecalling what Meghan had said earlier about being overheard, she hurriedly pulled on the guy's rucksack and adjusted the straps, a lot, before she hurried out there door. A quick look around told her no one was coming so she let out a sigh and headed for the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before they were locked inside a large bathroom in a section of the school that didn't see much traffic at this hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci squirmed a bit as she realised that she had made Meghan eat the two girls and she wanted Meghan's help on hiding her meals, but though the guy in her gut was big, he didn't make that big a bulge, she could get away with it. It was nothing like the hopeless bloatedness that she had experienced inside Meghan earlier when she'd had those two girls inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d Bryci started as they dropped the bags to the floor and a silence had settled between them, Meghan had intended to let Bryci lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Eh...you remember back at my place when I asked if you could help me learn to hide my meals a bit more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...this guy is all but hidden...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you want my girls too, aye?\u201d Meghan smirked. And before Bryci could find it in her to reply she continued. \u201cSure, open wide then, I don't feel like doing this the hard way like last time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci complied, she'd just wanted one of them to join the slight potbelly bulge the guy made, but if she was offered both, she was needless to say very curious as to how that'd play out and the concept of all three of them in her belly was certainly more delicious than either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan lead Bryci to the only seat in the room. That way she could lean on over and send them down the girl's throat better, plus Bryci would be able to concentrate on them rather than on the extra weight and such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite a sight looking into the little girl finding a large glistering pink mouth and an open throat leading into the darkness, apparently it wasn't open all the way to her stomach, but far enough to took strange and scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcentrating on the contents of her stomach as she positioned herself in front of the seated raven haired girl, Meghan lined the two girls in her stomach up, so that they came riding up her throat one after the other, both head first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her towering over Bryci and leaning over, this meant that as the girls appeared they were actually travelling downwards already, with gravity assisting as they traversed the short distance between the two predators' mouths and continued down the seated one's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci felt the first one wiggle on down, she hadn't known what to expect, but apparently the girl had been struggling enough with her breath to catch the blink of an eye moment she had to scream for help, before she was muffled again.<br>\r\nThe struggling she kept up though, but it was weak and soon she slid on into the stomach below, curling up next to the guy already there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere Bryci found that she didn't just make another pot-bellied lump as the guy had, but in fact the lump the guy made grew and the girl made at least as big a dent in her figure as the guy had, meaning that her belly swell hadn't doubled in size, but quadrupled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the girl's friend, she too missed her opportunity to both Meghan's and Bryci's relief. As she slid on down the struggles were about the same as that of her friend, but the swell of the belly she caused was much more severe, she added a full girl-size to the dome, though the added size was distributed between the three lumps in there so even though the guy had initially made the least dent in Bryci's middle, he now constituted the largest of the three lumps in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhooahh...\u201d Bryci sighed as she relaxed, cradling her massive gut larger than herself in her arms. \u201cThanks a lot. This feels...\u201d She paused for breath as her huge belly wiggled about in her lap \u201c...so strange and great at the same time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet. \u201d Meghan snickered at the impressive, yet somewhat comical scene. \u201cNow did you need my help hiding that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...some instructions would be nice.\u201d Bryci admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Meghan didn't know what to expect, this girl had already shocked her twice before and like before she was glad to find that Bryci was closing her eyes as she made herself ready to concentrate on her task and on Meghan's voice and words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while before anything happened, Bryci had already done a few things and she kept asking questions instead of applying others. But then all of a sudden she did apply one technique after another as Meghan went through them a second time and although Meghan suspected that she should have anticipated this, she couldn't help but be amazed that the little raven haired girl had reduced three full grown people to a slight bulge riding high on her smooth creamy white abdomen and as the girl adjusted her tight top you wouldn't have noticed it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci seemed plenty fascinated as well and rubbed her stomach through her garment and Meghan couldn't help but finding it pretty sexy, it probably didn't help that Bryci tried to have a look and failed because of her pretty large breasts being in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Meghan a moment to realise. \u201cEh... there is a mirror.\u201d she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, how silly of me.\u201d Bryci giggled and got up, failing to notice that the people that had weighed her down moments before didn't anymore, at least not in any obvious way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... can I get some help?\u201d The short girl asked, having found out that her height was a problem. The mirror was situated a foot over the sink and that meant that she could see her face and the top of her shoulders in it, her belly was way further down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Meghan giggled, feeling almost as silly picking the girl up as Bryci felt getting picked up only to have a look in the mirror. She was still fascinated by the ease of which Meghan did pick her up though and held her aloft as well, to the point that she didn't pay her just about flat belly a whole lot of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks...you can put me down now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...\u201d Meghan said and did as asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you give me some pointers on the digestion part as well?\u201d Bryci asked as she sat down again on the lid of the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did walk Bryci through  a few techniques and answered her questions as best she could on a couple of others. Then with Bryci's digestion well on the way she turned to the bags they had brought with them she didn't bother with the guy's since she felt pretty certain that he like most guys had everything of worth on him when he was swallowed, the girls though out of lack of pockets in their clothing tended to have money and such in their bag/hand bag instead. As was the case this time and she produced roughly twenty bucks from one girl's bag and thirteen from the other's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Bryci wondered, now sounding like she was afraid they get caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTaking their money, it's not like they need it to pay for the way out of your butt.\u201d Meghan joked. \u201cYou want a look at their other stuff, or should I get rid of it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...\u201d Bryci said and Meghan took that for a go ahead and promptly swallowed the remaining evidence, before dividing the money up as best she was able too, keeping the larger pot for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll be back.\u201d She said to Bryci as she headed out the door. \u201cI imagine that they may take a while to evict.\u201d She added with a grin and closed the door behind her before Bryci could say anything. Instead the girl walked over and re-locked the door before returning to her seat, this time with her panties down and the toilet lid up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later Meghan returned, she had taken a risk going down to the lower levels with more people about and just grabbing a guy in the corridor. <br>\r\nShe hadn't seen anyone else about so she felt certain she was safe, it wasn't like the guy had a chance to say anything, he hadn't even heard her coming, let alone seen her. Now he was pushing against her lower sphincter, eager to get back out again along with the baggage Meghan had eaten.<br>\r\nSo she took the much smaller toilet next to Bryci's and shoved him down the drain in short order. She wasn't taking her time and apparently the toilet could handle the strain, or rather it bottomed out before even trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting peckish again, or rather a bit hungry she hadn't expected, but then again she had carried people about a bit today, that usually does work up an appetite. At any rate it was taken care of now, so she knocked at Bryci's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d came the reply and she heard the faucet turned on and off as the girl inside had washed her hands before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan had left her stuff at Bryci's place so she couldn't just go home after leaving Bryci with the task of dealing with three meals at once.</span></div></div>",

She might not have a specific assignment waiting, but it was a full day tomorrow and she needed to read those books sooner or later, before the lecture covered the chapter usually helped, so she felt that she really should bid Bryci goodbye for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus the two chatted on the way back to Bryci's apartment and Meghan collected her things more or less straight away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeaving already?\u201d Bryci seemed somewhat surprised they'd hardly had time to hang out, other than Meghan helping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it's a long day tomorrow and I'm afraid I really should be reading up on a couple of things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...\u201d Bryci, acknowledged and gave her friend a hug. \u201cThanks for all the help.\u201d She said sincerely and was awarded with a big embrace herself, as in Meghan's mouth settling around her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later she was tossed about inside the girl's giant mouth, before being gently released back out, by the giggling girl. Now she was all slimy and soaking wet. \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d Meghan said licking her lips. \u201cThanks for the taste.\u201d She added poking her now tiny looking tongue out, but which and just swished Bryci around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're welcome...\u201d Bryci, said but she couldn't help but giggle as well, while wiping some saliva off of her. \u201cI guess I better head back into the shower now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, did I miss a spot?\u201d Meghan joked. \u201cHold on...\u201d she said and opened her mouth wide again, this time Bryci dodged away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah, well I think not. That's the problem.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSe you tomorrow!\u201d Both said more or less in unison as Meghan left and Bryci started to pull the garments off that seemed nigh glued onto her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day was indeed long, but Meghan still didn't have any specific assignment and if Bryci did, she didn't seem to care, she had one favourite subject and she had no better source for it than Meghan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it was pretty late by the time she got there Meghan expected to find Bryci starving, she had eaten beforehand herself, but thought that they might as well go hunting together now than her bringing food to Bryci, heck that was the reason she'd approached the girl in the first place, to have a friend that she didn't have to feed and that wasn't really just a snack waiting to be eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so she was surprised to find that Bryci had taken care of herself, she didn't go into any details though even when Meghan tried to prod and poke. It had after all been Bryci's first hunting alone as far as Meghan knew, but Bryci said next to naught, perhaps because she had spent a whole lot longer on the toilet than actually hunting and eating, for some reason one person had hardly sufficed, which caused trouble in the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they spent a few hours chatting and fooling around instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich included Bryci taking several trips inside Meghan, the one she liked the most being the one where Meghan had lain down on her bed with her mouth slightly open and her throat fully so and she herself had been let to crawl around in there both up and down the throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out from between Meghan's lips she could see her friend in her wall of mirrors lying there peacefully on her bed with no trace of herself showing. <br>\r\nIt had been awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually their fun and games had to end though, but Meghan thanked her for relieving her stress, apparently she was anxious about the next day, but she said even less about that than Bryci had done about her hunting, so Bryci found herself a little frustrated and curious as her friend left for the night.</span></div></div>",

Even the freckles didn't help in making her cute with that expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d Meghan asked, a bit taken aback by the way the girl had approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d The girl asked right back, ignoring the courtesies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeghan Hawthorn...and you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn't say me much, I'm Clarice apparently your practice partner for this class. The professor sought it fit to pair me with you for some reason and I care to know why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich professor? Blainey, or my mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBl... your mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Professor Hawthorn, the other professor, who works with Blainey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh...\u201d A wicked smile crept across Clarice's face, showing that she was actually rather pretty despite her somewhat unkempt and nerdy appearance. \u201cPleased to meet you then... Meghan was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Meghan. But now you have me curious as to why Blainey would pair us up, as in why you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you see, Blainey offered me a place on her research team before I had even finished the V101 class, I told her that I'd like to graduate first, but the door is open as far as I know. This I assume is a proof of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see... should we take a seat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFollow me...\u201d Clarice said and led the way to where she had already piled her things. Meghan felt a bit weird sitting in the first row, but Clarice looked right at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was shortly after that the last girl joined the class and Professor Blainey cleared her throat to get everyone's attention.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI'm glad to see that you all made it, at least the numbers match with those admitted to this class.\u201d Blainey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you well know this is no ordinary class, in fact all of you have taken a similar one and finished that with the top most grades. As such  you are already a talented group of young ladies, but this class will take even you several steps further, in fact had you not been the best students I've had, there would probably have been need for a class between this one and V101.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOfficially this class is called 'Modern physics from a feminist perspective', though I expect you'll coin plenty of other names for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt any rate, the prospect of it aroused many different feelings from the school council and as a result they have lain down some rules. Starting with your numbers as you can see there's only fifty-six of you, a hard negotiation, for every last spot was had, hence the strange number. At least you are of an even number so there should be a practice partner for each and every one. The argument that won that many places was that for larger practising groups, fifty six dividing neatly into fourteen groups of four and then onto seven groups of eight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot something I'll force on any of you I know there's some tension between some of you, but I mention it, so that you can give it some though. There are after all a lot of girls here who have no quarrels with the rest of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe second rule, which was also necessary in order to make this class larger than a handful students was that it is now prohibited for you to hunt on school grounds.<br>\r\nThe board recognises that you can't wander about asking first if the ones you pursue are students of this school, but one can assume that nearly all who are on the school grounds are and fact remains that the school gains power and funds from their students and their numbers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps that's an indication on the expectations the board has on this class, that you'll become such a threat to the campus population that you'll seriously affect the schools reputation and economics.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou've already signed your agreement to this and the usual stuff, like agreeing to participate in demonstrations, when signing the application for this class. <br>\r\nI thought it worth reminding you, since I remember a lot of you did a lot of whining about that part already in V101 and I imagine that you're even more reluctant now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo with the boring bits out of the way I'd like to introduce to you the people making this class possible.<br>\r\nFirst and foremost Professor Hawthorn, a talented woman who joined our university with her research team this semester.\u201d  Blainey motioned towards the assembled scientists and from amongst the ones to the back a tall statuesque woman in a business suit approached, she was clearly older than Blainey, but she still retained her natural dark blonde hair colour and looked very good for her age, her being in very good physical shape probably having something to do with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman didn't say anything though and the courteous nod towards Meghan would have gone by unnoticed if you weren't looking for it like Clarice was. It settling her last fears of being conned and finally relaxing back into her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Came three pretty large groups of girls and an endless barrage of names They were apparently the researches of there teams amongst the TAs for the class would be plucked. The students', Clarice amongst them, confusion about three research teams and only two professors was settled as Blainey introduced the last lady on the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did irk Clarice some that Meghan hadn't seemed the slightest bit surprised, as if she'd known already. That she hadn't, though she had suspected after her meeting with Doctor Tracey. And after Blainey's naming of the class, it seemed all the more likely. She was however a bit surprised by the physics professor's appearance and in that she wasn't alone, as she heard the girl behind her ask her neighbour:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bit physical this physics professor, ain't she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed...\u201d Came the hushed reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman in question did have a physique that grabbed much attention and it didn't help that she most often, as today, choose to wear casual and tight fitting garments, which she filled out in a way that often made them look nigh pained on. She was the shortest of the three professors, but certainly the most endowed and that while retaining the most slender waist of them all. And while shorter than them she still remained on the tall end of average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the rules and introductions over professor Blainey stepped aside and handed the scene to this buxom dark haired beauty that would pass for a professor in physics, called Denise De Luca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings class!\u201d She began in a voice that carried, while still being pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume the good Professor Blainey named the class as a physics one, due to the theories and findings we've had. Today though, we will just cover the basics and layout, but we have plenty of opportunities to delve deeper into each aspect and subject.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo that regard, it pays, as you all know, to have read up on the subject before class, and thus most classes will provide new material for upcoming classes, this one being no different. So later our assistants will provide you with some makeshift material.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you might have suspected this is a class in the making and somewhat on the edge, as such we have not had the time to print anything resembling a book. Heck, most of the material for upcoming classes will no doubt be deemed ready in whatever state it's in when we can't delay handing it to you any longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then. Basic introduction...\u201d De Luca said and went to adjust a chalkboard as she also opened up the front of the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe've studied this phenomenon, from a physics aspect, the most striking at a fist glance being the way a predator can hide a prey from view, it can baffle the best of minds and to our help we had the lovely Miss Daneford.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you please come onto the stage Miss Daneford?\u201d She motioned for the girl in question, an average height very trim blonde with thick golden curls reaching down to her waist. There was hardly any fat on her, a fact apparent by her revealing clothes a tight short top and a short skirt, left both shapely legs and well defined six-pack in plain sight, as well as showing that she wasn't the bustiest of girls. The lack of fat was probably what made her otherwise pretty face seem a bit hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith Miss Daneford's help we've managed to make some very interesting observations and conclusions, which has enabled us to make predictions and thus improve in many aspects our knowledge and implementation of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would like some volunteers...\u201d Denise said to her audience, the only movements though being that of faces turning anxious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAl-right, Professor Blainey, you're the head of this class and you know your students. Could you provide me with some reluctant volunteers?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlainey smiled \u201cOf course... You girls, please step forward...\u201d and motioned for the girls in the corner to step onto the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan sighed, she knew it was a bad idea to sit on the front row, Blainey might just as well have called forth the whole front row, or her corner. She felt lucky that the professor had stepped onto the side of the stage and that that side had been the one in the other end of the classroom from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as the girls somewhat grumpily left their seats, most of them removing quite a bit of excess clothing and leaving it behind, as they had the same impression as everyone else in the room that the 'volunteers' would be swallowed by someone or other. Perhaps by the girl already there?</span></div></div>",

Despite a lot of tasty bare skin though she did not linger, but rather efficiently picked the girl up and hoisted her lower body above herself while she engulfed the girl's upper body. With a straight path to her stomach and gravity to aid her and apparently no problem handling an item that big, it was a short procedure to make the girl disappear, for she made no impact on Miss Daneford's frame once she was in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly reached out and grabbed another, repeating the quick process she had just performed with another and another and as each girl vanished from view the interest of the audience grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with the sixth girl, Kimberly's taunt abdomen ceased to be unaffected, it was hardly noticeable, but one or two girls in the front row did notice. It was much more obvious with the seventh girl, who left the predator on stage with the having eaten a large meal look and the eighth and final girl gave her a bit of a belly, though fairly odd looking with her muscles draping the protruding lump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Daneford, would you please show off your belly to the audience?\u201d De Luca resumed once more and her assisting student started slowly walking about the stage, giving the students both frontal and sideways views of the lump in her middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEight full grown women and it can be passed of as an early pregnancy or for a girl of a bit softer build, just natural flab. Pretty impressive don't you agree?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan raised her hand, which somewhat surprised the professor. \u201cYes Miss...?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeghan...\u201d Blainey interjected, deciding right then and there that it might be best if Meghan's surname remained unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Meghan\u201d De Luca repeated, finding it a bit strange that the otherwise pretty formal Professor Blainey would use the girl's first name, especially in front of the class, which seemed a pretty formal place and time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't agree.\u201d Meghan stated bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't agree what?\u201d De Luca, didn't quite follow, this interruption taking her somewhat off-guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat it's impressive.\u201d Meghan said motioning for Miss Daneford, granting her a few stares from the other students, though sitting at the front, most could just see the back of her head and with half the front row inside Kimberly only her practice partner could see her clearly and she was giving Meghan a most approving look, looking quite smug in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don't?...\u201d De Luca fumbled and Professor Blainey interrupted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Daneford finished V101 just before summer, she does not have the experience you have, and in that context her feat is really quite remarkable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlainey saw that Meghan resigned, even though she said nothing and motioned for Professor De Luca to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere was I...Oh, yes... Miss Daneford, you can release the girls now. Someone give her a potion...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the professor\u2019s researchers had stood ready and Kimberly was already chugging the vile thing before the professor finished her sentence and the girls were coming back up and spilling over the floor before she could resume her place at the chalkboard of her choice.<br>\r\nThere she waited until the girls including Kimberly had removed themselves and retaken their seats. <br>\r\nApparently all of the soaked girls had decided to freshen up after class instead of getting Miss Daneford's gloop off of them right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight then...\u201d the professor announced when the rustle had more or less settled, silencing the low murmur in the classroom.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHow does this hiding work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImagine a one dimensional being in a two dimensional space, like this chalkboard.\u201d The professor said and drew a line on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's only aware of itself along that one dimension, though it's naturally needed a width in the second dimension in order to exist there. In this case the width of this chalk line, but it could be the line drawn with a pencil or something else, perhaps those are different types of entities. Alas it's not of importance here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is interesting is when we introduce a second one dimensional being in a two dimensional space. Parallel they are totally unaware of one another, they have no means of detecting the other. But what if they cross?\u201d She said drawing a second line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere the two dimensional property they've been given is interesting, do they perceive one another as that minor creature, the mere length of where their lines coexist?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps only one of them is in the proper one dimension, and the other being manipulated out of it's natural dimension feel that it's being shrunk and thus perceive it's fellow being as gigantic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe smallest this being could then become, would thus be totally perpendicular to its native dimension.\u201d De Luca said drawing another line, that was just that to the first she had drawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImagine the same to a two dimensional creature in a three dimensional space. That's perhaps a bit easier, seeing as you've all grown up watching cartoons and reading comics, they are all two dimensional and we're used to a three dimensional space.\u201d She said and picked up a piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo like the earlier one dimensional creature, the two has to be given a three dimensional property that it might be unaware of. Since drawn characters are what we're used to, perhaps a piece of paper isn't such a far fetched representation. It is fairly thin, so a good way of minimising the two dimensional creature.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow what happens when this character is brought out of it's natural dimensions?\u201c She said and held up the paper so all could see it. Then turned it sideways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the side like this, is probably as small as one could make it in it's own dimension.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImagine then that this creature is interacting with another in it's dimensions, one that has access to this third dimension. They share height and width, so turning the first one sideways would not help all the way if this three dimensional creature was predatory, it'd be like swallowing a rod as long as itself. <br>\r\nAnd what about the width that is now protruding into its own extra dimension? <br>\r\nClearly the two dimensional creature is quite unmanageable like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what ways is there to reduce the two dimensional creature, to a more manageable set of three dimensions?\u201d De Luca said and crumbled the piece of paper up in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple and purpose filling, but hardly the most effective way.\u201d The Professor said and drew a quick girlish figure, roughly the height of a paper on the chalkboard and held up the balled up paper in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt could, fit, but the creature would be bloated. So what if you folded the paper properly?\u201d She said and picked up a pre-folded piece of paper and held it up to the chalk-figure like she had the other paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt could very well fit in there, perhaps even without showing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why am I rambling on about this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's the next step?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's adding physical dimensions to our known three dimensions. Well some asks what about time then? Well time isn't exactly a physical dimension now is it. Question is what happens when you add a fourth dimension? Or a fifth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's our conclusion. That that's what 'hiding' one's prey is about. Forcing the prey out of these three dimensions that we're used to and into whatever other dimension or dimensions that the predator has access to. The result being a shrunken version of the whole three dimensional being in the three dimensions it's used to and the rest is elsewhere. Much like the one dimensional being may have appeared shrunk to it's fellows, while the two dimensional to its fellows, might have looked pretty weird, but I assume that's normal for cartoons, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt any rate, we know what a three dimensional person roughly looks like, though there are individual differences and we know what a two dimensional representation of the same looks like as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe do however not know what the person looks in any dimensions beyond the three, but we can assume that they are limited there as they are in the three we know. Similar perhaps in some ways to how a two and a three dimensional person correlates.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake for example our demonstration with Miss Daneford here, at first she could hide the other girls just fine, but as they tallied up she was unable to keep doing so. This proves that there are limits to her reach in those dimensions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is more interesting however is that these were not just three dimensional beings she swallowed and hid away, I can attest to that the results would have been very similar, perhaps even identical if they had been. But now they were fellow girls with similar traits as herself, which means that these dimensions can interact with the normal three and yet somehow bypass each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith this in mind a wealth of questions arises and we've been very busy studying the aspects of these dimensions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor one, just like in these three, everyone seems to be similar, but with individual differences. Some are tall, others short, some are skinny other's thickly built, some are chesty other's not and so on.<br>\r\nIt's the same in that expanse as well, though different.\u201d De Luca said and once again turned to her chalkboard and drew a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is how she might appear to our eyes and like most she's got a capability in these extra dimensions that when she influences something would be more like this.\u201d She said and drew a larger version of the girl around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCurled up in her stomach her three dimensional self would only make a small bulge in her belly. But here techniques come into play, for it seems one can to some extent manipulate the extra dimensions to where they are needed. Like this perhaps...\u201d She said and drew yet another version this time with a different coloured chalk. This girl version had a head and legs only a bit bigger than the original girl, but a huge belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that big belly her, or a similar sized three dimensional item wouldn't make a bulge on her three dimensional self as they'd fit neatly in that huge gut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut the thing with many skills is that you need to keep at them.\u201d the professor said and picked up her two pieces of paper again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike these two, the crumpled up one takes up a lot more space than the folded one and both seem to stay in this, much less obstructing to the predator shape than their original one. However they could take up a lot less space, at least for the crumpled one. If for example I squeeze the crumpled one in my closed fist like this.\u201d She said and closed her fist around the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile I keep squeezing it in my hand, the crumpled one hardly takes up more space than the folded one, perhaps even less, but as soon as I let go it fluffs back up again.\u201d She said and opened her hand again and like she said would happen the crumpled paper regained much of its previous volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe same thing is true for the folded one, although retaining a much smaller volume than the crumpled up one, if I squeeze it between my fingers I can make it a lot flatter while I squeeze it and as soon as I release, it it too fluffs up again to some extent.\u201d De Luca said, demonstrating as she spoke.</span></div></div>",

I assume all of you are familiar with stretching your mouth and throat out of proportion, doubtless this is an aspect allowed by these extra dimensions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, like I showed earlier with the hiding and the belly, and the relocation of extra dimensional properties to it.\u201d She said motioning to the figure on the board, specifically the bloated one, while she picked up a new coloured chalk and drew a new figure similar to the bloated one, only this one had a huge head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInterestingly enough there are apparently ways to do more than just stretch ones tissues, one can actually stretch ones three dimensions like Miss Mitchell will show us I hope.\u201d The professor said motioning for Daniela to do her thing, unfortunately for her without a victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela opened her mouth impossibly wide and like the professor had said, it did more than just stretch, it actually seemed to grow bigger as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Professor motioned for one of the students to come up on stage, she choose one of the girls who'd already been inside Kimberly and who was in the front row. And the girl got the hint as De Luca motioned for her to go over to Daniela, who's mouth now reached down to the floor and was wide enough for the girl to just walk right into, if she just ducked her head down a bit, since she was as tall as the assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't though so Daniela stepped forth and engulfed the girl in one bite, as quickly as it took Daniela to close her mouth the girl was gone and Daniela's mouth back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Mitchell's three dimensions doesn't want to stay stretched though, I bet you all know this from the stretching you are used to, it takes active effort to retain such a state. So it does to shift her hiding capabilities to her head region as well. <br>\r\nFor as you see, the girl in Miss Mitchell's mouth is as far as I can't tell well hidden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed she was, one could tell that Daniela had something in her mouth, but that was about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother strange aspect we've found in regards to hiding is that what matters is mass, not volume, meaning that if Miss Mitchell here had put a mannequin into her mouth instead, which would have the same volume as the student in her mouth, then she'd have a much easier time hiding it. And had Miss Daneford earlier swallowed eight mannequins instead, she wouldn\u2019t have sported any belly at the end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou've probably noticed that swallowing down air for your partner while practising hasn't made that big a difference in the difficulty of hiding her, despite that volume wise you both might consider there to be much more of the air than of her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is because apparently it really is mass that matters and the density of air is just one point two-two-five kilograms per cubic meter, while people weigh almost exactly one kilo per liter, or cubic decimeter, if you prefer. Meaning that air is roughly eight hundred times less dense than people and in short, that much easier to hide.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you miss Mitchell, you may release her now.\u201d The professor said, while Daniela did just that and the re-soaked girl once again lumbered back to her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said before however...\u201d De Luca resumed. \u201c...attributes in these unseen dimensions have individual differences. Some girls might indeed have an inclination towards this...\u201d she said and pointed towards the large headed girl-sketch on the chalkboard. \u201c...and as a result have an easier time swallowing things and hiding them as they enter, but they might have a hard time doing the same once the prey-item reaches her stomach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr she could be more like this...\u201d De Luca said and motioned to the big-bellied version yet again. \u201c...and have trouble getting anything down her gullet, but having no trouble concealing anything that ends up there. While yet again others might be more evened out like this one...\u201d She finished and motioned towards her original enlarged figure around the first figure that was supposed to represent the three dimensions of the fictional girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese dimensions interact with the visible three in other ways as well, for one you've probably all noticed that you've grown a lot stronger since you learned to interact with these new ones. That's part of why I like the representation of the extra dimensions as a larger version of the three as there seems to be more in those that affect the three, than the other way around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike for example muscle tissue, it's like there's ever so much muscles at work, hence your strength, but you doesn't seem to need to carry it around, at least that's what your bathroom scale will tell you. Same thing with a lot of other things. To a normal person, your skin might actually feel pretty unyielding, because its extra properties fight back, and the flesh beneath it doing the same thing, it being as a result much firmer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake Miss Mitchell again, that's an impressive chest, I think you agree. But there's even more of it that you can't see, but only gravity to affect what little you actually can, though little just being a relative word in this context.\u201d The student's could see the woman in question blushing as the professor talked about her unashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you don't mind Miss Mitchell, but do you wear a bra?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the deeper colours on her face wasn't enough of an answer, then her head shake was.<br>\r\nThen the PhD student quickly went back to her group and stepped behind some of her colleagues, so that the whole class wouldn't keep staring at her breasts, which despite the lack of a bra actually stood out proudly from her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I meant earlier by that you don't seem to need to carry this extra dimensions around, is just that. It seems like it, because you're using your three dimensions to determine what is happening and not all of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake for example this character.\u201d De Luca said drawing a stick figure on the chalkboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor it to travel to the end of that chalkboard over there...\u201d She said pointing towards the other end of the scene. \u201c... It would have to walk there. Same thing if it'd been three dimensional, like you see me. To get there I'd have to walk there all the same, despite having an extra dimension. <br>\r\nAdding more doesn't help in that regard, you'd still need to move there and that you don't feel yourself carrying your extra dimensions about, or even your hidden prey, doesn't mean that you aren't. Fact is you are, but you're using whatever dimensions they are in to do so. Just like this character would use his two to get there and I'd walk through these three.\u201d De Luca finished taking said walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then I think that's about it from me, a basic overview of what's to come.\u201d De Luca finished and motioned for the next speaker to take over.</span></div></div>",

The girl hadn't been the most slender then, but now Alectra was decidedly plump, which made Meghan raise an eyebrow, while others did so because they had expected one of the professors to take over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then...\u201d Alectra started in order to silence the low murmur that had arisen during the switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...like Professor De Luca, I'll give a bit of an overview, but we have to start this course somewhere and thus I'll later continue on to actual techniques.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat we've been studying is two problem areas; The need to catch prey and the process of making them leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn other words, we've been studying how to get the most out of every meal.\u201d She said and gave her extra flab around her waist a squeeze. \u201cDon't worry, this isn't the intended result, but may happen if you don't do things properly. But in essence that is what we try to do, but in those extra dimensions Professor De Luca spoke of.<br>\r\nHer findings have been very useful in explaining what we've been doing and does offer new ways to tackle old things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see one of the properties the extra dimensions seem to lack is that of being fat, there seems to be a few different forms of size and mass, but fat as we know it as more or less useless extra weight to haul around isn't one of them. For fat may be a way to store energy, but it's a very cumbersome way, and it only stores energy, no other nutrients that the body might need, whereas you can teach your body to store all things needed in the unseen dimensions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith that in mind you could thus actually store up on resources and not eat for a longer period of time. Whereas earlier if you ate a lot you'd just grow fat and would still need to eat again almost as soon as if you'd just had a normal meal, because the body craves more than just energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat takes us to the second aspect we've studied, ways of getting more out of every meal.<br>\r\nNaturally this would lead to needing to catch fewer meals than otherwise, which is a desired aspect I assume for most. It also leads to a third aspect we've tackled, the unpleasant but necessary step of relieving one of what's left of the prey once you're done with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPreviously one has been required to seek out a specialized toilet, that can handle a load of what most would consider unnaturally large proportions, like the ones here in school.\u201d She said and paused looking up into her audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard that it's a fairly new investment and seeing as we have a few post graduation students attending this class, this was perhaps news to you. I just wanted to make you aware that you don't have to choose the alternative when one can't find such facilities. Which is to spend a long disgusting and troublesome time on the toilet trying to get the prey down without clogging the facilities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, what I meant earlier was that, if you absorb more of your prey, there will be less left of it to get rid of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that doesn't seem to be the only way of making your bathroom visits easier, there's also what I suppose you could call a quick fix. The dimensions Professor De Luca spoke of also apply to your digestive tract, if they hadn't digesting a hidden meal would have been much less filling than a non hidden one, but as you all know, it is not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormally though once you've released your prey it's popped back into its regular size, whether it's been regurgitated, or digested. But you can actually digest it in those dimensions in a way that enable you to relieve yourself there as well. Meaning that the end result might not actually be less than otherwise, but the toilet only account for the excrement's three dimensional properties and thus the result is still that you'll have an easier time flushing the items down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that was the basic overview, now you'd better sharpen your pencils and your ears if you want to learn something, because from here on I'll cover several techniques to achieve these things.\u201d Alectra said and walked over to the chalkboards while the students adjusted themselves and their belongings and hoped that she wouldn't be asking for volunteers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have time to go very in depth on these three aspects, but she did manage to cover a few techniques before the class was over. By which time all the students had also received the material for this class and various material for upcoming ones.</span></div></div>",

By which time she'd already received two messages on her cell phone from Bryci asking if they could meet up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe figured that there was really no reason why not, she hadn't had time to hunt, plus with the new rule of not hunting on school, she was a bit reluctant to try her luck there. Though there were no surveillance cameras anywhere so she wasn't really sure how the rule would be enforced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so it'd be more fun to go out hunting with a friend and besides Bryci would probably like a look at this new stuff as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHence she messaged the girl that she was coming over right away and minutes later she was greeting the short girl in the doorway of her apartment. <br>\r\nThis time without any weirdness. Meghan wasn't about to wait for Bryci to take another shower before heading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill there was plenty of waiting anyway as the two went through the material for her new class. It didn't take many minutes before they removed the clips holding the bundle of papers together and started passing them between themselves instead, often pausing to get the other girl's attention \u201cHey, look at this!\u201d or \u201cListen to this!\u201d and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, and long before they'd gone through the material, it wasn't just Meghan's stomach that demanded to be fed, but Bryci's as well, although she had at least eaten that day, Meghan had not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo shortly thereafter they headed back out the door, this time Meghan took her things with her, including the new material they'd been reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci not carrying anything took the lead as her door locked automatically anyway and started heading towards the school like they had before.</span></div></div>",

We'll need to go there afterwards anyway, right?\u201d She said implying that even though they'd had a look at a few things that'd help lessen the load, it wasn't as if they had learned them, there'd still be way too much for a normal toilet to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later they visited a park that allowed for enough cover, both visual from the ample amount of foliage and the traffic would cover up quite a bit of noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it were things had progressed smoothly, despite Bryci deciding to tackle a group of four guys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like the pretty girls hadn't gotten the boys' attention, or that they had perceived them as a threat. Even so Meghan had thought it a tad bold, but they had paired them up more or less and Meghan had gotten hers to turn their backs to their friends while Bryci had made her two lean on down, promising to kiss one, but not telling who, before giving them both a wet sloppy kiss all over their heads and Meghan supposed that she shouldn't be surprised, but still was by the lack of difficulty the little lady swallowed the two down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't been completely noiseless though and beckoned their friends' attention, but as they turned around, they found themselves seeing very little as Meghan had pinned them together and engulfed their heads from behind, she was tall enough that she hadn't needed for them to lean on over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Meghan got her second surprise as Bruci picked up the guys she was eating by their feet and stuffed them into her mouth. Then sucked them down hard. Hard enough for Meghan to stumble forward losing her balance totally and out of fear of getting pulled in with her guys opened her mouth and throat wide enough to lose her grip on them, enabling Bryci to with a quick suck and swallow claim the rest of them and send them into her now quite large gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl then quickly snuck into an alcove, seating herself on a bench surrounded on three sides by the park's neatly trimmed and dense bushes. The only opening was that side towards the path on which the girls had just met the guys and where Meghan still stood. On the other side of the path were yet more bushes and trees, effectively blocking out the view of the city<br>\r\nand the traffic, although doing little for the constant city noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce seated Meghan saw Bryci's huge gut diminishing soon it fit in her lap. At first she wondered if the girl was digesting, realising that she wouldn't been able to hear if her gut was gurgling over the traffic, but it stopped shrinking when she just looked plenty pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're a greedy one aren't you?\u201d Meghan teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry about that, I just wanted to practice hiding some more, and when I saw that you hadn't swallowed yours down...I guess I got a little greedy...\u201d She said, while at least having the decency to blush. \u201cMind giving me a few pointers, I seem to be at a loss as to what to do next...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright...\u201d Meghan said taking the seat next to Bryci and the two of them turned their attention to the short girls bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kept at it for a while and slowly the girl's belly receded, finally leaving the girl with what could be passed for an early pregnancy. And by that time Meghan had had time to wonder several times what would have happened if she hadn't let go of the guys. Watching the soft swell in the little girl's belly, that now wasn't much to talk about, didn't really put her mind off of that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though her stomach demanded to be fed and shortly thereafter they came upon a couple. This time Meghan didn't waste enough time for Bryci to be able to steal her meal and the two soon struggled nicely within her stomach. That however didn't sate her hunger, only digesting would do that, so she proposed that they'd all return to school and practice there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan had been a bit reluctant to take the large bathroom again and let Bryci in, but the girl had insisted that she'd want to go through the instruction as well. Plus that that way they might give each other pointers. For Meghan had already proclaimed that she'd move one of her couple into her throat while she digested the first and That's what she did, with Bryci insisting on tackling her preys after Meghan had sated the worst of her hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact was that Meghan had been so hungry that she hadn't paid the new techniques that much attention, she'd only semi-tried and as a result she was done shortly after having seated herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci on the other hand took her time. Asking for Meghan's help to look through the bundle of papers for useful stuff and reading through them as she sat there on the porcelain throne and her belly returning to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was Meghan's turn, she took longer this time, but she frankly felt weird sitting there with Bryci watching, so she took nowhere near as long as Bryci had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may have been Friday and all, meaning she really did have the time for more studying, but the thought of another session with Bryci watching her taking a crap, just felt so uncomfortable, that she said she had to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci had pleaded for her to come down to the study-center and let her run the papers Meghan had gotten from class through the copying machine. That Meghan agreed to, figuring it was a pretty easy way of doing things, plus that way, Bryci might be able to help her for once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considered grabbing another meal to study on at home, but she really wasn't hungry, so she figured that she'd practice again in the morning instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci on the other hand as she waived goodnight to Meghan had no intention of returning home just yet, and she had signed no papers on not hunting on the school ground, something several unlucky students wished had been the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night both the girls studied the material from Meghan's new class, but with different enthusiasm. Meghan while interested in the subject as such although the topic of poop was a bit disconcerting and at times made her feel as if she was back on the toilet with Bryci watching her didn't help. Plus it wasn't like it was fun reading, the language was perhaps even drier than even her normal schoolbooks, as this had been composed from the works of the PhD students who thus in order to be proper had lain on their thickest academic lingua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci on the other hand albeit a bit troubled by the language, still read it like a teenage boy would read porn when no one was watching and well in her case, it would seem it pretty much was. Meaning that she was up until the early hours before sleep finally claimed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo by the time she awoke and called Meghan to ask her to join her hunting again, Meghan had already eaten and with the new techniques of extra absorption with which she had gotten a bit of success, she really wasn't feeling like eating anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci on the other hand was ravenous, despite her excessive eating last night. Today she'd have time to go over all the techniques though, and she really did want to try the whole store energy thing as well, it should mean that she'd be able to keep on eating, would it not? The concept intrigued her like so many other things that circled around the subject of people getting eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to her, one of the reasons she was constantly hungry was that her extra dimensional self was still growing, so naturally it needed building blocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was probably a good thing for her, as it meant that she could spend a lot more time practising than her friend. But fearing that she'd get full she studied up on the whole storing nutrients things before heading out even if her belly was giving her an earful for making it wait. Still she concluded that she could take the papers with her anyhow and study them while she digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, come evening Meghan had had another meal and felt like she'd pigged out, and Bryci had lost count and still felt that she could go for a few more. And she'd actually managed to store a bit food as that weird unseen fat. She hadn't really gotten the hang of it, but at least she hadn't totally failed. She feared that she'd put on as much regular fat though, but she wasn't sure. Her was body ravenous and as she carried people about, practising on hiding them before she digested them, she actually burned plenty more calories than she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had helped in that regard that she had tired of hunting at school, both because of the lack of students there and the fact that the ones who were there seemed to be in constellations and places that didn't really promote her eating them.<br>\r\nAnd that the school was the only place she felt comfortable letting the people back out again and she was making good progress in that regard, she also managed to squeeze in quite a bit of practice in on that subject throughout the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStored energy or not, during the night Bryci's body depleted her reserves and come morning she was just as hungry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a little afraid that her pigging out would have ruined her figure, but a long hard look in the mirror revealed no such thing and her bathroom scale agreed with her visual assessment. So with her fears settled she headed out once more to make the city unsafe.</span></div></div>",

Her timing was pretty much perfect as Bryci was already heading down the stairs to go out and hunt.<br>\r\nSo hurrying to get ready they decided to meet up at a spot they thought would serve their purpose and hopefully easy prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a head start Bryci hadn't been able to pass up, not one, but three opportunities, so when Meghan arrived the girl was busy applying the final touches to hiding her meal. Actually had Bryci been a bit more casual about it Meghan might not have noticed the slight pudginess of her belly. But as Bryci was caressing her gut quite blatantly it was hard not to take notice in the fact that she didn't seem quite content with the state it was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting some assistance from Meghan she managed to remove the bulge entirely though and seemed quite content with that. Meghan was more interested in getting the ordeal over with, so that she too could get something pleasantly wiggling about in her stomach. <br>\r\nShe never asked about Bryci's meal and if she had, she would have thought that Bryci was lying to her if the girl had claimed that there were four people in her stomach, even though it was actually true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the topic could come up though a trio of guys approached and Bryci was upon them before Meghan could object, to her surprise Bryci sent one of the guys her way and while he walked on over she could see that behind his back his friends were quickly disappearing down the little raven-haired beauty's throat. Realising that she needed to act before he caught on Meghan shocked him by being as forward as her friend. Being grabby isn't normally a good trait, but as she grabbed all of him and with her being so much stronger there was little he could do to object, except perhaps wiggle and squirm pleasantly and Meghan really didn't mind that at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her greedy friend Meghan saw her sporting quite a belly. Apparently it was more than just reluctant to go away as well, so she suggested that they'd return to school, seeing as there was a sure-fire way to remove it and that was more or less what they were supposed to practice anyhow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan regretted calling Bryci up as soon as they got back to school and found Bryci leading her by the hand into one of the handicap bathrooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing she closed the door behind them and waited for Bryci to take the first turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe motioned for Bryci to take the seat, since first she wasn't actually hungry and secondly she hoped that she could sneak away into one of the smaller toilets and do her business there. Well she could do that as soon as Bryci got started, but she got the impression that Bryci had studied without her and well she did want to know of any revelations the girl had gotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, before the short girl would start she wanted another try at hiding her meal properly. Though even with Meghan's help she failed at that, but did manage to reduce her pregnant looking belly to a significantly less bloated one before gurgling noises started coming from within and once those started it wasn't long before the bulge deflated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe visual change implied what was going on inside and it was hard not to look at. It didn't take long for the little girl's belly to become entirely flat, during which time she had asked Meghan several questions that she'd gotten semi-sentient answers to. Then came the whole absorbing properly deal, Bryci had quite a bit to handle obviously she had practised and found a few things that she applied before she started questioning Meghan, who ended up mostly look things up that Bryci had seen in the material, but not really grasped. Hence it took a while before Bryci gave up on her occupants and evicted them, by then she had absorbed quite a bit more than she normally would have had. Several times more and with the shift of mass to the parallel dimension, what remained was less than the previously normal load of a small girl, much to Bryci's satisfaction, but it still bothered her that she needed one of these special seats, but perhaps if it'd just have been one and not six prey she might have managed to use a normal one. She'd have to try that when she got home. The aspect of bringing one and using her own facilities excited her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Meghan's turn though, much to the larger girl's discomfort. Still she realized that she obviously needed Bryci's help. The girl hadn't been forthcoming at all with what she'd done while she was doing it she Meghan needed to ask the girl while trying to apply it at the same time, the tables were now turned, now she was the one being taught, unfortunately these things Byrci hadn't known since childhood and she wasn't really sure what was the proper cause of action apparent by the fact that she still had quite a bit more to learn and to Meghan's frustration Bryci going with what felt right, a vague useless advice, that spoke of Bryci having some talent for doing it, and less for teaching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end Meghan did manage to reduce the load quite significantly and even managed to store a bit of her meal in that new way Alectra had spoken of, so even though she got quite a bit more from this meal than a normal one and her normally just eating one a day, she didn't feel bloated or full and felt like she could have another, though she wasn't spending more energy, so she could probably go for days afterwards without eating, but that was a later issue. The important thing was that she could get more practice now. Bryci seemed quite eager to get going even though she'd have a much larger meal and gone much harder at it, for while Bryci might have gotten away with a normal toilet for a one-person meal, the one-person meal Meghan had just had, definitely needed the specialized throne she had used.</span></div></div>",

Stopping the girl in mid bend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you can take a seat, just don't digest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Bryci said and took her seat, waiting for Meghan to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much have you trained keeping your digestion at bay?\u201d Meghan wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much I suppose.\u201d It wasn't really the aspect of it she had been interested in, though she did sort of hold back while she practised hiding and while she was waiting to get to a place where she could digest properly, but if her meals semi-digested in the meantime hadn't really mattered as long as they weren't screaming to get out of her ass, when she was miles from a toilet. She did have quite good control of her digestion capabilities, so that meant she was fairly good at holding them, back, but she admittedly hadn't really practised that specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I think I'm pretty good at it anyway, I didn't digest the one's we caught out there until we got back here did I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that's not quite the same and it certainly wasn't a long while was it? It took us what? Ten? Fifteen, minutes to get here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I guess you're right that's not that long is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Meghan continued, Bryci eating the people exiting the other toilets out there made her realize that the school wasn't a safe haven. Bryci had told her before that while she and her classmates from the advanced class had agreed not to eat people of school ground, that still left every other predatory girl out there that wasn't in the class and some of them were quite skilled as well and like Bryci here would undoubtedly glean knowledge presented in that class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore specifically Bryci's stomach didn't seem that safe, especially now that she admitted to not having properly practised making her stomach a safe place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut then why do I need to keep prey safe in there anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause it's useful when you practice, especially with friends. I mean it's only fair that I visit your stomach now that you've been in mine several times, but I'm not willing to go in there if you can't keep me safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...\u201d Bryci was a bit taken by that, she'd never considered swallowing Meghan, though admittedly she looked very delicious and the concept of having Meghan in her stomach was quite enticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you want me to practice?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell for starters the whole, keeping digestion at bay and not just at a minimum, but also the whole release thing. You know I've brought girls back up my throat for you to eat and that's something I don't think Blainey is covering in the V101, unless that's changed now. They've been using some orange concoction.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I know about the potion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have any with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Admittedly Bryci hadn't seen any of the stuff outside of class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, so we have a couple of things to cover and you have a couple of people in there to practice on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAl-right.\u201d Bryci hadn't really been that fond of the subject, but the incentive of getting to swallow Meghan was quite a big one and she was beginning to think that the concept of having someone helplessly trapped inside for an extended period of time was beginning to sound pretty interesting as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Meghan started instructing Bryci on some safety techniques and much to the occupants of Bryci's stomach delight the change in there was quite rapid and significant the foul smells soon disappeared and shortly there after their eyes stopped watering and instead the accommodations were just warm dark and wet and not semi-hostile. Her stomach also quieted down and stopped tossing them around and squeezing them from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't hard for her to learn, she was quite good at controlling these muscles organs and whatnot already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was the whole release thing, that was significantly more tricky,  she was pretty good at controlling her stomach muscles, but this was a fingertip kind of procedure, you didn't want to vomit your meal back up, you wanted a controlled regurgitation and harder than controlling the stomach was controlling the throat which just wanted to swallow everything back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in a more or less vomit, at least dry vomit, fashion Bryci did manage to get one of her preys back up, though Meghan stopped her from letting any of it out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's good. Now swallow it down and get the other one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swallowing part wasn't hard, getting the other was, as the first one was in the best position. So she ended up getting that one several times before finally managing to switch, but by then she wasn't really sure it was a switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you have in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA guy and a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, nice and distinctive, good. Get the guy this time then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy had been a fairy tough looking hard-rocker kind of dude, not with the long hair, but with a shaved pate and a bit of beard instead. While the girl had been an average brunette in a fairly summery dress that was now threatening to tear into a million pieces and would have had, if the soaked fabric hadn't clung to her skin so tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough after a bit of fiddling about Bryci managed to get the guy back into her throat, at Meghan's signal he went back into her stomach though and it was instead the girl's turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, hold her there. I think it's time we got moving, so digest the guy, but keep the girl in your throat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci did as she was told, it was a bit much to concentrate on all these things at the same time, especially as the girl wanted to slip down her throat from time to time. It wasn't long before the guy melted away and vacated her stomach though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow make you stomach safe again before you swallow the girl back down again.\u201d Meghan managed just before Bryci had swallowed her anyhow. And it was a good thing too as Bryci's stomach had still been quite unpleasant even if most of the nasty stuff had left with the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci realized that now she did get to try digesting one prey at a time, so she finished the guy completely before she started in on the girl, in fact she even let him out and got up of the seat to have a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Meghan wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I was wondering if I could get a single meal down a normal toilet, you know like the one I have at home. I guess this would have worked, but it's a bit big, perhaps I can do better with her.\u201d Bryci said pointing towards her own stomach and sat back down after flushing to take care of the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed the guy had been a bit big, especially coming from a little girl, but a normal toilet would have managed with some complaints, the girl though being just under hundred thirty pounds rather than they guys just over two hundred, ended up being a more girlish sized turd, nothing that would have given Bryci's toilet at home any trouble. So with a satisfied smile on her face Bryci flushed the girl away and made herself ready to leave for another hunt with Meghan.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meghan admittedly not hungry, felt that with this storage thing, she should be able to go for another meal, though she was aiming for two. She'd have to find some way to burn those calories later though otherwise she wouldn't be able to practice again before midweek and that'd be really bad, but that was a later problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was rather amazed at Bryci though, the girl had eaten at least five people today, probably more seeing as she didn't have any trouble hiding these last two while she'd been having trouble this morning when she found her. She knew the girl was still adopting and 'growing', something she felt quite sure wasn't the case for herself, but even so it was quite fascinating to watch the small girl eat so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh and it was quite obvious that Bryci hadn't been content with those two and was looking for more than that now. The first guy they encountered she dismissed out of hand, hardly paying him any attention as he vanished into her depths. Already walking along towards where she hoped to find the next prey before he even hit her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Meghan's suggestion she did start paying him attention once he got there though, first with the safe surroundings and later with a few trips up and down her throat while they waited for new suitable prey to present themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long once they got to a good location, well they had almost been there when they found him, but before that while there'd been prey there hadn't been opportunity. <br>\r\nIn fact as they got there they spotted a group of girls walking in front of them, Meghan tried to dissuade Bryci, since there were four girls, but the short girl just ignored her and walked faster as to overtake the group. Coming from behind they had plenty of advantage, but Meghan didn't think that was enough to keep things under control, so she stayed back hoping that that would deter Bryci, but alas it did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Bryci launched herself at the rear most girl and engulfed her almost from head to knee in one go, Meghan realized that she couldn't just let this deteriorate into screaming chaos if the other girls should catch on and hurried to catch up and take care of any trouble maker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she even got close Bryci had cleared her throat of the first girl and filled it with the second and as she sidestepped her friend, Bryci was shoving the upper half of the third girl into her throat, just as the last one turned to face what she had assumed was her friend. But before she could scream, Meghan forced her mouth shut and brought her head into her mouth silencing the girl properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to manoeuvre the girl into position she was surprised to find out that she couldn't and then felt a strong tug on the girl that was strong enough to make her spin around and face the cause of it. Namely Bryci, who had already swallowed the girl up to her hips and swallowed yet again making Meghan bend over and almost kiss the short girl as they were now face to face, mere inches apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nod from Bryci made Meghan release the girl, well she only had the head and Bryci the rest, even so Bryci wanted her to let go before she quickly sucked in and swallowed down the last of the prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you take her too?\u201d Meghan wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you didn't seem to want any so that did make them all mine, no? You can't just barge in at the last second and steal one, that's just rude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh al-right, I didn't think you'd go for them if I didn't help but when you did anyway I thought I'd help keep things, well, nice and quiet.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do realize that, but if you want to help, give me some pointers on this thing.\u201d Bryci said, pointing to her bulging middle. So they sat down on a bench while they waited for someone for Meghan to come along while Bryci struggled with hiding the five in her stomach, she only had a small bulge riding high by the time a young couple walked past and nearly got out of her seat before Meghan could push her back down again and indicate that those two were hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, you're greedy.\u201d Meghan accused her when she returned, idly rubbing her stomach where the couple now struggled futility on the inside. \u201cYou planned on claiming these two as well, didn't you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...I guess not as much plan as much as it was instinct. They did look nice and now I think I have the room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell you what you can have anything we find on the way back to school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we're heading back, you don't want more?\u201d Bryci wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I'm not that hungry at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d Bryci agreed and hoped that something would present itself on the way back.</span></div></div>",

Again she saw no reason to leave campus and some unlucky students got to become more intimate with the pretty girl than they really wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan on the other hand was quite sated and felt quite invigorated, something about that stored energy just made her feel satisfied and alert in a whole other way than she usually did, except perhaps just after a meal. She did fear though that it'd last for several days, she really needed the practice, she couldn't stay full for days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome morning and afternoon and thus the next GI8U2 lecture, the sated feeling had not left her, which meant no more practice before hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her seat next to Clarice, was it? <br>\r\nIt felt somewhat weird to know you were supposed to practice with this supposedly very skilled stranger. She'd have to get to now the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClarice, I don't know how to put this, but we really got to get to know each other if we're going to practice together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I agree completely.\u201d The ginger nerdy looking girl replied and turned in her seat to face Meghan properly. \u201cThere is one very important question I have to ask you though, it's quite intimate, but I need you to be truthful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkaaay...?\u201d Meghan offered somewhat perplexed \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarice leaned in closer and kept her voice down so they could keep their conversation private, there was a slight murmur going though the classroom with it being a good ten minutes left before it actually started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you feel about other girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...I see now what you meant about intimate. Had you asked me a couple of months ago I would have said that they were delicious.\u201d This brought a sincere smile to Clarice's face. \u201cNow though, after having met so many other predatory girls I have to admit that there are at times other urges and feelings.\u201d Meghan said and unable to look Clarice in the eye as she did, looking over her shoulder instead and seeing a blonde that she recognized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Actually, that blonde over there with the curls in her hair...f...six seats down, is the one that made me realize I had other than nutritional interest in girls.\u201d That made Clarice raise her eyebrows and look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, you mean Jamie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno her name, I just saw her at the beach last weekend, she's a lifeguard is she not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that's Jamie al-right. She's a fiend of mine.\u201d Clarice said turning back to Meghan. \u201cShe's single as far as I know, not that that matters when we practice.\u201d She added with a wink. \u201cSo I suppose she could help you with those other urges.\u201d Clarice continued keeping her voice really low.<br>\r\n\u201cYou see we only allow lesbians into our group, so it's a real burden off my chest to hear that I can introduce you. However with the class currently as it is, we're not really meeting up for practice since well the topic at the moment is digestion. I suppose I can take you to meet the gang and all, but depending on what topic they cover here it might be a week or two before we start to hang out at our usual spot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, might be good to tell you, it's at the sports gym over by the C-building, don't go there without my company, it really is our place and well intruders tend to get taken care of if you know what I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the warning. You have other tips and warnings? I'd love to hear them, being new to town and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, have a look around, but don't stare, just steal a glance as I give you direction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I can do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see the back rows up by this corner, lots of hulking muscle right there. Well like my friends they too are sort of a group that sticks together and unsurprisingly the campus gym is their place. Obviously they like lifting weights, but more importantly they are always looking for protein, so going there tends to make it very likely that you'll become a protein snack for one of those girls. Dacia, the energetic girl on the edge there with the natural tan in a red dress used to be a TA for V101 a couple of years back, thing is she has a thing for eating other predators, so once the students learned to swallow each other the disappearances of V101 students increased dramatically, actually that's the case every semester anyway and she is part of that reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the other end pretty high up you see a slender Asian looking girl. Kind of nerdy, with fake glasses at times. She seems to have them on now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe used to be in our group, before my time, apparently she went ape-shit and ate someone and when the girls tried to make her pay that just meant that she got even more girls to digest. She's a loner and I feel sorry for the sucker that ends up as her practice partner. She is also as you might have guessed a major player and we've given up any ideas of making her pay. Perhaps Kari can go toe to toe with her, but who really knows? It's just not worth the risk. Just stay well clear of her. Her name at any rate is Casey, which is one indication that she really isn't as Asiatic as she for some reason looks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the middle you see a trim fairly tall brunette sitting with a confidence as if she owned the place, That's Karen, she's also a major player. The girls around her are by no means pushovers and certainly not the submissive kind, but they seem to obey Karen's every word without question for some reason. We usually call them her bitches, and in a sense I suppose they too compose a group of some sort. If they have a place to call their own, then I don't know where it is, probably not on campus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are a lot of girls here I know nothing about, I think a lot of them are post grad students.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about those three?\u201d Meghan asked indicating the three TAs from the current V101 class that she noticed were sitting in the first row, something Clarice and Meghan wasn't after last class' demonstrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, those. Nothing to worry about, Blainey realized that she couldn't allow for girls form any group on campus to be allowed to TA for her class, as they, well. They used their position for recruitment purposes and after Dacia she realized there were other reasons as well, perhaps more important ones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you see the TAs she has now are nobodies, well perhaps Julianne shows a hint of promise, but the other two you should refer to as snack and dessert. Fact is that every other girl in here is able to take on anyone of them, or more like all three of them at once, any day, any time. That they are here is simply because Blainey couldn't very well start an advanced class behind her own TAs back. She was simply forced to include them, even though they are not of the same stock as the rest of the girls here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHard words, Meghan realized there was something cold, but honest about Clarice and felt glad that they were going to be on the same side and made a mental note not to screw that up. She also realized just what Clarice had said, here in the classroom were many of the top predators around, she'd do well to remember these faces, but at the same time she couldn't very well sit and stare at her classmates.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There weren't nearly as many professors and others on stage today, but still quite a few. Blainey was there and greeted everyone as she started of outlining what they'd cover today. Apparently there'd be more techniques on the same subject, well there had been more in the material than what had been covered in class. In fact hardly anything was covered last time and she seemed to recall Alectra saying that they'd continue where they left off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough surprisingly  Alectra didn't take over from Blainey to cover more techniques, instead De Luca stepped forth catching everyone's eyes with her painted on low cut jeans and short flowery orange-ish top that barely contained her breasts and ended just below them, leaving a lot of smooth slender skin between it and the pants below, broken only by an unpierced innie bellybutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast time we started on the subject of acquisition and storage of energy and  miss Condon with the help of her colleagues will resume that topic shortly. However, I will insert a bit of the expenditure of energy in the meantime.\u201d De Luca said giving Alectra a nod, making Meghan all the more certain that by the end of this semester Alectra would probably become Doctor Condon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise started out as if it was some class on mechanics, forces mass and energy requirements. It made more sense when she started referring to things, more specifically a predator carrying prey around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started out fairly simple with just a transportation of mass from point A to point B, but then added the pendle motion of walking or running and the inherent inefficiency in the fact that the mass does not move smoothly from point A to B, walking you can easily tell that the center of gravity does not move in a straight path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen surprisingly she asked for one of the researchers from Hawthorn's team to continue. Emily Tomore the pale slim blonde was called and although quite busty she had nothing on the professor, who now that the girl of average height stood next to her, looked surprisingly tall. Something about those extreme curves of hers made her look short, but she was in fact several inches taller than Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily then took the chemist's approach, which was why De Luca had handed over the piece of chalk. Emily went on to give a quick overview of how energy in the body is stored and then retrieved and more specifically used and then went on to try and get some rough numbers on the conversions needed for the example of the walking or running predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDe Luca thanked the girl and added her numbers to the growing formula in the ongoing example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, now I need some volunteers.\u201d De Luca said with way too much satisfaction. It being fairly obvious what the volunteers would do in this demonstration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan was glad they weren't on the first row as De Luca eyed the girls there hungrily, but then she raised her gaze to the general level again and added. \u201cWell then, seeing as I'm not getting any volunteers I'll just have to ask for...you girls on the....hmmm...third row to come over here.\u201d She said without meeting their gaze and moved over to the chalkboards on the left of the stage and produced a blank one before adding \u201cAll of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan realized that meant her, when De Luca had said the third row, she, like most others had waited for her to pick one side or the other, not the whole row, which was possibly the most filled row in the classroom being close enough to see well, but not too close to risk...well this.. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDe Luca hadn't really thought about it, she'd just picked a number at random and it was just when she didn't hear anyone getting up that she had added 'all of you'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the girls were quickly removing excess garments and such and moving onto the stage De Luca dashed to the room in the back and retrieved a bathroom scale and stopped to instruct the TAs to retrieve another item she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when she came back she was faced with a row of half naked students, the third row to be precise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... I had only thought of having five or six volunteers, but you're less than half as willing as volunteers, so I suppose it's only fair you're more than twice as many.\u201d De Luca said with a mischievous grin.\u201dBut I suppose that I should stick to the original plan. You, you, you, you, you and you. Stay. The rest of you please return to your seats.\u201d De Luca added and motioned for the girls she'd picked out to form a queue over by the chalkboard she had prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the bathroom scale on the floor she motioned for the first girl to step on to it as she made a list on the chalkboard. Soon enough she had the names of all the six girls and their weights in this semi-undressed state listed neatly on the board. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately Meghan found herself to be one of those six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise then stepped onto the scale herself and added her own weight, which made a few raise their eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she ordered the volunteers to get in line again and before they managed that she had crammed the first one in and swallowed her down, just that quickly, and almost repeated the process with the second girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDe Luca wasn't savouring them at all Meghan realized and watched as the professor was clearly enjoying herself, but in a more gorging, gluttonous way and while she came to that conclusion De Luca had made her way through the girls in front of her and she got to experience that rough treatment the professor was giving all the girls. <br>\r\nStrong hands grasped onto her and easily lifted her up and forcefully crammed her into not just the professor's mouth but far down into her throat, so it only took a single swallow to send her far enough that gravity slid her down the rest of the way. By then she felt a girl's hand on her feet and the girl seemed to travel with her into the depths and pile on top of her as she herself piled on top of the girls that had gone before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot stopping for a moment's rest it wasn't long before De Luca grasped the parallel outstretched feet of the last girl, that still stuck out of her, with one hand and shoved them inside, finishing up with licking the fingers of that hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she looked down at her bloated middle and quickly it shrank away until it only resembled a mid term pregnancy at most, riding somewhat high on her belly.<br>\r\nShe then stepped back onto the scale and added the new weight to the board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAccording to this, the girls weigh about thirteen pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then the TAs had brought in a treadmill behind her and she stepped on to it and started with the programming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's see what calories this machine says I'm burning while hauling these girls around.\u201d She said attaching the sensor on a cord to her wrist. \u201cHuh...rude machine asking a lady for her age. Well seeing as we're all ladies here I can divulge that information. It's thirty-six.\u201d She said finishing the pre-programming and hit the start-button.<br>\r\nTo the surprise of especially the girls in her stomach De Luca didn't walk, even at a quick pace, no she started jogging and a pretty brisk jog it was. They would have been baffled had they known that she had maximized the elevation incline on the machine as well judging by the ease she took and held the pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndoubtedly she had chosen that setting, Meghan thought, so that she wouldn't have to carry out a whole workout in front of class before she got any interesting numbers, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile De Luca kept running the TAs distributed the new material, even taking care to leave a set in every now vacant seat for the girls currently inside the professor. They took their sweet time carrying out the task and even as they retook their places on stage the professor kept on running, instead Alectra had readied herself to take over and so she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo while Meghan along with the tangled mess of other girls bounced around inside Professor De Luca's stomach they heard miss Condon resume last week's lecture. At least they were the closest students and apparently many enough to keep De Luca from hiding them completely, but they were still hidden quite a bit and there were quite a few other things going on that kept them from hearing what Alectra had to say. So all in all while miss Condon covered technique after technique they could at best make out snippets here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as time went on the professor's stomach that had been so calm and nice from the beginning was beginning to sound grumpier and grumpier and after a while the girls could hear the professor's guts begging to let them try the techniques Alectra was covering on the tasty treats inside her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then it was so noisy that Meghan and the girls didn't notice when Alectra handed over to several of her colleagues, who went on with explaining different aspects and techniques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were even an questions and answers episode where a few girls presented quite a few questions and straightened out a few things, apparently some girls had succeeded better at absorbing things than they had at storing it as the new fat and got a bit of the normal fat instead, much to their dissatisfaction. It sounded like that particular problem got somewhat straightened out though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough it all De Luca had kept on running without missing a beat and as the stage cleared she kept on running until one of the TAs notified her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she pressed the stop-button and the machine slowly ground to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, then. The machine says I've burned...\u201d She said looking down at the display \u201c...barely  two thousand kilo-calories.\u201d Something the girls inside her could tell was just ridiculous as they could clearly hear the originally calm and pleasant gut of hers now screaming for her to digest them. The hunger growls were almost loud enough for the girls in the front row to hear them, despite De Luca's body with her hiding techniques in place providing quite a bit of insulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went over to the chalkboard and summarized the girls weights and her own original weight and went back to the main boards where she added it to the growing equation also adding the distance that she\u2019d run and the effect that her incline should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then went over to where unnoticed by most Emily had made a chart and a list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs seen here miss Tomore have helped us with what the normal body contains and perhaps more importantly in this example how many calories that is. So from this we can get an average calories per kilo, which I suppose is what we're interested in.\u201d She said and returned to the board with the main equation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst we have to make some assumptions on the body compositions, with most of their clothes removed I got a fairly good look and would put these girls in the lean category.\u201d Denice said and gave her belly a pat for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith that in mind the machine says that I've spent roughly one kilo worth of girl while I was running and if we apply the numbers to our basic equation here and thus taking into account the girls weight that we measured earlier and not just the weight of the bulge they made. We find that I've spent more like five kilos worth of girl, rounding up a bit, which is roughly a twelfth of a girl. Let me just say that my gut feeling is that that's just ridiculous.\u201d De Luca said with a smile that made most girls that were close enough to see it glad they weren't inside the gut in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we have actually neglected a couple of important things so far. Very important in this scenario.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirstly my weight in the other dimensions which most likely is a lot bigger than the three dimensional weight of the girls seeing as I can fit them inside me. It's a bit hard to determine, so here we'll just have to guess, but lets keep it small and just say three times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe second thing is more uncertain, it's if I have to carry around their extradimensional weight as well and something tells me I do. The important part here was that they too have a greater weight I have to haul and lets assume they are smaller than me, being good preds still half as big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThus summarizing I'd have to digest one whole girl to regain the energy I just spent on the treadmill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat  didn't sound very accurate to the girls inside her, who could hear every organ in her body begging her to do a lot more than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that would have been if I had digested as I went along and used the energy as it was provided to me, which I didn't, so in our more thorough equation we take into account that I used stored energy and thus we have to apply the, as you noticed earlier, fairly inefficient energy conversions from my stored body fat, to energy and then energy to replace the stored fat lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst you notice that protein isn't stored as fat, my body might use it for other purposes or if I had digested as I ran along for fuel, but it isn't stored as fat and thus we can eliminate that part of the equation. Secondly we find that on such a diet I would not have any carbohydrate source and as miss Tomore showed us, we need quite a bit of carbohydrates, glucose specifically. You learned how to control gluconeogenesis in your body in V101 I've been informed, but I suppose by now your bodies does it without you even thinking of it. It wasn't covered there how much of an energy drain it is though, but I'm sure miss Condon covered that topic more thoroughly when I wasn't paying attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe important thing here isn't just the energy loss caused by gluconeogenesis, but the fact that I needed so much glucose to keep running. Lets say that I have strong enough lungs to keep the fat oxidation at roughly forty percent even though I was running pretty fast. That means we only have a five percent loss on that portion of the energy. However the rest has to go through gluconeogenesis first and there are several ways to do that as miss Condon showed, so I'll just take a rough average here, which is a forty percent loss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis means that I actually need twice as much to regain what I lost.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow this sounded more likely to the girls inside her stomach, but still too low. Well there were quite a bit of estimates that she'd made and she'd gone low on most of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuckily this new fat that Professor Hawthorn and her team has been studying can be much more efficient in all conversions. So the energy requirement might not need to be just that high. Plus we didn't take into account the increased absorption techniques that miss Condon has been covering so far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that's it for today's class, see you Friday.\u201d De Luca finished with a slight bow, but making no indication that she was going to cough up the girls that had spent almost the entire class in her stomach.</span></div></div>",

After a few bouncing steps she realized that was not yet the case. She heard a door slam and then the stomach closed in on her and the rest of the girls causing several to scream in fright before they realized that they were being forced back up the professor's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne after another they emptied onto a cold hard floor and looked up to see that the door they'd heard was not one leading to a toilet, though several such were in front of them and to their left were some showers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the girls lined up for the showers as they emerged. With there only being three showers though, most girls went and got their spare clothes first seeing as the showers filled up quickly anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that many, but Meghan was one of them had noticed that De Luca had been holding a flask of that orange stuff when they emerged. Perhaps it didn't matter, but she'd had some success teaching Bryci to do without that stuff, she'd just assumed that the professors would have known by now. Was her mother holding out on them, or had De Luca just not gotten around to it yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't feel important. That she didn't get digested by the professor was the important part and her shower after that. Meghan hurried a bit, she wasn't sure why, but realized that she'd been amongst the first to leave and that she hadn't even said goodbye to Clarice, who had looked quite grumpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until she was leaving the school grounds that she realized that she didn't know where she a was heading. She should hunt, since she needed the practice, but even though she hadn't eaten today she still felt full.

Just a simple \u201cYou home?\u201d seeing as how close it was there was no need, nor time, for anything fancy. And she was already in the elevator when she got the affirmative reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci opened the door before Meghan hardly had time to knock. Looking down she saw the pretty girl in a fairly short top that hung somewhat loosely from her impressive chest, exposing quite a bit of smooth flat belly before a pair of snug blue jeans took over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan noticed that the fly was still undone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVenting are we?\u201d she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Bryci giggled as she stepped aside to let her friend in. \u201cYou didn't answer, so I'm afraid I just ate.\u201d She added and headed back into the room. \u201cAnd well...just made them leave.\u201d She said bringing the point home by sipping up her fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's al-right I'm not hungry right now anyway. Sorry about not answering you wouldn't believe where I've been.\u201d Meghan said thinking about the chesty professor. Then thinking Bryci was quite buxom as well. Didn't the professor say something about breast? She tried to recall as she noticed that she could only see the thin shoulder straps of Bryci's top, she couldn't see any for a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you take of that top?\u201d Meghan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci was a bit puzzled by the request. \u201cSure...\u201d But did as asked anyhow. \u201cThe pants as well?\u201d She queried, figuring that Meghan probably wanted to gulp her up again, now that they weren't going to go out hunting. And even though she'd grown to think eating was much better than getting eaten, since then it wasn't a one time thing, she felt safe with Meghan and the aspect still tickled her in all the right ways, though now she had to imagine that Meghan was going to digest her. It was still good though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, why not?\u201d Meghan managed after Bryci had already started undoing her pants. The top was off and Meghan's initial curiosity was settled, Bryci didn't have a bra and those big boobs of hers stood out as proudly as if they'd been a plastic surgeon's best accomplishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPondering the fact and marvelling at her friend's fine physique Meghan didn't quite contemplate what they should do, while Bryci quickly finished undressing, perhaps a bit too eagerly, but Meghan didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you gonna eat me or what?\u201d Bryci said as she walked up to the tall blonde standing in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hadn't planned on it.\u201d Meghan admitted as she looked down at Bryci again, the talk of eating bringing her eyes to the shorter girl's belly and reminding her of what she had said yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why?...\u201d Bryci blurted, somewhat baffled by the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps we should try the other way?\u201d Meghan said, dropping her bag and pausing to see if she should start undressing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci struggled not to grin, but it was hard. \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have practised haven't you?\u201d Meghan continued noticing that Bryci seemed to like the concept and she started disrobing, which was good because otherwise Bryci might have gulped her up clothes and all and now she didn't have any spares nearby, since she was wearing the ones she'd had at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Bryci smiled and helped her friend undress faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do we start?\u201d Bryci wondered as she stood there eyeing her friend, realizing that she hadn't seen Meghan naked before and without her clothes on she didn't look that intimidating. Her tall slender and svelte frame made her really pretty, but not intimidating...more like well, she looked delicious Bryci determined and brought her hands up, not sure where to put them and thus awaiting instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's up to you I suppose, but please be gentle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should take it slowly?\u201d Bryci wondered as she grasped Meghan by the hips, wondering if the girl should be heavy or not, finding to her surprise that Meghan didn't feel any different than any other girl her size, as she lifted the blonde with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease do.\u201d Meghan agreed as she found out she probably wasn\u2019t ready for this. It felt really weird with Bryci picking her up like that. It didn't feel any less weird as the small girl manoeuvred her in mid air so that her thighs came up against her front and her hips plunged into Bryci's warm wet mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least Bryci kept her word, she did take it slowly. Meghan felt herself gently slide in between Bryci's lips and it took her a while before she realized that she still hadn't entered the girl's throat. Bryci was simply hiding her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Bryci leaned back a bit so that she could balance Meghan in her mouth somewhat while she brought Meghan's lower legs up one at a time and stretched her cheeks to stuff them inside. Before long Meghan found herself sitting on her shins inside Bryci's mouth, with only her torso sticking out from her chest and up. Her friend's mouth was pretty stretched, with bulging cheeks, but it wasn't huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself thinking that Bryci was better at hiding than this, but then again she had said she was going to take it slow and obviously she was still applying her skills seeing as she still hadn't entered the girl's throat and was still sinking into her. Well those lips were coming up her neck now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite eerie to look out of Bryci's normally so dainty mouth and finding that it now could close behind you, trapping you inside. Then it did just that. But Bryci didn't do anything. Meghan still stretched her mouth quite a bit, but now that she was inside Bryci applied the last tricks she had held back and Meghan quickly shrank to a more manageable size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill filling her mouth though, but even so Bryci found it hard to believe that Meghan would feel just like any other girl. As she sat herself down amongst the pillows of her bed and started to taste the morsel in her mouth she had to struggle to accept that it was actually Meghan she was swishing around with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen gently she leaned back onto her pillows, making sure she could see down between her breasts and onto her belly before she tilted her head back and let Meghan smoothly slide down her throat. Pulling her head back down again to see if she could make out the tall blonde's journey and finding out that she could not.<br>\r\nShe could feel Meghan enter her stomach, but outside her belly remained a soft flat expanse without even a ripple going over the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a big predator she though and trapped like any other light snacks inside some little girl's stomach. The concept made her sopping wet and luckily Meghan was in no position to notice her glistering lower lips. Bryci did jolt a bit, afraid that she'd forgotten to apply the safety techniques, but a quick check assured her that she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow where was she? That interruption had put her a bit out of her mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci moved a hand down between her legs and inserted a finger and then two as she brought the other one down to rub a bit as well. She'd just play a little, she didn't want to alert Meghan to what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, this was good, but...Meghan wasn't doing much in there was she? \u201cCould you struggle a bit in there Meg?\u201d Bryci asked realizing what was missing. \u201cNot too hard though\u201d she added in a hurry, knowing that Meghan like her was stronger than she looked, perhaps it could get painful, she didn't want that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan didn't mind, she'd arrived in the pitch black darkness to a calm wet and friendly stomach, Bryci had indeed practised and applied the techniques they'd covered, but now that she was here what to do? So she did move her attention to the walls around her, it was quite roomy, they didn't hug her at all, she could probably stretch out. Yeah, her head didn't reach the opening to the throat and her feet didn't touch the opening south, she realised as she'd made herself more comfortable. Then she started gently pushing at the walls and moving her feet up and down, not sure if she should kick and punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci giggled, that was better, but not really convincing. Hearing Bryci's amusement Meghan did try a few light punches and a couple of weak kicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, that's more like it.\u201d Bryci sighed, but it still felt pathetic, so she added. \u201cHarder\u201d and Meghan obeyed, punching and kicking harder and harder. She could hear Bryci start to moan, so she clearly wasn't hurting the girl, so every so often she increased the force a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she thought that she was punching pretty damn hard, but Bryci was still just moaning and in fact the girl had brought one of her hands up to her slender middle and was rubbing her stomach and when that giant hand pressed down on her Meghan thought it was getting a bit uncomfortable and then her pushes outwards to keep it away were quite genuine, not that Bryci seemed to notice. Apparently it only felt good to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still calm and all inside Bryci's stomach but with her rubbing and all Meghan decided that she wanted out now, this was enough, also she was finally getting hungry, this workout must have burned through her reserves.. So she yelled as much, but only once as she realized that as hidden as she was there was little chance that Bryci would hear her, so she started punching and kicking genuinely, just to get the girl's attention.<br>\r\nBryci did notice the slight increase, but only replied with more moans of appreciation.</span></div></div>",

Somehow she had just assumed that Meghan would force her way out of there when she wanted out, but perhaps that was more effort than it was worth seeing as Bryci now knew how to cough her back up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci sat up in her bed and did her dry vomiting, feeling her stomach close in on her friend and forcing the girl back up her throat. Coughing her up was a pretty good analogy, she hadn't gotten anywhere near what you could call good at it, but at least she did get Meghan out of her stomach and was bringing the girl up into her mouth when she realized that she was probably pretty slimy and in need of a shower. So getting out of bed she hurried into her bathroom while Meghan gathered up inside her mouth once more. She then pushed aside the shower door and leaned down somewhat before letting Meghan slide out feet first. Finally slipping free in a kneeling position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you might need a shower.\u201d Bryci explained as Meghan took in where she was. \u201cThere's towels in that cabinet.\u201d The sorter girl added before hurrying back to the main room. Quickly shifting the blankets of her bed so that Meghan wouldn't see the wet patch that she'd made during the last half hour, hour? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long had they she been at it?<br>\r\nIt didn't really matter, what did matter was that Meghan would probably want to go out hunting and in all honesty she could got for a bit to eat. A purring from her gut told her that it agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Meghan emerged from the shower and started to get dressed Bryci was already dressed in the clothes she'd worn earlier and sat on the bed waiting for her friend to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how come you didn't just get out when you wanted out?\u201d Bryci wondered, a question Meghan had dreaded, she wasn't sure she wanted Bryci to know that she didn't have the first clue as how to do that. She did know one thing though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause something working against your body is really uncomfortable. You've ever swallowed something really dry that you didn't soak enough in your saliva and it just slowly and painfully edged down your throat?\u201d Meghan asked getting an affirmative nod. \u201cWell this would be similar, but going the opposite direction of course. But regurgitating me wasn't painful at all was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no, I guess it wasn't.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you see why I wanted you to learn that first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, still need a bit of practice though.\u201d Bryci said licking her lips jokingly with a hand on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about it sent a shiver down Meghan's spine and she realized that she'd just been in that stomach, helpless inside that stomach actually. \u201cSome other time.\u201d Was what she answered though, hoping that the new class would cover escape techniques soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we should probably go find something to eat instead. You hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome.\u201d Meghan admitted, though in fact she was quite hungry, as hungry as she normally was when she ate, but seeing how much Bryci put away she wasn't sure what to think or say. The girl had after all just finished eating when she arrived and was seemingly already hungry again.</span></div></div>",

She had noticed that the professor did cover other things, that weren't in the book and that was what she was looking forward to, that and the practice session where she hoped to get some help from the TAs. There was just one other thing, the book wasn't the only thing she was done with. She was quite through with her practice partner as well, in fact she'd wiped the last of her off of her butt at noon yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now as she eagerly scribbled down a copy of every mark and remark the professor made from in front of the class, she was also wondering if the same professor should question her about the absence of her 'friend'. <br>\r\nAs time went past though her body was more and more turning her attention to the fact that the practice session was quickly approaching and the seats next to her were empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two girls in front of her though, her body kept reminding her, not as filling as her partner had been, having been of her own size and frankly she was possibly past being plump and onto being fat, nothing that her partner had any blame in, to her surprise her fears of adding a heap of pounds to her already quite heavy frame had not come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a hand on her empty, but still bulging gut, Georgina thought that the two petite girls in front of her might fit nicely if she got both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after that the TAs scattered and the professor ended her droning, announcing instead that it was time to practice and in doing so resuming her usual place where she had a fairly good view of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgina hadn't really thought about it, but she did need some sort of conversation starter and possibly lie to get the girls in front of her into her belly. As she gave it some quick thought before leaning forward she wasn't surprised to find them facing each other in their seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d She managed but at least got the girls' attention. \u201cMy practice partner called me just before class and said she was sick. Any chance I could practice with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally looked up at the girl in the seat behind her, the girl was still sitting, so the back of her own seat blocked most of the view, but she still got a notion of the girl's impressive chest and the bare shoulders of her along with that somewhat puffy face told her that the girl was a bit more than a little soft around the edges, no extra chins though, and with the long perfectly straight hair with just a cut opening for her face from her eyes down, she was actually rather pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I'm gonna practice on my friend here.\u201d Sally said and Georgina saw that the girl was shedding clothes. \u201cNo offence, but you look like you might be a bit big for me just yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's al-right, I'll ask someone else.\u201d Georgina said with a soft smile. She hadn't been interested in being the one inside a stomach anyhow. Somehow she was surprised, she thought she was doing well, but as she looked about she realized that there were a few, that like the little girls in front of her, were getting ready to swallow each other.<br>\r\nSince she couldn't have the girls in front and she was just a few seats from the edge, empty seats from the edge, she turned around behind her to the empty seats there. That only really left leaving the row, or moving down the line.</span></div></div>",

Well one was probably average height, but she was skinny enough that the other one probably outweighed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to interrupt girls, but my practice partner called in sick today...\u201d Georgina said interrupting the two girls' giggling, making them eye her soft frame over. Seeing that she did have big thighs and a sizeable muffin-top, but all in all she was pretty proportionate and that big chest of hers did help her to avoid the disgusting fat-league.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, sure I guess.\u201d The skinny one said, not sure where to make room for the girl seeing as they were sitting in a row and she and her partner had loaded some things in the adjacent seats as well. \u201cWe're trying melons, you want one?\u201d She added offering a green oblong fruit to the girl still standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, my partner and I moved a bit past that. I think I could have practised alone on the fruits and medicine balls.\u201d Georgina said, trying not to sound superior or anything. \u201cI was more well... wondering if I could practice ...on...you.\u201d She said bringing the point home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d The two girls chimed in chorus, both of their eyes shifting to the soft girls middle, that didn't bulge as much now that she was standing. Facing each other they exchanged puzzled looks and Gerorgina could see by their body language that they asked without actually saying anything and came to a conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose we hadn't thought that far ahead.\u201d The shorter one said as Georgina met the eyes of the girl closest to her. \u201cBut I guess that's where this was leading all along and well... perhaps it's not so surprising that we weren't getting there first, but rather...\u201d She didn't quite know how to put it, so Georgina interrupted her search for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat a girl with my experience would beat you to the punch.\u201d Georgina laughed and grabbed a  handful of her soft belly for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, yeah, I suppose that's a way to put it.\u201d The skinny one smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you don't mind?\u201d Georgina wondered, bringing the conversation back to the actual topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...well we've got to learn sometime, so why not?\u201d The short one proclaimed, confirming Georgina's reading of their earlier body language conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou've...ehm...seem to have occupied a bit of space here and I think we might need a bit of space, so I'll just sit down over her.\u201d Georgina said, moving back towards her own seat and taking one amongst the empty ones, leaving two empty between her and the closest one the girls had put stuff in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do we do this?\u201d The short one asked as she stepped in next to Gerorgina and her partner lined up behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I can handle the start and then I suppose the other one of you can help along. Might be a bit of trouble with those flailing legs. It's pretty hard to know where to put your feet when you're being turned upside down me and my partner noticed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, I suppose I'm going.\u201d The girl closest said, offering Georgina her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure...\u201d the plump girl said. \u201c...but you might want to lose that sweater and perhaps some other things. It's a pretty wet and pretty tight ride, it's not kind to clothes, they tend to get not just soaked, but stretched as well. And they soak up a lot of saliva making it really hard to swallow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u201d The girl said turning back towards her partner, not sure how much undressing she was comfortable with, but then again it wasn't like there was any boys in class to ogle her.  \u201cSo do you want to try it, or should I?\u201d She asked trying to make her skinny friend make the decision for her.</span></div></div>",

Eventually edging around her partner in just her panties bra and a sleeveless top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you ready?\u201d Georgina asked as their hands met and she started bringing the girl's towards her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...yes.\u201d The girl smiled, wondering just how weird this would feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small nod was all she got from the girl who was going to eat her, before her hands got enveloped and she felt a wet pressure creeping up her lower arms, but the most significant sensation was the heat, that and the sleek moving flesh. \u201cIt's like getting kissed all over.\u201d she said turning to her practice partner, already leaning over as she felt the big girl's teeth bump along her arms, like a knuckle-massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat good?\u201d Her friend wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think that might be what she's actually doing.\u201d The skinny one giggled, feeling Georgina's wiggling tongue taste her as she slipped on in without any trouble. And she didn't get a chance to say anything else, because Georgina continued with her head and moved on down her slender frame with the same ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forward a bit Georgina guided her prey and made her arc her back a bit so that she could continue on down. To her own surprise the big girl found that she could lean on forward and let her gut hang over the seat while it pushed against and between the girl that was getting eaten's own legs. And so she could move past those slender hips and a bit down the thighs before she could simply lean back into her seat and let the girl's wiggling legs slide down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe adjusted her gut and inside the girl shifted as well as she curled up fully inside the plump girl's stomach. \u201cOh, that went a lot smother than I thought, I guess she didn't have the girth that my partner has.\u201d Georgina sighed hiding her belly a bit so that it fit more comfortably in her lap, nothing that either of the other girls noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's pretty damn cool.\u201d The short girl exclaimed, wondering if it was okay to put her hands on the big gut that contained her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, go ahead.\u201d Georgina giggled, pulling the girls hands towards her and placing them on her big but no longer soft gut. \u201cI wouldn't mind you doing that from the inside though. Your partner isn't exactly a big as mine.\u201d She lied, seeing as now her partner was a lot smaller than either girls, and if she'd been able to apply the techniques the professor had gone through today for minimizing the size of the waste, she'd been a lot smaller still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...\u201d The girl began, she wasn't sure about getting in there as well, but as she paused and looked around she saw that there was actually quite a bit of girl swallowing going on. \u201c...okay then.\u201d She decided and started removing her shoes and socks, before continuing with her skirt and sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d Georgina smiled, waiting with anticipation for the girl to finish and as the girl turned back towards her she stood up and opened her mouth wide enough to stuff the girl's whole head inside in just one gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl was a bit wider than her friend, but not much and with the leverage of her added height and the girl's assistance Georgina could even though she was just five foot seven herself, lean on down over the girl , using the girl's planted feet on the floor to provide the resistance and thus the force needed to shove the girl down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with herself standing the seat had popped back up in place, so she had pretty good room for herself and her gut as she crouched down and her lips slid over the short girl's hips. Georgina eventually went to her knees as she continued to press on downwards and leaned ever lower until her gut rested on the floor and the girl's lower legs were the only thing left sticking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back up she had hardly time to lean back before the girl's feet had slipped into her mouth and down her throat to join the rest of her and her friend inside Georgina''s now quite sizable stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing it with a pleased grin adorning her face, Georgina returned to her seat to have a look at her notes while she tried to hide the stomach some more, she didn't have much problem to reduce it to less than girl sized, but after that she knew it would get tricky and the little TA had been the better one at that, wasn't that what they had said? So instead of continuing on her own she decided to get the TA's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back up again she looked around before spotting the short girl and a few gestures made one of the girls close to Julianne make her aware of the fact that there was someone who wanted her attention. She gave the girl a signal that she would come shortly. <br>\r\nActually she was almost done with the questions she had gotten, so moments later she was by Georgina's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what can I help you with.\u201d Julianne smiled, her eyes more on the girl's sizeable gut that had pushed her top up to lay in folds just beneath her big breasts, which it still covered. The gut itself was sporting a big somewhat smooth, but still lumpy bulge, so the girl's partner must be inside it Julianne figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiding.\u201d Georgina said, jumping straight to the point, while offering the TA one of the empty seats next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, of course.\u201d Julianne said, realizing that that was why the gut wasn't as big as she'd expected the girl's partner to be, the girl was already practising hiding techniques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you've already started a bit on that.\u201d The TA said as she sat down. \u201cBut I think we'll take it from the start anyway so I can get a grip of what you've done and where to move from there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne was surprised to learn that the girl actually had a pretty good understanding of the techniques covered in V101 and as they went through them the girl's stomach receded quite a bit. But it felt like the girl would have managed that on her own, so she found herself moving on to the techniques she was just learning herself in the advanced class. And after she'd divulged a few of them, she moved on to help the next girl, leaving Georgina to try and apply them to the girls inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgina was very pleased, the girls had gone down pretty quickly and she had a few new techniques to try and quite a bit of time still before the class ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly her gut shrank and as soon as she could she pulled her top down over it and suddenly it looked natural for a thick girl as herself. She didn't normally have that kind of gut, but she could pull it off as being her own. That didn't mean she was satisfied and while she was at it she did manage to catch Julianne a few times as she hurried past, she even managed to get another technique out of the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo by the time the class neared its end, she hardly had any bulge at all, the one she had could be passed of as a very large meal, which was when she realised that she had no intention of letting the girls out any other way than the natural one. Something that made her glance over at their stuff, should she clean that up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started gathering their things, luckily it wasn't that much, small girls have small things and don't carry too much around. Taking it all back to her own seat she could stuff a lot of it inside her own bag and thus only require one of theirs to contain the remainder. That'd be her 'practice partner's' bag, if anyone was nosy enough to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlainey hadn't missed thing though and the girl's actions spoke pretty clearly to her. Not that it mattered much, in fact it meant that she didn't have to worry about those two any more. They had been learning, but too slowly for her taste, she might have had to taken care of them herself had not this plump brunette solved the problem for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd also noticed that a lot of the girls with knowledge prior to the start of the class had seen that there were proper swallowing going on and dropped most of the faking routine. She could tell there were still a few holding back, but how many she wasn't sure, some of the girls had even managed to fool her, making her wonder if some of the girls she ate last week hadn't been as bad as they had let on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter, they shouldn't have played that useless if that was the case.<br>\r\nThere were still quite a few that were bad and with many coming out with their skills, chances were slim that these ones were faking it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach let out a purring request and she decided that at least two should not make it to their next class, question was; Which ones?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girls inside her gut had heard the thing about her practising hiding on them and they had noticed that there was a more or less constant change as Georgina continued to hide them more and more, so even though they found it a bit overwhelming to be trapped in that warm wet darkness, they did decide to stay the practice session, if that was what Georgina wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as the session was over and they could hear everyone leave and feel Georgina move with them, they wondered why they hadn't been let out yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it wasn't until that time when they finally started struggling, but by then they hardy made a bulge in the heavy girl's gut and their struggles actually just felt nice to her. She had considered starting to digest them, but seeing as she didn't know if she'd be forced to throw them up or not, she decided to play nice. And it wasn't like she had mastered those hiding techniques either so, she moved onto her next class carrying the girls along after she'd left their stuff inside her locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring that boring history lecture she'd paid more attention to hiding them than to the lady in the front going on about the civil war or what ever it was, she hardly cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still one more class though making her almost curse at first, she just wanted to go home and digest these two in peace, but then she realized that her toilet might not be able to handle that, Which was when she remembered that Blainey had covered a few techniques that could help her in that regard, so the two girls inside her found them selves exploring the social economics of a girl's belly, or at least exploring her lower digestive tract while the girl in question hardly paid attention to the topic of social economics, which was what was the professor in front of the class droned on about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgina wasn't quite done when the class was though, so she moved down to the study center to read a bit, while the girls wrapped up their tour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while, but eventually Georgina could feel the girls move up her ascending colon and then back down again as she gathered her things and headed towards the nearest toilet.<br>\r\nShe had thought she'd need to hurry the last bit, but as the two smaller girls settled inside her big butt, they didn't cause nearly the pressure she'd feared. In fact she could calmly move along and make herself comfortable, before she needed to swank a bit to spread those big soft cheeks and start to push the two girls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell there was only one big lump so she couldn't tell them apart, but she could tell that they were a lot smaller than her partner had been. In fact she noticed after she'd wiped herself and stood up, that the specialized toilet hadn't bottomed out as it had done with her partner.<br>\r\nThe two girls inside the bowl were quite a bit too big for a normal toilet, but not horribly so, she thought as she pushed the handle and sent them on their way. With a bit of practice she could probably get away with using a normal one, if she only ate one at a time, or at least shat them out one at a time, she corrected herself when she felt the empty feeling in her gut. It had been nice with two in there.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a few days after Meghan's trip inside De Luca, when she and Bryci had gone through the new material at least somewhat. She hadn't gleaned much from the last lesson, that was for sure. Luckily the short girl seemed nigh obsessed, so even though she wasn't the greatest teacher, Meghan did get a bit of help from her.<br>\r\nA couple of trips into the raven haired girl's stomach helped her burn off a few calories as well so she could practice some. Bryci seemed to enjoy visiting hers as well, so it was a fairly mutual exchange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the only class she was having though, so in a free period she was sitting down in the student center's main room, where she wasn't the only student quietly reading or scribbling down notes, or answers to questions as they struggled to solve them. Meghan was reading up on biochemistry which was the class she'd have later in the afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a large girl loomed over her, looking up Meghan recognized the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Madeline, been a while hasn\u2019t it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I'm sorry to disturb, but could you come with me in here, I need to ask you something.\u201d Madeline said and moved into one of the isolated rooms that were meant for group-work. She held the thick door open while she waited for Meghan to gather her things and move inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind the blonde, Madeline moved to the non-openable window that offered a view out into the main room and not outside as one might have expected, and pulled down the scroll curtain that effectively blocked that view and the view of anyone looking the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the other walls were bare except for the one what might have been an outer wall, but instead of a window it housed a white-board covering almost the whole thing, but then again it wasn't a very large room. Just large enough for a table and eight chairs around it and barely enough room to sit in those chairs. There were probably a dozen rooms like it spread out over the student center all well isolated so that the people working in groups didn't disturb the rest of the students who wanted piece and quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I think you understand what subject it is I want to ask you about...\u201d Madeline said as she eased in to the slightly complaining chair next to Meghan. The girl looked like she'd lost weight, but she was still pretty soft, though most of the belly was gone, she was still wearing her old now somewhat looser clothes, though the scale at home didn't say anything about a weight loss, so she wasn't so sure herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d Meghan said. There was only one that'd requite them to really move in here. And sure enough as Madeline started asking questions Meghan answered them as best she could. Apparently Blainey had thought it prudent to introduce a couple of new things from the advanced class. Only a couple of techniques and only what Meghan thought was what Blainey thought was the most basic and easiest techniques. She didn't honestly master any of these herself, in fact she made notes of which they were so that she could take a look at them. If Blainey thought it was the best place to start, then perhaps it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I noticed that Blainey covers a whole lot more in class, than what's actually in the book.\u201d Madeline said when Meghan questioned her about a few things. She hoped that wasn't the case for her own class, but then again the V101 book had been exceptionally wordy hadn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did go through a few techniques, some new, but mostly ones that Meghan knew better and in the end Meghan had let Madeline have a look at her notes from the first class. She wasn't sure she should give the girl a full copy of everything, like she'd done with Bryci though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline was very grateful for the help and the next day she managed to catch Meghan in a similar way for some more questions and answers. It was during lunch this time, but as Meghan didn't eat normal lunch per say, it meant that it was almost as a free period to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then Bryci had helped her go through all the new material and it would seem that the material wasn't quite up to speed to the point that it covered the upcoming class, but there were a few things on hiding, none of which was anything new to Meghan and a few things on avoiding digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hadn't tested any of them out. Frankly Meghan had been at a loss as to even how.<br>\r\n\u201cIt's simple...\u201d Bryci had said giggling. \u201cFirst I send you to my stomach, then I try to digest you, while you do this mumbo-jumbo and then I poop out what's left. It's as easy as that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah as easy as that to become your poop, I'm sure.\u201d Meghan had replied not quite thinking it so funny, but had still found herself countering. \u201cHow about we do it the other way? You visit my stomach and try avoiding becoming my poop?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow why would I wanna do that?\u201d Bryci replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee what I mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I meant avoid becoming your poop.\u201d Bryci said with a smile and a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I see what you mean.\u201d Meghan joked back and turned her behind in Bryci's direction as she gave it a slap. \u201cYou like it don't you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do! It looks good. Good enough to eat. You sure you don't want to be my poop?\u201d Bryci countered again. And had Meghan not been clothed, she might have tasted the round protruding body-part as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt the end though they had just ignored those techniques for the time being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan hoped the lecture later today would bring more clarity into the matter and that she would be outside a stomach this time so she could learn.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meghan took her seat next to Clarice, again the girl had arrived before her ,despite the fact that she was even earlier this time. <br>\r\n\u201cSo you're sure this is a good spot?\u201d Meghan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose not, I had no intention of being a damn labrat last time either. I guess you just never know.\u201d Clarice said, not sounding quite as upset as Meghan had thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I didn't stick around last time, but you didn't look like pleasant company when I left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarice chuckled at that. \u201cNo, I guess I wasn't. I was the first to go down, so I didn't get to see who she picked. Luckily I found out later that she hadn't picked Summer, so it turned out not to be the total loss I feared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSummer?\u201d Meghan wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, a friend, you'll get to know her later, I saw a bit of hiding and stuff in the material, so I guess we're going to start meeting up soon enough I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I noticed that, nothing new though. I hope there's some in the material we get today.\u201d Meghan sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I see. Then I get why you didn't find that Kimberly's demonstration too fancy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. But what about Summer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well you see, she's not the sharpest tool, as you'll learn, but she's the best ever at taking notes, she didn't miss a damn syllable said last lecture. It turned out that the professor only chose lean girls for her experiment. I didn't know I fit that category, but I suppose I should take it as a compliment.\u201d Clarice said with a smile that closely resembled a sneer. \u201cAnd well, Summer is a girl for thorough study and lots of practice you could say. So she put on a few pounds prior to the last lecture and apparently that's why she didn't join us inside the professor I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's good, I hope you don't mind sharing those notes. I can't say I got much down last class either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d Clarice smiled with more warmth this time. \u201cI suppose I should share with my partner.\u201d She said and shuffled through her papers finding a bunch of papers that were clearly from a copy-machine. The handwriting on them was good, almost cute, but easy to read. The amount of papers made Meghan realise as Clarice handed them to her that she probably wasn't kidding when she said Summer hadn't missed a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake these, I'll get another copy after class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks! So who is she? I guess she's the one I really aught to thank.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, better not do that before I've got time to introduce you properly. She's a bit unpredictable.\u201d Clarice chuckled as if at some private joke. \u201cAnyway she's the blonde with the long straight hair. Next to the other blonde you fancied.\u201d Clarice teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJamie you mean?\u201d Meghan said, not really playing dumb, but making sure. The nod from Clarice was all she asked for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Summer was sitting down she didn't get that good a view of her, but it didn't look to her like the girl had put on that much weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Meghan she had, but the professor had covered how to get rid of it last time and with her excessive studying and practising of everything, Summer had worked most of it off again, so now she was just pleasantly soft, nothing that a healthy normal girl would aim to get rid of. The only place where she did have a bit of extra softness was down below, but Meghan couldn't really see Summer's rather large and meaty, but very well shaped bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat struck her was the girl' blue eyed gaze, there was something distinctly wrong with it. At first she thought the girl was squint-eyed, but that didn't seem to be the case. It really did look as if the janitor had left, but forgotten the lights on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know just how correct that assessment was. There was no real way to sugar-coat it. Summer was by all accounts really stupid, which it usually didn't take anyone very long to figure out, so it came as a surprise to most that she was a straight A student, she had aced her V101 class as well and she aimed to do the same with this one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she lacked in wits she made up for in stubbornness and perseverance, that's why she was so good at taking notes, because she had to go over them again and again and again and she did. That's what she'd always done with any task given to her, just gone at it until she got it and eventually she apparently did, because otherwise she wouldn't be a straight A student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had been one problem with these traits of hers though and that was when she'd joined the V101. The combination of not understanding what people meant along with a desire to study all the time at any opportunity given, had meant that she held an unofficial record for most practice partner ever, not counting classmates that had helped her without accepting to be her partner, she'd gone through a dozen and a half, or rather they had gone through her by the end of the semester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was what Clarice had meant with Summer being a bit unpredictable. <br>\r\nIt wasn't any malice or anything that had made her send them through her systems, she'd just not considered all the implications of what had been said or her actions. They had agreed to help her practice, but she hadn't really contemplated that they probably didn't want to become part of her next bowel movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough however many classmates she had eaten there wasn't anyone that had been able to keep count, she certainly hadn\u2019t and even though they had been plenty, they were nothing compared to the amount of people she went through when studying in general. Normally she dropped a subject after she got her grades, but since she'd joined Clarice's group of friends by then and they never seemed to stop studying this subject, neither had Summer, to a lot of people's misfortune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan might have eaten people all her life and Summer was still on her second year of doing so. Even with that time difference Meghan wasn't anywhere close to the number of prey eaten by Summer. That's how much she 'studied' as she called it. This class would undoubtedly make that difference a lot worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficially her 'unfortunate' partner for this class, was Jamie, the life-guard girl, who had made it perfectly clear that they weren't actually going to practice as partners. The group had chosen Jamie, for this task because she was strong enough that they had hoped that Summer wouldn't be able to just grab her as a snack if she got the wrong impression. Which would most likely be the case and possible end for any of the weaker girls in their group if they'd been given the task. Most of them though hadn't qualified for this class though, so perhaps the point was mute. Even so, none of them were envious of Jamie in that regard.</span></div></div>",

Which apparently as most had suspected contained a lot more on hiding and that other thing that had confused most of them, not that they had time to go through it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, we're going to move on to hiding, as you recall V101 didn't really have that much to offer on this subject, which means that even talented students such as yourselves often had difficulty moving about in public with someone inside you. Well I doubt that that's the case for most of you any more,\u201d Blainey said struggling to avoid looking at her own TA's from the current V101, who were probably the only ones in the room that did have this problem to any extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever as this class aims to have you practising on more than just a couple of people, there is need for you to thus be able to hide more than just a couple of people. So Today we will start on that and later move on and continue next time with things to make it safe to practice with your friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo yet again it is my pleasure to hand over things to miss Condon.\u201d Blainey said and Alectra stepped forward, taking her place at the center and getting down to business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan got a bit of a chock at her appearance, she'd been very properly dressed every time she'd seen the woman, but she still looked very different from what she recalled. Admittedly she hadn't really gotten a good look at her last time, but the one before that she'd been downright plump. Now however Alectra looked even slimmer than Meghan could remember her being back at the lab when she had first met her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat proper business attire now looked really good on her, those somewhat loose and soft business pants hung lightly from her body, draping that round bottom in a teasing manner that only really showed half the merchandise. Likewise her fashionable top was clean cut and form fitting, somewhat dark, but that matched well with her Latino heritage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Condon went through several techniques, nothing new to Meghan, which she guessed was why she paid so much attention to the woman instead. She'd gotten a few odd glances from Clarice because she wasn't taking notes to which she'd replied with a shrug of her shoulders and mouthing \u201cNothing new.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so now I need some volunteers.\u201d Alectra said abruptly, having hardly finished the sentence before. \u201cAh, who am I kidding. I need lots of volunteers for this one.\u201d She smiled, but that smile just kept growing until she was giggling at all the horrified faces of the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm just kidding with you. As fun as it would be with a demonstration, it's a total waste of time and I think the one we had in the first lecture proves the point well enough. Instead I think my colleague here could give you a few more pointers.\u201d Alectra said. She wasn't allowed to just use her friend's first name and she just couldn't bring herself to say 'miss Smith' about the girl that had been on the team nearly as long as she had herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren continued, but as far as Meghan could tell it was all old news to her, perhaps she should pay more attention, but it was hard when she could just as well have held the lecture herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped aside Alectra couldn't help but linger on the demonstration joke, what she really would have thought funny would have been if Haley had come in and given the girls a proper demonstration, but the professor had forbidden any mention of her youngest daughter in class, so bringing her here was quite a bit out of the question. It did make her rather puzzled as the girl in question was writing quite a bit of the stuff that her supposedly quite a bit older sister was studying here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlectra scanned the room for the girl in question and found the pretty bored looking young woman. Perhaps she wasn\u2019t studying as much as the rest, no need might be. Oh well. She still thought the concept amusing enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough they had covered enough of the techniques for hiding to move on to answering a few questions while other girls behind them were readying things.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally something new Meghan thought as a woman she sort of recalled from Blainey's lab, but couldn't quite place, was left alone in the center of the stage. The other researchers there apparently keeping a bit of a safety distance between themselves and the various things they'd brought in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAl-right, so for those of you who don't remember. I don't blame you, we were quite numerous that first day. I'm Nicole Westlake.\u201d The tall, dark haired and quite sultry researcher announced as she beckoned for everyone\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dressed as far as anyone could tell in only a lab-coat. Meghan found it curious how the garment only reached down to her mid thigh and that those thighs seemed naked and there seemed to be no garment on the way to here bare feet either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, I'm sure a few of you were puzzled by some of the material you got last time and there's even more of it in that which you got earlier. So before I start explaining that, I thought it'd be best with a demonstration and don't worry, no volunteers for this one. You'll see why in a moment.\u201d Nicole snickered as she moved behind a set of tables that they had put forth with large clear chemistry glass containers on them with something at the bottom of each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, here we have a container with some stomach juice, pretty nasty stuff, I'm sure at least some of you can make worse stuff than this, but it's pretty nasty.\u201d Nicole said and reached behind her and retrieved a leg of some creature. It was something from the meat market for sure, a large club of meat. She held it by the still protruding bone and the rounded thick end didn't have much spare room as she lowered it into the container. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it connected with the liquid at the bottom a loud fizzle came from it and Nicole let go of the bone and as a result the club was inside the container with the bone handle sticking nearly straight up. And the whole thing was visibly sinking into the container as the liquid level rose. The reaction did slow some as the juices got diluted by melted meat, fat and bone, but not a whole lot. Nicole didn't wait for it to finish though but moved on to the next container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow this one is even nastier.\u201d She said and retrieved another meat club and repeated the procedure. This one sank at least twice as fast and only a liquid remained moments later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said, pretty darn nasty, I doubt many of you, if any, could produce something this bad. However...\u201d Nicole said as she moved over to yet another container. \u201cThere are worse things.\u201d She continued as she repeated the routine once more. This time she didn't so much place the meat club in the container as much as gently drop it inside, because as soon as it made contact with the liquid in it, it just melted away, so the decent of the club hardly slowed, but moved from item to liquid in one fluent motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved over to a differently shaped container, but that was still clear. This one narrower and a bit taller, but if it contained anything like the others it was no wonder why it was equipped with a base that was even wider than the other containers, as you obviously didn't want it to tip over. This one looked about half full unlike the previous ones which had just had a bit at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow this is more of that last really nasty juice.\u201d Nicole said as she motioned towards the last container. And then removed her labcoat, revealing that she was just wearing a two piece bikini underneath. It wasn't the same one she'd worn when Meghan had met her, but the sight did make Meghan recall the occasion, she still looked as good and suddenly she looked sopping wet all over as if she'd been sprayed with water in order for a men's-magazine photo-shoot. She did look the part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is what I'm going to be talking about.\u201d Nicole said and shoved her right hand into the container, which resulted in a lot of fizzling and bubbling along most of her lower arm, but she held her arm there while it continued and then after half a minute or so retracted her by the looks of it unharmed arm and hand. She then turned around without saying anything and retrieved a slab of meat, which had been cut to fit and dropped it into the container. This piece of meat melted away as quickly as the club had in the previous container.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI'll be back in just a moment and we can get started then.\u201d Nicole said and slipped into the room behind, leaving the baffled students to wrap their heads around what she'd just done and her colleagues to carefully remove all the dangerous stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long and miss Westlake soon returned dripping water from her quick shower. She left a wet trail as she went and retrieved her labcoat, which she put on. It soaked up a lot of the water and clung to her in places and she didn't bother buttoning up the front this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went on with the help of power-point more than chalkboards to describe various techniques of both neutralizing hostile substances, as well as creating s shielding layer as she had shown earlier.<br>\r\nApparently it was a tricky business, one thing to counter another and they all knew how to create quite a varied concoction of fierce things, defending against that would require something just as intricate. Not to mention that it was a lot easier to test if you managed to produce something that would digest something than it would be to see if you managed to produce something that would defend against something. The trial and error approach didn't sound very appealing to anyone, not even Summer, who all things considered tended to make sure she was the one on the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shielding she had shown earlier was what most girls found most interesting, the problem with it was that that any shield is bound to have a weakness, if your predator can find that your shield is more or less useless, but even if that isn't the case, the shield is only buying you time as the shield is constantly digested. Admittedly better it than you, it still requires you to constantly replenish the shield, which means that you burn through your reserves in quick order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class Meghan and Clarice finally exchanged numbers, somehow it had slipped their minds earlier.<br>\r\n\u201cI promise to call you if I think it's a good time for you to meet the girls. Chances are that they'll be busy with the previous stuff for a while longer. However, I recall you offering me a private lesson concerning this.\u201d Clarice winked \u201cA perfect date for a nerd like me, you should know.\u201d She added grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan didn't quite know how to interpret that, Clarice wasn't bad looking or anything, but she hadn't struck her fancy either, at lest not yet. At least Clarice was lightening up, so she figured it might as well be good to keep it light hearted. \u201cA date it is then.\u201d She semi-joked back, not sure if the other girl would take it seriously or not. \u201cCall me when you think it's time, I'm just awful at making plans.\u201d Meghan added before they parted ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was heading towards the copy-machine, making a set for Bryci like she'd done with the previous material. It felt a little weird with Clarice finally opening up. She already had a practice partner of sorts in Bryci. But then again Bryci was learning along with her, doubtless Clarice knew a lot more than she did in a lot of topics, not to mention it'd be nice to have a whole group of friends. Perhaps she could bring Bryci into it later? <br>\r\nThere was the lesbian issue though, Bryci seemed open enough, but neither of them had actually done anything like that to the other even though they had been pretty intimate all the same. She would just have to keep them separate for the time being and hope that they could coexist in her life anyhow.<br>\r\nMadeline showing up earlier did make her feel a little bad that she sort of abandoned them for other company. Luckily it didn't seem to her like Madeline held a grudge or anything, so they were probably still friends she hoped.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meghan met up with miss Collin, as she'd teased the girl after the last Lecture, since especially De Luca and Blainey kept calling everyone 'miss'. And so as she'd walked over to Bryci she had realized that she didn't knew the girl's last name even though it was on her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Urp* Bryci greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that was very lady like.\u201d Meghan teased. \u201cNice of you to wait for me, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci giggled at that. \u201cIt was just a snack. That you've promised not to grab a bite at school doesn't mean I can't, does it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci's changed to a somewhat chocked expression as she got an epiphany \u201cOh, sorry, you meant that you wanted to take care of my peckishness problem, didn't you?\u201d She said as she brought a hand to her belly and gave it a little rub. \u201cTell you what. She didn't do a very good job, so I still wouldn't mind your help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa-ha...\u201d Meghan said dragging the words out. \u201cVery funny.\u201d She added and poked her tongue out at the short dark haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that wasn't very lady-like either.\u201d Bryci said and gave Meghan a light punch. \u201cBesides a snack like you should be thankful I asked first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Meghan was confused. \u201cWhy would I be a snack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we're on school ground, where you aren't allowed to eat, but I am, that makes you the snack, now doesn't it?\u201d Bryci teased licking her lips, while she tried hard not to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever thought of it like that, but I guess we should leave then. I doubt that greedy gut of yours will be content with just a snack anyway.\u201d Meghan accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I guess you're right.\u201d Bryci said as the two of them started walking. \u201cBut you could be a nice appetizer.\u201d She chimed in, sounding hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you call her then.\u201d Meghan asked pointing towards Bryci's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already told you. She was just a snack, I haven't started the meal yet.\u201d Bryci giggled back. \u201cBesides she's here.\u201d She added and slapped her own behind. \u201cWhich proves my point. If she'd been part of a meal then she wouldn't be all done before the others had joined her in my tummy now would she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan had come to accept Bryci's strange humour, the girl really liked to talk about people as food, including the two of them, so as they left the school grounds she countered the smaller girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it seems you passed up your chance little girl.\u201d Meghan grinned pointing to emphasize that they had just barely passed beyond the gates. \u201cYou don't look very filling, but I guess it's a start.\u201d Meghan said and made her stomach growl a bit. \u201cOh, seems my stomach wants more. Did you have some filling or what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, the filling passed the expiring date I'm afraid.\u201d Bryci smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrat. Seems I've got to find something else then.\u201d Meghan giggled back. \u201cAny ideas where I could look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could start in here.\u201d Bryci said and opened her mouth, but not wider than normal, they were in public after all, even if they made sure no one was close enough to hear their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt there's anything in there, my tummy told me that even the whole thing didn't look very filling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well then we should look elsewhere shouldn't we? How about this way?\u201d Bryci said and started walking without waiting for a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d Meghan said and made her belly rumble again. \u201cTummy agrees.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the two of them had walked together, but since both wanted the meals they came across they decided to walk in opposite directions and call one another when they were done. So Meghan had found herself walking back towards Bryci's direction, she wasn't that surprised that she'd finished first. Bryci had eaten as much as she had now even the first time they went out, she had no idea how many people were in that bulging middle the girl had when they finally met up and headed back to school.<br>\r\nWaste minimization or no, with four people Meghan knew she'd need proper facilities and she was pretty sure the same was true for Bryci who tried passing her girth of as some sort of pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they had already gone through the material concerning these bits, seeing as the new stuff didn't concern digestion, but now Meghan had gotten Summer's notes and the questions and answers bit had actually turned out rather useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they left the toilets Meghan had commented Bryci's gluttony. \u201cThat was some serious gorging you did there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d Bryci said rubbing her now flat belly. \u201cFeels kind of empty after that. You mind helping me out?\u201d She said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll pass.\u201d Meghan declined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEventually yes. Didn't plan of keeping you in there forever. Just until I got home or so.\u201d Bryci said trying not to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome girlfriend you are, not even gonna give me a one night stand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess dumping you that soon, would be pretty rude.\u201d Bryci snickered. But didn't say any more as a door opened in front of them and a couple of girls came out. Not being alone any more they couldn't really keep up that subject even if they had kept their voices low just to be sure and a new subject just didn't come to either girl's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead they walked on in relative silence until Bryci suddenly moved ahead and overtook the two girls before Meghan figured out what she was up to. The two girls didn't see it coming either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo strong hands reached around their middles from behind and forced them both together and backwards, while literally lifting them off the floor, with such force that the air was forced from their lungs as they folded over and found their hips, lower backs and upper thighs inserted into something. Something that clamped down upon them hard enough that they folded up properly and then got sucked into whatever it was before they even managed to gather breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second swallow pulled in the four lower legs that had stuck out from her mouth and the lot of them slid down Bryci's throat, their passing noticeable as the girl's throat returned to normal behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d Meghan wondered, she thought even Bryci would have been sated after that meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDessert.\u201d Bryci answered licking her lips, not that she'd really gotten to taste the girls, and they had been fully clothed as well, so they probably wouldn't have been that tasty even if she'd had the time to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeeded that did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I just wanted something squirming in there and you didn't seem to want to do me the favour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did say you'd dump me.\u201d Meghan objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly a little.\u201d Bryci defended herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you hadn't planned on leaving more than that had you?\u201d Meghan grinned, mostly at Bryci's fake-hurt puppy-dog expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan felt like she'd really pigged out as they left the school a second time. She couldn't recall the last time she digested four people before, at least now with the other type of fat, she hadn't ruined her figure and could actually use what she got from them, something she hadn't been able to do in the past. So as they left the school Meghan knew that she at least didn't want any dessert, but what did she want?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNo, way! For that silly thing you're gonna be the filler!\u201d Bryci objected, taking a defiant stance and making no move to remove her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it's my idea!\u201d Meghan retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it is my filling you're after, if you want it, you'll just have to get in here and get it.\u201d Bryci said pointing to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, be like that then. But I am gonna have you and your stuffing in my stomach later.\u201d Meghan said as she started to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci helped her focus on the clothes of her upper body, then to Meghan's surprise her whole upper body slipped inside Brysi's mouth, her hips and legs sticking out and dangling from the usually smaller girl's lips.<br>\r\nBryci tasted Meghan pretty thoroughly while she worked. Turning the girl around so that Meghan was on her back and Bryci could see and access the fly of Meghan's jeans. With it open she inserted her hands taking hold of Meghan's panties as well and then sucked the girl out of her clothes. Tossing the empty garments onto her office chair while she seated herself on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd already enjoyed the girl's taste well enough, so she leaned her head back some and cherished the sensation of Meghan sliding down her throat. Tracing her progress down her front until the girl slipped into her stomach, not making the slightest bulge in her middle even though there were already two others inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan was surprised to find herself staring into a flashlight as she opened her eyes after the slimy soft landing. The girls seemed unnaturally calm. And though she hadn't expected to be able to see anything, since she thought the stomach would be drenched in darkness, the damn glare of the light meant that she hardly saw anything anyway. What were they up to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mind pointing that somewhere else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike the view?\u201d Meghan tried to joke, but she was too puzzled and too annoyed to pull it off properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not bad.\u201d Said the one not holding the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing blinded and with Bryci's body making noises atop of the woman talking, she hadn't noticed the other one creeping up on her from behind, but the girls shoes made a strange wet sound as she stepped in the mucus lining the stomach, that along with the reflection as she stepped into the light about to launch herself onto the sitting girl, made Meghan turn around instinctively and met the girl head on, faced with her open mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that wide, so Meghan easily accessed other parts of her body and shoved the girl away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caused the girl holding the light to drop it and join the fight which since the flashlight sank into the mucus ended up being fought in nigh total darkness, with a bright spot where the light had landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flashlight girl hadn't counted on her losing track of Meghan when she dropped the light, but that was the case, so she was brushed aside as she lunged into the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the three tried to listen out the other opponents neither's eyes having adjusted to the insignificant light, while they reached out with their hands for first contact. Meghan had jumped aside after the initial contact and was standing almost totally immobile, she knew the other two were looking for her and she could hear their wet clothes grinding sometimes over the background noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they came really close she sensed that they were more or less moving together, that was an issue, but if she didn't strike first they would attack her together, that was worse and it was clear that she couldn't take them on one at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she reached out, brushed against an arm, that jerked in response, having been so actively searching for something without finding anything until now, but Meghan reached further and felt her left hand first collide with a clothed torso, so she grabbed onto the garment and pulled and reached out with her right to get hold of the other side. She did manage that despite the girl's arms coming for her own body. She however being naked and covered in slick goo was a lot harder to get a grip on and as Meghan couldn't see her opponent she simply opened her mouth very wide and hoped she'd get a hold as she pulled the girl in towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething did impact with her tongue and lower jaw, so she closed her mouth and felt that she had the girl trapped from her chest and up. She felt like quite the mouthful though and it took a couple of hard swallows before Meghan realized that she had to fight Bryci's hiding skills, she was after all tiny herself, so if she wanted to hide this meal she was in for a struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then she had the girl's waist in her mouth and the other girl had just put her hands on her, trying to figure out which end was what, that wasn't obvious though, so Meghan moved away from her while she struggled to get the first girl down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kicking legs were an issue, so she reached out and managed to catch the girl's shoe-clad feet, which offered surprisingly good grip. Holding on to them she forced the girl to bend her knees, so that her feet were almost touching her bottom, then Meghan opened her mouth wide again and crammed the whole thing inside.<br>\r\nNot fancy, but she had a girl that was yanking her right arm and being generally a pain.<br>\r\nLuckily it would seem that Meghan was not just hard to grasp, but significantly stronger as well.<br>\r\nAnd as the girl couldn't get a good enough grasp to lift her it was Meghan who kept dragging the other one along while she worked the first girl down her throat, which was more trouble than she'd imagined. The lump she formed in her gut was massive, or so Meghan thought, being so used to hiding her meals more than just completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did manage to hide the girl quite a bit though, leaving her with a somewhat pregnant belly and she realized as she turned to face her opponent, that it also meant that Bryci's hiding grip on her wasn't quite as strong, so she now loomed a few heads taller than her opponent. Something that made it so much easier to reach down and grab the girl, pinning her arms to her sides in the process, before shoving her screaming head down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much easier on the ears, Meghan sighed as the girl, while not quiet, was at least muffled by the flesh around her. She could relax and enjoy this meal better, but Bryci didn't seem to like the calm that'd come over her occupants, which caused Meghan to fall on her ass and realise that she should hurry up and get the girl down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that tough, this second girl wasn't as a significant a meal to get down and better trapped, so she went down easily enough, but she ended up doubling the size of Meghan's gut, which made the blonde girl groan, she wasn't used to this, had it been so long since she let her belly stretch out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flashlight was a nice touch, it gave the place an eerie air and as Meghan's eyes had begun adapting she could make out the silhouette of her beyond pregnant gut. The room itself was lost in darkness though so she fished the item out and wiped the goop of the lens and had a look around at the pink and red pulsating slimy walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci obviously didn't approve of her idle loitering though so Meghan gave the girl their signal for wanting to come out, which just seemed to make the girl even more annoyed, but Bryci complied and found as Meghan had said that the bloated blonde made for a significant obstacle as she made her way back up her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan found herself spilling out into the shower, that was the common practice as Bryci didn't want her bed covered in slime, but it was almost always a brute awakening, bright surroundings and a hard surface to land on.</span></div></div>",

You just sat down and did nothing?\u201d Bryci complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's not what happened at all.\u201d Meghan defended herself. \u201cWhen I got in there I got a flashlight in my eyes and those two tried to eat me.\u201d She said pointing an accusing finger at her own now trim belly, that didn't hint at the fact that there were two fully grown girls inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey did...?\u201d Bryci said but she couldn't help giggling, even though Meghan didn't look the slightest bit amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah and luckily I managed to eat them instead, after which I picked up their flashlight and had a look around, but you seemed so anxious that I decided to leave the place before you'd start doing something stupid.\u201d Meghan said, thinking of the times Bryci had squished her with her stomach, even if she hadn't applied any digestive juices it had been uncomfortable enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww...\u201d Bryci said, teasing. \u201cSo is it my turn now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not sure... These girls tried to eat me, it's kind of personal. I think I want to dig...\u201d She managed before Bryci cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Those were my dessert! You didn't get any, but that's your problem, you're not stealing mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine...\u201d Meghan resigned, getting up properly and leaning over the shorter girl, who had removed all her clothing in preparation, which was lucky since Meghan left big wet slime blobs on her. \u201c...but I'm coughing them up, fighting them in the pitch black wasn't that fun.\u201d She said before she put her lips to Bryci's in what could have passed for a kiss especially seeing as how they used their tongues to work first one girl and then the other from Meghan's throat to Bryci's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm...\u201d Bryci said as she lingered a bit in the kiss before licking her lips. \u201cI think I'm ready, but I can't deny I was tempted to taste you again instead.\u201d she smiled mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAl-right.\u201d Meghan agreed and leaned down over the girl, letting her lips spread over and slide along the shorter girls softer frame, tasting her as she went. Stopping as the breasts entered her mouth, for some bold tasting of that part, which she tried to justify by taking that moment to reach down and grab Bryci's hips and lift the girl up, so that the rest of her could enter smoothly.<br>\r\nMight be she lingered a bit longer and performing that action too slowly, but she hoped that Bryci didn't mind. Meghan couldn't find any justification to doing the same to her hips though, but she did take it slow, only speeding up when she had hardly anything to hold onto and the gravity pulled the girl down, but then she didn't find legs that interesting, so it might be that she didn't fight the girl's downward forces much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way Bryci made for a significant lump going down her throat, nothing compared to the girls when she'd been inside Bryci's stomach, but nice all the same, or perhaps, this was nice, the girls had been a bother. Meghan let the greedy miss Collin ease into her stomach, feeling her settle, before she turned around to take a shower, kicking her foot onto the flash-light. So with a grin she reached down, made sure it was turned on and popped it into her throat, she hoped it wouldn't get stuck in some saliva or guck lining her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurned out she paid more attention to her shower than to Bryci, but that was fine too, but once she was done, Bryci wasn't so she wondered if she should get dressed again or not, but then recalled how she'd gooped all over Bryci when she came out, so Meghan just wrapped a towel around herself and went out to lie down on Bryci's bed instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl inside noticed the new angle, it was a lot easier with the flashlight at hand, the angle also made the throat easier to access, so she gently eased it open and worked her way up it, Meghan relaxing to let it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough she was back in Meghan's mouth, filling it nicely with her added girth, but with regards to the furniture Meghan went back to the shower in order to let the girl out, taking her time in doing so and tonguing her all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm... that was nice...\u201d Bryci cooed as she was sliding from Meghan's lips. The small girl gathered herself up quickly enough though and actually pulled her feet out of Meghan herself.<br>\r\nQuickly standing up she pulled Meghan's towel away in the process and tossed it atop a small bathroom cabinet, then pulled the girl into the shower with her, in a wet saliva sticky embrace and turned on the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh...?\u201d Meghan yelped, but didn't complain. The shower was small, so it did force them close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I need your help getting the goop out, that tongue did a pretty good job but I don't think it got it all.\u201d Bryci teased, handing Meghan the soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this wasn't an invitation then she didn't now what was, so she took some liberties, but as she bent down to access the lower areas Bryci stopped her by pressing her head against her belly, it didn't bulge the slightest to begin with, but with her ear pressed against its surface Meghan had no trouble determining what Bryci was up to as it started grumbling, then went on to gurgle and finally sloshing and eventually groaning, but by then Bryci had pushed her down somewhat so that her ear was against the shorter girl's lower belly, which by then also was the active part of the girl's smooth middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo much for the girls who tried to eat you.\u201d Bryci giggled as she let Meghan go. \u201cDon't go anywhere, I'm gonna be right back, I just have to show these two out.\u201d she continued as she jumped out of the shower and took a seat on the only chair in the room. <br>\r\nShe didn't take long, Meghan quickly heard a wet noise through that of the shower and then the girl stood up and examined the contents of the bowl before flushing and coming back to join her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were predators you say?\u201d Bryci asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they didn't think being inside a stomach was that mindboggling and like I said, tried to eat me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird, didn't look any different than anyone else after I was through with them.\u201d Bryci said with a puzzled look and a grin as she rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan was a bit surprised that Bryci didn't carry on with the intimate stuff when she got back in, now the little black haired girl was all down to finishing her shower and then the two of them were drying off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bryci thought about it a moment, she really wouldn't mind the extra meal, but another thought crossed her mind, she had seen Meghan eat, yes, but she had not yet seen Meghan digest, which was something that deeply intrigued her, even if it meant losing out on the food. She wanted to compare her skills with Meghan's yes, but she also had ulterior reasons for watching her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Bryci replied, pulling up her jeans, \"Nah, you keep her, I do want to watch though,\" she started to blush, but caught herself and continued, \"Like, unhide your belly, I want to compare how well you do. You don't have to go fast though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan smiled and nodded, letting her belly expand back out, this wasn't natural for her, since she had so much practice keeping it hidden. \"There you go, she's not quite as big as the one you had.\" Not to mention, she had a hard time fully showing her belly, she was always hiding to some degree. She patted her belly, it's contents barely moving, the redhead long exhausted but not quite accepting her fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci nodded. This gave Meghan the go ahead and she undid her own clothing, and as if she was exhibiting she held her belly and pushed on the top and on the sides, demonstrating it's roominess, as well as sparking a little bit more movement from her meal. Then with a smile pushed in with her abdominal muscles and expelled the air from her stomach, it was like a burp but sounded more like a large exhale. Her stomach got a little bit smaller. Then she rubbed her stomach and stood in front of the seat. Bryci watched in anticipation as Meghan's stomach shrunk, and Meghan demonstrated the state of the redhead by poking deep into the shrinking bulb, it's contents making a slightly audible *squish* as she pushed harder. A gurgle followed, and Meghan finished taking off her panties and took the seat, the redhead flowing through her intestines now, Meghan consciously sped up this process, since there really wasn't much to show. So this part only took a few seconds as she leaned forward slightly on the seat, squishing the half solid contents of her stomach, and let the girl's large liquid contents out with a rather loud rapid hiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She blushed slightly, it wasn't like she did this for show before, but Bryci just did this same thing a few seconds ago, so she mentally shrugged and it was only a few more seconds before the once girl was beginning to reach the very end of her journey. At this point Meghan's belly wasn't much different than if she was fully hiding her belly, and with her leaned forward like that, no one would question the situation. Her bladder was still quite full, but the girl and the clothes of both her and her friend were waiting to leave, she never could digest clothing that well, especially synthetic fabrics. Still she pushed out the first bit of the girl in one solid chunk, big enough to set off the chair's special feature, and the rest of her followed quite easily, so a few more seconds and she finished emptying her bladder, and the toilet flushed what was not taken in by the seam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok wow, you digested her fast, I barely got to see your belly shrink,\" Bryci smiled, as Meghan stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well the way I saw it, there wasn't much to show after she had been reduced to mush.\" she replied pulling back on her clothes. Mentally Meghan realized that she probably could have described the redhead's trip and how she did it so fast, but then responds to herself, 'Well it wouldn't have been as fast then...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now?\" Bryci asked, her belly growled as she was reminded that she was still hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan thought briefly and then replied; \"Well, we could get something else, I mean I'm sure I could teach you a few more things, but do you want to do that another day? You can try out what I've taught you on your own, and tell me what you figure out next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryci responds:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a very brief moment of consideration, Meghan decided to try calling the elevator, and see if it's not busy being used on other floors, pressing the button, Meghan decided she'd give it at least seven seconds before opting to take the stairs instead. As luck would have it, the doors opened almost immediately, the elevator having been used moments before to carry someone to this very floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with her good fortune, Meghan stepped inside and pressed the button for the fifth floor. After a short moment, the doors closed, and the elevator began lifting Meghan upward. As the elevator reached the second floor, her phone gave off short ring, signalling that it has received another message. Taking it out, Meghan sees that it's yet another message from Bryci, as she reads it, the elevator stops, someone having called for it as it carried Meghan upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Meghan typed out her reply, she wasn't really paying attention to the person stepping inside, only politely stepping aside to allow the passenger room to stand on the other side of the chamber. Soon, the doors closed again and the elevator resumed it's trip upwards. A couple seconds pass, Meghan typing away at her phone, taking a bit more time than necessary to send a grammatically correct message, as the elevator beeped once again, announcing that it's passing the third floor. Having been looking at her phone from a downward angle, Meghan notices the legs of the passenger drawing near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Meghan gets a look at a woman, who appears to be in her mid thirties, with curly, brown hair, and blue eyes. That's all that she can notice before her arms suddenly lash out and grab her arms with surprising strength, enough to restrain her for a moment. Dropping her phone, Meghan takes a good guess at how she must have gotten so strong and curses herself for having not paid more attention to this woman. Fighting against her grip, Meghan feels that she's about to break out of her hold before the woman opens her mouth wide and lunges forward, engulfing Meghan's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as that happens, Meghan jerks her arms outwards, and manages to break out of the woman's grip, acting as quick as she can, she tries to push at the woman's shoulders to free herself, but the woman moves her hands downward and grabs her hips, pushing them back, this motion, along with Meghan pushing at her shoulders, lifts Meghan into the air. Wasting no time, the woman, with her hands still at Meghan's hips pulls downward, and with her disorientation from suddenly being flipped upside down, Meghan loses her grip on the woman's shoulders and is forced downward at high speed, settling within the stomach in a manner of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator beeps once more, passing the fourth floor, the brief struggle only having lasted a few seconds. Victoria, now seemingly being the only person in the elevator, gives her still-flat, gurgling belly a pat as she picks up the phone Meghan dropped, curious, she checks out what she was messaging about, and recognizes Bryci's name as one of the people living at the apartment, although she's never personally met her, reading through a couple past messages, it appears to Victoria that Bryci has been organizing for this \"Meghan\" girl to visit, although none of the messages really say what for exactly, only hinting at things such as \"lessons\" or \"tutoring\". But that doesn't change the fact that Bryci is expecting company who is busy being worked into a thick soup by her powerful stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator beeps once again, and arrives at the floor Bryci is at, before the doors open, Victoria pops the phone into her mouth and swallows, the expensive yet incriminating device quickly melting away into the thick soup consisting of acids and what used to be it's owner. Victoria quickly straightens out her clothing, having been roughed up a bit by her latest meal's struggles, after fitting her clothes properly around her slightly chubby, yet still attractive form, the doors open, and she wonders if she should go after Bryci for dessert, although there's pretty much no way that Meghan's disappearance could be pinned on her, she'll feel better if she eliminates anyone who may be expecting one of her meals to be here.</span></div></div>",

A gurgle emanates from her midsection as she feels her latest meal flowing toward the exit that she prefers her meals to take. As she moves along the halls, she tries to recall the chart, she knows for sure that Bryci resides on this floor, but can't exactly remember which room, reasoning that she's in no real hurry, she doesn't bother to head back down re-check the chart, choosing instead to wander the halls, thinking that seeing the exact room number would jog her memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she wanders, Victoria's intestines greedily absorbs as much as it can from Meghan, who has become much smaller throughout the trip, eventually, she reaches a much firmer consistency, and is squeezed into the colon, almost ready for expulsion. Just as Meghan settles into place, Victoria finds what she believes to be Bryci's room, recalling that this is the correct room number. And after making sure nobody is around to witness, Victoria knocks on the door, awaiting her next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, the door is unlocked, and opens up to reveal a pretty little black-haired girl, her pleased expression suddenly changes to one of confusion and annoyance as she finds the woman at her door to not be the person she had expected. \"Hello?\" She says in an attempt to greet her unexpected guest just before Victoria grabs the poor girl by the hips and lifts her up to her face, cramming the little treat into her mouth. In only a short moment, Bryci finds herself swallowed down, settling shortly into the stomach. After gaining her bearings, Bryci sits scared, she's read her books enough to know exactly what's in store for her, and that escape is far out of her ability. Defeated, the girl briefly cries to herself just as acids begin to secrete into the chamber, breaking the morsel down into a fine soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly filled and her meal digesting, Victoria licks her lips in satisfaction as she turns around, kicking the door back into place. Deciding that she's had enough for now, Victoria makes her way back to her room, forgetting what her excuse for wandering around the halls was in the first place. As she rides the elevator back down to her room, the satisfied woman feels pressure building up within her rear, her other meal wanting out. Since it's not yet time, she clenches with her ass, pulling the remains back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Bryci finishes her trip through Victoria, the cute little girl now a less cute, much smaller turd, and is reunited with Meghan within the colon, unfortunately, neither girl is in any condition for lessons now. And after being drained of some more moisture, the girls are pushed into the rectum, ready to be expelled. Now within her own room, Victoria feels the pressure building up again, and heads into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving her pants and planting her rear onto the toilet seat, she begins the process of removing the two girls from her body, unaware that there were actually three. After some effort, she manages to push everyone out of herself, and flushes, draining the girls away. Free of her worries, Victoria Leaves the bathroom, pulling her pants up as she wonders just how she'll continue her day, already forgetting all about the two girls she had eaten.</span></div></div>",

The elevator continues upward, taking her to the next floor where the utilities are kept. After exiting the elevator, she makes her way to the washers, swaying her hips left and right for no apparent reason as she walks. After reaching the washers, she reaches into her large purse and takes out a small plastic bag containing used underwear, and tosses them into the washer one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter inserting the change and starting the washer, Victoria takes a nearby seat, and to pass the time, pokes her fingers around her belly, feeling her latest meal flowing through her intestines, she recalls how she really put up a fight, and guesses that she must have been a fellow vore, although she certainly won't be having any further meals. Following her train of thought, she guesses that the lessons the girl had with Bryci probably involve that hidden vore class in the university, and reasons that it's all the better to eat her because of that, as she may attract unwanted attention toward this apartment, or perhaps when she's more experienced, present a threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA buzz from the washer catches Victoria's attention, as she was lost in her thought, she hadn't noticed that it had went on to it's dry cycle without her noticing, and already finished. After retrieving her unmentionables, Victoria headed back toward the second floor, riding the elevator again, although she didn't have any passengers this time. As she walks from the elevator to her room, swaying her hips more, she feels the remains of her latest meal squeeze into her rectum. Acting quickly, she quickly unlocks her room and places her cleaned underwear on the table, after locking the door behind her, she undoes her pants and slides them off along with her panties, and steps into her bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, Victoria firmly plants her plump ass on the toilet seat and expels what's left of Meghan, remembering to flush halfway before finishing is the the only recognition she gives that her meal used to be a person. After completely removing the waste from her body, Victoria casually cleans herself and flushes one last time, sending the last of Meghan down the pipes that many meals before her have gone before. Afterwards, Victoria leaves the bathroom and retrieves her underwear so she can put them away properly now that she had dealt with the distracting pressure in her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her current tasks done, Victoria makes a mental note to pay a visit to a certain room on floor 5 the next time she's hungry, and not even bothering to put her lower clothing back on, sits down on her favorite chair and begins reading through her magazines.

The muscular one?\" Meghan nodded, \"I watched you up there with her, I think she's the type that will try 'too hard' on many exercises, vore will never become something natural to her, and she will most likely become the target of many predatory girls trying to prove their worth, and upon speculation I can only assume Beatrice will either be digested midway through the classes' progression or she will be forced to create an ever growing reputation for being someone no one wants to even mess with.\"Meghan frowned slightly \"That said, usually bigger girls in general don't seem to last long either, so her partner doesn't have long to last if she can't get good quick. But I do think Beatrice has potential, if she knows how to use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan instantly began plotting some sort of scheme, or at least postulating on how she could turn Beatrice into a super predator, the idea lingered in her mind a bit before she remembered another question she had for the professor. \"Excuse me, Professor?\" This time however Blainey had ceased paying attention to Meghan and returned to watching the students go about, noticing a few girls having difficulties swallowing small melons. \"Kelly?\" This got Blainey's attention again, she was quite unused to such an informal usage in her classroom, but she smiled. Meghan continued, \"Based on what you've said, I can only think that vore is much more widespread than what I had thought before coming here.\" Meghan wanted to mention her findings at the beach but refrained for the time being, because of a gut feeling she had about the subject. \"Oh, yes, here in and around the university many women have some ability to vore, and many are protective about their secret, I do in fact have a classified registered database which has information on all those in the area who can vore. Or at least it contains those who are known to the University. In fact some of my researchers have inadvertently found test subjects, or as they aptly call them 'snacks' whose names show up on my database.\" Blainey smiled, \"This doesn't save them however, we always need suitable test subjects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point class was about to be over, and Blainey glanced at the clock, \"Well, Meghan, it's been nice chatting, but I think you can still help one or two more students before class time is up.\" Blainey then promptly returned to watching her class.</span></div></div>",

Katrina haven\u2019t paid any attention to whom she\u2019s eaten, she\u2019s just taken the ones that have been suitable targets, more over she hasn\u2019t been paying that much thought to anything in particular as her dance is a well trained repertoire and snatching people being her job, she\u2019s been letting her mind wander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t even notice that there weren\u2019t any more girls around as her routine took her to a suitable snatch opportunity, then again there\u2019s no one to snatch when she practices at home anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she came into another phase of the dance which had her start with the sensual caress the first dance had started with, but this one leading onto more erotic self groping, it was the long finale to this routine, but she didn\u2019t think, she just followed, which was why she didn\u2019t realize that she shouldn\u2019t be digesting. Digesting her caught prey and enjoying it was the whole idea of this part of the dance and she always made sure she had someone to digest when practicing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one noticed how her slight potbelly shifted and then finally flattened out, so that by the time the dance ended and she made her bows her belly was back to its normal soft smooth self and the girls who\u2019d been trapped inside it were instead just arriving far enough south to begin their begging to be let back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe applause ended after Katrina had made her way away from the dance area. She downed a drink offered to her, dancing always made her thirsty, though the moisture from her prey had taken care of her natural thirst this wasn\u2019t the time to say no to a stronger drink than water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn\u2019t linger, she had to visit the little girls\u2019 room, it wasn\u2019t until she had seated herself with her skirt and panties around her ankles that she looked down on her soft middle and realized what she had just done\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh..my\u2026\u201d She said out loud, rubbing her gut as she started to release the heavy load, who had she eaten? She felt a little guilty for hoping it was just girls from the other team, which really was just as bad, but she hadn\u2019t known any of them for very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you could call it luck, she was in luck, for only girls from Hawthorn\u2019s team had gone into her gut, a good fourteen of them, which was bad, really bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having digested everything in her stomach Katrina still got a lump in it as her insides tightened up, she finished up, cleaned up and got a little shaky out of there. <br>\r\nWhat should she do?<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t meant for this to happen\u2026</span></div></div>",

As a last option Meghan resorted to staying where she was and await the girl. With just a meter left between them Meghan opened her mouth as wide as she could and let the water flow into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any passenger she realized to her horror as she had filled up and hurried to push the water out of her stomach again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found the blonde circulating her, Meghan turned towards her again, figuring she\u2019d have to wait a little longer this time before she could try the same trick again. But the blonde stayed far enough away, yet teasingly close as she moved through the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she picked up pace, Meghan tried to move so she faced her, but the blonde was clearly at home in the water, she moved like a fish and Meghan couldn\u2019t quite toss and turn to match her elusive enemy. Then the blonde were at her feet, then her feet were in the blonde\u2019s throat and with a mighty jerk Meghan felt herself being pulled down and she emptied straight into the athletic girl\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie hurried back to the shore. She let her stomach have at the second girl while she swam and felt a satisfying presence as the girl\u2019s struggles ceased and she melted into a soup, clearly it was this girl who had eaten someone and apparently she hadn\u2019t digested them leaving more food for herself, how very thoughtful of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs thanks, Jamie gave her the tour and showed her the way to her little friend who had tried to flee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up and walking the last way in Jamie felt the last blonde and her captives make the final journey through her bowels and meet up with the first girl who was ready to come out of Jamie\u2019s big muscular butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back up on the shore Jamie grabbed a towel hanging by the railing of the stairs leading up to the lookout of her tower and she dried herself off rather unenthusiastically before tossing the towel back where she had taken it and walked to a door on the bottom of the tower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned the code knob a few times and the door clicked open and she closed the door quickly behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a small room with a little gear, but most importantly the staff toilet. She plied her red bikini bottoms off of her and made herself comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone had cried shark. Well sharks she thought were nice belly fillers, but there were very rarely any in here. Girls on the other hand, came here in plenty and they were much tastier as well and more satisfying to show their place in the food chain too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie didn\u2019t pay the four people making their way out of her bottom much attention, she was most pleasantly occupied by thoughts concerning the fact that this on the side job of hers paid well enough and often let her eat well while she was doing it.</span></div></div>",

She then returned to the couch and made herself comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she didn\u2019t make anymore progress as it was she decided to experiment feeling what felt natural and going with that. Sally was soon caught up in the movie while Madeleine didn\u2019t watch much, she was busy feeling around inside her using every muscle and organ to get her tummy just a little smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about twenty minutes into the movie that she felt a bubbly experience like some ease of pressure or other and it felt good, so she pursued what caused it and soon she was feeling it continuously. Neither she nor Sally heard the noises coming from her stomach through the noise of the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Madeleine felt her stomach shrink and she redoubled her efforts on what had made it do so and she could feel her tummy slowly sinking, slowly becoming smaller and smaller until it was back to normal. The bubbling feeling continued though so Madeleine continued concentrating on the workings of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about midway though the movie that she got up and realised that Sally had fallen asleep. She had been here many times so she knew her way and went straight to the large comfy bathroom. She had business and she knew there were some magazines there she could read while she was at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she locked the door and made herself comfortable, she was already naked so it was just to pull up the lid, sit down, grab the basked of magazines and pick up something of interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst she started peeing and she realised that it was quite a lot of pee, nothing too unusual she did pee much from time to time and then came the bowel movements and she thought it was a large turd coming. It was, but then came a second and a third and a fourth and she still had more, but she realised she had to halt it and see to that she got the first flushed down first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped the magazine and reached behind her, luckily it did go down and she was confused as to how she never had this problem before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to stop and flush several times after that and when she was done she looked down on her belly and patted it, feeling that it was empty and realising that the girls she had swallowed must have been what had just come out of her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 Madeleine heads back to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 She does something else.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just hold out in there, we\u2019ll get you out!\u201d She said loud enough so that she hoped the girl heard her and sure enough Madeleine\u2019s stomach stopped squirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow listen closely\u201d Meghan ushered as she racked her mind for how to explain things and what techniques were the easiest ones. Then she started instructing the bloated girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow the severity of the situation had sobered Madeleine up more than her friends would have thought possible and she was paying very close attention to Meghan\u2019s every word, carrying out every action as best she could while they were being explained to her, most of the time Meghan had to go over them a few times, but to some degree Madeleine did get most of them right and slowly her belly started to deflate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky tried her best not to move, she was sitting on her shins with her giant Gina shaped belly between her spread legs and her own torso curled up over the dome and using her lower arms to keep the surrounding stomach from closing in around her head.<br>\r\nThe air was foul, is sort of tickled her throat and her skin was starting to feel weird, Madeleine\u2019s stomach had secreted something that now was everywhere, Becky was quite certain it was stomach juices, luckily there wasn\u2019t that much of it, yet. She could only stress that word, because more juices were still trickling through the stomach walls into her cramped prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying, between the odd noises of Madeleine\u2019s body and the undecipherable ones pouring out of the TV their voices were mere mumbles, she could get the occasional word, but not more.<br>\r\nJust then she thought the pressure eased up on her. She looked around, by force of habit, it wasn\u2019t like she could see anything inside Madeleine\u2019s dark stomach, but it really felt like the stomach didn\u2019t hold her as tightly anymore, it still rippled and pushed down on her as it slowly churned, but before all of it had sort of squeezed in on her. Now as minutes passed by she could definitely tell that the overall pressure was easing up more and more.<br>\r\nBut two things still troubled her, the juices hadn\u2019t stopped flowing and secondly she was wondering if the churning hadn\u2019t become harsher as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFact was that as Madeleine hid the two girls occupying her stomach they made for a smaller meal and so her stomach didn\u2019t have to stretch as much to fit them, the downside was that they really were a smaller meal, so the previously nigh harmless churning didn\u2019t really increase in strength it was just that by comparison Madeleine\u2019s stomach was slowly getting bigger and scarier. It probably didn\u2019t help that the less the stomach was stretched the more it was returning to normal and thus the better leverage it got to do what it normally did, so it just might have started churning a bit harder as well for that reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan was surprised, she had gone through most of the techniques she thought Madeleine could catch on to, but she had never expected her to make such great progress. Looking over the dome in the girl\u2019s middle she could tell that it fit in her lap now, it didn\u2019t even reach beyond her knees anymore. That still made for a girl-sized bulge though, so should she go through the techniques once more and help Madeleine get the bulge down some more or should they make another attempt at getting Becky out?</span></div></div>",

She kicked into the flesh wall in violent desperation, only to have her foot singed by the fresh acids continuing to pour in. Suddenly the walls closed in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it Madeleine!\" Meghan exclaimed as Madeleine's stomach shrunk a bit more, followed by a sudden protrusion, that was obviously Becky's indignation. \"Becky!\" yelled Meghan, \"Just hold on a bit longer! We'll have you out in no time.\" Becky did not respond as she did not hear Meghan in the least bit,  her senses were beginning to dull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline pushed and kneaded her belly, feeling the sensations as her belly continued to shrink and hide her meal, for every twinge she felt she focused harder and harder until her belly had receded to what resembled simply a normally large meal. Her stomach still felt quite tight though.<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing\" Meghan said as she reached toward Madeleine's maw. Instinctively Madeleine opened up and Meghan lunged her hands deep down Madeleine's esophagus. Feeling the arm of Becky Meghan jerked hard to try and bring her back up, \"Becky!\" she cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky looked up to see a small light above her and felt her arm being tugged, it was almost like a dream to her, most of her senses had drowned out by now, but with her last bit of survival she responded to the cry and tugged back gripping Meghan's strong arm she felt herself being lifted from the pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndulating her throat to help her, Madeleine, winced in pain as she felt the girl being pulled from her, suddenly the movement stopped coming back out, a great wave of pain surged from the bottom of her throat, and instinctively she swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan, was almost ecstatic at the prospect of saving her new friends, found her arms suddenly fall back farther into Madeleine, unable to stop the scene from unfolding Meghan fought back the feeling of disbelief as her shoulders fell into Madeleine, no longer resisting the pains, Madeleine's unhinged jaw kept her from fully seeing what she was doing to Meghan, she simply continued to swallow to relieve the pressure in her throat, with no gag reflex to stop her she swallowed harder and harder feeling a first large lump indent on the inside of her throat followed by another, she realized fully what she was doing now, and tears flowed down her face as she resisted with all her might her body's muscles, but she had trained them too well it seemed, soon Meghan's hips slid down into the back of her mouth and her legs followed shortly after, making large indentation's in Madeleine's throat then quickly disappearing into her chest, gasping for breath Madeleine fell onto her hands and knees, only to have her stomach touch the floor before it quickly returned to hiding the very large meal, reducing in size to that of a single girl meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeleine, desperate, continued to follow her muscles movements kneading and massaging her tummy to make her friends seem smaller, she listened to her body's sounds and followed the feelings of her muscles. Back down to the size it was before she ate Meghan, she began to push the meal upwards using her new found control, but it was useless they were not coming up without the regurgitation agent, still hoping though, Madeleine pushed on her stomach once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Madeleine, Meghan was yelling and screaming, still astonished that Madeleine had gotten this powerful so fast, she felt the walls loosen and tighten pushing and churning on her, she tried to shake Becky into conscienceless but she was already out for good, the acids had taken there toll on Becky and Gina both, Becky's melting body had already released the half digested form of Gina into the growing pool, the feeling all around her caused Meghan to retch, and before long she felt Sally and Annette coming up, defeated, Meghan spoke to her now released, and confused friends, \"Madeleine can't get us up, nor can she hear us.\" Unable to see the expressions on her friends' faces, Meghan closed her eyes, as Sally and Annette began yelling and pushing on their tightening confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeleine knew little to the happenings in her stomach, only that it had just gotten larger again, about twice it's size larger, \"Well that's not right. Hang on guys!\" Madeleine said as she pushed harder on her stomach than she ever had before, suddenly the pressure released, and exhausted Madeleine passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking a few hours later Madeleine felt a gurgling in her lower belly, and a strong need to go take a leak, knowing the house well she meandered her way to the bathroom and lifted the seat up, She thought out loud as she sat her lovely round bottom on the comfortable toilet seat, \"Guess, the girls left without me,\" frowning she looked in between the blinds and saw the sun was up. \"Wonder what they're up to, wish they would have invited me.\" It took her awhile to stop peeing, every time she thought she was done a little more began to trickle out, it wasn't long before she had filled the bowl. Her bladder was refilling as she looked into the toilet, dumbfounded, and flushed it down, groggily a little bit of urine flowed down her leg before she could get back down on the seat, and another bladderfull emptied into the toilet bowl, a few more trickles and she finally reached for a sheet of toilet paper to clean her sex, then she felt a light pressure on her rear,\"Oh yeah,\" she muttered, \"that must have been all that soda i drank last night at the sleepover, and her comes last night's dinner,\" she chuckled, and a little turd plopped out of her taught anus before landing in the bowl, followed by a slightly smaller one, with that she put her hand in between her legs to wipe herself, and only manage to wipe the front, before she looked down at the small bit of extra pudge on her belly, \"Looks like i have a little bit of weight to lose,\" then she massaged it a little bit and another wave of pressure hit her hind quarters just as she had reached back there with the toilet paper in the other hand, \"Aaaw, i thought i was done!\" This time a much larger mass, hit her anus and she grunted in effort, and slowly the waste exited, but the pressure had not subsided yet and she waited a few more second before another mass pushed started to push out, strained and further confused she pinched her anus shut midway through, and stood up, to see an at least four kilo turd in the toilet, eyes wide she realized what this was and the night before rushed back to her. Solemnly she flushed the toilet and sat back down, and continued to defecate the last remaining vestiges of her once friends, grunting and pushing with all her might, she finally set her friends free, eighteen more flushes and she finally felt the pressure subside, and she reflected, the first bit was definitely her dinner followed by Gina in the first 2 flushes, then Becky came out, she was a little bit smoother but longer than Gina, then Meghan was huge, it took Madeleine at least 40 minutes and 7 toiletfulls to let go of her, then Sally was just a bit more, but you were pretty sure she was mixed in with Annette, she could tell, simply because each one smelled differently. Madeleine did feel confident in her abilities now, quite confident in fact, but she was still at a loss for her friends, unable to decide what to do next she considered telling Prof. Blainey about the incident and hope she was forgiving.</span></div></div>",

One, two, three!\" Meghan's long, firm hands are slithering through Madeline's full lips and down her tight, slippery throat. Madeline's eyes bulge, she sticks out her tongue and swallows down Meghan's arms some, helping the TA get in place. Meghan's face just barely enters her moist cavern, and Madeline holds  her in place by the ass and booby. She can hear Meghan grunting, holding something, coming up. Becky's easier for her to hold and pull on because Madeline's hiding techniques reduced the size and subsequent pain. Meghan's back muscle tighten like the coils of an enormous snake, her thin shoulders arching back like a monstrous wrestler, and as Madeline gags faster and faster a wet squelching emerges from her throat. Quickly Becky's face and heavy breasts are hanging out of Madeline's full lips, Becky's full stomach wide with a struggling Gina. Meghan is standing now, and pulls back hard as Madeline screams, waving her hands: Her mouth isn't wide enough, and while she could bring them down, pulling them out would rip apart her jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan is breathing deeply, covered in saliva and a thin layer of sweat. She isn't pulling, but Becky is staying in place halfway out of Madeline's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan shrugs. \"Ok Madeline, we could try training techniques a bit more, or try to get Gina out of Becky now, so Becky comes out easier.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She yelps while trying to seem casual, asking Meghan to hurry up please. Meghan thrusts her hands into Becky, pulsing deeper and deeper through the coiling, constricting muscles of Becky's throat, until she takes hold of Gina's desperately grasping hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan pulls hard, but the second Gina is halfway up Becky's throat, like the keystone of an arch popping out the rest collapsed as well.

She's extremely fatigued and annoyed. She went to Vore University to swallow people, to learn from the best. At some point, when can she just call her friends food? She's swallowing something with great weight, struggling and screaming, and suddenly the weights grows substantially as a pair of long, athletic legs swing up over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan could have escaped if just Madeline were swallowing, but Gina was holding tight as Becky's gag reflex swallowed down both and Madeline swallowed Becky and Meghan.

Curled on her bed, thick wool socks rolled up to her toned, bronzed calves, perky breasts pressing anxiously on her pink tank-top, Haley reaches a hand between her white undies and forces her fingers in, deep. She moans. She pokes her tongue against her cheek again, moaning, rolling the delicious orb about her mouth. Her full, pink lips are puckering. She presses the woman in her mouth, the expert vore instructor, now held at the size of a jawbreaker, against the top of her mouth. She closes her long black eyelashes over emerald eyes, fishes a hand through her silky black hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved her whole family, her mom, her two older sisters, and was glad they taught her everything they knew. Haley is rubbing her fingers in her cunt faster, hard. Since she'd devoured and digested an expert, however, her smaller, teenage breasts developed stronger, as well as her powers and her appetite. Her thighs are beginning to constrict now, pulse, tighten. She'd eaten more and more, and came home to a nagging older sister. She licks hard, sticking out her tongue. Kimberly Hawthorn, my oldest sister, you are delicious. Haley swallows, a heavy, hard, quickly vibrating orb descending down her young, flexible throat. Her wet finger cramp as her legs tighten hard. Her sister wouldn't feel a thing, digesting with the most powerful techniques into valuable paste in less than a microsecond. Haley gasps, rubbing her wet undies, recovering. Her stomach growls: She needs more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other older sister, the one who just became a TA, was having a slumber party somewhere. Maybe I could visit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley raps her knuckles on the door again.

Annette who was all over Madeleine gave the other two a good view of her more than moist neither regions had they looked over to where she and Madeleine were going at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead Meghan and Sally tried not to look and thus Meghan walked over to Sally and placed her hands and ear on the little girl\u2019s big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright in there Becky?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s actually quite nice in here.\u201d Came the muffled reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt might get a little cramp now, I don\u2019t know really. I thought this a good time to see if I could help Sally hide you a little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh, ok.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally smiled and stroked her belly that was easily larger than the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo should we do it like in the book? I\u2019ve read a little, or do you have something else in mind?\u201d Sally asked Meghan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell do the things from the book you think you understood first and I\u2019ll see what I can add. Tell me what you do as you do it and I can give you pointers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo while listening to all sorts of slobbery noises and moans and yelps Meghan coached Sally as she slowly made her tummy smaller and smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sally got her tummy to rest in her lap and not reach beyond her knees, it was somewhat smaller than herself the room got sort of quiet and she looked up to where the two girls had been going at it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d She gasped and Meghan too turned around to see why it suddenly got quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in the corner of the couch moaning and caressing her huge gut was Annette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Madeleine was supposed to eat you, not the other way round!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Buuurp* \u201cWell I got so hungry watching you so I just had to try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you couldn\u2019t hold off digestion at all!

She did manage to get off the couch, but it was with an \u201cOuch!\u201d as she landed on the floor with most of her huge tummy on top of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp!\u201d Annette squealed and a waving hand appeared above the edge of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cServes you right you greedy gut, I bet you planed on eating her right from the start didn\u2019t you?\u201d Meghan said as she made her way over to the helpless blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah.\u201d Annette blushed as she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Meghan questioned as she crouched down at Annette\u2019s feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell she looked like the most filling and she really looked delicious, though I have to admit that she tasted way better than I ever hoped.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette couldn\u2019t see Meghan beneath her huge belly, but she felt Meghan gripping her feet and before she managed any other protest than a short yelp she found herself travelling down Meghan\u2019s throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan got up and started walking out of there when Sally stopped her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you said no digestion right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, I was just thinking that Madeleine would be in a dire need of a shower once she gets out of Annette.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry.

While Annette couldn't digest people as quickly as someone with experience, the acids she would produce would be rather noxious to Madeleine, and Meghan wasn't eager to let her get hurt. Part of her wanted to be angry at Annette, but she couldn't muster much emotion. Humans had been the main constituent of her diet for so long, that sometimes it was difficult for her to see people as anything beyond meat. She could definitely relate to her cravings. Her mind fluttered to Gina in her stomach. She had curled up into a comfortable little ball inside her, and was rocking back and forth slightly. Actually, now that Meghan was away from the noises of conversation, she thought she could here soft moaning emanating from her taut midsection. Meghan smiled to herself. Gina was actually fingerbanging herself inside her stomach. Made happy by this for some reason she couldn't explain, Meghan ducked inside the bathroom. She turned the shower on so it wouldn't be too cold when they were cleaning everyone off, and began searching for towels. She searched through a couple of drawers in dressers inside the bathroom, but couldn't find any. She redoubled her efforts when she heard a deep belch with the slight undertone of Annette's feminine voice coming from back in the living room, but after another minute, decided there were no towels in this room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the bathroom and crossed the hall into a bedroom. Inside was a teal painted room, predominately filled by a large queen sized bed, and an impressive 40 inch plasma screen T.V. across from it. Hanging posters of teen-aged associated punk and metalcore bands left Meghan with the impression that the room belonged to Becky. Spotting an oaken dresser, Meghan began her search anew. She rifled through the drawers with mounting frustration before she open the bottom one, which contained a number of multicolored towels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, finally.\" Meghan muttered to herself as she gathered a number of them and brought them into the bathroom, leaving them on the sink. She left and began to head back to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright guys, the shower's re-\" Meghan started before she took a look inside the room. Annette was sitting alone, stomach larger then before. Her adorable round face morphed into a big grin at Meghan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddamnit Annette. Where's Sally?\" Meghan rhetorically questioned whilst pinching her sinuses with her two pointer fingers in a show of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrp.\" Annette responded, her grin parting for a moment to release a cute little burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you did.\" Meghan sighed. \"Open wide.\" she said, closing the distance between them. In response, Annette frowned and put on her best puppy dog face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to?\" She asked in as innocent a voice she could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you have to,\" Meghan commanded as she stood over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they feel so good in there - oomph!\" Annette returned before Meghan forceably jammed her fist down the now-not-so thin girl's throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want,\" Meghan grunted as she forced her way further and further into Annette, \"I can take you hunting tomorrow, but I'm not letting you digest our friends.\" She concluded as her hand broke into Annette's stomach. She reached down a bit further until she felt what she thought was an arm. Grasping holding of it, she pulled. There was a lot of resistance at first, but with a bit of sustained effort, the arm gave way, and Meghan started pulling it back up the esophagus; a task much easier than she imagined it to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I understand the cravings you're having right now, Ann,\" Meghan began as she pulled herself out of Annette up to her elbow, \"But it's never a good idea to eat people you know. You can really hurt someo-.\" Meghan suddenly stopped as she peered into Annette's mouth to see what she was grasping. Her hand was wrapped tightly around the wrist of a severed arm. There was no skin on it, and what muscle remained was desiccated and withered. White bone was stained red from some manner of scarlet liquid that ran off the remains of the muscle. A look of disgust crawled across Meghan's face as she slowly and deliberately released her grip on the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On second thought, keep it.\" Meghan said. Without a moment's hesitation, Annette swallowed the arm with alacrity and softly burped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Meghan started as she looked at her red stained palm, \"Just you and me now I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Gina.\" Annette said, pointing at Meghan's exposed stomach. Meghan looked down at her stomach for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, fuck it.\" She decided as she released control of her stomach acids. Gina screamed in surprised and pain as her masturbation was suddenly interrupted as Meghan's compactor-like stomach crushed her from all sides, before Meghan's acids began to eat away at her skin. Gina gasped in paralyzed pain before her heart suddenly stopped from shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan looked back up from her stomach. \"Just you and me now I guess.\" Annette smiled back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happiness,\" Annette began, \"A good bank account, a good cook, and a good digestion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say.\" Meghan muttered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so gloomy Meghan!\" Annette returned with a rising inflection, \"Becky, Sally, Gina, and Madeleine died for our happiness! It would be disrespectful to waste their gifts on getting all caught up on how they gave them to us in the first place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is seriously something wrong with your mind. But fuck it. Let's chill.\" Meghan stated, reaching for a DVD case. The two settled on a couch together, sleepily watching some film they weren't paying attention to. After abou thirty minutes, Annette slightly raised her tight little ass in the direction of Meghan, and cut loose a deep fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, Annette.\" Meghan said, rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" Annette said, giggling. \"You don't have to run off! Every person farts like, twenty times a day or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think a fart would gross me out, you have a lot of things to learn about vore. I'm just heading over to the bathroom to let Gina out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You digested her already?!\" Annette questioned in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. That twenty four hour digestion period you always here about is nonsense. Anyway, Gina's making a very persuasive argument as to why I should take a dump right now, so I'm going to go do that.\" Meghan said before leaving the room. </span></div></div>",

Then she promptly swallowed Meghan whole in one swift motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside Meghan felt around while waiting for Alectra to tell her what was going on. Was it getting wetter? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough some sort of liquid was starting to flow freely in there and Meghan began to panic as it was already knee deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down. The liquid is harmless on its own.\u201d Alectra comforted Meghan and patted her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan was glad to hear that as she was soon swimming in the stuff and she did notice that it didn\u2019t hurt her at all, it was slightly thicker than water though so she was more afraid of whether or not she would have the endurance to keep afloat in the stuff and if the flow didn\u2019t stop soon there would be no surface to break in there. Luckily it did and Alectra explained things to Meghan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe liquid is something I finally have managed my body to produce. It is very potent because it is filled with all sorts of enzymes and stuff, but at the same time it is harmless because everything is dormant. This means that an activator has to be added to make the components start to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan started feeling uneasy when she knew that she was swimming around in some sort of super digestive mix and it had taken Alectra only a couple of seconds to fill her stomach to the brim with the stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what an activator is right? Well anyway you asked me to show you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Alectra made her body add something to the mix in her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction was violent, almost instantly Meghan was reduced to an evenly distributed nutritious soup, which was even now being sucked into and absorbed by Alectra\u2019s intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Alectra\u2019s body was done with Meghan and she went to the bathroom to relieve herself. As she did it was clear that something was different, somehow there wasn\u2019t as much left of Meghan as one would have expected. In fact there was a lot less left of her, though Alectra didn\u2019t seem surprised by this.  </span></div></div>",

Tamara just shook her head and let Evelyn swallow Meghan, who was soon curled up in Evelyn\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan was surprised by the speed she was devoured. She struggled a little in the cramped stomach and let out a weak \u201cHelp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamara put her hands on her hips. \u201cSo you\u2019ve gotten to swallow her, now throw her up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn caressed the lump in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no time for games, let her up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn started running and Tamara followed close behind. She dashed around a corner and inside her stomach Meghan was being thrown about, and Evelyn\u2019s stomach also pushed down on her some as it flexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two of running Evelyn jumped inside a room and shut the door behind her. She locked the door before Tamara had reached it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamara didn\u2019t manage to catch up with Evelyn, because Evelyn were in much better shape and knew where she was heading. It was for one of the rooms where one could rest for a while, should there be a need for such. That is if you worked late or got a headache or something like that. Anyway there was a chair a small table and a bed in the room, and that was about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Evelyn jumped on the bed and pushed the pillows up against the wall on the head end, so that she could get herself into a half laying half sitting position which was comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the blanket at the foot end and managed to fetch it with her feet. It sure looked nice. As she snuggled up and relaxed a bit Meghan started moving around again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why did you swallow me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanted to learn some escape techniques, did you not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, but what are you up to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just getting comfortable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn got the blanket over her and placed her hands on her stomach so that she could feel Meghan moving around better.

She looked at the puddle on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026I guess I\u2019ll take care of that later.\u201d She mumbled, not that Tamara could hear her from down the hall but Evelyn realized she was a bit peckish, so she went to a storage room to get something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan and Tamara hurried into the large bathroom with a shower where Meghan had cleaned up earlier after their own little mishap. Turning on the shower Tamara turned to help Meghan get out of her clothes. It\u2019d be easy enough to just tear them off, but Meghan had started trying to get them off without destroying them which was a bit more troublesome considering they were tight to begin with and now soaking wet to boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough with Tamara\u2019s help they soon came off and while she put them in the large sink and started filling it with water Meghan jumped into the shower and began scrubbing the ghastly juices off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really glad you got me out of there in time.\u201d Meghan called over the noise of the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I did.

Strangely memorized as she watched the woman finish and then wipe herself, not quite being able to shake the feeling that that could have been her as Evelyn flushed and pulled her bikini bottoms back up again.</span></div></div>",

Had Meghan had time to ponder the woman\u2019s appearance further she would have thought the woman might be too old to be a student, maybe somewhere between twenty-five and thirty. As it were however Meghan got a bit of a shock as she found herself staring down the woman\u2019s wide open throat as she wrapped her mouth around the front of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan started struggling with her seatbelt, but because she was in panic it didn\u2019t loosen right away. All while the blond devoured more and more of the car. When Meghan had rid herself of the belt and lunged for the door, the blond\u2019s lips had already started creeping up the sides of the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled the handle and pushed at the door but it didn\u2019t open much, only an inch or so. So Meghan gathered strength and threw herself at the door. But now the woman had gained another foot or so of the door, so the resistance was greater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever the less Meghan managed to get the door open a good foot. But when she continued pushing, the woman took a swallow and the door slammed shut, forcing Meghan back into the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately Meghan looked around. She didn\u2019t have any backdoors so there was no way out of the car. Ahead she saw only the darkness of the woman\u2019s gullet and to the sides how she gobbled up more and more of the car. But in the back yes, that might work. Through the rear window she could still see freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkwardly Meghan made her way to the cramped backseat. She lay down on her back and put her feet up to the window and just as she were about to start kicking Meghan could just watch in horror as darkness crept over her last window to the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t much of a back to the car, so once passed the rear window Daniela\u2019s lips started to close behind the car. Soon Meghan and her car were trapped in darkness and Daniela manoeuvred the last of the car into her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified Meghan could do nothing as the car emptied into the busty blonde\u2019s stomach and the throat closed behind it. Daniela\u2019s stomach started to rumble and churn, slowly rocking the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan turned on the lights inside the coupe and hoped that the car would be both sealed tight so that no juices would come inside and also resistant to what the woman could hurl at it. But as she looked out the windows she could see the juices flowing heavily and that they were indeed doing serious damage to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it seemed as if the stomach kicked in a second gear. What came next seemed to melt the car like butter in a frying pan. Meghan could only helplessly kick about as the car filled up with juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it were it didn\u2019t take long before Meghan and her car was no more than a mushy soup in Daniela\u2019s stomach. At first she had been very bloated, initially the outline of the car had been clearly visible, even though it looked like she had swallowed a miniature car and not a full sized one. Now the bulge in her stomach was round and smooth and she let out a massive belch. There was no need to have a lot of air in her stomach, and frankly most of the car\u2019s volume was just air so when she let it out her stomach shrank away and she ended up with a small bulge, it didn\u2019t stretch her top out further then her breasts did, but then again she\u2019d need a serious bulge for that to be the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted her tummy as it let out another rumble and started pushing Meghan into her intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that takes care of dinner.\u201d She thought and started walking home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela is one of the researchers in professor Blainey\u2019s research team. She has spent a few years on her PhD so far and has made swallowing large things her special field of study. Naturally she tired of bringing them back up and her body has adapted to handle all sorts of things, so the metal and gasoline in the car were nothing new, nor were they any problem, neither were any plastic parts or anything else found in the car for that matter. But it was the lady inside that was the reason as to why she had eaten the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela has planned to take it easy tonight, even though it is Friday. The reason being that tomorrow her research team will have a party to get to know the new research team that arrived last week. And she always liked those crazy and honestly disgusting parties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of disgusting, her body was done with Meghan and her car long before she got home.</span></div></div>",

Meghan massaged and needed Victoria's cheeks and mouth like tough dough, and eventually began working down back of Victoria's throat. Samantha got out of her chair and stood behind Meghan. Meghan continued deeper, massaging for several minute, only halfway down the college girls' throat, where she made a significant bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria, unlike her far more experienced friend, genuinely needed the help. Her throat was stiff and tight. So much so that, while Meghan still had good footing, she simply let herself hang, held together by the slightly vibrating muscles. She had reached the opening of Victoria's throat into the stomach, and was massaging it with great force, sweating in the already hot and moist cylinder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside her body, the short, freckled brunette had wide eyes and was gesturing at Samantha rapidly to help her. Victoria had been trying to swallow Meghan for over a minute, but didn't have the ability. While Samantha was disappointed she didn't get the experienced, delicious meal, she found the prospect of sexually dominating her friend, the one who swallowed a hot TA, very arousing. She promised herself to do so later that night as she took a few steps behind Meghan, until she was directly in front of her exposed buns. Her skirt was riding up and she could see her undies and perfectly formed ass very well. Peering over this vibrating, delicious sight, she looked Victoria in the eyes and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan felt Victoria lapping at her crotch, which lay directly over her tongue. While she didn't approve, she thought it was probably just a reflex, like how whenever a dentist stuck something metal in her mouth she couldn't stop herself from licking it. If the dentist was ever an attractive female she'd ask her to check somewhere in the back after the appointment ended and would take her home as a snack. She chuckled lightly to herself as she pushed slightly further down, getting a better grip on the sphincter only to find it suddenly opened wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt four hands lay on her ass and realized the horrible irony of the thought.</span></div></div>",

However, the dark-haired bombshell had been so aroused by the prospect of watching the experienced TA's beautiful ass go down her friends' throat that she hadn't realized her head and hands would follow if she pushed as hard as she did. Undeterred, she was about to pull her head out of the small butt moist cavern when Victoria swallowed again, and Meghan's calves flew forward, hooking under Samantha's pits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden burst of adrenaline immobilized her for just a moment, and in that moment Samantha swallowed again. Her hands were half-way to the brunette's stomach, along with Meghan's butt. Her boobs were on her friends tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria didn't notice the extra weight at first, because while the lower half of her throat was flexible now the upper part wasn't, and she was in pain. Tears streamed down her cheeks and she swallowed again. Something was screaming curse words and thrashing inside throat, which she thought was odd, because Meghan should've been experienced enough to know it was a waste of energy. She swallowed again and felt a delicious, slightly wet booty roll onto her tongue. The cute, freckled girl wasn't the brightest kid in class, and for a moment thought Meghan was playing a trick that let her seem much taller than she was. Tasting the booty, she swallowed and casually flicked her slightly sweaty hair out of the way and over her shoulder. Her tongue lapped at the girls' sweet skin, and she swallowed again, curly her tongue around the delicious behind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her stomach, Meghan's feet popped out of the opening. She knew she'd been pulling Victoria's friend along for the ride, though she'd hoped Victoria would have a conscience and let the two of them out. She knew now her best chance would be to swallow the dark-haired student and use her as a hostage. She wondered briefly whether Samantha had planned to eat her as well before she turned enough to see Samantha, up to her abdomen, had already emerged from the sphincter.</span></div></div>",

She never stood a chance against the extremely experienced predator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samantha was thrown forward Meghan simply opened her mouth, letting the girl fall directly into her, like she were a bird being fed. Two quick swallows pulled her into her mouth, were she hid her in a tight ball. Meghan licked and sucked her like a piece of candy before sticking out the tip of her tongue and swallowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Victoria opened her eyes, panting and sweating. She looked around a few moments before she realized what must have happened. She grinned, looking at her basketball-sized stomach. She was a little wet from the idea of having eaten her friend. After all, she was attractive. Victoria also reminded herself of all the times she'd been treated poorly by her, dominated by her, and that she always stole the boys attention. Still smiling, rubbing her stomach and panting slightly, she reached for her bag and Samantha's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't make eye-contact with anyone, slowly beginning to realize how much trouble she might get in. Luckily she'd been near one of the doors, and she crept to the door and left, hoping the most anyone noticed was the sound of a door clicking shut.

Now on her back, Meghan reaches up and tangles her fingers in Samantha's hair, before yanking down towards her mouth. However, Victoria had swallowed again, letting Samantha in up to her knees, so Meghan's swing instead led the bitches' head to her crotch. Meghan vast experience and skill tells her to disable her opponent quickly, before the unpredictable environment makes a cat fight that should be impossibly tilted in her own favor an even toss up. So, with Samantha already pushing against Meghan's ass and trying to pull herself away, cursing her idiot of a friend all the while, Meghan snaps her thighs around the young bombshell's neck, trapping her in a 69 position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria swallowed the last of Samantha, still unaware her dominatrix of a friend had hitched a ride. She feels her stomach with an enormous smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha can feel her hot, skilled TA pulling her sloppy wet feet to swallow them, so Samantha does the one thing she wouldn't expect: she kicks them in. As Samantha hoped, the blonde beauty hasn't opened her mouth fully, and instead is temporarily disabled. Samantha uses the opportunity and surrounding mucus to escape what should have been an impossible trap, and begins to maneuver herself into position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria has finally deduced what must have happened, and is still simply sitting, quietly disgusted, ashamed, and turned on by the realization that half the tasty flesh, boob and butt sensations she'd just had were not a trick by Meghan, but her childhood friend. She tries to stand, to quietly leave the busy, cacaphonic classroom, but sudden kicking in her wide, throbbing gut force the petite brunette back in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan is kicking wildly, hoping the last-ditch attempt at chaos will wriggle her athletic body free. Her green shirt is soaking in mucus and crumpled up so the base of her double D breasts and toned abs and fully exposed to Samantha's iron thighs. Meghan still cannot dislodge herself, or pull Samantha's manicured feet closer to begin swallowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is less than Samantha can say, who currently has swallowed the pale TA to her calves. She can feel Meghan struggling, kicking, and see her squealing and applying mucus to her abdomen, but Samantha allows herself a fully sadistic, earpiercingly loud shriek of laughter to echo out of her full, occupied lips. The black-haired bitch swallows again, pulling her lips over Meghan's mid-thighs which so nearly sealed her fate, and in doing so curls robe sitting straight up in the stomach, using gravity, her own powerful thighs and the wall of Victoria's stomach to keep Meghan pinned down. Samantha extends her legs to pin Meghan's pits, preventing the taller girl from using her arms anywhere beyond the far sides of her body. Samantha swallows again, now up to Meghan's tight ass. Samantha shifts her pincer-like thighs to either side of Meghan's head, curling her shirt to expose enormous, still bra-clad boobies. Meghan is still twisting, but no longer has the leverage to kick or thrash in any effective way. Her face is petrified in an expression Samantha guesses belongs somewhere between shock and disgust. Samantha swallows again, moving the ass to the back of her throats and slowing the conquest so she can enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria's stomach is still gurgling, but no longer thrashing. Surprisingly, no one has noticed her. The anonymity of the crowd, I suppose, the curly-haired brunette muses to herself. Slowly sitting up, Victoria makes her way to the door. Many other girls have equally exposed stomachs due to the devices the class was training with, and one girl just left with a TA, likely to puke out the medicine balls and fruit somewhere less distracting. Victoria quietly follows them out the door, carrying her own, Meghan's and Samantha's backpacks, all nearly empty because the class involves more \"hands-on\" than homework-type learning. The short, skinny girl rubs a hand on her boob and another across her freckled face, moaning in ecstasy. Her escape, her conquest of her domineering friend and intimidating TA were fantasies come true, and she wondered what to do next with her captives. As she opens the school doors a cool breeze and white light rush past her, and she savors this perfect moment with closed eyes and a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan's eye are wide and bulging, her arms drenched in as much sweat as they are in mucus, and the disgusted protege of the best vore instructor in the world shouts \"Don't!\" as a beautiful but inexperienced and arrogant college girl sucks at her boobs, playing games with the large mounds of flesh. Samantha stops, looks over the short six inch distance between them and into Meghan's green eyes. Her predator's blue eyes and playful exprsssion are charming, but only piss off the blonde prey even more. She wriggles her body, with legs trapped in stomach chest in throats and boobs in mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha swallows three times, pushing the angry girl down. Her arms and a few blonde strands of hair still still outside her mouth. Samantha puts on hand on her clit and rubs furiously, laughing and licking the famous daughter's face. Samantha squirts cum into the puddle of mucus and sweat she's practically bathing in, laughs at the useless gestures of Meghan's manicured hands, and softly swallows them. She swallows twice more, until an entire women struggles, trapped, in her bloated belly. Samantha lays her head and soaking hair on a stomach-wall, panting and grinning and savoring the moment, before she tilts back her neck and politely shouts that she'd like robe let out now.</span></div></div>",

Holding onto the upper portion of the dark haired girl's stomach, Meghan forced herself further and further in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has ability.\" Meghan thought to herself as her shoulders entered the throat. \"To think she's only been doing this for a few days!\" She muttered as she stretched her arms to their expanse inside the girl's gut, and found little resistance. She brought her arms back to her side and pressed them to either side of Jennifer's esophagus, as to attempt to climb up backwards, when she felt a sharp pain beneath her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer bit down hard. Meghan's breasts were in her mouth and with a quick gulp they were in her throat. Meghan's taste was absolutely superb, especially with the additional flavoring of her salty blood.

Jennifer swallowed again, engulfing her would-be instructor to her waist, and swallowed again, her mouth conforming to the shape of Meghan's rear. \"She's got a nice ass.\" Jennifer thought as she swallowed again, taking in half of the TA's thighs, \"Not as good as mine, but still great.\" Another swallow brought in half of her meal's calves, and another left no part of Meghan outside of Jennifer. She swallowed again, sending her prey's legs into her stomach. \"That's what you get for swallowing me, bitch.\" Jennifer said looking to her enlarged belly. She hid it to the best of her ability and looking around, she didn't look too far off from those practising around her, in fact a few girls looked more swollen than she did.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nJennifer looked over to her partner, Victoria, whose curly brown hair shook slightly with her quivering. She slowly opened her mouth. \"You.

What are you doing; Let me out!\" To which an emboldened belch was heard in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked about, moving the flashlight with her vision. Jennifer's stomach was pink, with a glossy mucus covering it in its entirety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan regained her composure, she had been inside of both her sisters, even ravenous Haley, and made it out safe, she would just have to keep calm. This thought was forgotten in an instant when noticed the walls of Jennifer's stomach begin to convulse and spew forth a clear liquid. She looked about, the liquid was omnidirectional, there was no where to go. Meghan wished she had learned how to properly escape the human stomach as she made desperate attempts to force open the sphincter that led to her assailant's throat, but to no effect. Gasping and looking towards the burning sensation on her leg, Meghan looked down to see her exposed skin, her pants melted away. She redoubled her efforts but soon collapsed as her leg shrieked to her in agony. Landing on her left side in a slowing growing pool of the liquid, she looked at her leg; clumps of skin were sloughing off, she felt nauseous as she watched her exposed muscle flex, before she felt the same sensation on her left leg. She tried to lift herself to her feet, but found that she couldn't use her left arm, only managing to roll a bit. Looking at it, Meghan began to sob. Only her white bone remained. As she focused on her leg pain, Jennifer's acid had ate through her arm, including the nerve endings. She could see the meat once attached to her on the area wear she had landed and watched as it liquefied before her eyes. The burning sensation she initially felt in her leg was now felt nearly everywhere. Her clothes dissolved, Meghan lay naked on her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what I've been doing to people all these years?\" Meghan thought to herself as the acid ate through her rear. She recalled the first person she ate as time began to seemingly stop. She was three, walking with her mother and her sister, Kimberly. Her mother had taught Meghan how to swallow people within a week of her learning how to coherently talk. She and Kimberly had swallowed each other for fun and Meghan applied her knowledge to her meals, taking in whole chickens and hams in seconds. It was a mild spring day in May, and Kimberly pointed to a blanket-seated family having a picnic. A single mother with a teenage son and a blonde haired daughter enjoying a selection of cold cuts and fruit. Her mother nodded, looked about, and walked towards the group, Kimberly in tow and Meghan a bit after. Wordlessly, her mother approached the three, grabbed the mother and swallowed her whole in a moment. A moment that Kimberly used to pounce on the teenager and wrestle him into her six year old stomach in seven seconds flat. Kimberly belched loudly as Meghan caught up. Her mother looked at her and said a phrase that would shape Meghan's life: \"Last one is your's Meghan, I think you're ready.\" she said gesturing towards the quivering child. \"Just like play, but don't let her out!\" Kimberly chimed in with a puerile happiness as she dug into the family's meal like a badger. Meghan awkwardly walked up to the child, she was maybe a year older than her, and couldn't meet her gaze. As the child shell-shockingly stared off into nothingness, Meghan looked over to her nodding mother and opened her mouth as wide as she could. The blonde girl went limp at her grip and Meghan began to eat her as fast she could, not wanting to disappoint her mother. As Meghan was half way finished, the girl regained her senses and began to scream and thrash. Meghan struggled and struggled against her and finally after a twenty second debacle choked her legs down. Panting heavily and belching loudly, Meghan looked up to her mother's approving gaze. \"That's mommy's little killer!\" she said happily \"Let me eat the blanket and the basket and we'll go find a potty for all of us. Meghan watched her mother swallow the blanket and the now empty basket as she felt the rumbles of her stomach and listened to the bloodcurdling screeches of her meal. She didn't sleep well that night, nor for the rest of the week, as her mother offered her a meal every day from there on out until she was old enough to go to school and get her own food. After a week, Meghan could ignore the death woes, after two weeks, she acquired a taste for digesting whole humans alive, and after a month she had a craving for it, it became nearly her only food, about two a day from three to eight, three a day from eight to twelve, as many as twelve a day from eight to sixteen, before she began to wane herself down to the one a day she had been maintaining for the past four years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow many people had she done this to? Ten thousand? A hundred thousand? What kind of monster was she?! Her thoughts cut back to reality as she felt an impossible pain where her shoulder and hip bones began to melt. She screamed and screamed and tried to move, but found herself unable to use her arms and legs. \"I deserve this.\" Meghan thought \"Slowly digested by a novice. How many have I put through the same thing?\" She lay on her back and waited for death, feeling both agony and a sense of duty, that this is what must be done. She shrieked as the skin on her back melted away, and shrieked again when Jennifer's body began to eat through her spinal cord. After but a moment, the acid ate through Meghan's backbone and what remained of her muscular system had one last spasm as she foamed at the mouth and went limp, her body turning into a repulsive reddish liquid in moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken twenty-seven seconds.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Victoria continued in a distressed but hushed tone \"You can't just kill her Jennifer! She's a person, and she's a TA! So not only will you be expelled, you'll be put in jail for life! Let her out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer wasn't listening, she heard only the rumblings of her belly and felt only the waves of euphoria from her digestion, it was like a thirty second long orgasm. Biting her lip and holding in moans of pleasure, Jennifer watched as the beach ball sized lump in her mid-section shrunk and shrunk, until it was the size of a bowling ball, and it shifted about three inches downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohp!\" Jennifer started as she nonconsensually released a very audible fart, causing several groups to look in her direction. Blushing she softly said to no one in particular \"Still trying to embarrass me Meghan, you bitch? Be a good girl and digest, would ya?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria looked shockingly at Jennifer, saying with a hint of simultaneous fear and anger \"That's it than, you killed her. you just murdered someone Jenn! You're acting like it's a fucking joke or something!\" The curly haired woman said, her words becoming increasing louder. \"This isn't ri-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, while that was a very riveting argument you had for whatever you were talking about Vicky, I'm going to go drop about a hundred and forty pounds. Don't say anything dumb, or I might just have to do something drastic.\" The dark haired beauty interrupted, starting towards the bathroom, a growing pressure building inside of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the other groups were preoccupied with their work, as was Professor Blainey and the other three TAs. Jennifer worked through the throng and into the chlorine stenched air of the lavatory. The room was styled in typical fashion, white tiles on the floor and half way up the wall, where they were than replaced with white paint. Two urinals, three standard sized stalls, and one larger, walled off stall composed the room's facilities. No one was in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably what I'm looking for.\" She thought to herself. \"Probably designed for those suffering from the same issues as me.\" Jennifer walked towards the stall, noticing how she could visible observe Meghan's remains travelling through  her digestive tract. As she closed the door and pulled down her pants, she took note of how the mass had stopped travelling several inches above her waist. She looked down curiously at the lump, and as her rectum began to scream in pain, she put two and two together as she thrust herself on top of the bowl. Explosive would be an apt term to use in describing what transpired to Jennifer at that time. She had nearly no control of what was expelled as she did her best to choke back cries of pain, and after nearly an entire minute of uninterrupted excretion, she stood to look at what she had wrought. Somehow the bowl had expanded to fit the shape of what was undeniably once the 1.8 metre tall woman Jennifer had made a meal of. Urine rose from the foot of Meghan's desiccated remains to about what was once her waist. The stench was overpowering and there was blood in the bowl. Panting, Jennifer flushed the waste away, remarking how the machine managed to complete the task before it. She wiped herself and flushed that away as well before pulling her pants up and awkwardly walking out of the stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She went over to the sink to wash her hands, and checked herself out in the mirror. She stood at about 160 centimetres, and had gorgeous dark hair that ran to the bottom of her shoulders. Her eyes were a bright green and her face could be the envy of a model. Her hairless skin was a shade darker than standard European by her own works through tanning. Her breasts were a c-cup and her thin abdomen was toned with muscle that she worked out excessively to maintain. She had long, muscular legs and an ass that made her the desire of most men she encountered. Jennifer was a beautiful woman, and she worked hard to made herself even more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her hygiene and her body, she slowly walked back to the classroom, concentrating intensely to walk normally, as her anus throbbed with pain. After a while, she managed her way back to Victoria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what, ya know... happened in there?\" The attractive curly haired girl asked, biting her lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's just say good in, bad out, don't go in there.\" Jennifer said, leaning on a table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, uh. That wasn't cool what you did.\" Victoria said meekly, straining to force herself to look Jennifer in the eyes. \"I know we're good friends and all, but I don't know if I can act like this never happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither can I.\" The gorgeous dark haired woman said. \"This changes everything.\" she said, eyeing several nearby people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right people, that's it for today!\" Professor Blainey shouted from behind her desk. \"Remember to continue practising, and push your limits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good bye then.\" Victoria said, hastily grabbing her backpack and walking away. \"And remember to think about what your doing before you do it!\" She added before walking away with a bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bye.\" Victoria said absent-minded. She watched Victoria walk away. Jennifer wouldn't say she was particularly attracted to females, but there had always been something between the two. They had been friends since high school and both played offense on their school's football team. Jennifer could recall times when after a game she looked at her friend for a bit too long in the showers, and she remembered how, to her shame, occasionally during the uncommon times she wasn't in bed with someone, how her mind would drift to Victoria in the dark. And now she was thinking about ratting her out? Jennifer didn't know whether to feel shocked or angry or spiteful, but she definitely felt hungry. Maybe she could take care of two issues at once...  </span></div></div>",

Henceforth I will be keeping the character's name as Jennifer for the sake of my own ease.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Jennifer couldn't risk Victoria telling anybody about this. She was in an introductory class, which meant there were advanced courses for eating people, and Blainey was well versed enough to educate people in it, if the Professor got wind of it, that might spell the end for her. Not to mention that even suggesting that she might do it is a blatant lack of respect for their friendship and their mutual trust. And if someone was going to make Victoria into a meal, Jennifer was sure she'd want it to be her best friend. Grabbing her backpack and pulling out her phone, Jennifer walked out of the classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked through her contacts until she found her boyfriend, Dave, and dialed him. Dave was a large man, 195 cm tall and 95 kilos heavy, he was on the university's American Football team and had played the sport since High School. He was a brunette with blue eyes and had the look of a Scotsman about him. He studied engineering and wasn't particularly adept at it, so most of his out of class / out of practice time was spent studying to keep up with his courses. This and his sports practice left him a drained man by day's end, which was fine to Jennifer, who only sought him for her attraction to him. As Jennifer spent a lot of time and energy securing a single room for herself, she and Dave spent nearly all of their nights with each other, much to her neighbor's dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while, Dave answered the phone. \"Hey Jenn,\" he said \"What's up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dave, I was just calling to say I've made plans for dinner, so I won't be coming with you to the Dining Hall.\" Jennifer said walking out of the building and into the clean September air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, all right.\" came from the other side of the line, \"Can I still come over tonight? Got an exam at eleven and I want to get a good night's rest, and I always sleep better knowing you're nearby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With an empty ballsack you mean.\" Jennifer said, smiling, ignoring the oogling look of a man she pasted by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, but I'm trying to be romantic.\" Dave admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, well good to know romance still has a pulse, see you tonight.\" The dark haired girl concluded, pulling her phone from her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later.\" came from the phone before the call was ended with a click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer, having no more classes for the day, headed back to her dorm, a brick building some thirty metres tall by the name of R\u00f6tgen Memorial Hall. She started towards the stairs, passing by two Hispanic thirty year old female janitors having a heated discussion in Spanish. One gestured towards Jennifer and turned towards the other:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u00bfQu\u00e9 tal este? \u00a1Ella podr\u00eda llenarme bueno!\" She said. Jennifer looked at the woman. She was about 155 cm tall, with short black hair, decently attractive, with a type of body that could be described as \"thick,\" but there was little fat on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u00a1Tu recibi\u00f3 los \u00faltimos cuatro, tengo que comer demasiado, si alguien la consigue, ser\u00e9 ella!\" The other replied. She was of an average build with average features, excluding her protruding rear, and had shoulder length brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer typically did her best to try to ignore public servants, but the these two were clearly talking about her. Normally her pride demanded she interrogate the two, demanding them to tell her what they said, but at the same time, she was in a great mood, still on a biological high from ingesting Meghan.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Forcing a smile and mouthing the word \"Hi,\" Jennifer moved past the duo and into the stairwell, ascending the steps two at a time, until she reached the third floor, where her room was located. Walking through the hallway and unlocking her door with a keycard, she entered the room. A well kept loft, Jennifer's living space was a single room with painted white walls and gray tinted white tiles for a floor. Both her and Dave's items were kept in the room, hers in several chests positioned in various places throughout, and Dave's on the desk he had appropriated. Jennifer looked at the time on her phone. It was 13:30 and she typically exercised from 14:00 to 16:00 before showering and going for dinner, so she figured around 17:00 she'd head over to Victoria room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the thought of what she was going to do to her best friend, Jennifer felt wet, recalling her experience with Meghan, she removed her clothes in a hurry, jumped on her bed, and pleasured herself to the memory of the pleasure of eating the experienced woman whole. After she came, she stood up and opened a nearby chest, grabbing three protein shakes and a packet of beef jerky, all of which she consumed with haste. Throwing the packaging out and belching almost quietly, Jennifer changed into a pair of white underwear, black yoga pants, a trainer bra, and a shoulder-less blue t-shirt before grabbing her phone and a pair of headphones as she left for the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe university's gym was expansive and well supplied, as the school's population was large, and their performance in sports (particularly woman's sports) was unmatched throughout the country. Jennifer swiped her school ID at a front desk, where a athletic looking Asian man actively struggled to not stare at her whilst he swiped her in. Jennifer walked to the treadmills and, plugging her headphones into her phone and starting a playlist, set one for 12 kilometres an hour. Normally, Jennifer ran for twenty minutes, but as she lost herself in her music, she looked down to see that she had been running for nearly forty. She hadn't even begun to feel tired. Stopping the machine, she walked to the bathroom and urinated before heading over to weight machines. Starting at the abdominal machine, she set it to forty kilos, her standard weight, but found herself easily lifting this, so she gradually increased the weight until she found a good resistance at sixty. She proceeded through the rest of her routine finding herself much stronger than before, garnering looks of surprise from other gym attendees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her two hours were up, Jennifer headed back to her room, opening a litre of water and a package of peanuts, consuming them both in less than a minute. \"Urp.\" she belched, almost as a statement before disposing of the packaging and changing into her showerwear and heading into the bathroom. After showering for fifteen minutes and drying for five, Jennifer went back into her room and looked at her phone. 16:30. She got changed into a tight fitting black sleeveless t-shirt and a pair of tight fitting beige short-shorts, exposing her legs. She than left the building and headed towards Victoria's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having a problem, Jess.\" Victoria said to her roommate. She was wearing pink pajamas and sitting on her bed, cross legged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? Jess asked from her desk, looking down on her anthropology work. Jess was an attractive black girl that didn't really do much. She maintained decent grades, had a tangible social circle, and had even dated a couple of different guys in her time at the school, but to most, she was just a pretty face in a crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A friend of mine did something bad. Like really bad. And I don't know if I should tell someone who can do something about it, or just let everything go on like nothing never happened and hope she doesn't make a habit of it.\" Victoria said, absent mindedly playing with her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she's your friend don't rat her out. Unless she like murdered someone or something.\" Jess said, eyes on her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Victoria started, speaking quietly. Jess looked up from her work and met her roommate's gaze. About three seconds passed before a knock was heard on the door. Jess slowly got to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it.\" she said in a contemplating voice. Jess opened the door to find a tall, utterly gorgeous tan woman with piercing green eyes, a head of luscious shoulder length black hair, c-cup breasts, a remarkably athletic body, and an ass that many woman would kill for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ja - Jennifer!\" Victoria said startled, getting to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Vicky.\" Jennifer said, her voice dripping with malignancies. She walked into the room, closing the door behind her as Jess moved out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wa -What are you doing here?\" Victoria said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only what I have to.\" Jennifer said, approaching Victoria with malignant purpose, her back turned to Jess, who reasoned Jennifer was the person Victoria was talking about. She reached her hand back to her desk and grabbed hold of a metal three-hole-punch. Raising it over her head, she took a step forward and swung as hard as she could at the woman's head, closing her eyes as she swings out of fear. Slowly, she opens her eyes to see...</span></div></div>",

The black girl opened her eyes and with a gasp wound up for another swing, but Jennifer made a move. Grabbing her arm with her right arm, and the cuff of her shirt with her left, she drew the girl in close and kneed her in the stomach, a loud \"oohmph\" was heard. Next Jennifer ripped down with her left arm, tearing Jess' shirt and bra off in one quick motion, exposing the girl's small breasts. Then Jennifer released her hold and punched her victim in the gut as hard as she could, causing Jess to collapse, retching noises exuding from her. Jennifer than squatted down and removed Jess' shoes and socks, before grabbing hold of her pants and pulling them off her. Now Jennifer reached for her panties, a feeble hand trying to stop her squatted away as she pulled them off. Jennifer than hoisted the African woman to her shaky feet and used each hand to grab a cheek of her sizable ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer! Stop! Please!\" Victoria pleaded from behind her, but her beautiful friend hoisted Jess to arm's length, hitting her head against the ceiling, and placed her feet in her mouth. She swallowed, Jess' calves going in easy from the lubrication provided by the saliva Jennifer's body built up in anticipation. Jess regained her senses as Jennifer swallowed again, bringing her into Jennifer halfway up her thighs. Jess tried to move her arms to fight back, but Jennifer was as quick as a striking cobra, moving her grip from Jess' ass to her arms, where she pinned them by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please no, oh god no!\" Jess shouted as Jennifer engulfed her up to her waist. The dark haired beauty swallowed again, moving Jess' ass into her throat, and again, moving her abdomen and hands into her eager gullet. Jess' taste was marvelous, albeit not as good as Meghan's, but Jennifer swallowed hard regardless, consuming Jess' arms and chest. It was at this point that Victoria ran at Jennifer, to help Jess, to attack her, she did not know, nor did she find out, as she whipped about with a flurry, catching her friend's chin with a right hook that sent her sprawling. Jennifer turned her attention back to her screaming meal and swallowed again; only Jess' head was not in her esophagus, instead it sat entirely in Jennifer's mouth, the once screaming girl now crying. Jennifer walked in front of a mirror on the wall to show Jess herself. When she saw, she began crying louder, but went quite when Jennifer stroked her face and put a single finger over her mouth. When she stopped, Jennifer patted her on the head and swallowed, sending the sniffling girl down to her doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrrrrrrrrrp!\" Jennifer burped, her jaw opening and moving a bit to the right. She looked at Victoria sprawled on the ground, and deciding that she would deal with her friend in private, before the wave of euphoria she once felt surfaced once more. Jennifer moaned and screamed for the next thirty seconds as her body turned Jess into nutrients with an audible sizzle. Then the sphincter separating Jennifer's stomach and small intestine opened as the soup that was once a person drained in. Jennifer knew what came next, so she clenched her fist and slightly lifted her right leg, and when she felt the urge, a massive fart exploded from her massive yoga pants clad rear. With a sigh of relief, she walked over to Victoria's unconscious body and began to undress it. As Jennifer removed her friend's bra she found her gaze unbroken on Victoria's breasts. Snapping out of it, she removed her pants and underwear before once again finding herself in unbroken concentration staring at her friend's toned rear. Jennifer hoisted Victoria onto her bed, and tied her to the posts with her and Jess' clothes before leaving the room, Jess telling her she's ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer ran into the lavatory, removed her pants and underwear in one quick movement and jumped onto the bowl rear first. This time she had a much easier time relieving herself; it seemed the Meghan had stretched her out. In about two minutes, the roughly Jess sized turd found its way out of Jennifer and into the sewer system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh Jennifer pulled up her pants and walked back into Victoria's room. Victoria was conscious and looked at her friend with sad eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenn, I'm not going to fight you, I know I couldn't win, and I know I couldn't convince you to not do what your about to do to me. I'm sorry I said that I would betray you like that, but I don't take back what I said.\" Her eyes quivered slightly and several small tears ran down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vicky...\" Jennifer started, but Victoria looked up at her and said in a quite voice, \"But before we're together forever, I want to be with you once. I've been attracted to you since we were girls, and I always knew you thought the same about me. I'm okay with being a slab of meat for you, but please, just this one thing, for an old friend.\" she finished with a smile. </span></div></div>",

Breasts and ass bouncing slightly with each step, Jennifer moved over to the bed and untied Victoria before kissing her passionately with desire pent up from her youth. She returned the kiss and grabbed hold of her companion's rear she valued so highly, before Jennifer did the same to her. Victoria gasped as an errant finger found it's way into her vagina and moaned when another one did as well. After a minute of this, Jennifer withdrew her fingers and moved herself down Victoria's body, her head in her crotch, where she than attacked her friend's genitalia with her mouth. Victoria cooed and moaned as Jennifer continued, screaming at the moment of climax. Next, Victoria assumed the position on Jennifer, railing her as best as she could, Jennifer screamed the whole time and shrieked when she came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus the two continued for an hour, switched who pleasured whom and kissing passionately in between those times, until both, satisfied, collapsed on the bed simultaneously. Panting, Victoria looked over to Jennifer, her brown curls matted to her hair with sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should have done that years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we should have.\" Jennifer said, face glistening as though she had just emerged from a pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you.\" Victoria whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Jennifer choked, realizing how she felt about her friend,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, I know, we've both known all this time.\" Victoria said before she turned her gaze to her lover's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it hurt?\" The brunette asked in a timid voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes.\" Jennifer said, unable to lie to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" There was a moment of silence between the two, they locked eyes and held each other until slowly Jennifer brought her face close to Victoria's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" Jennifer kissed Victoria softly, her mouth slowly expanding until Victoria's head was in Jennifer's mouth. She swallowed, and her lovers shoulders were brought to her mouth. She swallowed again, her breasts inside Jennifer's mouth. Again, Victoria's naval was brought to her maw. Jennifer started to cry. Another swallow engulfed Victoria's abdomen. Jennifer brought her love's rear into herself with another gulp. Two more swallows brought in the last of Victoria's body. Jennifer felt the last bit of Her travel through her esophagus and inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp.\" she proclaimed unhappily. Jennifer had never tasted anything as delicious as Victoria, and was sure she never would again. There was another moment of silence before she heard her stomach begin to churn. She lay on her back, watching the beach ball of flesh that was once her friend. It was still at first, but after a few seconds, that unmistakable sizzle began and it began to convulse. Jennifer could here Victoria screaming inside of her, and she began to scream as well from this irreplaceable feeling of euphoria. Both shrieked, one in pain and one in pleasure, but for both, it was over in half a minute. The orb in her gut was a fifth of size as it traveled deeper into her. Pressure from Victoria built up in her, and with a moment of delay, Jennifer released it. It smelt foul. Holding back tears, Jennifer walked into the bathroom and plopped  herself down on the seat. With two pathfinders before her, Victoria's passage was the easiest yet physically. With a final grunt, Jennifer released her friend from the body that so cruelly destroyed her. Forcing herself to look at what she had done to the only person she had ever loved, Jennifer cried. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Several notifications from her various apps were displayed on the screen along with a text message from Dave that read \"Hey Jenn, I'm in the room when you get back, how was dinner?\" Sighing, she disabled the device's lock screen and wrote back \"Okay. Be there soon.\" Taking one last look in the room, Jennifer breathed deep and left the room, closing the door behind her. She left the building through an auxiliary staircase and thrusted open a door. Outside was mild and the wind swept through the fallen leaves as the sun set.

Her shocked face was an attractive one, and even though she attempted to cover them up, Jennifer could easily tell she was well endowed, her d-cup breasts spilling out of her hands.

A third time. A fourth. Jennifer saw that her boyfriend was starting to lag behind, which was a surprise to her, as he normally drank her under the table. The American Footballer struggled his way through three more shots, which Jennifer finished with ease. Odd given how she typically was smashed by shot five, but she felt perfectly fine. As the gorgeous woman finished her eighth, Dave swaggered and swayed, before admitting his defeat. Jennifer finished his drink and looked over to the third member of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Melinda!\" Jennifer called out to the barely clothed woman who had been watching from the bed. \"Come over here, and give me a run, I'm not even buzzed yet!\" Jennifer called, her sorrow forgotten in the spur of the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist.\" Melinda said, getting up from the bed and grabbing the chair Dave had just risen from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter six volleys, Melinda too admitted defeat, slowly getting to her feet.

This was an act of disrespect and disregard for her, she had never thought much of Dave past his body, but for him to do this to her? Regardless of how the night carried out, she was done with these two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer thought for a minute before she looked up.

I fucked up and It'll never happen again!\" Dave slurred out, stripping naked in about twelve seconds. Melinda too hurriedly got to her swaying feet, undoing her bra and peeling off her panties. Both started for Jennifer, but Melinda got to her first. The two made out for a moment before Jennifer lifted the shorter woman up effortlessly by her admittingly small rear, until their breasts touched. Then, as Dave neared the two, he watched the pretty head of his girlfriend open wider and wider, until she leaned forward and clamped down on the back of Melinda's neck. Jennifer swallowed rhythmically and pushed upwards on Melinda's ass, engulfing her in a continuous motion. Dave watched in awe as Jennifer gulped down Melinda's rear and slurped in her legs. All that remained of Melinda was a beach-ball sized orb in a gorgeous woman's exposed naval; the drunk Italian girl never had a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrrrrrrrrrp.\" Jennifer belched, her back arched and a hand on her stomach. She did her best to stop her digestion, but admittingly Jennifer didn't pay much attention when Professor Blainey was going over the subject, so with an uncertain amount of time on her prey's life, she turned to a very shocked Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-\" Dave started before Jennifer seductively put a single finger over his lips and shushed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dave?\" Jennifer propositioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y - yeah?\" Dave replied, voice quivering. He felt scared and aroused, but mostly he felt confused about what he just watched his girlfriend do to his mistress. Jennifer locked eyes with him with one of her soul-piercing glares she managed so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were a decent fuck.\" There was a moment of tension before Jennifer shot forth and grabbed Dave. She was by far quicker than the drunk athlete, and somehow, with the nutrients of what was once three people coursing through her veins, she was stronger than the large man. After a brief struggle, Jennifer engulfed her ex-boyfriend's head and swallowed. Dave struggled, but he was of no compare to this devouring machine of a woman. He yelled, but the sound never escaped Jennifer's depths. He once more admitted defeat to his lover and submitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brapppppppp.\" exuded Jennifer. her gut was the size of a volleyball and a half. She sat on her bed and released the control she maintained on her digestion. Her stomach began visibly churning as the feeling of intense jubilation returned. She began masturbating as the size of the orb fifthed in size, cumming whilst she farted the gas produced during digestion out of her. As the two began to fizzle away into Jennifer's bloodstream, she stood up and entered her own bathroom. Hoping it contoured to the shape of her excrement as per the other toilets she had used on campus, she plopped herself down and followed the progress of her meal through her, opening one final sphincter to let the two cheaters take a last trip together whilst she spewed forth the volume of piss that had once been their blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thirty seconds of exertion, Jennifer stood up and looked upon what she had created. She had melted the two into one solid mass, some features of their desiccated corpses still noticeable, such as their heads, which somehow maintained their general shapes. Jennifer looked onto Dave's and Melinda's devastated remains and actually found herself aroused. She had turned these people into... her. Her boyfriend Dave, his mistress Melinda, the supposed \"vore expert\" Meghan, Victoria's roommate Jess, even her beloved Victoria herself. They were now all just pieces of the equation that added up into Jennifer. She wiped herself and sent her most recent victims sprawling toward the sewers. Jennifer stretched and looked at herself in the mirror. She patted her stomach, saying \"Thanks for your help with those two, they were real assholes.\" She began walking away before she caught a glimpse of her sizable rear. \"Oh, and of course you too.\" She said with a chuckle, smacking her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer than layed down on her bed and pleasured herself once more to the knowledge that there was now five others trapped inside her skin. After she finished, cumming into Dave's discarded shirt, Jennifer stood up and walked over to the table. Taking the half empty bottle of whiskey, she chugged it in three seconds flat. Next she grabbed Dave's six pack and drank the contents of each can with a speed to make a frat-boy jealous. Belching loudly, Jennifer climbed into bed nude, pulled up her sheets and patted her stomach, saying \"I feel today was the first of a very enjoyable relationship between you and me.\" the booze finally kicking in. Her stomach gurgled in response. \"I know your hungry, I'm hungry too, let's wait until morning, and than we'll have ourselves a grand old time, deal?\" After a moment of silence Jennifer smiled to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\"</span></div></div>",

Killed her.\" A wave of rekindled emotion flooded over Jennifer. She choked her guilt back, repeating a personal mantra; \"No point in crying over the past, only in looking towards the future.\" She took a deep breath and headed towards a case of bottled water she kept in the room. Taking a bottle and drinking it, she continued: \"Then I came back here, and that chick from my Pre-Calc class... Melinda...

It was 9:14 and she had an essay due in her English class on Wednesday. As she began to surf through her social media pages, Jennifer felt her stomach curdle in hunger. She reached for a banana on her desk, but looking at the fruit, she found it incredibly unappealing. Her stomach rumbled again as she conjured a mental image of what her body craved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Jennifer said, looking to her stomach. \"Well, you're in luck, I'm in the mood for the same thing. But where to for breakfast? She could always walk about campus, perusing and choosing between the university's population. Or, she thought, there's a wing of eight decently nerdy guys two floors up, they could be easy to convince to allow them into their rooms, given her aesthetics.

She put on a tight black shirt with fabric missing in the chest and pushed her breasts up, to show off as much of her sizable cleavage as possible, and a pair of skin-tight yoga pants. Slipping into a pair of stringless shoes, she left her room and started towards the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerging on the fifth floor, she headed in the direction her memory told her the collection lived, down the hallway on her right. The hallway split into a smaller passageway, with four adjacent doors conforming around the shape of the building's corner. A fifth door presumably led to a communal bathroom, as unlike Jennifer's more expensive floor, the people on this floor shared a bathroom to every wing. Jennifer noticed to keycard lock on the bathroom as she read the room numbers. 502, that seemed right. Walking up to the door, Jennifer knocked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several seconds, the door opened, revealing a thin, pale, not exactly attractive man dressed in a high quality wool turtleneck. He wore his brown hair close to his head and smelt like cologne. Past him, Jennifer could see a slightly overweight Hispanic kid sitting in a collapsible lawn chair, video game controller in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, hi.\" The thin man said, not too subtly looking at Jennifer's breasts. \"What do you uhh, need?\" he said, gaze jerking awkwardly back to Jennifer's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Jennifer started, looking the person up and down before looking him in the eyes, smiling slightly and biting her lip suggestively. \"This is kinda weird, but me and my ex were having an argument, and I was looking for an outside opinion. Can I come in?\" Jennifer asked, moving past him into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, sure!\" he said with a smile. \"I was in a couple relationships where we were having issues too, so my experience is your knowledge.\" he added, closing the door. The Hispanic man shot up to his feet, grabbed a nearby remote controller, and turned off the television. He looked like he had skipped a day of showering and hadn't groomed himself in a while, a dark neck-beard forming beneath his disheveled black hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh?\" he emoted questioningly towards his roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look you two,\" Jennifer started, fluctuating gaze between the two individuals. \"This is going to seem sudden, but just go with me.\" She turned around a removed the thin kid's turtleneck. With a noise of puerile glee, his hands fumbled for his belt as he started removing his pants, already growing hard. The Hispanic man hesitated before he too removed his clothing, pants first than shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood in boxers, both with erections and anxious faces, as they shot a look of excitement to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thanks for the help, I really needed this.\" Jennifer said, turning around. She grabbed the thinner of the the two and pulled him in close, opening her mouth wide. She lurched forward and engulfed his head in one smooth motion, muffled cries of shock still audible. The larger man recoiled with a cry as the woman before him lifted his roommate into the air until he was directly above her, and releasing her grip, let the boy slide into her mouth and down her throat effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp.\" She softly belched, looking over to the other man. \"I hope your game was fun.\" Jennifer said motioning towards the television. And with that she leapt forward at the boy, easily overwhelming and consuming him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe belched softly and looked down to her gut, both hiding and attempting to stop her digestion, as she didn't want to be in the middle of something when these two came knocking. It looked like she had swallowed a medicine ball, much smaller than she had looked previously when she swallowed someone. Her body was adjusting fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer rifled through her meal's discarded clothes, coming up with 43 dollars that she slid into her pant's pocket. She left the room and knocked on the adjacent one. A tall, fat,unkempt man answered the door. He had long brown hair in desperate need of bathing and wore a black shirt with a exaggerated skull on it with a pair of gray sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" he said, greasy brunette hair matted to his like-wise greasy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm RA Jennifer, I just took over on the third floor, and I thought I'd go about and introduce myself. Can I come in?\" she said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes wandered to her breasts, than her hips, and finally her protruding stomach as he moved to the side, extending his arm into the room. \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was an obviously unkempt room, with discarded bags of chips and energy drinks strewn about. On the top bunk of the bed, a small Asian man slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind him, his name is Max, kid could sleep through a parade. Now, what did you want?\" the large man asked, shutting the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer responded by wheeling about and kicking him in the gut as hard as she could. He doubled over with a cry of pain as Jennifer grabbed him by the waist of his sweat legs and pulled his legs out from under him. She ripped off his pants and tossed them to the side before grabbing his feet and placing them in her mouth. She swallowed thrice before the screaming man's head dissipated into her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jon, you want to knock that-\" Came from behind her. Turning about, Jennifer saw the Asian man groggily looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" he said sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urppp.\" was all she managed before she sprang at him, grabbing him by his leg off the bed and into her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really that important in the end.\" Jennifer said to her now two-football sized gut. She searched the room and came out with 27 dollars before heading to the next door over. She knocked, quietly belching off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA black man answered, he wore frizzy black hair some two inches off his head and a pair of clear framed glasses. He wore an unadorned grey hoody and a pair of cargo pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's up?\" he asked, leaning around the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, is your roommate home?\" Jennifer questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, hold on.\" As he turned around to yell to his roommate, Jennifer bulled into the door, knocking the man to the ground. She stumbled but managed to maintain her balance. Inside was a fairly standard room with not much adjusted from how it looked when its inhabitants arrived. A average looking white man sat a desk, laptop in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, what's this?!\" he yelled. Jennifer slammed the door shut with her foot and pounced on him, sucking him upwards from his sat position on his chair into her maw in several seconds, tearing off his pants as they got close to her. Turning around, Jennifer saw the black kid stumbling to his feet. Pivoting on her left foot, she kicked the man in his chin, causing him to fall to the ground with an \"oomph\" before she pulled off his pants and engulfed him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room yielded 64 dollars as Jennifer searched with her volleyball sized gut impeding her progress. Satisfied with her thoroughness, Jennifer proceeded to the final door and knocked. A shirtless average sized white man opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Jennifer said, shifting uncomfortably from leg to leg \"Can you open the bathroom for me?\" She looked down to her belly. \"Damn kid makes it so I have to - bruuuuup.\" she belched before continuing \"pee every ten minutes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, sure.\" The man said, reaching into his pocket and producing a keycard. \"Just slide this through the lock and you should be good.\" He continued, holding the card out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Jennifer said, grabbing the card with her left hand and the man's head with her right. In a quick movement, Jennifer turned facing the wall and slammed his head into the frame of the door, an audible sound of impact produced. Blood strewed out of his forehead as Jennifer gulped down his unconscious body in some five seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing open the door, Jennifer saw a Pacific Islander looking man and an Asian woman sitting on opposite ends of the room. The man was handsome and tanned with long black hair and had sizable muscles observable underneath his t-shirt as the woman was likewise athletic and had an attractive face, but a rather flat body. She wore her black hair in a bob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth looked surprised as Jennifer opened the door, and she wasted no time; she moved over to the surprised man and grabbed hold of the lapels of his shirt before engulfing his head and drawing him inside of her in a few scant seconds. She looked up at the Asian woman smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then there was one.\" Jennifer said, approaching her slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" the girl started, \"Don't. You don't need to do this.\" she said quivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well logically, I kind of do.\" Jennifer said, absent mindedly playing with a couple of nearby items. \"You see, I'm hungry. I don't want to be hungry I can stop being hungry by having you in me. Whether you live or die is not something I'm going to concern myself with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about my brother, Max? What did you do to him?\" the girl asked, despair in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp.\" Jennifer answered with a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was born with a terrible disease, he wasn't supposed to live past five.\" the Asian woman started, tears welling up in her eyes. \"His successes in life made our parents so happy... And you just would rip him away so violently? You're a cruel woman, my parents will be destroyed.\" she concluded, looking away into nothingness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I would. And if you don't want your parents to be so sad, tell me where they live, and I'll reunite you four.\" Jennifer said cooly. After a moment of silence, the girl looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They live on 25 Harbour Street, this town. Please don't let them now what you've done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll never know their name died inside of me.\" Jennifer said, approaching the girl. \"Strip down, you'll taste better clothes-less.\" she said eyeing the girl up. Sobbing softly, she complied, removing all of her clothing before prostrating herself before Jennifer, shivering.</span></div></div>",

After a few seconds, multiple cries of agony emerged from deep within her and she collapsed onto the floor, the feelings of euphoria so intense she could do little save breathe and convulse. She tried to think about her next course of action, but the animalistic pleasure she felt cancelled out any rationality she might have had. So she lay on the floor in heaven for some three minutes, unable to do anything save enjoy the ride. When the feelings at last subsided, Jennifer struggled to her feet. She was breathing heavily and sweating profusely, but she felt so... whole. She started for the door before she had the urge to fart, which she did for about fifteen straight seconds, the maelstrom inside her producing a lot more gas than she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer swiped the keycard and entered the bathroom, the traveling mass inside her about half way through its journey. She swallowed the card and walked into a stall, peeling her yoga pants and her underwear off her legs, as they had been slightly adhered to her skin from her sweat. Jennifer sat down and spread her cheeks apart a bit in anticipation. When the moment came, Jennifer clutched and wiggled and pushed, dropping an about 700 kilo mass and a geyser of piss after some four minutes of struggling. Sighing with relief, Jennifer stood and cleaned herself. Looking to the massive thing that was nine desiccated corpses fused into one, Jennifer grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it as good for you guys as it was for me?\" she said with a chuckle to herself before flushing. Jennifer pulled up her pants and washed her hands. Stepping out of the bathroom, she patted her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, was that good enough for you, you're highness?\" When Jennifer heard a gurgle in response along with returning hunger, she rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist.\"</span></div></div>",

Birds sung and light gusts of wind rustled the leaves as she continued, and the consistent hum of automobiles was ever present.

Panting, she looked up to the figure before her. The woman smirked and met her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe I've never come that close to defeat before.\" She said in a voice that slightly sounded of the American south. \"Tell me your name.

The girl was hard as rock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going down swinging? I respect that. You are truly a memorable individual.\" She grabbed Jennifer's ring finger and pulled it backwards. It snapped with a sickening noise. Jennifer screamed. \"Now tell me your name.\" the black woman reiterated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer.

Jennifer marveled at the size of her killer's belly for a moment before she noticed the colour of the liquid about her was slowly changing to a bright pink. Confused, she watched as the pink liquid slowly encroached on the area around her. When the liquid she was trending in turned, Jennifer died instantaneously, her body dissolving in a millisecond before her head fell in and dissolved as well. The sphincter to Jacqueline's intestines opened, and the sea of pink that Jennifer was lost in drained away.</span></div></div>",

She bent a bit forward and pissed, a thick stream that persisted for some thirty seconds before the urge subsided. The ground about her for some two metres was mud from the urine, but this was nothing new for Jacqueline, it wasn't like this was her first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had used a different method of digestion for Jennifer; it was one that turned the victim's body into a liquid and allowed the intestines to absorb them almost fully. It caused a lot more energy to be absorbed from digestion, but it also took about as much energy to produce the liquid as one would get from fully digesting about a hundred people. Because of this, as a general rule of thumb, Jacqueline never used this method unless she was simultaneously processing at least a hundred people, but she felt that she owed that much to Jennifer, as she reminded her that she was still mortal. She was going to have to refill her deficit again because of this though. Sighing and thinking of different locations where she could make a hundred people disappear, she started back towards the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline wasn't even hungry as it was, having just cleared out near 250 people inside the park deciding to treat herself to a large lunch, leaving the shit she turned those men, woman, and children into at the bottom of a nearby lake before starting through the woods, but having used the method that she used to consume Jennifer, she was sure the energy she got from the park attendee's deaths was already gone. But she wasn't worried, she never had a problem getting a meal before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline was twenty five years old, and was something of an urban legend. She had subsisted on adult humans since she was three, her first meal being her father and pregnant mother. She spent the next two years in an orphanage and slept in one of the place's common halls with 29 other children, but to those who ran the establishment's perpetual wonder and anger, come morning, Jacqueline was always alone. Orphans were shoveled unknowingly into her child-sized stomach day after day, until she turned five, when she went off to elementary school. Her first day in class, Jacqueline got bored and sent her teacher and screaming classmates on a one way trip to the toilet. Jacqueline arrived back to the orphanage on an empty bus, having clumsily guided it herself. Deciding that she was done with the orphanage, she spent the rest of that day hunting down and devouring the two hundred orphans and twenty staff members. Then the next day, she did the same at her school, and the next day she took to the town. In a week, not a single denizen of Jacqueline's home town had managed to escape her hunger, and she left in search of more prey. Newspapers across the south printed stories of how some two thousand people just disappeared in a town at the base of the Appalachians. A week later, they published a similar story regarding the disappearance of a hundred and fifty from a nearby thorp. A week after that, the disappearance of five hundred more. Every week, Jacqueline gave the press another story, as the nation looked on in fearful bewilderment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jacqueline grew, her appetite followed, a normal meal for her consisting of a small town's population. Her supposed presence (which was determined only after several thousand were already gone) caused mass hysteria and sparked en masse emigrations from areas where people thought she might turn up. Spiritual men claimed that the disappearances were the cause of God's wrath, as conspiracy theorists spoke of government propagated mass killings to push the nation towards totalitarianism through fear. She was personally responsible for the murder and cannibalization of some 11 million disappearances in the American South and personally halved the population of her home state of West Virginia. Jacqueline was born to consume, and played to her destiny well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline had never attended university, but a researcher at the nearby school, Professor Hawthorne, had heard of her capabilities and had asked her to fly up from the American southeast to provide field testing and data regarding a story she had heard through the grapevine. Apparently, in a medium sized town in the state, a thirteen year old girl had swallowed and digested a school bus and the hundred or so children on it whole, and Hawthorne wanted to see if the story held any credit. So she found Jacqueline, considered by anyone who knew of her existence to be one of the greatest \"vorists\" in the United States, if not the world, via hear-say and friends of friends who knew a guy. Jacqueline had never attempted to swallow something as large as a bus before, and was intrigued by the notion. She was eager to try, and having a team working behind you always made things much easier, so she agreed to take the trip, arriving in the city's airport in a suspiciously empty plane. Providing her with a schedule of the bus stops around the city and a map of where they stopped, Hawthorne asked Jacqueline to recreate the story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, Jacqueline would confirm that the urban legend indeed held some credibility, as she had consumed two high school buses, a city line bus, and four elementary school buses for her breakfast yesterday, some 650 people and 94000 kilos of steel. In addition, she ingested 3 more high school buses for lunch, and 6 city line for her dinner. It was the first time she had felt full in quite some time, and if she could stomach 7 buses at once, it was defiantly in the realm of possibility that someone half her age could eat one. She was one her way to confirm the story with Professor Hawthorne when she had ran into Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving returned to the path, Jacqueline...</span></div></div>",

Curious, she bent over and picked it up. It was an iron tetrahedron with a two centimetre spike at every point where two bars intersected. She had heard of this before, it was called a caltrop a tool designed to be stepped on by passerby to impede their movement by impaling their foot. Looking down near where she found the spike, she noticed a clear path through the tall grass that led behind a nearby tree, some fifty feet away. Having spent much of her childhood in the woods of West Virginia, Jacqueline looked at the shape and size of the path through the unkempt grass, and determined that two children had pasted through here, presumably after leaving the caltrop. She started down the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jacqueline approached the tree, she could hear the two. They were breathing shallowly and quivering, the sound of fabric on bark audible to Jacqueline's heightened senses. Only about ten feet from the tree now, Jacqueline could smell them. A hint of Old Spice deodorant on one, and the smell of Head and Shoulders shampoo on the other, however, they both smelled of fear. She walked closer, only about five feet from the tree. There was a hiccup in their breathing, a signature of the human respiratory Jacqueline learned at a young age; they were about to take off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline broke into a full sprint before the two could start to run. Yelling in fear as she rounded the tree, both tried to get away, but Jacqueline grabbed each with one of her arms and hauled them into her maw simultaneously at a breakneck speed before swallowing them down. She pulled her pants down and bent forward. After a moment, Jacqueline clenched, and a single turd, about the size of two children shot out of her sizable ass, landing three metres away.

This city was a veritable metropolis, with a population of about four million, so the probability of 100 souls being in relatively close proximity to each other is practically guaranteed. Voices up ahead, sounds like two adults and a child. Maybe she could find another bus, she did have a map of all of their routes. The group came into line of sight, a blonde woman, a brunette man, and a blonde boy, all Caucasian, 100 metres away. She could head to the beaches, the city was famous for its shore-fronts and infamous for how densely populated they were, but it was quite some distance to the beaches, maybe 13 kilometres. The three were ten metres away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afternoon.\" the man said as Jacqueline approached. She responded by opening her mouth and engulfing the man's head. Her left hand grabbed the woman and her right the child. She swallowed once, sending the man shooting into her before she hoisted the woman and the boy into her maw and swallowed. The three did not even recognize that they were under attack before Jacqueline's stomach turned them into an aqueous paste flowing into her intestines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, there was always the university Jacqueline thought as she took a step off the path, pulled down her pants, and casually shat out the family as a single mass, all while still standing. Hawthorne had never said that the students were off the menu, and she was heading there anyway. One lecture hall full of students could hold her for a couple of hours. And besides, Jacqueline reasoned while pulling up her pants and resuming her jog, you don't pack two hundred people into one room at a university that teaches students how to eat people without eventually expecting something terrible to happen to them.

She wouldn't have to worry about running any stragglers down. She felt her appetite returning to her already as she crossed the street into the university. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline had initially planned to stuff herself silly on the students after she and Hawthorne concluded their work, but after her encounter with Jennifer, she was a bit incredulous of her plan. Jennifer was obviously new at vore, and she had almost been her end. What if another, more experienced woman got the drop on her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline was positive she was stronger than anyone in the university, nay, the country, as strength increased exponentially with the amount one consumed and there were only four other woman in the world with a body count to match her own, but Jennifer had proven to her that if she left herself open for too long, it wouldn't matter how strong she was. The university was well known for teaching vore, so logically, a comparatively large percentage of the campus' population would be capable, and Jacqueline felt a bit unsure that she could successfully devour hundreds of these women before one got lucky. It would probably be better to stick to areas less likely to contain a large number of vore capable women when she decided she was going to gorge herself, which would take about 3000 people to accomplish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree men in a field playing frisbee, on her left. Jacqueline started towards the men, while simultaneously reminding herself of the four who had eaten as many people as she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first and only one she had met was a Swedish woman by the name of Astrid Odensdottir, an imposing thirty year old woman at 190 centimetres tall. She had shoulder length hair the colour of gold, massive DD-cup breasts, and athletic, muscle toned body, and an ass that made her an object of lust. She was several steps above gorgeous and has been known to be wanton, often sleeping with as many as a dozen men and women a day, if rumors could be believed. Astrid hunted throughout Europe, and is credited with the cannibalization of 13 million. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven years ago, Jacqueline had set her gaze on the state of Virginia for her new hunting grounds, she had been in the state for a week and had eaten about 10000 denizens. The next stop on her tour was a decently large town by the name of Clifton Forge. The town had a population of 4000, and Jacqueline was eager to gorge herself on the townspeople, sure that when she cleared the town out, people would start to flee the state in fear. But when she arrived, she found only empty buildings and human-sized turds throughout the streets. She carried on for awhile before she found Astrid waiting in the town's centre. She had heard of Jacqueline's spree throughout the south, and was interested in formally recognizing her as one of the world's most talented vorists, so she had predicted where Jacqueline would next turn up, and got to Clifton Forge that morning, before she would arrive, using the population as breakfast. Then, Astrid offered to sleep with Jacqueline as some sort of initiation rite. Jacqueline hesitated, as she was not only a virgin, but was not particularly attracted to either sex, but decided she would. Astrid was a skilled lover, and Jacqueline enjoyed the sensation, but after she was finished, she still felt nothing for Astrid, and it didn't feel as good as eating a few hundred people at once. So, with disappointment on her words, Astrid told Jacqueline of the other women she had recognized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail Farren was a twenty two year old brunette English woman, with a body similar to Astrid's, although she was only about 175 centimetres tall. She too was impossibly attractive, there are several stories of young Englishmen engaging in fatal duels to win her attention in her youth. Out of all the others she described, Astrid spoke of Abigail as the most sympathetic, she was even known to have several friends she regularly conversed with. Abigail had been a late bloomer, not discovering she was vore-capable until the age of sixteen, when she accidentally swallowed her best friend. Shortly thereafter, consumed with hunger, she devoured the entire populace of her hometown of Newbridge. Then, according to Astrid, her father found her crying alone in their house, having just devoured her mother and her two younger sisters. He sent her to India so the British authorities wouldn't find her, and she's remained there since, pleasing her hunger on some 9 million Indian men, women, and children over the past six years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChao-xing Li was the third, and a bit more typical of a story than any of the others, despite being far beyond them in terms of body count. She was a twenty-three year old black haired Chinese woman, with large D-cup breasts, a taut athletic body, and the ass of a model. She too could turn heads a kilometre away by virtue of her attractiveness, but she stood at a minuscule 145 centimetres tall. Chao-xing had found she was vore-capable at the age of eight when she swallowed her brother during a play-wrestle match. From there on, Chao-xing became a monster, devouring cities in a day. When she was eighteen, she embarked on a campaign that ruined China's economy and infrastructure for years to come. At the beginning of every week, she would find a city at the end of a railway, devour its populace, and then take the train to the next town and doing the same to it, before she reached the end of the line, where she would find her way to another railroad and start again. Following this, the Chinese government launched a massive campaign to find and kill her, so Chao-xing was forced to flee to country. She moved to India, becoming one of Abigail Farren's close friends, and eating with more fervency then she ever had before. She is responsible for 36 million deaths, 27 million in China, and the rest in India.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final member of the ensemble was a 34 year old Brazilian woman by the name of Fernanda Torres. She stands at 160 centimetres with shoulder length black hair, C-cup breasts, an athletic body, and an ass that could drive the most docile monk into a rage of lust. While still incredibly attractive, she isn't as much so as Chao-xing, Abigail, or Astrid. She holds a doctorate in both history and world languages from the university of Sao Paulo. Like Jacqueline, vore came naturally to Fernanda, who devoured her first victim, an inattentive babysitter, at the age of three. Fernanda is a veritable globe trekker, and claims to have devoured a hundred thousand people from every country on the Earth, excluding those countries with less than a hundred thousand, whom she just devoured the whole populace. In addition, Torres has an odd fetish of devouring everyone who knows a particular language, as to kill it inside of her. So far, she has spent twelve years on these efforts and has had 34 languages die inside of her, mostly the language of estranged Afrikaani tribes, although, much to Astrid's dismay, she is currently attempting to kill the Icelandic language as well, and has spent the past two years digesting all non-Icelandic speakers of the language out in the world, landing in the country last month to scour the country of its population, planing to have fully ingested all 323000 people before this month is over. She is responsible for some 31 million deaths across the world, but mostly in Brazil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline held out her hand and called out, still approaching the three. One of them looked to her and threw her the frisbee. She caught it and threw it at the furthest away player as hard as she can. It hit him in the throat and he fell to the ground, clutching his neck and making choking noises. She then dashed forward, grabbed the nearest player, and swallowed him in less than a second. The second player looked to the man rolling on the ground and then at Jacqueline before he took off, but Jacqueline took off behind him. He was nowhere near as fast as she was, so he too was sent sprawling towards Jacqueline's stomach. She then walked over to the fallen man. She scooped him up and ate him in one fluid motion before she pulled down her pants and defecated three human sized turds. Pulling her pants back up she looked around, there was no one to see her, and although her prey's desiccated remains would be found in minutes, she would be long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering how Fernanda was fairing in Iceland, Jacqueline started towards Curie Memorial Hall, where a Engineering lecture would be taking place, if Jacqueline overheard some girl she had ate yesterday correctly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jacqueline walked towards Curie Memorial Hall, having memorized a layout of the campus on the plane trip over. Her mind flashed to that torturous trip. It was the first time in her life she had not devoured a person immediately upon seeing them, let alone the nearly 700 aboard for the eight hour flight. She was ecstatic once the moment of catharsis had finally arrived. She became a whirlwind the moment the vehicle touched the ground, her enhanced physiology giving the the ability to consume at rates that would be considered impossible by conventional logic. She remembered her thoughts fading as she flew from this piece of meat to that one as her hunter's high took over her. She remembered her consciousness returning to her as she stood belching at the end of the plane. She remembered the feeling of the 700 men women and children being atomized within her. She remembered the sensation as her intestines absorbed every single portion of matter of those unfortunate enough to be within her proximity. She remembered the lengthy fart she had cut as she walked towards the exit, the only thing remaining in her digestive tract the air in her food's lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline autonomously pulled her pants down and released a gout of shit onto the sidewalk. She looked for a second at the pile. By her count, five people. She didn't even notice that she had ate them. With a shrug, she rounded a corner and after a quick walk, threw open the door to Curie Memorial Hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo small women stood in front of her. In one step, she swallowed them both, and the next, she shat them out. Jacqueline was pretty sure she would of found the student filled lecture hall even if she didn't know where it was; she could smell them already, despite the fact that they were two floors above her. After a minute and ten more people turned into feces, Jacqueline threw open the door to the room. As she beheld the 400 students focused on a lengthy packet before them, she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan looked towards the door instinctively. A black woman stood in the frame. She was absolutely gorgeous, and had one of the best asses he had ever seen. He wondered how he had missed seeing her in class before as he looked back to his test. \"Find the shear force of X\" the question read. He studied the free body diagram for a moment before a clamor caused him to look past the crowd before him and towards the front of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe... wasn't sure he could describe what he was seeing. The beautiful black woman was moving row to row at the speed of a sports car. Where ever she crossed, anyone nearby... disappeared? No, they weren't disappearing, he could see a blur of colors in between where they were sat and the woman's mouth. It was then that Jonathan noticed that she was two rows in front of him. No, one row. Suddenly, Jonathan was in a dark place. He was falling, he realized. His eyes suddenly began to burn. He tried to scream, but the inside of his throat turned to liquid as the jelly that was once his eyeballs pour from their sockets. Jonathan was a skinless corpse by the time he fell into Jacqueline's stomach acid, and then, Jonathan was no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline grabbed the last person in the room, a dark haired short girl, and swallowed her before her eyes could turn to look at her. The legion of what was once people in her stomach drained into her intestines. Her body took every last bit of her prey's corporeal forms, and a moment later, Jacqueline farted out the air that was 400 person's last breathes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should hold me for the next hour or so.\" Jacqueline thought as she exited the room.</span></div></div>",

It was always a struggle to get them to fit around her impossible curves, but she had just bought this pair, the cut on the jeans assumed some manner of normalcy in the size of the wearer's ass, a luxury that Fernanda's genetics did not provide, and hadn't been broken in yet. The light of the dusk sun gleamed across the blue northern sky and over the tundra grass, before so eloquently highlighting her gorgeous Brazilian features. She flipped her sleek black hair and began to walk forward. Behind her lay a veritable mountain of human corpses turned to feces; what remained of the 17500 souls of the city of Akureyri before Fernanda's body robbed them of their nutrients. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one more left.\" Fernanda thought as she walked towards her appropriated vehicle, a police cruiser. \"Just Husavik left, and I have killed the Icelandic language.\" The thought made her wet. So many had lived and conversed through the language, and soon it would just be a memory, lost somewhere in her body. She wondered what she would do next as she started her vehicle. The death of Icelandic had been her largest undertaking yet, and she had accomplished it in a scant one month span. Fernanda thought hard as she drove out of the dead city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, Uyghur?\" She thought. The language was located in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and... Western China? \"No, China's a no go since Chao-xing Li decided she was hungry for about 7000 people a day for the rest of her life. I would be found out in days. However...\" Fernanda thought to herself. \"Perhaps I can visit Chao-xing in India, and meet this Abigail Farren Astrid thinks so highly of. The Konkani language is located solely in India, and is spoken by, what? 7.5 million?\" Fernanda stopped herself, that number was incredibly high. Chao-xing could do it in a year if she put her mind to it, but Fernanda wasn't so sure she was capable of doing such a thing. It would take her nearly a decade, but at the same time, it would keep her occupied for a long while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeighing her options, Fernanda continued down the road, setting sun at her back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chao-xing Li waited. A midday sun shown through the dense Indian foliage and illuminated her impossible beauty. Someone could spend their life imagining and theorizing about the most ideal picture of beauty, and their conjured image still wouldn't be able to hold a light to the diminutive Chinese woman. She wore her shining ebony hair in a bob that ended just above her large brown eyes. She wore nearly nothing, as she often did to allow her to hunt more freely; only an athletic bra, a pair of short-shorts, and a pair of sandals clung to her paragon of a body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Annnnnd clear!\" rang out from behind her in a husky Indian accent. A plunger was pressed, and suddenly the bridge before her exploded into a menagerie of splintered wood and bent railroad ties. Chao-xing stood her ground as the shrapnel clattered uselessly off her body; her perfect, hairless skin might look and feel as soft as silk, but it was tougher than steel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, Jayanta.\" she called out in a heavily accented Chinese accent. A tall, muscular Indian man emerged from the canopy behind her, a grin on his face. He removed his safety goggles and strode up next to the Chinese girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Chao.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where should I be standing?\" Chao-xing asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" Jayanta produced a sheet of paper and studied it for a moment, \"16.7 metres from where the track ends. So,\" he pointed at a stretch of land underneath where the bridge once was, \"There.\" Chao-xing strolled over to where he had pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you again for this, Jay. Once Abigail and I have cleared the city, you're welcome to anything you want in it.\" She called back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's no problem, Chao. My two friends are hungry, I feed my two friends.\" He smiled back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, don't dismiss this, Jay, you helped us take out every possible way out of the city, except for the railways. Mumbai would be well and safe if it wasn't for you. Abigail and I are in your debt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thank you for the kindness, but I do this not for money, but for friendsh-\" A train whistle cut Jayanta short. He and Chao-xing exchanged looks, as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is,\" Jayanta started,\" first refugee train out of Mumbai. 4.2 kilometres of steel, with 120,000 people fleeing the carnage Abigail is creating inside the city onboard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's found the end of the line already.\" Chao-xing said with glee. \"How many more do you think will follow it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this area is inaccessible by radio for the next thirty kilometres, and the trains will be going at about fifty kilometres an hour, so I say they get suspicious about an hour from now, and they stop sending the trains in about two, two and a half. It took this train twenty minutes to get here, so I say 6 or 7 find their way here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"720,000 to 840,000 people. Thank you so much for this Jay.\" Chao-xing replied with joy on her face, and a growling in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, no problem. Now I believe the train will be arriving very soon, if you would make ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChao-xing planted her feet firmly in the ground and pointed her head at the railroad track that ended at the now demolished bridge. She could see the tracks shaking, and felt her heart pounding in tandem. She hadn't felt this excited in years. She waited, seconds taking hours, for two and a half minutes before it came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparks screeching out of the wheels, the locomotive barreled off the tracks at full speed directly towards the tiny Chinese girl beneath. Time stood still for Chao-xing. She looked into the conductors bewildered face, and read the graffiti on the engine. In her peripherals, Jayanta looked on in wonder as bird emerged from the trees, fleeing the cacophony. And then, the train was upon her. Chao-xing opened her mouth and began a sustained swallow that she normally did when she ate large objects, and caught the train with her mouth. The engine of the metal monstrosity flew into her gullet in a split second, followed by the car behind it, and behind that one, and that one, and that one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJayanta looked on with utter shock. The scene before him didn't look real. The massive locomotive cars shot forward faster than anything he had ever seen into beautiful, beautiful Chao-xing. She was swallowing them nearly twelve a second. Jayanta knew each car had between 150 and 200 people inside; he had done his homework. Fathers, sons, mothers, daughters, families, they entered his friend thousands at a time, never to emerge. Their entire lives led up to feeding this gorgeous girl before him. In the end, they were destined for Chao-xing Li. Jayanta felt his manhood rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, it was over. The thunderous metal clamors ceased immediately. There was a moment of silence before Chao-xing stopped tensing. She looked about and then looked over to Jayanta with a look of \"Did I do it?\" upon her. Jayanta looked at her and felt his heart melt. She looked so... innocent. She had just killed 120,000 people, how did she look so... cute? Her mouth opened slightly, and Jayanta tensed with anticipation of her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrruuuuuuuuuuuppphhhh.\" she belched. Another moment of silence followed before she started laughing. Jayanta looked on confused for a moment before he began chuckling, and in a few seconds, both were paralyzed with laughter. Thirty seconds of this scene of mania passed before Chao-xing held up her hand and muttered \"Wait.\" A breath passed before she slightly lifted one of her legs and farted deeply and loudly for nearly twenty straight seconds. Following this, she smiled and jumped in the air with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! 120000 people, digested at the same time! I did it!\" she practically squealed with joy. She ran forward and wrapped Jayanta in a tight embrace, squeezing the air from him with here inhumane strength before she realized that she was hurting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I'm sorry, Jay.\" she said, backing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... not an issue.\" the Indian man said, gritting his teeth through the pain. Suddenly, there was a sound neither of them were expecting. The train whistle cut through the air like a hot knife through snow. The two exchanged looks for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not supposed to be here for another fifteen minutes.\" Jayanta said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's here now!\" Chao-xing yelled, running back to her spot. Once more the train fell on her, and once more she slurped it down  like a wet noodle. Panting, she belched and looked over to Jayanta, before another whistle was heard. When it arrived a minute afterwards, it once more found its way into the small girl's stomach, even as she farted out what remained of its predecessor. She burped in tandem with the next whistle. She shot a glance back towards her friend. \"This is going to be a long day.\" her look seemed to say...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hours later, Chao-xing Li collapsed to the ground. A new, fully loaded train had arrived every five minutes, and every five minutes, 120000 more people met their end in Chao-xing's reluctant tummy. But now it seemed they had stopped. Jayanta looked towards his small friend. There had been 42 trains by his count. Five million people. Lost somewhere in that sleeping girl over there. Sighing, Jayanta retrieved the wheelbarrow he had used to transport the dynamite he used to blow the bridge and returned to Chao-xing. With great effort, he slowly moved her lithe, impossibly heavy body into the wheelbarrow, and from there, rolled her to the car they had arrived in. He carefully moved her into the back seat of the vehicle, and laid her down, throwing a blanket over her. He watched her sleep for a moment, still coming to terms with the sheer number of people that had ended up as one of this nymph's farts. He sighed and started the car, driving it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Jayanta thought as he pulled onto the dirt road, \"If there's that many people trying to get away, Abigail must be raising hell in Mumbai.\"</span></div></div>",

As the two hit the ground simultaneously on their bellies, she heard a cry of pain from her foe. She released her grip on Jennifer's arms and rolled the two them both onto her back, grabbing for her stomach. Jennifer used the opportunity to her advantage; she wrapped her legs around the woman's waist, and grabbed her by the armpits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer pulled the impossibly heavy girl towards her mouth and swallowed, taking her in to the shoulders. The black girl still clutched at her stomach, pulling on something. The model-capable tan woman repeated the same movement, re-positioning her hands further and further down her target's body. The woman's breasts were in her throat. Again she swallowed and pulled, bringing the girl in to the bottom of her ribcage. The black woman finally succeeded in pulling out whatever was stuck in her, but at the same time, Jennifer swallowed, engulfing her prey to her waist. With pleasure, Jennifer put her tongue in one or maybe two of her meal's holes. It tasted like victory.She swallowed again, taking in half of her victim's thighs. Another swallow left only half the woman's calves and her feet outside of Jennifer's body, an issue quickly resolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer stood to her feet and turned slightly to her left, hands on her hips. Her medicine ball sized belly began to rumble as she let out a bastardized war cry of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrrraaaapph.\" she belched confidently, before the feeling of euphoria from digestion returned. Jennifer moaned and convulsed on the ground for what felt like an eight minute orgasm before she stood back up, breathing heavily. She looked down at her gut. Why did she take so long to break down? Was it because she ate people too? She clearly knew what Jennifer was trying to do to her, and she weighed far too much for how large she was. There was something odd that happens when she ate people, she became stronger and her constitution greatly improved after she ate just Meghan, who knows what happened to her after she subsumed all of those other people? Jennifer wondered at what was going on inside of her, before she realized she was literally in a class for just this thing. She could ask Blainey or find some other Professor to learn more if she really needed to. Resolving that it was an issue for another day, Jennifer reached down and grabbed what she believed that black woman was looking at. It looked like a pyramid, with spikes coming out of every corner of it, one covered in blood. With a grunt of dismissal, Jennifer dropped the item, and feeling that familiar feeling of pressure, farted very loudly for about four straight seconds. With a sigh of relief, Jennifer looked about for a place where she could let her newest friend out. Deciding on a nearby path of pushed aside grass, she started walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking for a viable location to pop a squat, Jennifer rounded a tree some fifteen metres away from the path, and to her surprise, found herself looking at two small boys, fear evident in their eyes; they had seen her.

With her left hand, she hastily pulled her shorts and underwear down before she squatted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh of relief, Jennifer defecated the woman she had ate, and pissed out enough urine to fill a toilet bowl while the two children watched in horror. She put down the two kids but still held onto them firmly. The child on the left stared off into the woods, unable to meet Jennifer's eyes, as the other stood still, mouth agape and eyes transfixed on Jennifer's exposed crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me your shirt.\" Jennifer said to the boy on the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mu - my shirt? Why?\" He said, unsuccessfully trying to meet Jennifer's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To clean myself, hand it over.\" Jennifer said sharply. After a moment's hesitation, the child pulled his shirt off with one hand and gave it to Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Jennifer said sarcastically before she ran the shirt up and down her ass crack, discarding it once finished. She looked at the two children, one was clearly afraid of her, as the other clearly was attracted to her on some kind of puerile level, she could probably convince the two to never talk about what they saw her do here. Or she could take the more direct route and just ingest them, but was she really willing to do that? With a moment of thought, Jennifer decides...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You too, kid.\" Jennifer said to the child on the right. Her voice dissolved the boy's transfixation on her genitals, and he hastened to obey. He removed his red t-shirt and handed it to Jennifer, eyes now fluttering to either gander at her exposed parts or to meet her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wu - why did you want his shirt?\" the boy on the left asked, voice quivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same reason I wanted your's.\" she said before she readjusted her grip on the boy on the right and lifted his head into her mouth. She swallowed once, engulfing the boy to his waist. The other child shrieked and struggled in her grip, but to no avail. She swallowed again with an exaggerated \"gulp,\" and the remainder of the youth was propelled into her. With wide eyes, the remaining boy stopped his struggles and followed the path the lump that was once his friend took into the gorgeous woman before him. When the lump stopped at her midsection, Jennifer slowly leaned into the boy's face and belched softly. He began to quietly sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yum.\" Jennifer practically whispered. \"Now it's your turn.\" The child began sobbing louder and shaking his head. \"Oh come on now, it's not that bad.\" Jennifer said, lifting the boy off the ground, \"It's like getting hugged all over, then it's going to sting for a bit, but after that, you never have to feel bad or worry about anything ever again.\" The child's sobs turned into a whimper as his tear-stained gaze met Jennifer's eager eyes. \"And besides,\" the beautiful woman continued, readjusting her grip such that the boy would enter her maw feet first, \"Think of how happy you'll make me!\" With that, she allowed her victim to slide from her grasp into her throat. He renewed his sobbing. Two successive swallows sent him to his doom as Jennifer's mouth closed behind his descending head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the boy's body enter her stomach as she released her hold on her digestion and prepared herself for the stomach -based orgasm - like sensation that followed. Disappointingly, while the resulting feeling was still pleasant, it was nothing like what she had experienced when she had digested people before. While normally the sensation rendered her immobile with pleasure, this time she barely felt it. After maybe twenty seconds the feeling stopped all together as the soup that was once children drained into her intestines. Jennifer was disappointed to say the least, especially after the pinnacle she had just reached from ingesting that black woman. With a sigh, she released a soft fart from her still exposed rear, and squatted in preparation. Ten seconds later, Jennifer felt a pressure, and opened her rectum, what remained of the children's bodies emerging from inside of her, and plopping onto the ground with a slightly wet sounding \"thump.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer grabbed her most recent snack's t - shirt and cleaned herself, before tossing it to the side. She pulled up her underwear and her shorts before heading back to the path. As she worked her way through the throng of the woods, Jennifer heard voices coming from further down the path. Ducking behind a bush for cover, she looked at them. A man, brown haired, a woman, blonde, and a boy, blonde, most likely a family. If so, they were a handsome family, the man and the woman defiantly attractive, and the boy looking as though he would follow his parents later in life. Jennifer's well toned stomach rumbled as she decided...</span></div></div>",

After about a minute of anxious waiting, the three walked by, the father telling his son about the types of trees in the area. With a pounding heart, Jennifer jumped out from the bush, and recalling her martial arts training in her youth, kicked the man in his gut. As he fell to the ground with an \"oomph,\" Jennifer backhanded the woman, sending her sprawling. As the child began to scream, she punched him in the forehead, causing him to fall to the ground disoriented. The man began to struggle to his feet, but Jennifer wheeled about and kicked him in the temple, rendering him unconscious. The woman too struggled to her feet, but Jennifer sprang forward and grabbed her by the collar of the shirt. She tore it off with her right hand and tossed it to the side as her left hand groped the woman's rear. She placed her right hand on the woman's side and hoisted her into the air, engulfing her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree swallows followed as Jennifer subsumed the woman before walking over to the groggy child. She picked him up with one hand and placed his head into her maw. Two swallows sent him to join his mother. Next, with alacrity, Jennifer walked over to the man, and hoisted his legs into her mouth, four gulps spelling his end. They would be together forever inside Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burrp.\" Jennifer exuded as her stomach began to rend the flesh from the family's bones. She grabbed the woman's shirt and  walked to where she left what her body didn't want from her opponent and the two children as her most recent meals had their bodies melted into one, solid mass. The sensation had felt better than the two boys, but it was still nowhere near any of her meals before that black woman. The family descended into Jennifer, their nutrients absorbed by her intestinal wall as juices from her multiple digestive organs were sprayed onto them. Jennifer farted audibly as she reached the area and pulled her shorts and underwear off in preparation. In their killer's large intestines, the water that had been contained within their bodies and Jennifer's digestive juices pulled out from the mixture, solidifying it into a single turd. The desiccated remains of the family than ceased moving, as they hit a dead end. Jennifer felt the familiar pressure of a completed digestion return and opened her sphincter. The family slid out and landed on the forest floor as Jennifer sighed and wiped herself with the shirt she had taken. She tossed it on top of her shit and looked back on what she had created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix people. She had cannibalized six people just now. Not to mention the nine before. And the, what, five yesterday? She had ingested, killed, and absorbed twenty people. Jennifer felt no remorse, she knew she should feel bad, but all she felt right now was hungry. She pulled her tight fitting shorts over her large, similarly right ass and started back to the path.</span></div></div>",

No people crossed her path as her sneaker clad feet carried her through the twig-ridden path into a clearing that led the park. The normally crowded area was uncharacteristically empty, and there was a hint of repugnance that permeated the area. Confused, Jennifer began to jog through, looking about. She spotted no living thing until she had progressed about halfway through the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome 100 metres down the path stood a decently attractive woman guiding a baby carriage. She stood about 155 centimetres tall and wore a grey sweater, along with a pair of jeans. Jennifer's stomach roared and she instinctively started towards the woman and her child, intent on making a snack of them, but she stopped herself. \"The urge is getting a lot stronger than it was before...\" Jennifer thought to herself, concerned with how fast her body had decided that she should eat the two before her. </span></div></div>",

The mother awkwardly smiled back and attempted to break eye contact, but Jennifer was uncomfortably close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hello?\" the woman said. Jennifer responded by grabbing her by the sweater and ripping it off of her, unintentionally taking her shirt with it. The woman shrieked, but Jennifer pulled her in close and covered her lips with her own, thrusting her tongue into her mouth. The woman fought it for a moment, but after finding herself strangely attracted to the young adult before her, she stopped resisting and returned the motion, placing her hand on the exposed thigh of her assaulter and closing her eyes. Jennifer returned the volley by placing her hands on the woman's ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips slowly expanded over the mother's face, until the woman opened her eyes into darkness. She began to struggle, but Jennifer thrusted her head downwards so that the mother's own head was now trapped between Jennifer's cheeks. The model-like woman than lifted her prey by her ass and swallowed hard, rocketing the woman into Jennifer up to her waist. The mother's taste was great, but to be fair, Jennifer couldn't recall a single person that had taken that fateful trip into her digestive tract that didn't taste excellent. Another swallow removed her from sight. Jennifer looked down as to watch the woman travelling through her esophagus, but she saw no lump where she should have been. Taking a moment to puzzle at this, Jennifer went to the baby carriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a baby girl, perhaps a year old. She looked at Jennifer with eyes full of the innocence only an infant was capable of. Almost autonomously, Jennifer scooped up the baby and swallowed it in one gulp. A look of disappointment was written on Jennifer's face. The two souls she had placed inside her had not even had an effect on her hunger. Placing a hand on her gut and belching softly, Jennifer spotted a portable toilet. She began to walk towards it as her vicious stomach liquefied mother and daughter in a moment. She quietly farted as she opened the the door, pulled down her shorts and underwear, and sat down. After a moment, the familiar pressure returned, and Jennifer relaxed, a single human sized turd fell from her with little resistance, splattering to the feces filled pit some five feet below. She cleaned herself with nearby toilet paper before discarding it and re-clothing herself.She walked outside before something hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I just eat a baby?\" Jennifer thought to herself, looking at her gut. She felt no remorse for doing so, but at the same time, she felt strange for having done it. Shrugging to herself, she continued her jog, recalling the address of one part of her breakfast's parents. 25 Harbour Lane. </span></div></div>",

She repeated the techniques for some ten minutes before she was hit by Jessica's fluids that shot from her at the moment of arrival. The two lay on their backs on the dirt path breathlessly, looking up towards the midday sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is how humans are supposed to be,\" Jessica said after a few quiet moments. \"Eating and fucking under the skies, not shut up in some dumb brick cube studying for quizzes and shit to get a piece of paper that says you aren't an idiot so you can do stupid things for some jackass who hates you because he's been wasting his life doing it for a lot longer than you and thinks that means something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does sound a lot better.\" Jennifer replied absent mindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Luckily there's the little things in life that keep you from freaking the fuck out.

Did Jessica know? No, she couldn't have. But what if she did? What if she told Blainey? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if she read her mind, Jessica looked over to her. \"But I suppose you got back at her for all of us didn't you there, gorgeous?\" She said before continuing her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so Stacey, Julianne, and I were going to hit up this party and chow down, but I got really drunk and started eating, like, everyone I came across. At some point I lost track of myself, and when I woke up this morning my burps tasted suspiciously like Julianne, and I couldn't find Stacey anywhere, so whoops. Guess that means I'm the only TA now.\" Jessica put her bra back on and reached for her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But anyway, the next morning I wake up, and the rich asshole who owns the place had locked the gate to the building and said his girlfriend went missing last night, and no one can leave until she's found. My guess is she made her contribute to this,\" Jessica said, slapping her exposed ass, \"but I never found out. Stupid rich bastard put everyone inside with me, so I put everyone inside me. Took me a few hours, but they all got their turn eventually. Once I was done enjoying myself, I shat them all out on his nice Kashmir carpet. Good times, good times\" Jessica concluded, pulling her pants up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Jennifer stated in a monotone voice. \"That's cool, but how the fuck do you know about Meghan?\" she said, her voice  becoming threatening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Jessica said, retrieving her sunglasses. \"Oh, the Hawthorne bitch? We're better off without her. Damn Hawthornes are sociopaths. Meghan wasn't that big of a deal from what I heard, but her two sisters are fucking menaces. Her older sister, Kimberly, likes to crash vore get-togethers and digest everyone there, which is really a problem when you only have a vore capable population of like, a few thousand in the state, and her younger sister, Haley, is a goddamn nightmare. The girl's fifteen and has probably near a hundred thousand people floating through her teen aged veins already. One time she swallowed a fucking school bus, and the 150 kids inside it, whole. And to make matters worst, the three's mother just took over the other research team a couple months ago, so you can be assured that quite a few human sized turds will be showing up with biological stamps on them that read \"Hawthorne.\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, you like to talk, don't you?\" Jennifer responded with a voice of ice. \"I don't need rumors and I don't need stories. What I need is for you to tell me whether or not I have to kill you so Blainey doesn't hear about Meghan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down there, honey.\" Jessica responded in an unimpressed voice. \"Blainey already knows about you and Meghan's misadventures, I mean it's not exactly had to figure out. She goes to help you one minute, next minute she's gone, you're burping and farting uncontrollably, and you've grown a pot-belly. If Blainey cared, I wouldn't be here licking your cunt, I'd be sending those party goers some more company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you here?\" Jennifer responded, just as tense as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it has to do with Blainey. She didn't say why, but she told me to find you and tell you that she wanted to speak with you at five today. I just noticed that you were the most beautiful woman to ever live once I got here, and got a bit distracted.\" Jessica pulled out her phone. \"Should I tell her you'll be there?\"</span></div></div>",

An array of streets stood opposite her, separated by the road. Jennifer walked to a crosswalk and hit the button as she scanned the street names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mildew, Honey, Cliff, Bertnam, Harbour... Harbour!\" she thought to herself as the crossing light turned blue. Jennifer walked across and started down Harbour, and continued until she reached address 25. It was a white building, looked to be maybe two floors with an average size. A stone walkway lead through a flower enriched field up to a a spruce patio, on which lay a dark red door. Wasting no time, Jennifer strolled up the walkway and onto the patio. She knocked at the door with three quick raps and waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, Jennifer heard voices in a language she did not understand, one male, one female.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An Asian man opened the door. He looked to be a bit shorter than average, and shallow wrinkles ran across his handsome, but weathered face. He was muscular, his skin still held tightly to his body, despite his age, and he had short black hair. He wore a light green shirt and a pair of blue jeans. From Jennifer's memory, she could definitely see traces of the boy she had eaten in him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" the man asked in slightly accented English. Jennifer wordlessly shot out her hand and grabbed him by the arm, pulling him in close. The man quickly brought his free arm to Jennifer's, delivering a savage blow to her elbow. Jennifer gritted her teeth at the pain, and used her own free arm to grab his. The man struggled against the grip, but Jennifer's inhumanly strong grasp never faltered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ai! Come quick-\" the fifty year old began to yell before the young woman engulfed his head in one fluid motion. She lifted him upwards and swallowed thrice, and the man was no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Jian?\" a woman's voice asked from inside the home. Jennifer looked towards the origin of the sound, and saw an Asian woman, of similar age to the man. She wore a light pink dress, and had a rather athletic body, with large hips. She was very pretty, despite the wrinkles on her face, and wore her black hair in a bob. She looked at Jennifer for a moment, and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you...\" she said in a shocked tone before her face twisted in anger. She sprinted forward at an incredible speed, reaching Jennifer in a moment. The woman skillfully ended her charge with a spin kick, which Jennifer only managed to block by a hair, bringing her arm to the side of her face, recalling her Martial Arts training in her youth, and intercepting the path of her leg. The older woman deftly landed on her feet and jabbed Jennifer in the gut before hitting her in the jaw. Jennifer stumbled backwards, tasting blood. She fell to the ground in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spit him out, now!\" the woman commanded. When Jennifer didn't respond, she stomped on the small bones of her feet with all of her might. Jennifer cried out in pain and began rolling about uselessly on the floor; it felt like she had shattered her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it, or this gets much worse.\" She said coldly. When Jennifer's only response was muffled noises of agony, the woman grabbed her by the leg, and practically yanked her inside, slamming the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have one last chance, girl, spit him up, and this will be over in a breath.\" Several seconds passed, with no words from Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spit Jian out, damn you!\" she yelled, stomping on Jennifer's shattered foot. Jennifer shrieked in pain. The woman began to grind her heel on the injured area, as Jennifer's vision began to fade to white. She screamed louder and louder as she felt close to fainting. Jennifer lost control of her bowels with the pain, a deep and lengthy fart emerging from her. After this, the pain subsided. Jennifer's fading vision looked at her assailant; she stared at Jennifer's rear, tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jian?\" she muttered, realizing the source of Jennifer's gas. She fell to her knees, sobbing. Jennifer paused for a moment, before she sneered, her sight turning to red. She sprung up with a yell, taking the older woman by the head, and driving her to the ground. She grabbed the back of her head, slamming it into the ground consecutively until the forehead of the attractive woman's face was a red mush. With a hurry, Jennifer choked her corpse down in a moment, belching loudly as she finally lost consciousness.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three loud knocks at the door awoke Jennifer with a start. She quickly looked around before recalling where she was. She went to rise, but collapsed as soon as she put any pressure on her left foot. She looked down at her foot and winced; the bulge inside her sneaker wasn't in the correct shape, and her socks were soaked through with blood. There was also a deep bruise on her right elbow, which was difficult to move. Her stomach screamed to filled, and she really had to shit as well, which did little to help the situation. Jennifer started to stand up again, supporting the left side of her body with a nearby table, and slowly moved to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a moment!\" Jennifer called before reaching the door. Throwing it open, she found a girl to be standing there. She was an attractive sixteen year old, with long platinum blonde hair, blue eyes, and soft features. Her pink spaghetti strap and designer brand blue jeans clung tightly to her slender form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Mrs. Li?\" she asked with a confused, but friendly, smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes.\" Jennifer replied with a smile of her own. She did her best not to stare at the girl's body, every cell in her being crying for her to ingest her immediately, but she was too far away, and Jennifer wasn't exactly mobile at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me for saying so, but on the phone you sounded a lot more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asian?\" Jennifer finished for her. \"I get it all the time, I speak kind of weird when I think I'm alone I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry. I didn't mean anything by it.\" The girl apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not an issue.\" Jennifer said, starting to lose control of herself. \"Please, come in!\" She made a sweeping motion towards the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" she said, entering. \"Now, where's little-\" Jennifer closed the door and clamped down on the girls head. Two autonomous swallows brought the girl first into Jennifer up to her waist, and then all the way in roughly two seconds. Jennifer let out a feminine belch and started hobbling towards an open bathroom she saw. She felt the girl liquefy in a breath, but it did absolutely nothing to abate her hunger. Frowning, she entered the bathroom, pulled down her short-shorts and underwear, and thrusted herself onto the bowl, her anus screaming to her. She began to  shit, but after a few seconds, she felt an odd sensation as something pushed back on her. Moaning in frustration, she realized the bowl wasn't big enough for the digested remains of her last three meals. Thinking quick, she hopped off the bowl onto the edge of the bathtub. She leaned forward and resumed. Some thirty seconds later, she stood and observed her work. There was only a signal turd, a bit smaller than a man, despite the fact that she had eaten three people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer wondered about this for a moment before her foot called out in pain again. She gritted her teeth, cleaned herself, and washed her hands. Jennifer then left the room, shutting the door behind her. She stumbled her way through the house before happening upon a bedroom. Sighing with relief, she stripped down nude and crawled into the bed. She pulled the covers up over her and fell asleep in a moment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A creak and a muffled footstep caused Jennifer to bolt up, where her eyes set gaze upon two women before her. One she recognized, Professor Blainey, but the other she didn't. The stranger was tall, easily 180 centimetres, and incredibly athletic looking. She wore her platinum blonde hair in a bob that hung close to her utterly gorgeous face. Her DD breasts jutted out from her like a pair of Kilimanjaros over the Serengeti that was her taut body, a black shoulderless shirt did a poor job at trying to hide them from public sight. Her hips were wide and her posterior sizable and toned. Her long legs, visible due to short skirt she wore, were well muscled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh. Hello?\" Jennifer offered, before remembering her lack of clothes. She quickly threw the sheets over her chest, but in doing so, had pulled her injured foot as well. She released a short cry of pain before gritting her teeth and looking back to her visitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer,\" Blainey started, \"Jessica told me you would meet me for five, and it's half past six.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I got kind of busy.\" Jennifer snapped back, thrusting her mangled foot upwards. The small bones had been snapped inwards, to a divot at the center of the foot. The whole thing was purple and swollen, and dried blood covered most of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" spoke the tall stranger, \"You did try to attack one of the greatest vorists in the country. That Asian woman you ate was Ai Gao, she had been at large for the past thirty five years, and is estimated to have digested as many as 525000 people in China and the United States.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five hundred... Did you just say five hundred THOUSAND people?!\" Jennifer guffawed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Blainey butted in, \"And she's not even the most impressive catch of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jennifer asked. The tall blonde woman produced a picture that looked as though it was taken from a security feed. On it was a black woman, pretty as the day is long, with assets to boot. Jennifer stared at the picture for a short while before she remembered where she had seen this person before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate that woman in the woods early today.\" Jennifer said, sight flickering between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name was Jacqueline Milton. She is responsible for the cannibalization of more than eleven million American citizens.\" The gorgeous woman said emotionlessly. Jennifer looked shocked at first, but her face soon after twisted to incredulity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eleven million? How could anyone eat eleven million people?\" Jennifer inquisited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With enough innate talent, and learnt skill, the female body is capable of the impossible.\" Blainey said. She produced a smartphone and handed it to Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you doubt what she was, watch this and see the monster you had inside of you.\" Jennifer grabbed the phone and hit the play button. The video seemed to be a dashboard cam of a police cruiser behind a school bus, stopped at a red light. Nothing happened for several seconds, but then the bus suddenly lurched forward. There was a breathe of silence where all of the children on the bus stopped their movements, before the vehicle violently shot forward nearly thirty feet with a loud mechanical lurch. The bus was then lifted into the air, perpendicular to the Earth, and in the next breath, it was gone. Directly beneath where the bus had been stood the woman Jacqueline. \"Oh my God.\" muttered a man's voice from inside the car while Jacqueline opened her mouth and belched loud enough for the camera to pick up. Then she spotted the police officer. She broke forward in a sprint a Cheetah would be jealous of and grabbed the bumper of the car. \"Oh shit, oh shit.\" came from the officer as he threw the car into reverse and slammed on the gas. But the car moved forwards instead of backwards as the black woman pulled it in closer. Finally, her lips touched the car, and after a short, sickening flash of images, the camera showed what appeared to the vehicle free falling in her stomach, the headlights providing light. About three seconds passed before there was a loud crash, and the camera was pointed at the school bus, where the hundred or so kids on board screamed and cried. A half second passed before a clear liquid fell onto the hood the car, eating through the metal as if there was only air. A thick wave fell onto the bus a second afterwards, and then there was no more bus, only an orange liquid. The liquid creeped over to the cruiser next, and a blink afterwards, the feed was lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...How?\" Jennifer barely managed in her stunned status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Blainey started, \"I could give a surmise on recent theories of the conversion of excess mass and theoretical vore capabilities of woman given consumption of said mass, or we can all appreciate that you killed once of the greatest mass murderers in history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks.\" Jennifer replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there's need of you yet, Jennifer.\" The tall one stated. \"The progenitors of this recent wave of vore thought the public could handle it. But they can't. Most girls die within a month of entering the world of human consumption, and those that don't go on to kills dozens, hundreds even. We need a number of responsible woman capable of great feats of vore for researching the subject, but we can't allow the numbers that we have now. That's why we need you. You took out one of the world's greatest vorists, and we need somebody to act as our Grim Reaper, to start a new slate in this city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I do that? And who the fuck are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's start with the easy one, I'm Emily Wicks, commissioner of the city's police department. And what do you get? Another easy one, I can guarantee you immunity from the law in this city, Blainey can have your tuition payed in full, and furthermore, you get to leave this room as something other than a stain on my underwear.

Fortunately, the professor has a solution.\" Wicks gestured towards Blainey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see,\" Blainey started, beginning to pace, \"Any woman is capable of vore with practice and instruction, but there are those among us who are innately skilled. It is expected to be resultant of eugenics, we have yet to isolate the gene, but that's besides the point. These particular individuals are capable of devouring their first person with little or no practice, have incredible metabolisms, and tend to be incredibly attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you think of anyone that fits that description?\" Emily chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Jennifer smirked, \"My mother always did say I had a black hole where my stomach ought to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Blainey returned, \"How long had you been practicing before you ingested Meghan Hawthorne yesterday? A week? Less?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's say less.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And let's take another person in the class to compare. One of the more exemplary students, a woman by the name of Sally. She's been putting in great effort towards becoming vore-capable, even seeking tutelage under Meghan since the beginning of the class. And she's only just managed to down a willing person after all of this time. She could practice until she's grey, and she will never be on the level you will be on in a week's time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly, you're rambling.\" Emily interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, sorry. Anyway, those with this gift, Emily, Jessica, Meghan, Jacqueline Milton, you, their bodies metabolize their victims at incredible rates, repairing their wounds in fractions of the time it would typically take, the time being reduced even further if there is a steady supply of food. And Commissioner Wicks has just the thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I do.\" Wicks said. \"So you get dressed, and come with us, and you'll be running tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oookay...?\" Jennifer said, drawing out the \"O,\" \"If you two could step out for a moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure.\" Wicks said, leaving. \"I got a crutch for you out in the car I'll grab.\" The two left the room, shutting the door behind them. Jennifer slowly rose to her feet and retrieved her clothes. She fastened her bra, pulled on her shirt, and pulled up her panties and shorts before setting sight on her blood soaked sock. Jennifer decided she would really rather not wear it and began rummaging through a nearby dresser for a replacement. She found both woman's and men's socks, but found the woman's to be too little for her. She put on a pair of the men's, wincing while clothing her wounded foot, before putting on her sneakers. Jennifer then hobbled over to the door, using furniture to support her along the way. Opening the door, she found Wicks and Blainey waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" Wicks said, thrusting a crutch into Jennifer's hand. They then began walking through the house. Jennifer noted the smell as they walked across the bathroom. Before long, they were outside, and heading towards a grey hybrid sedan. Wicks produced a pair of keys and took the drivers seat. Blainey grabbed the far end back seat, and motioned for Jennifer to take the other. She put the crutch in before climbing into the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the foot feeling?\" Blainey asked as they pulled onto the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had worse injures playing football during college.\" Jennifer lied. In truth, it was taking every part of her not to cry out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that was true, you would be a cripple by this point.\" Blainey said, seeing through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't worry about it,\" Wicks called, pulling off Harbour Street, \"We'll pump you full of people, and you'll be fine come tomorrow.\" The three traveled in silence for a few minutes. Jennifer noted how quiet the hybrid was, and swore it had stalled when they stopped at a traffic light, but when it turned, it drove with no issues. With nothing but her thoughts to keep her conversation, Jennifer began recalling a few questions she had before, and figured now would be an appropriate time to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blainey,\" Jennifer started, breaking the silence, \"After I digested that Jacqueline chick, I found that I was a lot hungrier, and people didn't fill me up like they used to. Why was that?\" Blainey paused a moment before replying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want the long answer or the short one?\"</span></div></div>",

The working theory of how vore is possible, and to where the excess mass goes when a person is digested states that when a vorist absorbs their prey, most of the mass is translated to a four dimensional version of the vorist.

This part is not fully understood yet, but from our findings thus far, when you ingest someone, they are stored in your fourth dimensional body while being digested by your third dimensional stomach, if that makes any sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I understand.\" Jennifer replied after a moment. \"So everyone I ate I processed into my fourth dimensional self, which made it larger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely,\" Blainey returned with a enthusiastic nod.\" \"And when you digested other vorists, such as Jacqueline Milton and Ai Gao, you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I absorbed their fourth dimension selves as well.\" Jennifer interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" Blainey smiled. \"And so you add to your capacity at a rate of one point zero seven times ten to the negative fifth metres cubed per kilo for every person digested, and for every kilo of human someone you've eaten has digested, your capacity increases seven point eight three times ten to the negative ninth metres cubed. So just in subsuming Gao and Milton, your capacity has increased -\" she pulled out her smartphone, loaded a calculator application, and furiously tapped at the screen for several seconds \"About 6.1 metres cubed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, cool?\" Jennifer replied, shellshocked at the flurry of her professor's speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, cool.\" Blainey returned, reigning herself in. \"But,\" she started up again, \"Those are the rates for typical women. Those gifted, such as yourself, have increased rates. For example, Milton, mathematically, should have a capacity of roughly 117.7 cubic metres, but a school bus has a volume of roughly 130 cubic metres, and as shown in that dashboard camera video, she wasn't even in the vicinity of being filled. I've been looking for appropriate subjects, to discover how those so lucky among us work, but those I've asked so far, have been so far, unwilling.\" She said, gazing towards Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly, I've already told you,\" the Commissioner replied, \"I'm not swallowing hundreds of blocks of concrete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get a free meal afterwards.\" Blainey replied, \"Say the word and we can have a dozen hundred people ready to be stuffed down your throat by tomorrow evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then I'll have to swallow a couple more hundred concrete blocks. No thanks.\" Wicks stated dismissively. \"And besides, how the fuck did you plan on making twelve hundred people disappear? Or getting them into a city of four million with no one noticing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wouldn't do it here, and we definitely wouldn't try to get them all from nearby. A hundred there, a hundred here, a couple hundred from the Orient, a few hundred more from Mexico, a few hundred from Canada, and then that vast cornucopia of stories and experiences placed directly into you! Come on Emily, it's for science!\" Blainey finished with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Kelly, drop it.\" Wicks snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that Ms. Augustin has revealed herself to be what she is, I think we may just have someone to observe instead.\" Blainey returned, gazing towards Jennifer, who awkwardly looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky her.\" the Commissioner snorted. The car pulled off the main road onto one in desperate need of maintenance. The group traveled down the bumpy path for nearly ten minutes before they came upon an old abandoned warehouse. Any glass that was once there had long since been broken, several large shards visible on the ground. Painted on the peeling green side of the building were the words \"Burgerstein Metallurgy and Welding Inc.\" in fading red paint. Despite the clear abandonment of the facility, there was no graffiti, which Jennifer attributed to the double layered razor-wire topped rusty chain link fence that surrounded the perimeter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the place.\" Wicks said, getting out the car. She produced a key and used it to undo a padlock on the gate before them before sliding it open. She then returned to the vehicle, drove it into the facility, and closed the gate behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" She said, starting towards the warehouse. Blainey helped Jennifer out of the car and into the twilight. She handed her the crutch before they began following the police commissioner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Jennifer proclaimed, \"How do you two know each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily was a student of mine a few years ago. She made more progress than any student I have ever had, so I took her under my metaphorical wing, and with her skill and my knowledge, we forged her into the best vorist in the state. Until Milton showed up at least. After she graduated, we kept in touch and became good friends, and three years later, much to my benefit she became the youngest police commissioner in the city's history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, commissioner at twenty five, how'd you manage that?\" Jennifer asked to Wicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first off, I was twenty six, stupid five year plan, and I was more intelligent, more athletic, and more persistent then any of the other candidates. And also everyone who got nominated for the role beside me had this horrible habit of falling into my stomach. Strangest thing.\" Wicks replied with a smirk on her face and a sway on her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three walked through the blown out facility for a short while before coming upon a loading bay where three eighteen wheelers were parked. The floor of the area was carpeted and clean; a large double bed was placed in the corner, and a massive toilet bowl was placed opposite it, on the far end of the room. Emily walked over to the first of the trucks and turned towards Jennifer and Blainey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my little home away from home. Here is where I really get to reap the benefits of my position, for you see-\" Wicks undid the latch that held in the back gate of the trailer and threw it open. Inside was a crowd of people, all tied up and gagged. \"These are those unfortunate souls that ended up in lock up this week.\" She opened the next trailer to another crowd. \"328 persons, who were released from Metro Police custody this morning.\" She threw open the final gate to a similar picture. \"328 Jennifer turds. Shall we begin?\"</span></div></div>",

Why?\" Jennifer questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to need to eat every last one of these people, and take my word for it, digesting so many at once is an absolutely wonderful experience. You're not going to be able to think, let alone eat. So I'm going to fill up on everyone here, and then vomit them down your throat. Like a bird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, that's not what I was expecting, Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's what's happening. I'm not going to have you convulsing on the ground and shitting all over my carpet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine.\" Jennifer conceded. She hobbled over to the toilet, which was larger than any she had ever seen by far. She cautiously took off her clothes before sitting down. It was then that she realized that excluding her dinner, there were only two people in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Blainey?\" Jennifer called out to Wicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ran off most likely. Despite the fact that she literally gets people to do this stuff for her job, she still gets a bit queasy around all the shit and death. I wouldn't hold it against her.\" The Commissioner replied, walking into the trailer, beyond Jennifer's sight. For the next thirty seconds, there was a cacophony of muffled screams and gulping noises, punctuated by a loud belch. Wicks walked out of the trailer and into the next. The same situation occurred, and after the half-minuted clamor, Wicks hopped out with another lengthy burp accompanying her. She then climbed into the final trailer. This one was positioned at such an angle that Jennifer could see her ally in work, and she was astonished. Wicks transformed from a person into a blur; her arms moved faster then the human eye could detect, lashing out to one helpless victim to the next half a dozen times a second, shooting them into her mouth at impossible speeds. She walked in a straight line down the center of the trailer, her deal dealing gait never breaking, until she reached the end of both the trailer and the crowd. She turned around, swallowed once, and looked towards Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrph.\" She practically stated, her bob moving with the air from her belch. She jumped down onto the ground and started towards Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what you're going to want to do here, Jennifer,\" she said closing the gap between the two, \"Is nothing at all. Just sit there, let me push these people down your throat, let them digest, and when their done, let them fall out of your ass. Don't think about it.\" The two were an arms length away. \"You're probably going to pass out from the pleasure. That's okay, don't fight it if it comes. If you do, I'll finish pumping you full, and I'll let you finish pooping, then I'll throw you on that bed over there, and join you. You sleep it off, and we'll catch breakfast tomorrow, deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds go-\" Jennifer started before Wicks grabbed her by the back of the head an kissed her full on. Jennifer's arms flew out to the side in surprise, but she managed to regain her self control. She placed her hands on Wicks' ass and lifted her, placing her to sit on her exposed crotch. Her womanhood throbbed with attraction to the woman sat on her lap. When this was done she would have to make a move on the older woman Jennifer thought to herself. Jennifer undid her benefactor's shirt as their breasts touched. Then Wicks made good on her promise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer felt a flood pour into her mouth and into her. She moaned and moaned, but it never stopped. She felt her stomach fill up, digest, and drain a dozen times. She felt her anus open autonomously as clumps of feces larger than she was fell from her with a sickening squelch and a pleasurable sensation. A dozen more times she filled and emptied to the tune of her muffled shrieks of ecstasy. She could feel every centimetre of her digestive tract, and every molecule of it felt like its own orgasm. Jennifer couldn't remember a time when this wasn't happening to her, she had never felt so... happy. With a smile, she closed her eyes as the flood continued forcing itself through her. She fell asleep in Elysium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWicks looked down at the girl she was straddling. Jennifer looked like she was gone, which a noticeable drop in her breathing confirmed. She almost laughed; they were only about sixty people in, by her count. She continued feeding her for the next ten minutes before the last of her victims disappeared down Jennifer's throat. She rose to her feet and fetched a roll of toilet paper as Jennifer's colon finished emptying very audibly. Wicks congratulated herself for having had purchased this automated toilet bowl as she hoisted the naked girl up. She cleaned Jennifer's ass and then carried her over to the double bed. She tucked her in and watched her more a moment. A smile was plastered on her relaxed face. She looked so... innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the fuck did you kill Jacqueline Milton?\" Emily muttered to the unconscious girl before her as she stripped down to her underwear. She then took a long look at Jennifer's body, and after a moment of thought, removed her small-clothes as well. She climbed in besides Jennifer and wrapped her in an embraced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to do great things for us, Jennifer.\" She whispered into the sleeping girl's ear before closing her eyes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great things...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A soft sigh lulled Jennifer back to consciousness. She opened her eyes and glanced over her shoulders to meet Wicks' azure gaze. She smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Jennifer.\" Wicks said through her grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Jennifer replied. Emily released her grip on her and rolled onto her back, stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer sat up and climbed out of the bed. She stood up, and noticed something was missing; she wasn't in pain. She looked down at her bare foot; it was perfectly normal, not even a scratch on it. As a matter of fact, Jennifer noticed that even her scars were gone. That long scar on her thigh she got when she caught a cleat during a football game, the scar on her wrist when her cat scratched her, even the large one on her shoulder she got when she had a cancerous mole removed from her; all were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" She muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there,\" Wicks said, rising from the bed, \"You see the power of your birth. Those three hundred odd men and women from last night repaired you. Whenever you're hurt, just find some more \"volunteers\" to assist you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three hundred people...\" Jennifer mumbled. Three hundred. She had eaten three hundred people. They were a part of her now, where ever she went, there were hundreds walking alongside her. Inside her. Three hundred people, and they were all hers. She felt wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know, three hundred people is a lot, and you may be feeling some remorse, but through their sacrifice, you'll save thousands. Tens of thousands, even.\" Wicks said, mistaking Jennifer's withdrawal for guilt. Jennifer turned around and looked at Wicks, admiring the woman's naked body. She had the face of a model, the tits of a porn star, and the body of an Olympian. How many people had fed that exemplar of human beauty? With a quivering uterus, Jennifer looked to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily,\" she started, biting her lip, \"Blainey said you were the best at eating people in the state. How many people have you eaten?\" Wicks looked at her for a long while as Jennifer congratulated herself on not flubbing a single word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not say.\" she said softly, looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-why not?\" Jennifer tried to ask calmly, her pulse rising as she imagined the legions inside this woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's far too many. I've killed so many people, Jennifer.\" She looked away, tears in her azure eyes. \"For my own pleasure, I've cut short so many lives. How many mothers cried for hours after I took their child? How many fathers? How many friends and families stood somber as they buried an empty casket, as I sat on a toilet, squeezing what's left of their loved one out? How many sisters - oh god.\" Her voice cracked as she spoke. She turned away and began sobbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer didn't really feel much sympathy for Wicks' trepidation, but if there was anything she had learned in her years of wantonness, if she wanted her way into this woman's pants, she would need to comfort her when she needed it. Jennifer approached Wicks from behind, turned her around, and wrapped her a tight embrace, resting her head on the police commissioner's shoulder. Continuing to cry, Wicks placed her head on top of Jennifer's. She continued to sob for several minutes, as Jennifer's patience shrunk and her concupiscence grew. Finally, she stopped, with a weak voice, she began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Jennifer. I...\" She paused for a moment, \"My sister... How old are you Jennifer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm nineteen.\" Jennifer quickly responded, as softly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nineteen... My sister, Kimberly, was seventeen. I hadn't seen her since I was twenty six and she was fifteen. I had just been elected as police commissioner, so my family wanted to fly up from my hometown in Virginia to celebrate with me. They came, and we spent a lot of time together, seeing the city and such. I was really happy to see Kimberly, as I only saw her sparingly over the past several years over summer break, as I was working, and she was hanging out with her friends. One day, I got the idea in my head to teach Kimberly how to eat people, as I thought my life had improved significantly since Blainey taught me, and I figured starting her off younger would mean she would get more fun out of it. I approached her about it, and she was interested. I was ecstatic; I was already eating nearly two hundred people a day, and I had only been doing it for five years at that point, with me teaching Kimberly that young, she could be one of the greatest vorists in the world. So, I taught her, stretched her out, gave her Blainey's medicine ball treatment, the whole show, and I thought she was ready. I wanted to start her small, so that night for dinner I cleared out a middle school bus coming back from some field trip somewhere, and saved one of the little girls on board. I threw her into the car, and brought her back to my place, where Kimberly was waiting. I brought the girl before her, and told her all the steps, but Kim just sat there, staring at this little girl. When I was done talking, all she said was \"I don't want to do this.\" I kept trying to convince her, but every time all she would say was \"No, I don't want to do this, Em.\" Finally, I snapped. I looked at my sweet baby sister and said \"Kim, right now, you're a fucking sheep. And you know what happens to sheep?\" I grabbed the girl and swallowed her whole. Then I picked up Kim and brought her to my bathroom. I shat out the little girl and made Kim look at her. \"Do you want to be a fucking sheep, Kim?\" I said. \"Fuck you, Em.\" she said, walking out of my apartment. \"Fine, go then!\" I yelled after her, \"If you're not going to be a hunter, you're going to be prey!\" My family left the next day, and I kept trying to get into contact with Kimberly to apologize, but she would never answer or reply to my messages or phone calls. Then one day, she picked up. I apologized, and she forgave me, and we started talking again. After awhile, we started to talk about her coming up to visit me, and she made the arrangements, flight 602 out of Baltimore, touching down in the city last Tuesday, at 12:57 P.M. And so last Tuesday, I went down to the airport, and found that the place had been shut down. I showed them my credentials, and demanded to speak with whoever was in charge of the scene. They brought me to this guy Arnold Beecher who was with the F.B.I., I asked what was going on, and he said that their was an empty plane that had landed. I asked for the flight number, and he said 602. I had Metro Police working on the case five minutes later. I spent the rest of the day watching surveillance camera feeds from the Baltimore airport, and checking flight schedules and what have you. Around 2 A.M., I had the idea to check the flight itinerary, to see if Kim had even gotten on the flight. To my dismay, I read down the list, and saw her name. Kimberly Wicks, seat 27 B. And then I read through it again, and something caught my eye. Jacqueline Milton, seat 57 C.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit.\" Jennifer whispered. Wicks turned to her, both a fury and a sadness in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That fucking monster ate her. She ate her, absorbed every single fucking atom of her, and farted out her last breath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... so sorry.\" Jennifer said genuinely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that, Jennifer. You killed her. That monster who killed my baby sis, you ate her, and left her as a steaming pile of shit somewhere in the woods.\" Wicks said, hugging Jennifer tightly. The two stood for awhile in silence before Wicks began speaking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way,\" Wicks started, holding Jennifer at arm's length, \"You're all I have left of Kim. Milton turned her into a part of her, and you turned Milton into a part of you.\" She smiled, looking deeply into Jennifer's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... a way of looking at it, I suppose.\" Jennifer said, a bit creeped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... so beautiful, Jenny...\" Wicks said, cupping Jennifer's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm beautiful?!\" Jennifer started, getting ready to make her move, \"Have you ever seen yourself before, Emily? I'm a damn candle in the sun in comparis-\" Wicks interrupted Jennifer by jamming her tongue into her mouth. After a surprised moment, Jennifer returned the motion. The two kissed passionately for awhile, before Wicks effortlessly brought Jennifer onto the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's the police training at work.\" Jennifer thought as Wicks began kissing her way down Jennifer's body. \"...Annnnd there you go.\" Jennifer thought to herself as Wicks arrived at her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Jennifer looked up from between the police commissioner's legs, her hair and face wet with sweat and vaginal juices. She smiled at Wicks, whose face was similarly dressed. Returning the smile, Wicks locked her hands with Jennifer's as the two sat panting, looking up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to fix this, Jenny.\" Wicks started, breaking the silence. \"The vorists on the streets, the research teams, the Hawthornes, and Blainey. We're going to stop this before it gets any worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about after breakfast?\" Jennifer asked, suddenly being reminded of the void in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sure, let's go. I know a place.\" Wicks said, standing up and starting for her clothes. The two got dressed in silence before Jennifer rejoined her lover at the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are we going?\" Jennifer asked, re-clad in her light blue spaghetti strap and black short shorts. Wicks, once more clad in her stupidly tight black skirt, replied...</span></div></div>",

Not to mention I just ended a relationship Friday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boyfriend cheated on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boyfriend?\" Wicks asked, with a tinge of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my boyfriend, this guy Dave.\" Jennifer replied, looking over to Wicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, from the way you were back at the warehouse, I had thought you were...\" Wicks' voiced trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gay?\" Jennifer finished for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah.\" Wicks replied uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why you're skirting around it, you're the one that threw me onto the bed.\" Jennifer accused as they pulled onto a more maintained road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was lonely. I learned my baby sister had been killed by one of the greatest mass murderers in history, and then I have her avenger wrapped around me while we're both naked. It was spur of the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how did we get naked? I was already there, but you were fully clothed when I passed out.\" This caused Wicks to pause. After what seemed like a long time, Jennifer cut the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing wrong with being gay, Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying that,\" Wicks replied, \"It's just, I've never been with a woman before, I've never wanted to be with a woman before, but I'm sitting here, thinking about you naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, I'm flattered.\" Jennifer said insincerely. There was another long silence before Wicks broke it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you, Jenny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-\" Jennifer instinctively went to deny it, but then her mind flashed across the events of the past three days. She thought of her calculated plan where she made out with Melinda Scarzeni to get the drop on her. She thought of her and Jessica lying breathless on a dirt path, naked as the day they were born. She thought of Victoria - oh god, Victoria; her mind flashed through her teen-aged years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer and her football team had just won a game against a nearby school, but during the last twenty minutes, she had been cut by the cleats of one of her opponents when they both went for the ball. The cut was long, but shallow, and even though it hurt like hell, she finished the game, scoring a goal fifteen minutes later. Afterwards, everyone on the team had congratulated her on her three scores when they went into the locker room, but then Victoria approached her. She didn't say anything about her goals, she only placed a hang gingerly on her wounded leg and asked if she was okay. Afterwards, in the showers, Jennifer found herself constantly looking over at Victoria, sneaking peeks when she thought the curly haired brunette couldn't see her, but she knew that she had noticed. And yet, even after she knew she had been found out, she kept looking. Her and Victoria locked eyes for a moment as they were getting dressed later, and suddenly she felt weird. She fled the room without saying goodbye. That night, when she was fucking her boyfriend at the time, Tom, she imagined it was Victoria whose head was between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, Emily?\" Jennifer started, receiving sudden intuition regarding her life stance, \"There are people that I like.Those people have been both boys and girls. If liking a person who happens to be a girl that makes me gay, fuck it, I'm gay.\" Wicks thought on this for a moment before replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that makes me gay as well then.\" Another moment of silence before Wicks spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that Dave guy, he'll get what's coming to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He already did. Him and the chick he fucked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Wicks looked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, people who try to fuck me over have this horrible habit of falling into my stomach. Strangest thing.\" Wicks looked over confused for a moment before she realized who she was quoting. The two shared a smile and a chuckle. After ten minutes of silence, Wicks once more spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is this a thing?\" she asked. Jennifer thought about it for a moment, tonguing the words, before responding:</span></div></div>",

Glad to hear it... honey.\" Wicks said awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too babe.\" Jennifer said with over exaggerated confidence. They continued in silence for a few minutes before Wicks spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It going to be kind of weird to be fucking someone ten years younger then me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't be my first time with a geezer like yourself.\" Jennifer replied. Wicks' eyebrows furrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was fifteen, I started banging my twenty seven year old history teacher.\" Jennifer spoke, candidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Wicks exclaimed in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, third time, we got caught. I got a week suspension; he got fired, blacklisted, arrested, and put on a sex offender's list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer, that's not okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was young and stupid, he was hot and much more stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've ruined that man's life, he's never going to amount to anything because of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to talk about ruining lives? How many people have you eaten, Emily?\" Wicks paused for awhile, as Jennifer sat back, confident that she had \"won\" their argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight hundred and twenty three thousand.\" Wicks admitted after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight hundred...\" Jennifer repeated. Wicks remained silent. Jennifer looked over to her. Sadness was etched into her beautiful face. Sighing, she decided to try and change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I've told you about two of my bad relationships, you tell me about some of your's.\" After a moment, Wicks sighed and began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've actually not been in too many relationships. When I was in school, I spent most of my time studying and what have you, and when I got to university, every moment I didn't spend studying, I spent eating people, or practising to eat people. And when I got out of university, I spent all my time putting in hours with the force, so I could become commissioner. I've really only had two other relationships. First one was my freshman year. This nice black kid named Peter. He was funny, smart, and good looking, but after being in Blainey's class for about two weeks, I got curious, and poor Peter became victim number one. Second was this Hispanic guy, Carlos, that I started dating my senior year. We got along pretty well, and he was rather good looking, but one night he came home when he was supposed to be on holiday, and found me halfway through a truck full of people. And so Carlos joined them. How about you?\" Jennifer's face twisted into a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot more then two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a synapse then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine. I lost my virginity at thirteen to this Josh Willbrooks, who I dated for a few months, but then we broke up in search of new horizons. Uh... then I dated a few more kids who were too young and awkward to make a lasting impression. Then came that bit with the history teacher, then I was dating this guy Tom Oaks. He was probably the best person I slept with for awhile, but we broke up after he graduated later that year. Then came Nick Carroton, Tony Sanchez, John Carpenter, John Wilkins, and a couple more kids I forgot about, I'm sure. Then I got to university, and I started dating this guy Joseph, but I dumped him for this other guy Michael, and then there was this guy Randall Milkins, who got really aggressive with me at a party this one time. He grabbed me and started yelling at me, but I used to do a lot of martial arts during high school, so I managed to get free, and I broke his nose. He got angry, and tried to hit me, but that guy Dave, and this other kid, Aaron, held him back, before the guy hosting the party, this huge kid named Mike, literally threw him out. I slept with Aaron, and started dating Dave. And after that, I got with...\" Jennifer paused for a moment, \"My best friend Victoria, and then I fucked one of Blainey's TA's, Jessica. Oh, and after that, I started dating the Head Cop of America's second largest city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's quite the story,\" Wicks observed, \"But you paused for a second when you started talking about your friend Victoria. What's that about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now.\" Jennifer softly spoke, voice immediately becoming laden with grief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, we have to be honest with each other if this is going to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not. Now.\" Jennifer nearly spat, with a voice of ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. We're almost there anyway.\" The two traveled in silence for the next five minutes, before they pulled into a beach parking lot. Getting out of the car, Wicks pointed towards a small, light blue coliseum with a tarp covering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the place. A little area for families to get out of the sun for awhile. And a great spot for hungry women to take their fill. Let's go.\" Wicks started towards the building, Jennifer in tow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two continued across the oddly silent parking lot. The sun shown bright through the cloudless sky, causing the parking lot to radiate heat, the only thing keeping the weather from being uncomfortable a strong, salt-laden ocean breeze. Jennifer reveled in the familiar smell of the ocean. It reminded her of simpler days. She was harsh and cold towards everybody she met, Victoria was her friend for the long haul, and she could have any boy she saw elbow deep in her with a whispered word. So many memories at the beach within a gale of salt-stenched air, accompanied by the chorus of seagull's calls and the cacophony of the other beach goers. How the times have changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually changed...\" Jennifer thought to herself as she lent her ears her attention. They heard nothing, save the gulls and the winds. But that was it. She looked around. Half of the parking spots were filled, but there wasn't a person in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily...?\" Jennifer propositioned. Wicks held an open hand downwards, signifying for Jennifer to be quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" she whispered softly back. Jennifer watched her girlfriend's pupils dilate as they began to flicker back and forth, scanning the horizon. Her nostrils flared and unflared rapidly as she sniffed the air. After several moments, her eyes stopped on a green SUV in between a sedan and another SUV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There.\" She quietly said, starting towards it. \"Act natural, let me take care of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Jennifer whispered, concerned. Wicks shushed her as they continued to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie waited behind the green SUV, ready to pounce. She had watched the two beauties before her pull up,and had made ready to waylay them. She congratulated herself on her plan once more. After the initial wave of beach goers hit the scene, she had used her authority as one of the beach's lifeguards to close off the path that led from the parking lot to the beach, devouring anybody that had parked. So far, fourteen people had fallen to her ruse. Her blonde curls draped over her wide shoulders, she snuck a peek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere. Jennifer saw her as she peered from behind the vehicle. A cute, round face with large blue eyes. And then they were gone. She looked towards Wicks. There was a fierce determination on her as she eyed the spot where the girl's head had appeared. She strode forward with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit. They had seen her. Jamie knew they had seen her. Her muscular body flexed as she got ready to attack. When she peered out, she had seen two. The ebony haired girl looked to be a child, but she also looked to be incredibly athletic. The blonde looked to be a fully grown adult. She was much taller then the other, but she couldn't really tell if she was as in shape as her cohort; her massive tits pulled her clothes away from her body, making it much harder to see the outline of the woman's muscles. After a moment of thought, she decided to use her surprise to close the gap between her and the taller one. With a deep breath and a sudden burst of energy, Jamie jumped out from her cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer watched Wicks suddenly break into a run, moving on the balls of her feet so that she made little noise. In a blink, she was at the SUV. As the girl hopped up from behind the car, Wicks put a single foot on the vehicle's side. She pushed forward, shooting the verdant automobile into the sedan next to it at breakneck speed. The windows on the thing had cracked into an intricate web of glass, and a deep dent appeared around Wicks' foot. After the clamor had ceased, Jennifer heard the screaming. Looking over, she saw the girl, round face twisted in agony as she struggled in vain to push away the metal monstrosity that had crushed her legs between itself and the sedan behind her. Wicks strolled confidently around the vehicle until she was within a metre and a half of the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many?\" she demanded, with a voice full of authority. The curly haired blonde only continued to cry out in pain. Wordlessly, Wicks grabbed the bumper of the green SUV and pulled it towards her. The girl shrieked as her knees shifted to the side with a chorus of sickening pops. She uncontrollably vomited a clear liquid on herself. In but a few short seconds, her acids began eating their way through her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many?!\" Wicks reiterated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many what?!\" The girl sobbed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many people have you digested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was fifteen before you two.\" She slurred out, now bare chested, her modest breasts covered in both her digestive juices and what remained of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. In your lifetime.\" Wicks said, patience diminishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" she yelled back at her, before she renewed her screaming. Jennifer noticed how the previously clear liquid became red tinged, as the trapped woman's skin began to dissipate from her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" she begged in a cracking, eyes full of tears, \"... The pain...\" Half of her breasts were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many?\" Wicks once more questioned. The girl began to sob, sounds of sorrow mixed with those of agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thirty thousand, I don't know! Please make it stop...\" Jennifer could see her sternum within her wound, blood pouring out from the void that was once her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWicks grabbed the front of the SUV and pushed it aside, allowing the girl to clatter onto the ground. She curled up into a ball and cried for a moment, before Wicks scooped her up and swallowed her in one fluid half-second motion. Silence once more reigned over the parking lot as the two exchanged looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooo...?\" Wicks offered, drawing out the \"o.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really strong.\" Jennifer returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. Comes with the eating people domain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of eating people, how's she doing?\" Jennifer pointed at her date's midsection. In response, Wicks slightly lifted one of her legs and released a little *pfft,* a squeak of a fart. Jennifer chuckled as Wicks smiled to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's another potential thirty thousand saved.\" Wicks said, walking closer to Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A shame, she was rather pretty.\" Jennifer smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty, is it? Checking out other women directly in front of your girlfriend?\" Wicks accused jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but now's she's gone. I wouldn't worry about the competition.\" Jennifer said, bringing herself incredibly close to Wicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not gone, every last bit of her got digested into this.\" Wicks replied, smacking her shapely ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's mine, so I guess I own her now.\" Jennifer put her hands on Wicks' ass and gave her a quick peck on the lips. The two locked eyes for a long moment before breaking it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon,\" Jennifer started, walking towards the coliseum, \"I'm hungry as fuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Wicks agreed, following the younger woman.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two traveled through the vacant parking lot and onto a wooden path that rose over a salt marsh. They continued on the path for some fifty metres before ascending a set of stairs onto the board walk. Even this early in the morning, people abound around the festivities to be had; children darted in between the legs of adults, frolicking from overpriced game to overpriced game. Young couples held hands and looked longingly out onto the vast ocean. Crowds traveled to and fro, attending the many eateries and benches, before heading out to the beachfront. Jennifer began to salivate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how you feel.\" Wicks chimed in, catching Jennifer's avaricious stares. \"The whole world feels like a buffet, and all you gotta' do is dig in. It's quite a struggle to contain yourself sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just get to the coliseum before I snap.\" Jennifer commanded. The two made further progress along the boardwalk, their self-control being tested several times when children would dash by or in between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you really think that chick in the parking lot ate thirty thousand people?\" Jennifer asked, eager to set her mind to something other then those stupid kids. They're so close... She could just...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Wicks started, interrupting Jennifer's fantasy, \"I she felt closer to one thousand. Still advanced for the common vorist around here, but nothing that level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you tell?\" Jennifer inquired as the two were now thirty metres from their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a weird thing to tell. After a while, you get like, a taste for it. You can tell whether or not someone eats people on at least a biweekly basis through the taste, and through eating a lot of other vorists, you can start to differentiate them by how many people they've eaten. The ones that have had many people take a lot longer to break down, and they have a certain weight in your stomach.\" The two were now stood outside the building, stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really a knowledgeable source on these things, aren't you.\" Jennifer said, grabbing hold of the door handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Star pupil of one of, if not the greatest universities in the country for vore. Cannabalizer of nearly a million.\" Wicks dictated as the two entered the building. \"I would say I am indeed a good source.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked through a carpeted hallway for a short while before arriving at a pair of double doors. Visible through a small window was a medium sized amphitheater styled room. While not the main stage for the facility, the room could easily play privy to a small party, or a local band's concert, or even a poetry night or something of the sorts. Many families were lounging in the area, on benches, leaned against walls, stood towards the middle of the room. Some spoke among themselves, some let the children frolic freely, and others scolded their non-responsive young. A quick head count revealed that there was nine families, with maybe-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's thirty two people. nineteen are kids.\" Wicks reported, interrupting Jennifer's train of thought. \"Make sure you get ten, and I'll make sure I get twenty, then whomever grabs the last two gets the lasts two. Make sure you don't leave any stragglers, and try to be as quick as you can. I don't want these people to be sad or afraid before they die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it. I'll go left.\" Jennifer nodded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, let's go.\" With that, Wicks opened the door on the right gingerly, Jennifer doing the same to the left door. The couple approached the throng calmly. Until a little Asian boy made it within arm's reach of Jennifer. Her arms struck forth like cobras, grabbing the child by the shoulders. In the next breath, the boy's head was in her mouth. Jennifer moaned audibly as she swallowed deeply. The child was propelled into her up to his waist. Another swallow, and he was nothing but a bulge in her throat that traveled and disappeared into her midsection. A chorus of gasps and screams emerged as Jennifer released a petite burp. Far from done, the two woman sprung into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWicks strode forward with the speed of a photon, grabbing and practically inhaling an overweight white family, her arms moving too fast to be seen as she grabbed and pulled in the five in a blink of the eye. On the opposite side of the room, Jennifer choked down the mother and father of the little boy simultaneously, even as she held the couple's infant daughter. Three quick gulps spelt the end of mommy and daddy, and one additional sealed their daughter's fate. Jennifer moved on to a fleeing Hispanic family as Wicks swallowed the last of a black family. Without breaking stride, she lurched towards another nearby crowd as Jennifer swallowed the Hispanic mother in to her waist, sending her in after her two children. Her husband futilely grabbed for her legs, but he only accomplished getting pulled in himself. His arms already entrapped, Jennifer swallowed thrice, before moving on to the next batch. A single mother an her two sons fell prey to Wicks as Jennifer found a single father with his two daughters. When the father threw a punch at Jennifer, she quickly blocked it by placing her forearm at his elbow, halting the path of his fist before she quickly sweeped his legs out from under him with a brisk movement of her foot. As he clattered uselessly to the ground, Jennifer took one of the girls in each hand and brought them to her mouth. She shoved their heads into her own, and swallowed twice, and the girls were gone. As she reached down for their father, Wicks ingested a Hispanic family of five and stepped towards the last family in the room, even as Jennifer simultaneously lifted a family of three into her maw. Panting, she forced them down her throat into her already full belly with multiple forceful gulps. Still breathing hard, she spun about, and found herself alone in the room except for Wicks. As her older girlfriend let out an almost silent belch, Jennifer placed a hand on the potbelly she had grown and let fly a burp a truck driver would be impressed of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely.\" Wicks smiled at her, closing the gap between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Jennifer replied sarcastically. \"That hit the spot on the fucking head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you maybe.\" Wicks replied as she casually farted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You complain about me burping, then you stride over here to fart next to me?\" Jennifer prattled in fake alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to start? I was locking lips with you while you shat out three hundred corpses. Wasn't exactly roses, Jennifer.\" Jennifer replied only with a deep fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgive you Emily.\" Jennifer said, pecking her on the cheek. \"Now let's go find a bathroom, I'm not quite at your holiness' level where I don't need to shit anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right.\" Wicks replied. \"Follow me, there's a bathroom this way that has a toilet that can support your load. I used to use it all the time back in my early days of hunting.\" Wicks led the two out of the room, around a corner, and down a flight of stairs as Jennifer struggled to keep her rectum under her control. Once they arrived, Jennifer pulled down her pants and flung herself into one of the stalls, much to the surprise of a pair of women at the sink. Jennifer released her control over herself and let fly twelve digested humans into the bowl beneath her, all to a chorus of sickening squelches and plopping noises. After nearly two minutes, Jennifer stood, cleaned herself, flushed, and redressed before leaving the stall. Outside, the two woman were gone; only Wicks was present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful.\" she commented as a barely audible squeak emerged from her back end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you didn't like it, why did you stick around?\" Jennifer accused, washing her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" Wicks returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's next?\" Jennifer inquired as she dried herself. Wicks thought for a moment, then spoke:</span></div></div>",

R\u00f6ntgen Memorial, right?\"Jennifer's ears pricked up at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how do you know that?\" the tan beauty questioned. Her platinum blonde lover chuckled and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have access to census and population records, Blainey has access to the student directory, and your phone is bugged. Take your pick.\" Jennifer's expression twisted into surprise. Wicks caught her gaze before casually continuing \"Oh yeah, get rid of the black chip on the back of your phone's battery by the way, its a bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bugged my phone?!\" the raven haired woman nearly exploded as they passed back through the amphitheater where they had pleased their hunger some 3 minutes ago. \"If only for a moment...\" Jennifer thought to herself as she autonomously placed her left hand gently on her near perfectly flat belly. It roared and stabbed at her just as it had when she had first woken up, seeming to ignore the fact that it had digested 3 whole families less then 200 seconds ago. She bit her lip as she realized she needed more. 12 human beings had lived their lives destined to be a moment of satisfaction and a burp on Jennifer's breath, and her hunger didn't seem to care. Her stomach wanted more people to consume, to use up and absorb until they were forced out of her perfect ass, reduced from a sentient being to an unsatisfying meal lost somewhere in the confines of her skin, and a turd lost somewhere in the sewer system. Nothing sounded better to the newly discovered cannibal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, *I* didn't bug your phone.\" Emily responded, pulling Jennifer from her moment long stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then who did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you know Professor Hawthorne? One of Blainey's colleagues?\" Wicks inquired as they exited the amphitheater and started up the exit hallway. Jennifer thought about the name. She knew she had heard it before. Suddenly a sound played in her head, Professor Blainey's voice announcing a new TA, by the name of Meghan Hawthorne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah!\" she chortled. \"Yeah, I do, I ate her daughter!\" she bragged, slapping her stomach for emphasis, which illicited a roar as a light \"Urp\" forced itself out of her throat. Feeling more pressure rise from her new favorite organ, she then placed her second hand on her abdomen, slowly leaning forward as she slowly belched out an airy \"Orrrrrrrrrrrrruup\". It tasted exactly like her family-style breakfast. She smacked her lips after her burp, straining out as much flavor as possible while the uncomfortable emptiness in her belly grew painful, thoughts of her first meal not doing much in helping to abate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Wicks returned with genuine interest in her voice, ignoring her girlfriend acrid belch as it rolled over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. First person I ate actually.\" Jennifer said as she heard a child's laugh from outside. Her mouth immediately filled with saliva as her eyes shot towards the direction of the noise, which was unsurprisingly, the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... good.\" the Aryan woman answered with calculated words. \"Do you know which one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one?\" Jennifer responded, unsuccessfully forcing herself to ignore the cries of her prey. The laughter was close to the door, and it wasn't the only noise from that direction. \"I didn't know there were others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Haley, Meghan, and Kimberly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meghan, that was the one. Tall, blonde, attractive?\" She could filter the noises now. There were two separate laughters, as well more voices talking. She heard the words \"chase\" and \"get him\" said more then once, surmising that there was a game of tag, or something similar going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've pretty much just described all three of them, but yeah. Meghan was the middle sister, and the tamest of the three. Kimberly, the oldest, is a consistent \"I need to eat 40 people a day or I believe I'll starve to death\" type, and she's given Blainey a lot of trouble in the past by eating a good number of her research teams when she was a student of her's. Haley, the youngest, is a completely different story. Consider her a reason why it isn't safe to be in crowds in this city. She isn't a senior in high school yet and her death toll is in the hundreds of thousands, at least. There's even a rumor that she can swallow buses whole, and I can tell you for a fact that buses have been going missing for a lot longer then... Milton has been here.\" Emily's voice dripped with venom at the last few words. Jennifer puzzled at this for a moment before recalling the powerful black woman she had come far too close to losing a fight with, less then 24 hours ago. Apparently she was a devourer of millions, including her azure eyed girlfriend's younger sister. \"Or at least she was until I pinched out the loaf I digested her into.\" Jennifer mentally mused to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Jennifer returned, pulled back into conversation for a minute. She tried to picture a 15 year old Meghan, swallowing several football stadiums full of people, and then she envisioned the police cruiser footage Wicks had shown her of Jacqueline Milton swallowing a school bus whole, but with that same 15 year old Meghan standing where once a massive yellow machine did. Both times she could only picture the full toilet bowl in the lavatory behind v101 where she had shat the woman out instead of how she had looked as she foolishly crawled into her mouth. She shook the image from her head with a grimace, before she came to a realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I have heard those names before. One of Blainey's TAs, Jessica, told me about those two before. Also said she knew that I ate Meghan.\" Her mind flashed back to a bizarre, lust filled 20 minutes around midday, where she lay naked on a dirt path in the middle of an empty park, yellow blonde hair plastered to the inside of her thighs by two different people's sweat, the owner of that yellow head of hair stuffed face first into her pussy. She really did have a weird day yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Does Blaney know about it as well?\" Wicks inquired. Jennifer nodded. At this, Wicks' brow furrowed. \"Then I'm really starting to wonder why I didn't know.\" she breathed in a huff, clearly agitated about being kept out of the loop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" Jennifer shrugged. \"I could bring it up next time I see one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I imagine you might want to be seeing one of them soon.\" Wicks prompted again, her anger gone as quickly as it came, \"It's funny that you mentioned Jessica, because she's the one that put the bug in your phone, at some point around midday. Blainey has the tracker It's how we found you after you had passed out in Ai Gao's house.\" There was a twinge in Jennifer's motion. She couldn't imagine getting to her phone once she had discarded her parts was difficult. She had thought Jessica's advances were a bit sudden and random, but had thought nothing of it. Jennifer felt used, and that was not a feeling she was accustomed to. Anger, however, was such an emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck! Fuck her!\" Jennifer exploded, throwing her arms up in the air in a very animated motion. \"Oh, I am so eating her ass.\" she promised in a mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I thought we were in an exclusive thing?\" Wicks joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jennifer angrily demanded, before understanding the sexual implication of the last sentence, at which point she genuinely chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I meant it. I'm going to eat her ass. I'm also going to eat her pussy. And her legs, and her abdomen, and her very perky tits, and her lying little face, and her grimy bug planting hands. The whole package deal.\" Wicks gave a chuckle of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told Blainey you were going to. She said you would never notice that Jessica put it there. Tell me how she tastes.\" she winked at Jennifer, the tan woman realizing that her girlfriend was the sole reason she knew about Jessica's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a fan of Jessica's?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she's fine. She kind of has this frat boy mentality which makes her annoying to try to do anything serious with when Blainey brings her along. I just don't like that she's bugged my girlfriend's phone.\" she finished with a smile unbefitting the murder implication she had just given. \"Now come on, we've been standing in this hallway for like 5 minutes.\" she said, starting towards the door. Jennifer began following her before her ears found laughter again. As Emily reached for the handle, Jennifer tensed, realizing the laughter was growing closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door shot open, the police commissioner's hand inches from the handle. Two young boys shot through the open portal, past Wicks, and were upon Jennifer in a moment. Their clothes, hair, skin color, she would not have been able to say, for as they approached the jet haired model, her arms shot out, each hand grabbing one of the passing children by the lapel. A soft \"oomph\" escaped them as their momentum was suddenly halted. Jennifer lifted them both upwards, and pressed them against each other, back to back. Her mouth clamped down around the back of their necks, their heads making no bulge in the meaty prison that was her cheeks. She swallowed once, twi-, they both were greedily pulled down into her depths before she had even finished her second gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ourp.\" she belched as her gastric juices sloughed the skin and flesh from their bones, their nerve ending killed before they even noticed what had happened to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, quick reflexes.\" Wicks complimented, unaware of how long she had been craving the two laughing children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrruuuhhhp.\" Jennifer responded, belching out the air trapped in her meal's now liquefied lungs. In a moment they had been turned from children into a skeletons and a red puddle, and a moment after that, just a puddle. The sphincter below them opened, and they drained into Jennifer's intestines, ready to be absorbed by the gorgeous woman. She casually cut a fart as she went to rejoin her girlfriend.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The door opened to a short fifty year old Asian woman. Time had taken its toll on her, but she was still attractive, with large brown eyes and a sleek black bob. Her skin was still tautly to her smirking face, but several shallow wrinkles ran across it. Her body was thin and athletic underneath her thin light pink dress, despite her age. Her hips were wide, and her breasts apparent, but nothing out of the norm. She defiantly looked similar to the Asian girl Jennifer had for breakfast, as far as she could remember. Eager to abate the pain in her stomach, Jennifer pounced forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did all she normally did when she went to eat a person, but nothing seemed to work; she tried to engulf her prey's head, but the older woman quickly ducked backwards, anticipating the attack; she reached out to grab the woman at the hips, but her two hands shot out and grabbed her at the elbows; lastly, in a desperate attempt, Jennifer threw herself at the woman, head first, but her breakfast's mother quickly pulled her hands back in and shot them back out, halting her forward motion with incredible strength. Jennifer clamored to the ground uselessly, hitting the spruce with an \"oomph.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman triumphantly reached down and grabbed Jennifer by the top of her head, effortlessly picking her up with one hand. She lifted Jennifer directly upwards before placing her pink sneakers in her mouth. Regaining her senses, Jennifer groggily looked down as her would be snack relaxed her throat, and her bare legs slid down smoothly. The texture of the woman's esophagus was nice to the touch, and the gentle warmness was pleasant; the situation would have been relaxing if Jennifer didn't know what came next. She tried to flail her arms about, but found that her opponent had pinned them to her side. She struggled against her grip until her ass and abdomen had slid into her aggressor, at which point Jennifer sighed and loosened. As her breasts entered the older woman's throat, Jennifer realized she wasn't afraid of death. She closed her eyes and listened to the rhythmic swallowing that encompassed more and more of her with each passing moment. It was a soothing song. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gentle warm of the attractive woman's body covered her face, Jennifer wondered what it was like to be dead. \"Was there an afterlife, where she would be judged on what she had done in life, and punished accordingly?\" Jennifer wondered as she traveled down the esophagus, unable to breathe from the tight confines. \"Maybe it was just like a peaceful sleep\" she thought as the entirety of her was now inside the Asian woman's belly. \"Would I even know I'm dead?\" Was her last thought as the older woman's stomach began to convulse and spew forth a clear acid. The powerful muscles of the stomach squeezed on Jennifer's lithe form like an anaconda, snapping several of her ribs inwards such that they pierced her lungs. Jennifer sucked in air to no effect as pain rattled her body. Then the acid landed on her, eating through her perfect skin, well toned muscle, and small amounts of fat so quickly it caused no pain. As the crushing of the fifty year old's compactor -like stomach drove Jennifer's ribs further and further, wrapping them like tinfoil around her spine, she tried to scream with air that she didn't have, before she felt an odd numbness at her clavicle. Quickly looking, she saw that her cannibalizer's acid had eaten a nearly perfectly round tunnel downwards through her body. She wondered how far it had gone before the fluid reached her heart; liquefying it in a moment. Jennifer figured out the answer to life's greatest mystery as her killer released a hearty belch that was the air from her last breath. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now sure her prey was dead, she reduced the acidity of her gastric juices; it would take almost 12 hours to fully digest the girl, but the digestion would be much more complete, and leave little waste, such that she could shit what remained of her into a normal toilet bowl without issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that?\" Ai Gao's husband shouted from the living room in Mandarin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea, Jian. She was tasty though.\" Ai shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate another person? You already had two pizza men, a Chinese food deliverer, the maid, and two babysitters you called in!\" Jian exclaimed. \"Not to mention two pizzas and an order of Beef Lo Mein.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be fair, she attacked me.\" Ai said, entering the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Jian said, looking up from a novel, \"I hope you at least didn't make her suffer.\" Jian Gao was of an age and ethnicity with Ai, and shared her apparent ability to be resistant to aging. There were shallow wrinkles on his handsome face where two brown eyes stared at his wife with hints of sadness, understanding, and, attraction perhaps? His muscular body was well defined from years of running his own successful construction business, and his hands were well calloused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jian, I've been doing this since we were both children, back in Gansu. It definitely- Urppp\" Ai said, interrupted by an unexpected burp, \"hurt, but she was dead in seconds. Definitely not suffering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know where you put them away to, but damn can you put them.\" he muttered, looking to Ai's stomach, than fluttering to her rear before returning his gaze to his book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I put them in my stomach, silly.\" Ai said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What even happens to them after you eat them?\" Jian questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first i contract my stomach as tightly as I can. That holds them in place and breaks their ribs into their other organs, so their immobilized, and they start to die quicker than it would normally take. Next, I allow my body to digest as it would if I wasn't reducing the speed of the digestion. The acid tends to kill them a couple seconds afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like an absolutely terrible way to die.\" Jian responded, once more putting his book down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's quick at least, most die of the shock before the acid gets them. And besides, it's not that uncommon of a way to go. There's a few thousand women capable of it in this state alone.\" Ai said, reaching for her ringing phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I thought I had married someone unique.\" Jian said sarcastically. Ai playfully threw a pillow at him as she answered her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Ai said in slightly accented English. \"Yes, this is Mary. Oh Elizabeth! Hey how've you been? Sure, sure, we can take Sam and Sammy right in tomorrow! Three to five? Got it! Thank you for calling us! Bye!\" she put her phone away and reached for a notepad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow at three,\" she started, switching back to Mandarin, \"a thirty year old white woman is coming by to drop off her son and daughter off for a daycare business I told them we run. She thinks my name is Mary and your name is John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's a shame,\" Jian said, \"Don't you think she's going to miss her children after you make them lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it.\" Ai said, sitting down on a loveseat, \"She's going with them.\" she finished with a smirk. Jian smiled back, aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just another snack for my beautiful wife.\" he said, grinning like a school boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so.\" Ai giggled, \"I'm really glad I fell in love with someone who doesn't mind that I'm a child - eating monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I fell in love with you, regardless if you are a child - eating monster or not.\" Jian said, rising from his chair and walking over to the loveseat. He kissed Ai passionately and began undoing her dress. She stopped him and rose, effortlessly lifting Jian, their kiss unbroken. She carried him to their bedroom and tossed him onto the mattress. She removed her dress, bra, and underwear as Jian watched with beaming eyes. He than removed his own clothes, and pulled his boxers off over his erection. Ai jumped onto the bed, pushed Jian onto his back, and straddled him, riding him in a chorus of moans until they both finished simultaneously. Ai removed herself from Jian and laid down next to him, both panting heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirty-five years, and it's still as good.\" Ai said, threading her fingers through Jian's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Remember our first time?\" Jian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, The Baita Mountain Park, on a class trip. I was sixteen and you were fifteen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had been dating for a week, and had been friends for years. Our families didn't want us to see each other after they figured out, but the week afterwards both of all of our relatives mysteriously disappeared, and I could smell my mother in your burps.\" Jian said, patting Ai's stomach, which in turn elicited a lengthy and loud fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sorry.\" Ai said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was so nervous after I ate your family, I was sure before I did it that it was what I needed to, but afterwards I was convinced you would never want to see me again. I felt so bad as well when I ate my mother and my two little sisters were sitting there confused, asking me what I had done to her.\" Ai said, turning onto her side to face Jion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You actually had a conscious back then?\" Jion said jeeringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I felt bad sometimes. Mostly when it was children, or I had not eaten them the right way and they were sitting in me with a broken back crying out in pain as I slowly digested them. I don't really know how I got used to it. But here I am, forty years since I ate Nuan Li on a bet. I've probably eaten over half a million people, and I still get to have a normal life, with a loving husband, and two beautiful children. Life is odd in how it dispenses fortune. I don't know how nice things have happened to me.\" She turned away and stared off into space<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ai, you could eat a billion people before my eyes, and I would support you with every swallow. You are more important to me than anything in this world. If it was needed, I would let you eat me and the two kids for a snack.\" Ai turned about and smacked Jion on the arm with all the force her incredible metabolism could afford her, leaving a deep bruise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never say that, Max and Julie are our responsibility, we can't lose them for anything. I would die a thousand deaths before I would let something happen to them.\" Ai said, speaking a mile a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't feel that strongly about me, eh?\" Jion said jokingly, shrugging off the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Ai said, climbing on top of Jion, looking down on him, \"I was planning on giving you the grand tour of me before one of us dies. I was going to have you for a last meal on either your death bed, or mine.\" She gnashed her teeth playfully, smiling, her hanging breasts just touching Jion's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear.\" Jion said smiling. \"I've been waiting these thirty - five years wondering when you were going to turn me into your poop. Nice to finally have a date to look forward to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, I'm sorry I scared you.\" Ai said in a fake - sympathetic voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault, you're just a scary girl.\" Jion said. In response, Ai put up her hands like claws and made a \"rawr\" noise. Jion pulled her in and gave her a quick peck on the lips before their was a knocking at the door. Ai immediately jumped from the bed and quickly dressed herself, starting towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\" Jion asked, looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sixteen year old girl who runs a babysitting service. She's here to watch over our little baby Allen.\" Ai said with a smile, patting her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Round seven, eh?\" Jion said, watching his wife's rear as she left, entranced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet.\" she said as she left, her unshoed feet inaudible as she walked to the front door. There were several exchanged sentences too soft for Jion to understand, followed by the sound of the door closing. Next came a few seconds of struggle, punctuated by a long belch. Half a minute later, Ai stood in the doorway, having somewhere lost her clothes on the way. She looked seductively towards Jion before she broke the silence with a loud burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So good you had to taste her again?\" Jion said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Ai said, strutting towards the bed, \"Kinda like you. I've just had round seven, how about we have round two?\" Jion grinned and nodded as Ai jumped onto the bed.</span></div></div>",

With a yawn, she stood up and looked over to her clock; 5:30.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting old; I just slept for four hours during the day.\" Ai muttered to herself as she started towards her dresser. Passing by her mirror, she stopped to admire herself. If it weren't for the shallow wrinkles in her face, Ai would have looked thirty. Her breasts were firm and perky, her skin smooth and evenly coloured, her rear wide and voluptuous, her body thin and well defined. She stopped admiring herself and produced a semi-formal outfit from the dresser. She began dressing herself before she felt the urge to fart, which she did, but a foul odor and continued pressure spoke to her that yesterday's companions were asking to part ways. She hurried to the bathroom and removed her underwear before sitting down on the toilet. She quickly defected her meals out and cleaned herself before flushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back to her bedroom, she tried to recall the people she had just relieved herself of. Ai couldn't recall faces, but she remembered that she had four adults at a bus stop for breakfast, twelve second graders and a chaperon on a field trip to the famous observatory towards the richer part of the city, and ten elderly people at a retirement home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ai finished dressing herself, her stomach reminded her of her hunger, especially at the thought of her escapades in the retirement home the night before. So often were the elderly ignored as a source of food, but it works out quite nicely; from Ai's experience last night, they were too old to do anything in their defense, the orderlies that took care of them were prepared to lose them already, so when they turned up missing the next day, not many cared, and Ai found that when she actually went to do the deed, many among her prey didn't really care that they were going to die, having come to terms with it already. She really might want to look into going back later. She kind of regretted already making plans for dinner for the rest of the weekend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi walked the stairs onto the ground level of the building and turned into the living room, where she found...</span></div></div>",

It had always amazed Ai how she had watched a boy become a man, then a gangster, then a honest entrepreneur and father of two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly, Ai doubted that she would still be alive if not for Jian, who smuggled them out of China when Ai was twenty two. Chinese officials were not as blind to women eating people as American officers, and there were several times where Ai had almost been found out. They had been through so much together, and had given up everything for each other. Ai could honestly say she loved Jian, (and even though she would never admit to it) even more then her children, and when she looked in Jian's eyes, she could see that he felt the same; he could look past the fact that she had literally ate, digested, and shat out more people than some countries are composed of for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sleepy.\" Jian said in Cantonese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. When did I fall asleep?\" Ai asked, walking into the room and sitting on the couch next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Around 13:30. We had both finished, and one second we're cuddling, the next you're sound asleep.\" Jian said, putting a placeholder in his book and shutting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that last babysitter made me tired. What are you reading?\" Ai asked, segwaying the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, by William Shakespeare.\" he said, picking up the novel and reading the title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hired this kid named Jason who said he was going to school for Literature, and I've been trying to read more, so I asked him what he thought the best English book was. He said that most Literature critics agree that Hamlet is the best story ever written.\" Jian said, turning to face Ai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confusing, I'm pretty sure most of the words in here are not actually words in English, but there is a little dictionary on the side of every page that explains what Shakespeare was trying to say. But it's alright so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Say, I was going to head out to grab some dinner in a hour, did you want me to make you something before I go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm fine, thank you. Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know a woman by the name of Cynthia Sanchez? Lives three blocks from here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't believe so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, her daughter just turned fifteen, and they threw a \"Kawincerneera,\" I believe she called it, today for her. Pretty much a big Latin party to my understanding. There having the party at this rent - out place called \"The Ballroom\" about five minutes from here. Twelve people RSVP'd, and four more relatives are coming from the family itself, so there will be as many as twenty people there. The event ends at 20:00, so they've probably all ate and danced already, so I'm going to show up, start at the back, and corral them towards the front of the room, which has no exits, and from there pretty much just gorge myself.\" Ai rattled off, speaking faster and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks for the heist plans I guess, I'll keep them in mind.\" Jian said, looking bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heist? What's a heist?\" Ai asked, an almost childish look of questioning on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bank robbery. This other guy I hired, John, keeps inviting me to his house to watch American movies, because I asked him for recommendations once. He likes crime movies a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, are they any good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're fun to watch. But anyway, you're going to eat twenty people at once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And all of their food.\" Ai said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you can get the bathroom first tomorrow.\" Jian grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Ai said sarcastically. She gave him a quick peck on the cheek before standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't want anything, I'm going to head out. I'll be back for 21:00.\" Ai said, walking towards the front door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright honey, be safe!\" Jian shouted after her. Ai walked out the front door and across the yard, arriving at a relatively new black sedan. She produced a key ring, unlocked the car, and turned the ignition on. She backed out of her driveway and started towards \"The Ballroom.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After some five minutes driving down the avenue her neighborhood was connected to, Ai took a right and turned into the parking lot for The Ballroom. It was rather plain architecturally; a plain rectangular prism with only one floor, but there was clearly time and effort put into the paint job on the place, with many detailed paintings over a general white and gold motif. Ai certainly appreciated the aesthetics, and hoped that the building's owner wasn't inside; she liked what he had done with the place. She turned off her car, and started towards the brass handled oaken double doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed open the doors and walked through a entrance hall before throwing open another set of doors. Inside was the main hall; a Greco-Roman themed location with paintings of the culture's gods. Slow Latin music played throughout the red oak floored room, and over the two long hardwood tables. At the one on Ai's left sat 13 people, and the one on her right 7. Mostly Hispanic, the table on the left was comprised of the celebrated person's family; all adults, save for the girl herself, and another girl close to her age. The table on the right was comprised of a more polyethnic group, but all were around the Sanchez girl's age; friends from school, Ai deducted. They all sat, eating an array of breads, different styles of pork, and fruits, more of which Ai noticed were set up on serving trays on a table to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi's moth began to prematurely salivate she made her first move; she moved to the table on her right, grabbed two of the children (a blonde haired white girl and a black haired Asian boy), and shoved them into her mouth simultaneously. She swallowed once as the two were propelled into her up to their waist. Even as she did this, she stepped deftly further down the table and grabbed hold of a black haired black boy and a red headed white girl. Without breaking stride, she swallowed once again, bringing the first two into her up to their calves, and shoved her new two victims' heads into her mouth, alongside her previous prey's legs, before stepping once again, grabbing hold of another two, this time a black girl and an Asian girl. She swallowed, finishing off the first two and bringing numbers three and four in to their midsections. Following this, she shoved the heads of the black and Asian girls into her maw, alongside the torsos of the red haired girl and the black boy, causing her cheeks to expand almost comically, like a chipmunk's. She swallowed again; three and four's calves dangling from her mouth, as five and six's body from the waist down did the same. As Ai grabbed hold of the seventh and final person, a blonde haired white boy, someone from the other table shouted, getting their attention. Quickly, Ai shoved the blonde boy's head into her own, and choked down the conglomerate of people-turned-food with three successive swallows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a clamoring of  chairs as Ai turned around to see that all of the people at the opposite table had rose. Ai swiftly put herself between them and the door, her dexterity not addled by the seven people in her gut. The whole family began backing away en masse towards the back, away from Ai, with looks of fear and bewilderment on their faces. Chuckling, the fifty year old Chinese woman began advancing towards them. They continued to back away for about five metres, before one of them, an older, large man, wordlessly picked up a chair and ran at Ai, screaming. \"No, Papa!\" eminated from somewhere in the crowd as Ai continued her walk, unfazed. Once the two were close enough, the man swung the chair like a club as hard as he could. Ai deftly ducked backwards until the chair had past her, at which point she stepped forward and delivered a savage jab into the man's throat at a breakneck speed. He dropped the chair as his hands clutched for his neck and his face turned purple. Ai, without ceasing her strut, grabbed the man, lifted him clear over her head, opened her mouth, and allowed him to effortlessly slide into her.There was a moment of silence that Ai cut with a large belch and a smirk. The crowd erupted in a chorus of gasps and screams as they all started to panic, scattering in every direction, but whenever someone tried to move in a way that wasn't the way Ai wanted them to go, she interposed herself, causing the person to reel back in fear, until all twelve were huddled tightly in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this?\" came a whimpering voice from the recently turned fifteen year old girl. \"She's rather pretty.\" Ai remarked as she spread her smirk to a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all have to eat.\" she said advancing ever closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not food, we're people!\" came another voice that Ai couldn't quite pinpoint over the sound of the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately for you,\" Ai said, standing only about two metres from the group, \"You're about to find out how much you really are food.\" She put on her best sympathetic look before continuing; \"I wish I could tell you that you were all about to have a quick and painless death, but that would be a lie. Every last one of you is going to suffocate to death in my belly, and then I'm going to digest you, and shit what's left of your body out into the sewers. The police will never know what's happened to you and your families will spend their time wondering and crying about you. I also wish I could say I was sorry, but I'm not. But I do wish you luck in whatever life comes after this one. Good bye.\" With that, Ai dove into the crowd. In a flurry of screams, cries, and gulpings, she attacked the family, taking mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters in three at a time, all to the tune of slow Latin rhythms over a sad sounding voice in Spanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final swallow, Ai sent her last victim, ironically the girl whose party this had been, sprawling into her. She belched loudly as she checked her phone for the time. 18:30. Ai almost felt a tang of regret for her most recent meal, as when she ate more then ten people, she couldn't properly contract her stomach to kill them, and digesting them in the standard method would cause too many of their nutrients to be lost, so she had to slowly digest alive, meaning that they would all run out of air in minutes, while their skin was slowly melted off their bodies. Ai shuddered at the thought of seeing the sight going on inside of her. She started towards the banquet table next,demolishing the three trays of pork, the six loafs of bread, and the thirty odd assorted fruits before she perused the dining tables, devouring any morsel that the guests had left on their plates before she started back towards her car. Ai belched as fifteen year old Alyssa Sanchez released her final breath on a mound of her friends and families. At most, all these twenty people would ever amount to now would be a befuddled thought and a stain on a stranger's underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi pulled out of the parking lot, and started back for home as the sun set its marigold majesty on one of the last days of summer.</span></div></div>",

As she exited her vehicle, she put a single hand on her belly and belched loudly, tiny globules of saliva flying out of her mouth as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were really quite filling.\" Ai thought to herself as she walked up the stone pathway, \"I should treat myself to large meals like that more often.\" she walked up the stairs onto the deck and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jian, I'm back.\" she called as she entered and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back. How were they?\" Jian asked from the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very filling.\" Ai said as she walked into the living room. Jian was sat upon the couch, watching a movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too much?\" he asked, turning the volume of the television down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just a lot.

The duo watched the movie intently for several minutes before Ai place her head on Jian shoulder, which quickly devolved into the two cuddling. Ai, sleepy from her meal, closed her eyes, and in a few minutes, Jian heard her soft snoring. He tried to watch the movie, but soon after felt his eyelids becoming heavy. He turned the film off and settled back in with his snoozing wife, the contents of her stomach happily churning away audible. He closed his eyes with his arms wrapped around AI's midsection, quickly falling asleep to the sounds of her soft breathing. </span></div></div>",

Resolving to devote her attention to the next person she saw, Jennifer broke eye contact and continued down the path. After the woman passed her by, Jennifer felt something catch her leg. She fell to the ground, hitting it hard. With the wind knocked out of her, Jennifer tried to roll on her back and stand up, but there was a pressure on her back that prevented her from moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my, you are a gorgeous little aren't you?\" A soft voice whispered uncomfortably close to her ear. \"If I looked like you, I'd have all the men lining up for me doing whatever I asked, I would never have to leave my home. Yet here you are, beautiful, alone, and -\" she added, getting so close her lips touched Jennifer's ear. \"Defenseless.\" Jennifer was flipped on to her back, her assailant slamming her knee into her gut and applying pressure.With an \"oomph,\" she looked upon the black woman,her pearly white teeth revealed by a wolfish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Jacqueline.\" She said in a hushed malignant voice. \"What's yours?\" she continued, voice filled with venom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer.\" she replied calmly, despite feeling that she was about to get pretty intimate with Jacqueline. She wouldn't give her attacker the pleasure of her fear, she would die with her pride intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Jennifer, nice to meet you.\" Jacqueline said, predatory grin still plastered on her face, \"I judge by that look in your eyes you know what comes next. And still you're calm, you've got my respect for that. Good-bye, Jennifer.\" with that, she put her lips on Jennifer's and expanded them before sucking in hard. Jennifer shot up into the woman like dust into a vacuum cleaner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt like she was free falling for several seconds before she hit the elastic \"floor\" of Jacqueline's stomach. She stretched her arms as wide as she could but didn't touch the walls of her stomach. \"How big is this thing?\" Jennifer thought to herself before the ground began moving. She pulled out her phone and activated a flashlight application. She looked around, but the light didn't reach to the stomach's limit. It was then that a viscous clear fluid shot on to Jennifer's outstretched arm. She felt no pain, but dropped her phone anyway. She reached down to grab it, the flashlight pointing upwards, but she was unable to reach it. Confused, she thrusted her arm into the light. Or rather she thrusted what remained forth into the light. Her arm was a stub, non-existent past the elbow. Looking at the wound, Jennifer began breathing shallow and fast. Her arm was slowly liquefying before her eyes, bloody muscle turned into sickening red liquid before it spilled out of her arm and onto the floor. Jennifer's skin turned pale and clammy as she collapsed. More liquid shot forth onto her, eating through clothes, skin, fat, muscle, and bone instantaneously. Jennifer watched unconsciously as about 10 milliliters of the fluid landed on her chest. She felt no pain as it ate through her breasts and sternum in a tenth of a second, and felt nothing ever again as it borrowed through her heart. Her body was turned into a puddle a moment after. It was then that one of Jacqueline's sphincters opened, and Jennifer faded into the woman's intestines.</span></div></div>",

Reaching down, she pulled her pants back up and started jogging again, her powerful legs easily eating up the distance before her.

She wasn't even hungry as it was, having just cleared out near 250 people inside the park, deciding to treat herself to a large lunch. She left the shit she turned those men, woman, and children into at the bottom of a nearby lake before starting through the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline was twenty five years old, and had subsisted on adult humans since she was three, her first meal being her father and pregnant mother. She spent the next two years in an orphanage and slept in one of the place's common halls with 29 other children, but to those who ran the establishment's perpetual wonder and anger, come morning, Jacqueline was always alone. Orphans were shoveled unknowingly into her child-sized stomach day after day, until she turned five, when she went off to elementary school. Her first day in class, Jacqueline got bored and sent her teacher and screaming classmates on a one way trip to the toilet. Jacqueline arrived back to the orphanage on an empty bus, having clumsily guided it herself. Deciding that she was done with the orphanage, she spent the rest of that day hunting down and devouring the two hundred orphans and twenty staff members. Then the next day, she did the same at her school, and the next day she took to the town. In a week, not a single denizen of Jacqueline's home town had managed to escape her hunger, and she left in search of more prey. Newspapers across the south printed stories of how some two thousand people just disappeared in a town at the base of the Appalachians&gt; A week later, they published a similar story regarding the disappearance of a hundred and fifty from a nearby thorp. A week after that, the disappearance of five hundred more. Every week, Jacqueline gave the press another story, as the nation looked on in fearful bewilderment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jacqueline grew, her appetite followed, a normal meal for her consisting of a small town's population. Her presence caused mass hysteria and sparked en masse emigrations from areas where people thought she might turn up. Spiritual men claimed that the disappearances were the cause of God's wrath, as conspiracy theorists spoke of government propagated mass killings to push the nation towards totalitarianism through fear. She was responsible for some 11 million disappearances in the American South and personally halved the population of her home state of West Virginia. Jacqueline was born to consume, and played to her destiny well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline had never attended university, but a researcher at the nearby school, Professor Hawthorne, had heard of her capabilities and had asked her to fly up from the American southeast to provide field testing and data regarding a story she had heard through the grapevine.

Jacqueline had never attempted to swallow something as large as a bus before, and was intrigued by the notion. She was eager to try, and having a team working behind you always made things much easier, so she agreed to take the trip, arriving in the city's airport in a suspiciously empty plane. Providing her with a schedule of the bus stops around the city and a map of where they stopped, Hawthorne asked Jacqueline to recreate the story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, Jacqueline would confirm that the urban legend indeed held some credibility, as she had consumed two high school buses, a city line bus, and four elementary school buses for her breakfast yesterday, some 650 people and 94000 kilos of steel. In addition, she ingested 3 more high school buses for lunch, and 6 city line for her dinner. It was the first time she had felt full in quite some time, and if she could stomach 7 buses at once, it was defiantly in the realm of possibility that someone half her age could eat one. She was one her way to confirm the story with Professor Hawthorne when she had ran into Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming a happy song, Jacqueline continued down the path, towards the university.</span></div></div>",

In a few scant seconds Carmella shat out two human size turds and spewed forth a gout of urine before standing up and wiping herself. The Latina pulled up her khaki pants and stepped over the puddles of piss, so she could get her cleaning supplies.

Her milk white skin was covered with freckles, her round face\u007f topped by a short feminine mop of red hair. She was a very short woman, slightly more then a meter and a half tall. She wasn't what you would describe as fat, or even overweight for that matter, but the girl loved to eat, and her body definitely showed that, with a thick core, large c cup breasts, and a wide bubble butt, all of which observable on her short, shoulder-less blue dress. She was an exchange student from northern England, her soothing accent and genuine smile leaving a pleasant memory in the minds of most she met. <br>\r\nShe had a pretty difficult time making herself unavailable for this time of day, given the interest that the dozen or so people she had befriended since she arrived in the country had in her, but in pain in her gut was getting to an unbearable point. She had two slow walking black girls for breakfast that morning, and some poor freshman boy made the mistake of walking down an empty hallway with her an hour ago, but her empty stomach roared and gurgled at her, the naive freshmen already being processed further inside of her. She looked at her phone again. 1:13. She knew the class that taught vore to newbies got out at 1:15, and she could tell by the feelings she was getting from her belly that she wasn't going to be able to help herself after she finally got someone to eat. <br>\r\nDespite the fact that humans had been her sole diet for the past 3 years, Ashleigh still felt kinda bad about filling up on regular people as often as she did. She always found herself thinking about some concerned parent calling a phone she had digested, worried about their child she had shat out hours ago, and sympathized, imagining how destroyed her mother and father would be if the same happened to her. But come morning, the rumbling in her stomach would return, and later that night, she would imagine a dozen unanswered calls made to a dozen missing students being absorbed somewhere in her intestines. She didn't feel as bad if she felt her food was a bad person, and in her mind, girls who were actively trying to learn how to eat people made that cut. She thought it'd be a lot more dangerous, given what the students were being taught, but today would be her ninth time making a lunch out of the students leaving v101, and to her count, it was Ashleigh 34, v101 0. She checked her phone again, 1:14. She chugged the remaining 32 ounces of her coffee, and let out a brassy but soft \"uuurrahp\", which caused a short Hispanic girl at the table adjacent  to steal a look at her. \"Ugh, my burps still taste like freshman.\" she thought to herself, before she noticed the look of the girl a few tables down. \"Go on then,\" she internally challenged the girl, \"say something. I got an open space in my stomach with your name on it.\" The two made eye contact for a moment, before...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Are you serious?\" the girl said in a Valley-Girl accent, looking up from her phone \"That was like, so gross.\" Ashleigh felt her skin go hot with anger. She looked around quickly. There was no one around for a little distance. She walked up to the girl as her stomach began audibly growling.<br>\r\n\"It's not gross love.\" she said in her sing-songy voice as she stood as menacingly as she could at her height, \"That's just the way my body works. Here, let me show ya.\" Ashleigh wrapped the girl in a bear hug and effortlessly pulled her out of her seat. She then slammed her to the ground, leaving the Latin girl gasping in pain. The British redhead then grabbed both of the girl's ankles, one in each hand, and stuffed her feet into her mouth, the diameter of her open maw expanding to fit around them. She swallowed hard once, and the girl slid towards her a good foot as she was engulfed up to her knees, the pale English girl's lips forming around her calves as she brought them inside herself. Again she swallowed, and the Hispanic girl was left dangling upside down as her attacker engulfed her thighs and ass. Ashleigh then threw her torso backwards, leaving the girl's upper body perpendicular to the ground. She then opened her throat and let gravity do the rest of the work. The Latina dropped like a sack of rocks, her torso, arms, shoulder, and neck falling into Ashleigh's eager gurgling stomach. Only the woman's head exposed, her chin resting on the British girl's tongue with the rest of her body contained by her throat and stomach. Ashleigh reached out and grabbed her snacks's phone, which she had dropped on the table. Still unlocked, she opened a camera app, turned the camera around, and started a video. She looked into the lens and swallowed, the Latina girl screaming as her vision became the inside of the redhead's throat. Still looking into the camera, she followed her food's path down into her stomach using her finger, the outline of her prey's body and face still visible, smushed up against the inside of her stomach. She then tipped her head back, opened her mouth and her throat, and focused the camera on the clearly afraid girl bundled up inside her belly. \"Please...\" she begged through tears as she tried to reach a feeble arm up Ashleigh's esophagus. Ashleigh closed her throat on the arm and swallowed softly before closing her mouth. She licked her lips dramatically before panning the camera downwards and patting her roaring stomach. She rubbed her protruding gut for a little before it made a strange noise. After a moment, a massive \"URRRRAAUP\" exploded from Ashleigh's mouth.<br>\r\n\"Oh, 'scuse me!\" she said, proud of her belch. She then paused for a moment, before opening her mouth again to a more drawn out, airy \"uuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrraahp.\" She smiled warmly after she had finished forcing all of the air from her stomach.<br>\r\n\"Pardon my burp,\" she started, reciting a nursery rhythm; \"T'was rather rude. It wasn't me, blame my food!\" she forced herself to chuckle for the sake of the video.<br>\r\n\"Name's Ashleigh by the way, thanks for being a good bit of nosh for me. See ya when I have to use the loo tomorrow morning!\" with that, she cut the recording. She quickly typed her own number into the address for the video and sent it. She heard her phone buzz in her purse as she quickly popped her victim's device, page still open to the video she had just taken, in her mouth and swallowed. In her mind, the girl was watching the video right now inside of her, but from the gurgling her stomach was making, she doubted her food was having a peaceful enough of time in there to bother with it. She pettily burped again as she checked her phone. 1:16. She looked up just in time to see the door to the hall fly open, with dozens and dozen of freshmen girls flowing out. She watched the throng carefully as her stomach sent her another sharp pain, telling her it was nowhere near full. She licked her lips and watched. the majority of the girls walked in the same way, but Ashleigh noticed two girls with brightly colored hair break off to the side to chat, and a larger group of athletic looking girls, numbering 13, 14, 15, 16 people walk down a offshoot path that led to a small garden behind the hall. <br>\r\nAshleigh stopped to think for a moment, before her stomach's loud growling cut through her thoughts. Making a spur of the moment decision, Ashleigh...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The four girls enter into a large living room with five large couches and a couple recliners spread around the room and in the center of the room is Kayla ,definitely hard to miss,  she was sitting there totally nude and rubbing he enormous belly that was as large as her. Around the room there were other women in various states of undress and doing various activities. Some were partway down others throats and some were just relaxing rubbing their bulging bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, over here\u201d Erin call to the others. \u201cThis couch is empty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey follow Erin over to one of two empty couches on the left side of the room. Erin waste no time and strips her clothes off and gets on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you girl don't mind, but I think I will just watch the shows for now.\u201d  Stacey says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThats fine, your loss. We are going to get started.\u201d Jessica says and starts getting cozy with Erin and so does Julianne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey on the other hand sits down on the couch and get comfy to watch the show around her. Just as she gets comfy three girls walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure these things are safe.\u201d the first girl says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy friend told they were so lets just have fun.\u201d the second girl replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it looks like there is another party inside that girl.\u201d Says the third. Pointing at Kayla sitting in the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey head over towards her and when they are almost there the first girl says.\u201dLooks like there is a party going on in that belly of yours. How many girls are in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight now there are nine, but there is room for three more if you want to join them.\u201d Kayla responds.\u201dBut you might want to take of your clothes cuz they don't taste very good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three ladies strip and walk up closer to Kayla and she starts swallowing the first girl head first, slowly  sucking her in savoring her flavor. Her two friend watch as their friend slide down the redheads throat. As Kayla reaches her feet they give a little wiggle and are gone, down Kayla's gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don't you two lay down and give me your feet and I will suck you down at the same time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat should be fun\u201d the second girl says. And they lay down and present her their feet. She does exactly what she said she would and sucks them down in just a couple seconds. This startles Stacey a little she wasn't expecting any one to go in Kayla willingly. But it was a great show anyway.<br>\r\nStacey notices that there four new girls who had come in and had been watching the show also. Three of them look to be in there late teens and early twenties and the fourth was definitely older but still very attractive. Stacey can't help but watch them as they make their way to the empty couch next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite the show.\u201d The older lady says to Stacey \u201cI bet they had no idea that Kayla always digest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think they really had no idea\u201d Stacey says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably not.\u201d She says. \u201cYou must be new. I have never seen you at a Vorgy before. My name is Malinda and these lovely ladies are my daughters Marie, Kerri,  and Natalie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour daughters, really?\u201d Stacey says a little surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yea, its great family bonding.\u201d Malinda says. \u201cIs this couch taken?\u201d she says looking at the empty couch next to Stacey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNo, its open\u201d she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four ladies disrobe and get ready on the couch. Stacey just watches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalinda and her oldest daughter Marie look as if they are about to start making out but then Malinda's mouth opens wider and she engulfs Marie's head, slowly taking it in. At the same time the youngest , Natalie, starts to take in Kerri feet first. This is almost too much for Stacey as she slide her hand down her pants and starts rubbing her moist lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalinda skillfully works her daughter in a little bit at a time. Massaging her breasts to get them in her mouth she continues to swallow. Natalie on the other hand was moving quickly and Kerri was sure enjoying it. Kerri was already halfway down her little sisters throat. The two women continued like this for about ten minutes until they were finished and Malinda and Natalie lay side by side  rubbing their protruding bellies. Natalie looked about seven months pregnant while her mom only looked about 3 months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey continued to watch until Malinda noticed her watching and she quickly looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't be ashamed.\u201d Malinda says. \u201cYou can join her in my belly if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I know we will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud gurgling continues and several girls start rubbing them selves including Malinda and Natalie. After about ten minutes Kayla's stomach stopped thrashing about and started to smooth out and shrink. Stacey just stared and started rubbing herself more. Another fifteen minutes went by and Kayla's belly had reduced to half its original size. And was still shrinking. Stacey could hardly believe this. She was getting of to a woman digesting other women. She watched as Kayla finally was able to reach her pussy and started to masturbate.<br>\r\nStacey looked around and saw other women doing the same. Then she looked over at Malinda and Natalie and could not believe what she saw. They were furiously masturbating and as they did she could see their stomachs shrinking rapidly. After a few short moments Malinda and Natalie exploded into orgasms as their stomachs returned to normal. So did Stacey. Malinda had digested her daughter and Natalie had digested her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god\u201d Stacey says \u201cDid you two just digest them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we did. Sometime its hard to control you digesting when masturbating.\u201d She says breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horrifying thought come to Stacey's mind and she quickly turns towards her friends only to see Erin alone on the other side of the couch rubbing her pussy. Then she cums, squirting so hard some lands on Kayla's almost back to normal belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErin, you didn't?\u201d Stacey ask a little panicked.</span></div></div>",

As they hear this, Julianne and Jessica both step back alongside Stacey, the three girls all considering ditching the club before they too, end up on a trip to the pipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin, sensing her companion's distress, steps toward them and speaks. \"Hey, what they did was an accident, it doesn't really happen often, they just went a little overboard.\" She says, attempting to persuade the girls into letting Natalie and Malinda join in. \"Trust me, that's the first time I've seen them digest anybody in a while, and before now, they were only strangers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before now, you say. Now being completely okay with sending their own family through their digestive tracts.\" Stacey retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's not like we did it on purpose, and we've all known that there would be some... downsizing in the family eventually.\" Malinda cuts in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, they'll have a lot more self-control since they've had a meal recently.\" Erin points out, a claim that is not entirely true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Julianne says. \"But you're going in us, not the other way around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be fine.\" Natalie says with a shrug. \"Right mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine with just watching, for now.\" Malinda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that should settle things, any further objections?\" Erin says, turning toward her companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, Julianne, and Stacey all exchange nervous glances, and figure that they should be safe, yet silently make note to not visit the insides of Malinda or Natalie, just to stay on the safe side. After a brief moment, they all shrug, having nothing further to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, how about we get a little privacy for six of us?\" Erin says, motioning toward the staircase leading to the second story. The girls all follow Erin into a bedroom in the upstairs hallway, it's a decent sized room, enough space to accommodate the six women, including a queen-sized bed in one corner, a small closet in the furthest one, and a comfy looking chair in the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you girls all get ready while mom and I say our goodbyes.\" Natalie says before she leaves the bedroom with Malinda, towards the small upstairs bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think you're going to be needing those.\" Erin says to the others, referring to their now wet clothes. As Malinda and Natalie are off squeezing Marie and Kerri out of their rears, the girls all strip, quickly making themselves naked. And then after a couple minutes of waiting, Malinda and Natalie return, having finished their business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, aren't you quite the looker.\" Natalie says as she enters, and immediately gives Jessica's breasts a firm squeeze, who doesn't seem to mind it all that much, in fact she's rather pleased at the attention. Malinda grins as she watches Natalie's attentions while she closes the door behind her. After finishing her brief yet not unwelcome molestation, Natalie sits down on the ground as Malinda crawls onto the far end of the bed to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, who's going to be first to taste me?\" Natalie says lewdly as she spreads her legs, clearly showing that she intends to be pleasured before swallowed.</span></div></div>",

Erin was waiting for one of the girls to make a move, but after a brief moment, she looks at the others and notices their reluctance to approach the young woman, despite being told that she intends on being the one curled up within a stomach this time. It dawns on her that she's going to have to be the one to break the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the petite asain approaches, Natalie gives a barely noticeable squeal of delight as Erin moves aside her, her hand making it's way to her ready and waiting pussy. Malinda grins in delight as she watches the young woman pleasure her daughter, Erin's fingers teasing her slit while she moves in for a brief kiss. The others simply stare perplexed, unsure if they should stand and watch or join in on the action themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief moment, Erin gives a little push, gently making Natalie lay on her back before retrieving her fingers from the wet pussy. After getting the young woman in position, Erin crawls onto her, then turns to bring her head down to her eager nethers and begins licking. Natalie moans in pleasure as she stares at Erin's moist folds in front of her, the short girl too small to properly 69 with her flat on the floor, Natalie settles with rubbing the asain's lower lips with her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the other women in the room watch as the two girls pleasure each other, eagerly awaiting their next move. As a few minutes pass, Natalie's moans intensify as she begins to draw near orgasm. Noticing her raising arousal, Erin, without warning raises her head and slides herself forward, pushing herself away from Natalie between her legs. Confused, Natalie leans upward to see Erin turning around in front of her, her mouth beginning to stretch open somewhat. Knowing Erin's plan, Natalie brings her legs together and brings them toward Erin's mouth, who graciously accepts them, licking the feet for a moment before swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her daughter being ingested, Malinda's hand makes it's way down to her hips in a subtle manner, and a finger begins stroking her folds. Erin works her way up Natalie's legs with haste, bringing the woman's hips into her mouth in only a few seconds. With surprising strength, Erin lifts Natalie up into the air, and begins licking at the stimulated sweetness between her legs. Between the feeling of her legs being squeezed by Erin's throat, and the skilled attentions of her tongue, it doesn't take long for Natalie to scream out in orgasm, juices squirting onto her legs. Erin makes a moan of approval as she slowly swallows her meal down, taking her time to taste every inch of the delicious girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it up Erin, swallow my girl down.\" Malinda encourages as she begins slipping fingers into her nethers, seeking to enhance the pleasures of the show before her. It's hard to tell whether or not Erin acknowledged her, as she simply moans as she continues swallowing Natalie down. As the young woman's breasts enter her mouth, Erin pauses for a moment to taste the soft orbs, triggering an additional moan from her meal in her afterglow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three girls in the room were undeniably aroused from Erin's display, it begins as little touches, testing if their advances are welcome, it then moves onto brief strokes, as the three TAs begin to admire their bodies, and as they watch Erin resume her Natalie meal, the three girls are all exploring their bodies, too busy watching Erin to keep track of whose hands belong to who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie gives one last moan as Erin's lips close over her head, and after one last brief swallow, the last of the young woman is deposited into Erin's flat belly. Having finished swallowing Natalie, Erin gives one last moan of approval before standing back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A great show, Erin.\" Malinda says, not bothering to hide her arousal. \"As always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Erin says. Appreciating her complements. \"Would you like to keep watching, or would you like to put that body of yours to use?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more moan escape's Malinda's lips before she replies. \"I think it's time I had my fun now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what do you have in mind? I'm sure my company would love one more show.\" Erin says, looking toward the other three girls, their actions look like it could escalate into a real display of pleasure any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalinda replies. \"I'm sure they would absolutely love to watch me...\"</span></div></div>",

After breaking the kiss, she turns toward the three TAs and speaks. \"Hmm, Stacey, how about you join us for a bit?\" She says as she brings her hands toward Malinda's knees, spreading them apart. The three girls stare at Malinda's glistening wet folds, and no longer able to contain her urges, Stacey comes toward the two, crawling onto the bed between the mother's legs, stopping with her face at the pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Malinda gives out a loud moan as she feels Stacey go down on her, but is silenced as Erin comes in for another kiss. Surprised, Malinda's lips spread open, a reflex that she built up from her visits to this club. Erin's eyes go wide as she suddenly finds her head slipping into Malinda's mouth, staring down her throat. Stopping for a moment, Malinda realizes just what she's doing, and licks over Erin's face, enjoying her taste. A cute giggle escapes from Erin as she enjoys the feeling of the woman tasting her, then gives a quick gasp as her head is pulled downward into her throat. Slowly swallowing the small girl, Malinda gives out a loud, yet muffled moan, caused from both the taste of the girl between her lips, and the feeling of the other teasing her lower pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Julianne find themselves rubbing all over, forgetting about the show in front of them so they may focus on each other, watching the two quickly grow intimate, and noticing that she no longer has an audience, Malinda swallows hard, surprising Erin as she finds herself quickly traveling the rest of the way down the throat, curling up within the tight stomach in a matter of seconds. Malinda uses her hands to support the bulging belly containing her unhidden meal, preventing it from falling onto the girl eagerly devouring her nethers. Another moan escapes her lips as she feels Stacey's efforts intensify, and she bends her legs, pinning Stacey's hips with her feet, and pushes her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Stacey picks herself up and notices the squirming bulge containing Erin. \"A fine job.\" Malinda complements. \"But unless you want a reenactment of what happened to my little Marie, I suggest we cut our fun short.\" She points out, rubbing her belly, feeling Erin's form within. Stacey stares dumbfounded for a short moment, she hadn't noticed that Erin had been swallowed so quickly, and quickly realizes that if Malinda hadn't pushed her away, she may have indirectly caused Erin to be digested. \"How about you rejoin your friends?\" Malinda says, motioning toward Jessica and Julianne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning toward them, Stacey finds the other two TAs on the floor, Jessica laying on her back with her legs spread, moaning as Julianne rather skillfully dashes her tongue in and out of her moist center. Stacey, still ready and willing for a little fun, approaches Jessica from her head, and leans downward, slipping her tongue into her mouth as her hands move forward, fondling her breasts. Pausing for a brief moment. Julianne looks forward and notices Stacey at the front side, and decides that it is now time to make her move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, enjoying Stacey's attentions with her breasts and mouth, is a little confused, but not very concerned when she feels Julianne stop, but quickly realizes that something's wrong as she feels her legs being forced together, immediately followed with her feet being engulfed by something unmistakeably warm and wet, and after a second, the warm, wet feeling begins quickly spreading up her legs. Jessica tries to sit back up, but can't move anywhere with Stacey in the way, who is enjoying the feeling of her plump breasts too much to care much for her attempts to push against her. Realizing that she's not going to accomplish much, Jessica simply lies still, knowing that she's not going anywhere except Julianne's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Stacey feels something wet crawl over her hands, and breaks the kiss as she looks forward, her heart skips a beat as she finds her breast-grasping hands engulfed by Julianne's mouth, who has been for the last moment working her way up Jessica. She briefly considers allowing Julianne to continue, joining Jessica in her trip into Julianne, but decides against ending up inside anyone's stomach for the moment, and quickly pulls her hands out just before Julianne swallows. With Stacey no longer in the way, Julianne sits up and points her head upward, lifting Jessica into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess this is payback for earlier.\" Jessica says in an annoyed tone just before Julianne swallows, sending her meal to curl up inside of her stomach in one last quick motion. Patting her buling, Jessica-filled belly, Stacey begins utilizing her hiding techniques, causing the bulge to disappear within a short moment. Still in the mood, Stacey scoots closer to Julianne, and embraces her into a kiss, which lasts for a moment before their world suddenly goes dark, and the two girls find themselves both being squeezed into a tight, fleshy tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Erin sat comfortably within Malinda's stomach, she was quite surprised how her devourer had suddenly picked up the pace like that, and nearly panicked for a short moment, fearing for her life as she heard Stacey pleasuring the woman that had swallowed her. She dreaded her situation for a moment before she heard Malinda drive Stacey away. Believing herself to be safe, Erin curled up within the tight stomach for a while before she suddenly found her surroundings growing larger, and her Natalie-filled belly bulging out. Erin was a little surprised, she wasn't aware that Malinda had gotten this far with hiding techniques, but welcomed the additional space, and decided to uncurl herself and lay straight on the bottom of the stomach, waiting for when she would be released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, as she lays within Malinda's stomach, Erin hears commotion coming from above, her eyes adjusted to the darkness, she sits back up and notices Stacey, alongside a large-bellied Julianne squeeze though the sphincter, joining her within the cavernous stomach, as the sphincter releases them, the two lose their hold on each other as they plummet into the soft stomach walls. \"Ugh, should have known she'd pull that.\" Julianne says as she and Stacey get their bearings, Erin notices Stacey's ass pointed straight at her, and acts quickly, darting forward and engulfing the girl's tasty rear. The poor girl doesn't even have time to make a sound before she finds herself pulled backwards, and squeezed into another brief trip through someone's throat, soon finding herself packed tightly against another girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you could join me, I was getting a little lonely.\" Erin says as she rubs her belly, which bulges out quite a ways, her hiding techniques less effective due to being hidden herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh be quiet you, I didn't have this in mind when I came here.\" Julianne replies. \"Where's Stacey?\" She asks, not feeling her anywhere nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting acquainted with Natalie.\" Erin says giggling as she gives her belly a quick pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate her!? Why did you do that! We might need her help to get out of here.\" Julianne says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Because I thought she had a tasty butt, and I was right.\" Erin says, licking her lips. \"Besides, you may have had a bad first impression with what happened to Marie, but Malinda's accommodations are nice, and she should be letting us out soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph, \"soon\", that's reassuring.\" Julianne pouts.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica, a little wilder than her two TA friends, usually the exhibitionist of the three. Perhaps not that surprising with her body, but she had an easier going attitude on things like this and hardly missed a beat before deciding that she would go down on the girl to get the action going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie leaned back, supported on her straight arms to enjoy the ministrations of the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey in turn took Erin's hand and brought it to her mouth. The little Asian stopped her though, as she noticed that Julianne seemed to have her attention on Jessica and Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's take the chair shall we?\u201d Erin proposed, but she started walking without waiting for an answer, pulling the larger girl along with little effort, but then Stacey didn't really resist her either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed Stacey into the recliner. \u201cPlease take your time, I really want to watch the other girls.\u201d Erin said and she climbed up in Stacey's lap before flopping down on her belly, sliding down with her head on the floor, supporting it with her arms and offering her feet to the girl sitting in the chair.<br>\r\nA position that enabled both of them to watch, at least for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHardly had they taken that position before the hesitant Julianne finally decided what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe circled the two girls on the floor, taking up position behind Natalie and bowed down to engulf the girl's head. Just then Natalie clasped her legs onto Jessica for anchorage, so that she wouldn't topple over. At the same time removing the support of her hands as she brought them up to the upper arms of the girl assaulting her from behind, with quite a show of strength she pinned them to the sides of the girl and heaved the girl up over her head holding her in that position, with legs flailing above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait wait!\u201d Julianne shouted as she watched the girl, now below her open her mouth wider and wider. \u201cWe were supposed to eat you, remember? And the other end was taken...\u201d She said nodding towards Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah...sorry...\u201d Natalie said as she set the girl down again. \u201c...reflex...\u201d she excused herself. \u201c...please continue...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe display had caused Stacey to hold her breath as a shiver went down her spine. She was able to relax though as she saw that Julianne was allowed to swallow the girl and soon both head and shoulders had entered the smaller girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising that she'd hardly touched Erin she sucked hard as she leaned forward in the chair, slurping up those tasty Asian legs like noodles and making them bend as the feet hit the bottom of her stomach. <br>\r\nShe paused there for a moment as she could still watch Julianne slowly engulfing Natalie, but it was hard to take in more of Erin in this position as there was no room for her own belly to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo determined to not miss too much of the show she quickly grabbed Erin's waist and hoisted the girl up over her head, before swallowing hard and cramming the girl down her throat, which caused Erin to yelp in surprise and protest. But then as Erin's head entered her mouth she stopped and halted the girl's decent into her stomach.<br>\r\nWith Erin's head in the back of her mouth and throat and with Erin's arms sticking out, holding her mouth open, they could both watch the other girls and in this position Stacey kept them as she rubbed Erin's body through her own skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there they watched as Julianne closed in on Natalie's hips, clearly Julianne was hiding the girl as she went for there was hardly a dent in her pleasing frame, It's also looked as if Jessica had seen her intentions and decided not to play along, for as Julianne reached out to hold Jessica in place as she continued, Jessica jerked away and brought Natalie's legs together as she held them down, forcing Julianne to remain at floor level while Jessica could reach forward and pin the smaller girl's arms to her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Natalie's legs sliding down Julianne's throat, Jessica opened her mouth and lifted the smaller girl up into it, quickly shifting her grip so that she still held the girl's arms in place while she gobbled up her torso, including the barely visible bulge that was Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin had expected Jessica to pause at some point, but as she just kept on stuffing Julianne down her throat, so it wasn't long before the girl's legs were the only thing left and they too were sliding down quickly. <br>\r\nSeeing this Erin let herself slide on down as well and settled in the sizeable potbelly that she ended up giving Stacey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica couldn't help rubbing her bulging belly as she got to her feet, it felt nice, there seemed to be quite the commotion in there, she chuckled a little, Julianne had obviously wanted to eat her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then she felt a pair of arms around her who's hands started groping her breasts.<br>\r\n\u201cMmm... that was delicious to watch... I wonder if it tastes the same...\u201d Jessica heard the woman behind her say, before she felt a pair of lips spread over the back of her head and down over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey who with the show over had turned to her own belly and it's occupant looked up and watched in surprise as she saw Jessica in a very smooth motion veritably slide up into and then down the throat of Malinda, it was almost graceful, but it wasn't very comforting. It didn't help that Malinda seemed to be enjoying herself to the fullest and that her hands caressed her own body, including a soft, but still flat belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Stacey eyeing her Malinda walked on over. \u201cOh, don't worry, it's all in good fun. Speaking of fun, I really wouldn't mind a bit more, I hope you don't mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't wait for Stacey to answer, she just quickly reached down and stuffed Stacey's feet into her mouth. Then Stacey got to experience that smooth slide for herself, a continuous even suction pulled her in and straight down the woman's throat, in mere seconds Malinda was the only one left in the room and to her delight she did sport a bit of a belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down in the chair Stacey had occupied she settled for enjoying the commotion inside, for there was certainly something going on that she wasn't the cause of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the inside the commotion Jessica had felt that had been pleasant at first, but became quite uncomfortable as she felt something move up her throat. She couldn't see anything in the dark place she was in, but she was pretty sure it was a girl, it was a bit problematic to ask questions though with your throat full, so she settled for waiting until the girl was out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wait wasn't long, the girl quickly forced her mouth open and heaved her body out in a well practised manner. What surprised Jessica was that her belly felt empty, but that surprise was quickly exchanged with that of her head getting engulfed almost before the girl had managed to exit fully.<br>\r\nHer struggles were quite futile as the girl knew well what she was doing, in just a moment Jessica found herself in her previous meal's stomach, curled up with another girl no less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessica is that you?\u201d The girl asked and Jessica recognised Julianne's frightened voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't get much chance to answer though as Natalie's body tensed up as she struggled, clearly not content with her situation. They felt something impact on their captor and felt her tumble down again but she was up before they could gather their breaths and at it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalinda looked down on her belly with a bit of displeasure, one of the girls had forced her throat open and was quickly making their way back up, she considered swallowing and use other techniques to try and make it hard for the girl, but she decided to let let girl come on out, struggling with her would only prolong the discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a bit surprised as she bent forward ad let the girl slide out on the floor to see that it was Natalie. Although her daughter's belly was completely flat, she could tell that her own had been robbed of more than just one girl, it felt like only Stacey and Erin were left in there, a guess that seemed all the more likely judging by the grin on her daughter's face as she got up off the floor, idly caressing her belly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the girls all deposited within their bellies, Malinda and Natalie both figure that they've both had their fun, and decide to rejoin the club. As they caress their flat midsections, they briefly ponder what they shall do with all the girls trapped within, but figure that the group of girls are much too fun and friendly to digest yet. Leaving the clothes of the three TAs behind, the two women make their way back to the staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approach the stairs, the two hear the familiar sound of heavy footsteps drawing near, and catch sight of a shadow being cast on the wall, someone else making their way to the second story. Stopping for a moment, the two wisely refrain from getting too close to the currently unidentified woman, but as Malinda catches sight of the plump, naked beauty heading up the stairs, she happily moves forward, extending her arm in greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candice!\" Malinda says as she approaches her, kissing her on the cheek. \"It's been a while! How have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could ask the same thing.\" Candice says, and returns the kiss, this one planted firmly onto Malinda's lips. \"And who might this delectable dame be?\" She says, pulling away from Malinda and approaching Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Natalie.\" She says, extending her hand in greetings. \"I'm guessing you're a fri-\" Is all she manages to say before Candice suddenly takes her arm, pulling it into her mouth. A slight \"EEP\" escapes the girl's lips as she's sucked with great speed into the woman's mouth. Natalie freezes as her mind processes what just happened, one instant she was greeting this woman, and the next she found herself completely inside someone's mouth, sprawled out on a gigantic tongue. Immediately the tongue presses her gently against the top of the mouth, and begins rubbing her against it, drenching her in saliva. After getting over her brief panic, she finds herself enjoying the feeling of the large, wet organ slathering itself all over her, but all too soon it suddenly it brings her back down and tilts backward, causing her to slide down into the throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Candice gulps, Malinda watches as a barely visible bulge containing her daughter makes it's way down Candice's throat, making it's way to her stomach. The sight of her daughter being devoured in such a simple manner excites her. Candice gives out a moan of approval as she feels her meal pass her sphincter, entering the currently inactive digestive chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be my last surviving daughter.\" Malinda points out, her voice clearly showing arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhmm.\" Candice moans, nodding. \"Now that you mention it, she does have your taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why the absence? I thought you loved it here, all this time I assumed that someone's belly finally claimed you.\" Malinda asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I had to leave on a business trip for a few weeks, I'm all too glad to be back, and I just had to get acquainted after a little birdie told me you were up here with five or so little treats, your lovely little Natalie was one, and I felt two inside her, so, am I incorrect in guessing that you have the rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" Malinda says, giving her trim belly a little stroke, feeling the two small bulges within. \"But I'd rather not be digesting them for now, and you've got my girl inside you, so I'm afraid I must decline what I believe you have in mind for a reunion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Candice gives a disappointed moan. \"I guess I'll just have to wait for now.\" She pauses, thinking of some other activity. \"I saw Olivia gathering a few treats earlier, I believe that she may be organizing one of her silly games.\" She recalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that I don't like getting involved with any of her outright suicidal activities, and I honestly believe that she tips the results of her so called \"games of chance\" in her favor.\" Malinda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but they're always a good deal fun to watch, there's just something fascinating about watching all the girls fidget in their seats, cursing themselves for joining in having been convinced with promises of delicious young ladies digesting away within them without repercussions, knowing full well that one unlucky roll of the dice could end up with them melting away within another, and leaving will only incur the wrath of all the other competitors.\" Candice says, taking on a sultry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. I suppose that it won't hurt to watch, from a safe distance.\" Malinda says. \"I still can't believe that my girls all insisted on attending her games so many times, and I'm honestly surprised that I lost all but Natalie to anything but them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Candice thinks. \"Perhaps Olivia gives a bit of an advantage to those she likes.\" She muses. \"Anyway, let's head on down, shall we?\"</span></div></div>",

Long time, no see.\u201d She smiles \u201cAnd I'm trying to organize a game of poker, you in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh, no.\u201d Candice had to admit she was tempted, but at the same time she already had a three girl belly-filler. \u201cWe would however like to watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia snarled \u201cYou know I really don't like people who want the show, but not the stakes, but al-right, for old times sake. But then you have to promise to make sure no one else tries to get a free show and make sure that the girls that lose don't escape the punishment of losing. Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I can live with that.\u201d Malinda agreed, to which Candice added a nodding \u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long after that that everyone had gathered in the room next to where the three TAs' clothes still garnished the floor. Here they had put a couple of tables together to make one large enough to fit all participants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright people, cough up your passengers so they can join in. I'd prefer if I only have to go over the rules once.\u201d Olivia said loud enough to get everyone's attention and as a result a few girls coughed up a few more attendees, making it a grand total of twelve players, plus Candice and Malinda as acting guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe rules are fairly simple, it's standard Texas hold'em with limited bets, which means that bets are the same as the large blind for the pre-flop and the flop rounds and twice the big blind for the turn and river rounds. <br>\r\nThe blinds will be two equal blind bets of five each.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen there are the house rules which makes things interesting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone starts will a hundred in markers, these are your full health and you're not allowed to leave the table unless you have at least a hundred markers to remove from the game, unless the game is over of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf a player becomes bankrupt, then she must remain anyway, but is out of the game. Other players may chose to remove a hundred markers from the game, which represents the markers the bankrupt player entered the game with. Buying a bankrupt player makes her your bitch for the rest of the game and an hour after as well.<br>\r\nHowever in order to be able to buy, you must have at least one hundred markers left after the purchase, in other words you need at least two hundred in order to buy someone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo make things a little more interesting no player may hold more than three hundred markers at anyone point, unless there are no broke players to buy. This means that if you have three hundred in markers, you have to buy a girl if or when one is available.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, seeing as we are....twelve players, the game ends with a final auction when sixhundred markers have been removed from the game. The auction has all the remaining players with more than a hundred markers bid on any remaining broke players.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen the auction is over, the game is over and the remaining players can leave the table and any bitches should do as their new owners tells them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, what if someone buys a girl and then goes bankrupt herself and gets bought?\u201d Iris asked as she looked forward to possible intricate developments of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the order still applies, the first bankrupt girl is still the bitch of the second, though her owner in turn might make demands of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no one else raising any questions Olivia produced a case of makers and removed twelve-hundred in fives and tens, which she distributed to the players so that each had a hundred in markers.<br>\r\nShe then produced a card deck and after some thorough shuffling and with the blind bets having been pitched in, she dealt each player two cards, which meant that the game was afoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeated at the table, going clockwise from the lithe, red-headed Olivia, who was the dealer for the first hand of the game, were Carol, then Alex, who were the ones placing in the blind bets for this hand. Then Gina, who'd be the one starting the actual betting. <br>\r\nAfter Gina sat Vera, another redhead with long vibrant hair. She was followed by Cindy, a lusciously long haired blonde. Following her in turn was Wendy and then the short Mindy, whom had her bleach blonde hair a bit matted, as she was still wet from Vera having brought her along.<br>\r\nThen there was Mary, the curvaceous girl, with a short mop of black hair, who had a similar appearance from having gotten there inside Cindy's gut.<br>\r\nNext in line Was Helen, who stroked her belly with a wanton feeling, having just been made to release Iris, who was the last, sitting next to Olivia, but between her and Helen, Sarah had squeezed her self in and she was trying to keep her dark hair from falling back into her face while she awaited her cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina, first after the blinds had the opportunity to start the betting and decided to do so. <br>\r\nVera tagged along not wanting to quit before seeing the flop at least, but Cindy folded while Wendy didn't. Mindy too decided to fold, while Mary raised the bet, causing Helen and Sarah to fold.<br>\r\nIris decided to call, as did Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her blind bet counting towards her bet, Carol would only need to put in another five, but she still decided to fold. Alex however joined in and the remaining girls matched Mary's bet to see the flop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carol was out, this left Alex to bet, but she decided to just check, as did everyone else, so Olivia stepped in and raised a five. \u201cCan't have such a chicken-game, can we?\u201d She teased, not showing a hint that she only had a pair of threes and a knight kicker so far. Still it caused Alex and Vera to fold, who'd both been hoping for a flush, but with three different colours in the flop there was little hope of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest tagged along though and Mary even considered raising the bet again as her pair of kings felt pretty solid with a nine being the high card in the flop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turn revealed another three and didn't inspire much confidence in anyone but Olivia even though it meant that three of the five remaining girls had two pairs, one of those were on the table and it also made Iris give up her hopes of getting a straight, so when Olivia again raised the bet she decided to fold. The other remaining girls also considered it as the bets were now ten at a time, but they all stayed in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ten of diamonds was what the river flushed out and again only Olivia raised the stakes Making Gina fold, but Wendy and Mary decided to call and see it through to the showdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's his name?\u201d Olivia said and presented her lurking jack \u201c...then three, three and three.\u201d She added pointing first at the table and then revealing the last three from her hand. A hand that beat both Wendy's nines and threes and Mary's kings and threes and making her claim the pot of a hundred and seventy, bringing her to a total of twohundred and thirtyfive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalinda wasn't surprised that Olivia had won the hand, but she had no idea how she would have been able to cheat, three of a kind in threes with that many players wasn't exactly the most solid hand either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia then turned over the deck to Carol, who'd be the dealer for the next hand.</span></div></div>",

A wise choice considering that the river revealed a jack of hearts, which would have helped neither of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made Alex cocky enough to bet though, as it meant that with the two jacks on the table she now had three of a kind with king-queen kickers. Gina folded, not quite trusting her tens and jacks to be up for the challenge, Vera too felt that two pairs wouldn't do even if her kings were better than Gina's tens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen and Iris had both considered folding earlier with both holding two hearts that followed one another they had hoped for either straight or flush and the flop had only granted them one heart, but it had meant that Helen would only need one more card for a straight so she'd kept in and Iris had gotten a pair which was the little encouragement she needed to keep going. They had both been surprised when the turn and river turned up two more hearts giving them both flush, so they saw no trouble in meeting Alex's bet, Helen even raised it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Alex realised that there were three hearts on the table and got cold feet, so she chickened out, making Helen and Iris reveal their cards and to Iris's disappointment she saw that together with the five of hearts from the flop they would have had a straight flush, the problem being that she held the lower cards of the straight, meaning that the pot of a hundred and forty went to Helen, but worse, it brought herself down to only fifty! She really needed to win a hand now, hopefully Alex would give her some good cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not the case, she folded along with most of the girls when Cindy started betting. She didn't bet after the flop though, only Olivia did which caused everyone to fold and she downright frowned at the meagre winnings, she hadn't had jack shit though so perhaps she shouldn't complain, even if her chances for a straight had been pretty high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how many joined in on Gina's hand Olivia, while not letting anything show, still cursed that she'd gotten cards that she couldn't possibly win with, she also gave Sarah a strange look, the girl hadn't entered a single hand, bad luck, or just cowardice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia wasn't less annoyed when she saw Wendy raise and everyone but Vera follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the turn no-one bet. So Carol gave it a try and was awarded with everyone but Wendy tossing in their cards. And on the river, Wendy didn't bet so she tried the same thing again and saw Wendy too give up and she could collect the winnings, that wasn't by a long-shot what Olivia had initially thought they might become. Still it brought her into the safe zone with a total of a hundred and sixty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Vera started dealing Wendy was a little anxious to even pay the blind as doing so brought her down to a mere thirty five, many of the other girls were more pleased by the facts that girls were finally getting into danger and that it wasn't them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain everyone checked, so Olivia put forth a bet, which caused most girls to fold, she wasn't surprised that Sarah was amongst them. The flop revealed a pair of eights and figuring she couldn't bluff her way out of it, she folded like everyone else when Cindy put forth her bet. The measly winnings were even less than Olivia had received earlier and it only brought Cindy to an even hundred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy's hand turned out to be one with more participants, even if Sarah unsurprisingly decided to yet again fold as soon as the betting started. Then Carol raised eventhough it was pre-flop, which only caused poor Wendy to fold in order to save her remaining thirty for a better hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flop revealed a pair of aces and colours no one wanted, so when Mary dared a bet, Helen, Olivia and Mindy pulled out, while Carol again raised it, but it didn't cause any more to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried again at the turn, which made Mary toss in her cards, finding the extra ten a bit much when she only had thirtyfive left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she bet at the river and again Cindy called, forcing them to a showdown, where Carol's aces and queens beat Cindy's aces and fives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol was glad she had kept betting, her cards might not have been that good, but obviously good enough and it had given her the best winnings in a while, which brought her into the lead, much to Olivia's dismay, even if it was just a five marker lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy's hand brought the surprise that Sarah joined, it would have been even more surprising if they had known that she didn't even have a decent hold. Though she folded once the flop was revealed, but then again so did everyone except Mindy and Helen. And when Mindy again bet on the Turn Helen also folded.<br>\r\nOlivia was pleased with the result if for no other reason than that Sarah was now no longer allowed to leave the table, in fact only four girls were, herself, Carol, Helen and Mindy. <br>\r\nThen again why would you want to leave when you're ahead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy did like Olivia had done in her turn, she raised the bet when it came around to her, half the girls were already out by then, but the ones that weren't accepted the increase in order to see the flop. But when Helen bet after it, she folded, leaving it a contest between Sarah and Helen no less, a contest Sarah won with a single pair of aces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary's hand had Mary herself folding and Helen raising the bet before the flop, making it a good start, because most decided to join. The pair of twos that came up turned it into a betting match which made all but the three in the lead fold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turn saw Carol betting and the other two calling, the river saw Helen betting, Olivia folding and Carol raising the bet, only to have Helen raise it further, which gave Carol cold feet, so she decided to call, a stake of sixty was quite enough, half the girls around the table hadn't had that much for a while.<br>\r\nSo it was all down to the showdown, where Carol displayed her three of a kind, only to see that the nine of clubs that the river had brought had turned Helen's two pairs into a full house, the best hand so far in the game and the largest pot, but since it was a bit of a duel the winnings were probably not the best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill the hundred and nintyfive pot, brought Helen over the threehundred mark, so if there had been a broke girl she would have been forced to buy her. A fact that made Helen play a bit with her long wavy auburn hair as she gave the almost broke girls really inviting come-hither glances, which left little doubt as to why Iris ended up inside Helen's stomach as often as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was Helen's hand, which brought first the surprise of everyone folding after Olivia's bet and then that it was raised by Mary, who was down to her last twenty, meaning half of it was already placed in bets. As she now had money to spare, Helen joined, just for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Sarah and Olivia checked and Mary was the one to bet, the flop had given Helen a pair of eights so she figured she might just as well continue, she could afford to lose the money and she really felt like annoying Mary and raised the bet. Which would force Mary to spend her last marker. Sarah and Olivia both folded, which surprised her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary decided to call, it was all or nothing now, unfortunately for her, 'all' was not a whole lot, so even if she did win, she'd still be piss poor. Something that wouldn't change since only she and Helen remained and she was out of money, so there was no further betting.<br>\r\nAnd it really didn't help that she'd been hoping for a flush, but the flop didn't reveal a single spades to match her six and king, which meant that flush was a lost cause. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turn revealed a six of hearts, which at least gave her a pair, but Helen's pair of eights would beat that, it was all down to the last card. Funny, as Helen had thought of folding at the pre-flop, since a four of diamonds and an eight of hearts really wasn't something to brag about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all down to the river... a jack of spades! Totally useless for both parties, but more or less everyone else that had already folded would have had a straight either queen or jack high with the cards on the table, since four of them had had a seven on hand and a different four girls had had a queen, but now it was all won with:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA pair of eights.\u201d Helen smiled as she revealed her cards that just barely out-gunned Mary's already revealed pair of sixes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a hundred in markers on the table she turned to Mary. \u201cNow you get over here. I've been wanting something in my stomach ever since I had to let go of Iris.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sultry look she gave Mary struck the right cords, so Mary didn't say anything, she just wanted to feel Helen suck and lick her body all over as soon as possible and got out of her chair and offered the girl her arms, in fact forcing them into Helen's mouth as she turned to accept her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary wasn't disappointed, Helen quickly sucked much of her in, but once there she sucked and slurped her delicious morsel quite thoroughly, clearly enjoying herself, so long before Mary slipped out of view most girls were either envious of her, or of Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Helen found it a bit hard to sit at the table with a Mary-bulge in her gut, so she decided to hide the girl. That wouldn't stop her from enjoying her, so after adjusting her seat she kept idly caressing her smooth flat belly, that didn't show a hint of the girl it contained.</span></div></div>",

Then the turn only interested Helen, who was the only one who saw any use for the revealed seven of hearts, but she still didn't have a flush, so far Mindy's tens and threes were the winning hand, but the river could change everything, so both feeling rather confident in her hand and trying to get a few more to bail out she decided to bet, yet again, which indeed made both Carol and Wendy fold, leaving it a match between herself and Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe river was a nine...of...hearts. Mindy didn't bet, but Helen did, making Mindy call her, only to find that Helen's flush totally trashed her two pairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollecting her winnings she counted her markers to be sure then she grinned as she patted her stomach. \u201cOkay, who's next?\u201d Helen taunted, hinting that she had yet again passed the threehundred threshold. The other girls tried to ignore her even if Wendy tried to hide a little and Iris gave her marker-stack a suspicious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that they had made it one lap around the table and it was Olivia's turn again to be the dealer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly Wendy was the one to start the betting, perhaps more surprising was that only Iris and Olivia followed and both raised the bet, meaning that Wendy had to toss in all her markers to call.<br>\r\nThe flop didn't impress anyone, so everyone checked, the turn was little better, it brought Wendy a seven of hearts which she could have used for a straight flush, but the flop had ruined both chances of a straight or a flush. The way she saw it, her only hope lay in the other two folding, how that would happen she just couldn't figure out though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left the river, which tossed forth a jack of diamonds, that made Olivia bet and Iris fold, but ultimately changed nothing, for prior to it Olivia's pair of twos had been high and eventhough the jack gave Iris a pair of jacks, it also gave Olivia the same, leaving Wendy with jack shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here Wendy...\u201d Helen leered, placing another hundred in markers on the table. \u201cSorry to say, but Mary wasn't very filling...\u201d she teased. \u201dCould sure use your help with that...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly Wendy got up and walked over to Helen, who promptly picked the girl up and fiddled for a while, until she was holding Wendy by her thighs and waist. That way when she held the girl up, she got great access to her moist center. And after some attention to that part Wendy didn't seem so upset about losing any more, when Helen shoved the girls whole hips into her mouth and sucked her like a hard candy, Wendy couldn't have uttered a sentient word even if she'd tried.<br>\r\nThen in mid climax she disappeared with a wet slurping noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen licked her lips, then wiped her face, finally licking her fingers clean of the collected moisture, before adjusting her seat and turn to idly caressing her belly while she waited for the next deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't comment with a single word and she casually ignored the stares of the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer second snack had cost her the lead though, now Olivia was ahead, with a full five-marker.</span></div></div>",

The pot had been a hundred and twentyfive, which brought her up to a total of threehundred and twenty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin on her face Olivia placed a hundred on the table next to the two stacks of markers Helen had placed there earlier, before turning to Iris, who was seated next to her, just like Mary had been to Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHead, or feet first?\u201d was all Olivia said to the girl, who was examining Olivia's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh, feet...\u201d Iris said and still sitting, lifted her legs up and offered Olivia her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia gave them a lick continuing halfway up the shins, before placing them both in her mouth and started sucking the girl in. She wasn't hurrying along, but she wasn't really taking her time either, so Iris disappeared as a steady pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Iris's dismay Olivia didn't pause to enjoy her at any point, she was given a thorough tasting, but that was pretty much it. She tried protesting a couple of times but Olivia silenced her and before long her head slipped in between Olivia's lips, leaving a large bulge that travelled down the redhead's neck before joining the large dome in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Helen before her Olivia too noticed that it was hard to sit at the table with a large gut, at least if you were facing it, she dismissed the thought of sitting sideways, so she too hid her meal, the bulge shrank rapidly until all that was left was her trim belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia also caressed her belly with a pleased expression covering her face, with her meal hidden she could digest at leisure and there was little need to force it along much, that'd only risk the process getting loud enough for the other girls to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Iris, still noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been intrigued at first, she had wondered what Olivia's stomach would be like. Now she would get to experience it and more of its features than she wanted to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer screams didn't carry outside her prison though, she was too well hidden for that. She could only struggle fruitlessly as Olivia slowly turned her to a nutritious soup while the game continued outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia had been peckish for a while now, since the game started in fact, so it wasn't some grudge against Iris or anything. Anyone that would have ended up in there would have gotten the grand tour, Iris was just unlucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her belly Olivia enjoyed the shifts inside, she'd relish the feeling as the girl would struggle to sate her appetite as her intestines would greedily absorb what it wanted. She idly wondered if Iris would succeed, she kind of doubted it...she already had an appetite for seconds, which didn't speak in the girl's favour.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inside Helen things were not quite as rough, though it had been close a moment ago, for Mary had decided to eat the new arrival. In the dark she couldn't quite get her aim right, which had led to her not getting the girl when she was vulnerable from both her recent climax as well as being dumped into the dark stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis led to Mary struggling to get a hold on the taller girl, but Wendy knew what was up and put up a fight, much to Helen's delight.<br>\r\nMary was the stronger and more skilled of the two, so if it hadn't been for the darkness and the slipperiness and the moving floor and walls, the struggle would no doubt have been quite short. Now as it were, it lasted for at least a couple of hands. But in the end Wendy was unable to keep herself from going down yet another throat and once she was trapped inside Mary's bulging belly, there was no more commotion in Helen's stomach, Mary even laid down to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Alex was dealing and the blind, made Gina pitch in her last marker. This was it, all or nothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked good jack and queen of spades, now all she could hope for was a large pot and that too looked promising as when Cindy placed a bet everyone called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flop revealed seven of spades...ten of diamonds...and...king of hearts...<br>\r\nGina still has hopes, it looked worse at first than it was, a nine or an ace will give her a straight and it is still possible for two more spades although unlikely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the flop didn't inspire too much confidence, Helen placed a bet to weed some people out, the king had given her a pair, which was at least something.<br>\r\nHer plan succeeded as four girls folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turn then placed a six of clubs on the table to Cindy's delight, since it meant that she now had three of a kind, which meant that she decided to bet, forcing anyone but Gina who wanted to tag along to pitch in another ten, but everyone folded, so that just left her and Gina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the river revealed a seven of clubs, giving her a full house, Gina in turn had naught but the pair of seven that were on the table, making her broke and up for sale.<br>\r\nFor Cindy the winnings brought her back from the brink of ruin to a more steady hundred and five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Gina out, the deal went to Vera, who apparently provided Cindy with another good hand, a pair of tens in the hold and the flop revealed another ten, giving her three of a kind.<br>\r\nSo she bet, but none raised though several girls called because they figured they could afford it, like Helen, who had eight and jack in hearts, but with the flop consisting of ten of clubs, seven of spades and three of hearts her hand didn't look that great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turn revealed a nine of diamonds though, which changed things a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy still placed a bet and Helen raised it, causing Sarah and Carol to fold and it did make Cindy wary, so she only called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her the river was an eight of diamonds, so she tried to play it safe and check, but Helen raised and with three tens she didn't feel like folding, so a call brought them to the showdown where Helen revealed her seven to jack straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least she wasn't in deep trouble just yet Cindy tried convincing herself, counting her markers to sixtyfive, before she received the deck to deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It turned into a bit of a raffle, raise both on the pre-flop and the flop, though by then Cindy was the only one with a small purse still in the game.<br>\r\nAnd with Carol raising the bets she was a little anxious when the turn placed another nine on the table, since that was a pair everyone could use, still with it she had two pairs, question was if to fold or not, another ten markers in the bet would have almost halved her funds and there was still the river to come...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to fold...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the river revealed a four of clubs Olivia and Helen did the same, so Carol didn't even have to show her hand, she could just grin and collect the winnings which were significant, eventhough they were now down to only eight players.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina gave her a worrying look as she counted her markers and Carol replied with an \u201cAlmost, but not quite.\u201d She could still buy Gina if she felt like it though, but she decided to hold on to the markers for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy's hand had Vera entering and Cindy decided to chance it, so she even raised the pre-flop to Vera's dismay, the girl had been down to fifteen, so this meant that if she wanted to see the flop, she'd be down to her last five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flop had Cindy bet, only to see everyone, but Helen pull out, so she decided to be bold and bet on the turn as well and to her jot, Helen too folded, allowing her to claim the much needed markers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen's hand had everyone, but her, Sarah and Olivia fold on the pre-flop, so it was quick, with Olivia folding on the turn and Sarah on the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Vera decided to join in with her final five and was a little unnerved when everyone but Sarah and Olivia folded, even if she won she wouldn't get any winnings worth mentioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the other two kept betting against one another, but that hardly helped for the flop had only given her a pair and the turn hadn't helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let on a small smile when she saw the river though, now she had two pairs, sixes and eights, neither of which was on the table.<br>\r\nSarah kept betting though and surprisingly Olivia folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera was first to show, her six and eight both of diamonds went well with the eight of clubs from the flop and the six of hearts from the river.<br>\r\nSarah only smiled though as she put forth her five and ace of diamonds, which together with the ace of spades from the flop and the five of hearts from the turn handed her the win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant that Vera too found herself broke, and could only watch with trepidation on Helen and Carol's huge stacks of markers, even if neither seemed that eager to spend them just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia's flop turned interesting as Alex pitched in her last marker, no one folded though, even if Helen hesitated, the stakes weren't that high yet and she did have markers to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky for her too as the turn revealed a queen, which was the unlikely card she needed to get a straight. Obviously she raised the stakes and was a little sorry to see both Olivia and Mindy fold and as Alex was out of markers that only left river and showdown. A four of diamonds changed nothing and Alex only had a pair of kings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat meant a third broke girl for the market and Helen back in the lead with twohundred and eightyfive in markers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol's hand was the cheapest so far, the showdown was over a pot of mere twenty. It went to Sarah for her pair of ace and ten-kicker where the kicker gave her the win over Mindy who had a pair of ace as well, but only a nine-kicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs pathetic as Carol's hand had been, Cindy's handed the pot of fifteen to Mindy, just barely beating Helen's hand with the third kicker card after the pair of fives that were on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy's hand proved more promising, before the flop only Olivia had folded and looking at the modest flop of two, four and ace, Mindy realized that with her three and five of diamonds, she had a low straight, ace to five. Helen had two pairs twos and fours, so she was pretty pleased as well, the others were less pleased though and folded as Helen put in a bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Mindy did mind, she raised the bet, making Helen call her to see it through to the turn, but the ace of spades changed nothing, so Mindy pitched in her last markers, this was indeed all or nothing and Helen called once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe river placed king of hearts on the table, but as Mindy was out of markers it went straight to the showdown where Helen revealed her two pairs, so Mindy was quite pleased when she could collect the pot, she was still placed last in the running, but at least now she'd have her head above water.</span></div></div>",

The fact that there were three girls available for purchase, and when they were, the game would be over. But no one that had the markers seemed interested in doing so just yet, which might mean that they would have to be forced to buy another three before the game would end and then all the broke girls would be auctioned out. In short, there would probably just be three or four girls left playing when the game would end and she was by no means in the lead, in fact she only had fifteen more than Mindy, who despite her win remained in last place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen interrupted her line of thoughts as another hand was dealt, an interesting one at that, no one folded, eventhough Helen raised the bet. Then the flop revealed three hearts, two, four and five.<br>\r\nIt didn't sit perfect with Carol's two eights, but one of them was heart as well, so she raised and saw all but Mindy and Olivia call.<br>\r\nThe queen of diamonds complicated things, which was why everyone called Helen's bet, which made the pot quite interesting.<br>\r\nThe river produced four of clubs, not what anyone had hoped for.<br>\r\nCarol tried a bluff, two pairs wasn't much when one of them was on the table.<br>\r\nTo her dismay Cindy called and Helen raised, only Sarah folded. The pot was big and Helen could be bluffing too she figured, at least she had another pair, so she called and so did Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was Helen's deal Carol had to reveal her pair of eights first, then Cindy showed her pair of queens and finally Helen revealed her two aces. Thus she claimed the large pot, not the largest in the game, but it made for a hundred thirtyfive winning, which had only been achieved twice before and was the highest so far, it also brought her to a staggering total of threehundred and ninety in markers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHence she looked quite smug as she examined the broke girls, who all squirmed beneath her gaze. Not that it was all unpleasant, she did have quite the erotic sultry air about her, but fact remained that there was nothing submissive about her which made the girls feel as if they were evaluated for their properties as playthings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter tormenting the girls for a while her eye's couldn't help but linger on Vera, the girl had similar fiery hair as Olivia, but where as Oliva was tight all over, she only managed to avoid connotations such as skinny or lanky by having just enough muscle on her bones to make them feel somewhat misleading. Vera in turn had a more normal softness, which Helen thought made her look perhaps not sexier, but certainly tastier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo putting forth another stack containing a hundred in markers Helen motioned for the redhead to come on over. \u201cWell Vera, you shouldn't look so tasty, I just have to try for myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really the words Vera wanted to hear, but she saw no other way than to walk on over. Not that she'd had any other plans, but Malinda and Candice were positioned in a way that really left her no other choice, even if she'd had other ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one moment...\u201d Helen said, stopping the redhead a couple of steps short. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then bent over as a lump rose up her throat. The lump transformed into a pair of feet that stuck out of her mouth and as the attached legs had slipped out to the knee they were placed on the floor. Standing up from her chair, Helen released more of the girl and with a final wet noise her mouth opened wide and she craned away letting it return to normal and revealing a slobbering wet Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What's that?\u201d Helen pointed and accusing finger at the large bulge in Mary's stomach. \u201cYou throw her up this instant!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking a bit shaken by all the girls staring her down, she felt like a kid that had been caught red handed with her arm down the cookiejar.\u201d So as to not prolong it, she tried coughing Wendy up as quickly as possible, which was pretty quick. Unfortunately the wet girl sprawled out on the floor didn't take away Helen's attention from herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVera, swallow her.\u201d Helen commanded, surprising most in the room, including Vera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA surprise that caught her to hesitate, so a \u201cYes, mistress...\u201d slipped from her lips as a sort of excuse without her giving it a thought before it was already out, she couldn't remember having used the phrase before, but she was supposed to be Helen's bitch, perhaps her subconscious had provided her with the excuse for her delay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a line of thought that almost made her forget to taste and enjoy the short curvy girl that she had the pleasure of being ordered to send to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen didn't pause to watch the show though, she reached down for the slobbery girl on the floor, who thought that Helen was helping her up and was quite surprised when Helen instead picked her up and crammed her down her throat. In just a couple of seconds Wendy was reduced to a small bulge going down Helen's throat before vanishing, leaving her belly still smooth and flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Vera as she struggled to get the last of Mary down, Helen told her. \u201cGet under the table, I've got something else for you to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she retook her seat and spread her legs, a hint hard to misinterpret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera hid her bulging belly a little in order to be able to move and fit under the table. Once in position she could use it as a pillow, or bed of sorts, which was nice for her, but probably not for Mary, but then again, she was being punished, Vera wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that's what I'm talking about...\u201d Helen commented as she adjusted her seat and pushed Vera's head into her crotch a little further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, your time to deal...\u201d Helen said and handed the deck to Sarah.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cindy was in the fight for this pot, her opponents were Helen and Carol though, not the ones to fold that easily, Helen had even raised her pre-flop bet and bet again on the flop. The flop hadn't really gone her way, but she was giving it a chance, a pair of fours in the flop and that turned into two pairs on the turn. Though Carol's pairs of aces and kings were better, good enough to bet on the turn, which made Cindy chicken out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen stayed and raised the bet though. Carol thought for a moment to raise the bet as well, to show that she wasn't about to be intimidated, but she didn't and only called, thus revealing the river, a six of spades.<br>\r\nThat made Helen bet again and Carol call her, only to see that Helen's original measly pair of fours had by the turn turned into a full house, making her able to claim yet another pot and bringing her yet again past the threehundred mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hundred-stack was placed on the table, she could place yet another and end the game, as she was now the only player with more than twohundred in markers, but she didn't.<br>\r\nInstead she just calmly waived for Gina to come on over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't stop.\u201d she called down between her legs and placed a hand on Vera's head to get her back into position. Then she turned to the girl who'd walked around to her side of the table.<br>\r\nWithout a word Helen just reached out and without turning from the table she picked the girl up, then flicked her around, so that she could hold the girl upside down by the waist, while still pinning her arms to the sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Helen lifted the girl over her head, leaned her own head back and opened her mouth wide. Then let the girl slip from her grip to slide on down her throat.<br>\r\nShe finished by licking her lips and sucking her fingers clean as if some of the girl had stuck to them. \u201cMmm...not bad...\u201d She said and turned her attention back to the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNon of the girls watching felt all that eager to go down the throat of a girl who had someone paying their full attention to their pussy, but they had to agree that Helen hadn't lost it yet, perhaps she was good at keeping the control, or perhaps Vera wasn't that good at the job?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Gina emerged in the large stomach, that on the outside didn't show any hint of her presence in it. <br>\r\nShe felt around, half expecting, half fearing to be assaulted and gobbled up by the girl who came in here before her. She couldn't see anything in the dark chamber, so when the assault didn't happen and when she couldn't feel the girl, she called out. \u201cHey, Wendy? You in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing she waited, no answer...no that wasn't right. She felt a slight tremor, then that increased and she started getting tumbled around as the stomach started to slowly churn her, but that wasn't the worst part, the worst part was the stinging sensation that spread over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy couldn't have heard her even if she hadn't been a slowly solidifying blob of goop. She was entering Helen's large intestine, so the distance between them was just too great. The noises coming from Helen's body would also most likely have drowned out any conversation they might have had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shouldn't fret too much though, they would soon be together, possibly Helen's colon would even squeeze them together into one, but that remained to be seen. At any rate they would soon both have left Helens slender middle and move on down towards her surprisingly wide hips only to get trapped inside her soft bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the game continued, but the game didn't hold Helen's interest for long, she folded right away and paid more attention to the struggling girl in her stomach instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there were others that shifted their attention to the cards, like Sarah and Cindy, who were pleased to see a pair of twos in the flop, since it gave both of them three of a kind and Olivia noted that two of the cards were hearts, meaning she only needed one more. Also Carol held two pairs, so it was a hand that looked interesting for all the remaining girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turn revealed a ten of hearts, changing nothing for everyone but Olivia, even if Cindy noticed that another heart would give her a flush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol tried to flush out a few players, but to her surprise no-one folded, Olivia even raised, to which she had to call, and so did everyone else.<br>\r\nThough the river changed nothing with it's three of diamonds, a bit scared by the previous round everyone checked but Olivia, but no-one willing to fold meant yet another increase to the pot, even if Cindy had been out of markers for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol, first to show, played two eights and two twos, Cindy raised that with three twos and queen-ten kickers making Sarah grunt as she tossed her cards on the table revealing three twos with ten-nine kickers. It mattered little though as Olivia calmly revealed her flush of hearts and collected the pot, bringing her back over the twohundred mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy's previous fears had proven well founded, not only had she now joined Alex as someone up for sale, but Olivia didn't use her markers to end the game, which meant that they could still receive company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Mindy claimed a few markers, no one had gotten anything, so she won on a pair of nines, which hadn't been enough for her to chance anything. After that it was Helen's turn to get a few markers as everyone folded on the flop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen when Helen dealt the cards Mindy claimed the meagre pot again, this time by betting on the river, had anyone else done so everyone would have folded, the river had given her a pair of kings, but that was it and unknown to her the only thing in the whole game, not even a pair of two's to compete, but the others didn't get to see her hand, so as far as they knew she might have bluffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's hand got a little interesting start, as the blind got Carol to dip below a hundred and as usual by now Helen eventhough she had nothing, forced everyone to pitch in a five to join, but that was the only bet and it looked like it'd 'all' go to Sarah for a pair of threes when the river revealed a seven handing Mindy yet another tiny pot, but enough this time to get her over a hundred and thus placing her in third place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time when Helen played her trick Sarah folded on the pre-flop only to first sigh as Carol raised the bet, then to curse as the flop revealed a pair of fours, which would have given her three of a kind.<br>\r\nThen Olivia contained her joy of seeing a five of hearts in the turn as it gave her a straight, unknown to the fact that it'd given Carol a full house, which led to them having a betting duel ending in a showdown that brought Carol back on the safe side of a hundred and Olivia down to a hundred and fifty and a third place after Carol's hundred and eighty. <br>\r\nIn the long run Sarah was glad she had folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia was a little miffed by losing that much markers, it didn't help much that Iris was feeding her small intestine with herself, for she was almost done with that. All Olivia could do was to take out her frustration on the dwindling girl in her gut and hope that'd help.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThen Helen pulled her usual stunt, but now being player of the second blind meant that it was ten to see the flop, too steep a cost for Sarah, but Helen continued eventhough she had naught, which made the others fold as well. A successful bluff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mindy dealt the cards Helen did the same again in the pre-flop, this time everyone called her, even Sarah. The flop she bet again and again everyone called. And again in the turn where everyone but Carol folded, Carol had just a pair of nines, but that was more than Helen did. The river turned that pair into a three of a kind for Carol though, so she could claim the pot, sizeable due to Helen's schemes and Helen never revealed that she didn't have anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blind of Helen's hand forced Sarah down to her final five which made some girls give her a thorough eye-exam, which made her a bit unnerved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she had to struggle to hold her cool and didn't bet when the flop revealed a pair of twos, giving her three of a kind. Carol did though and Helen only called. Naturally Sarah did too, but that meant it was now all or nothing for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did as Mindy had done before, climb back from the brink, Carol's betting had eventually made everyone fold, so she was surprised when Sarah revealed that both of them had three two's, the problem was that Sarah\u2019s queen kicker beat anything Carol had, so the pot went to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen went back to her trick of betting on everything, this time she did have the high cards, a pair of kings on the hold, but as everyone had something they kept calling and on the river Mindy got a straight so she bet and the rest had to call her instead, even Helen, but no-one had anything better than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was time again for Helen to pay the blind which meant that it cost ten to see the flop, perhaps she was annoyed that the game was taking so long? Though if that was the case she could have ended it at any time, she was after all the only player over twohundred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stakes of ten to even see the flop meant that players seemed more eager to stay, since they had already paid so much. In the end that meant another nice stack of markers for Mindy, who by that robed Helen of her first place and she realized, that now that she was safe, she wasn't at all that interested in buying a girl and end the game.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Mindy dealt Olivia tried a 'Helen', so it ended up costing fifteen to see the flop, but everyone paid up. Figuring she couldn't chicken out now, she continued and only Helen followed, neither girls having anything at the moment. <br>\r\nThe turn changed that, but it gave both the same pair as both had a king in their hold. <br>\r\nSame thing with the river, another pair, this one on the table. <br>\r\nSo it all came down to the kicker, Helen's ten of clubs, versus Olivia's jack of clubs. A close call for the redhead, had she lost, she'd been down to a mere fifteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen was then glad to see that Mindy placed a bet, since it meant that she could increase the cost to see the flop to ten, leaving Sarah yet again with just a single five-marker. But after that she folded and it all ended with a duel in Carol's favour, placing her in the lead.<br>\r\nApparently Helen's increased bets had the effect of greater changes in the scores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was Sarah\u2019s time to deal, so she could have folded if she wanted, but she was content with her hold and decided to join, thus risking her last marker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flop, nor the turn looked to be in her favour, even if they opened up for a straight if the river washed up a six or a jack. Not much she could do about it now but hope. Surprisingly everyone checked the turn, even Helen, which made Carol wish she'd placed a bet. The River turned up a king, which wasn't at all what she had hoped for. Surprisingly everyone was still in the game due to lack of bets and Mindy got it all with a pair of fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least this placed another girl on the market. The fact that the remaining girls had lots of markers made both Carol and Mindy wonder if they should end it, Olivia was last with hundred and twenty. <br>\r\nA few more hands they both thought...then maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a couple of hands later first bringing a win to Olivia and the second one to Helen meant that no-one could end the game even if they wanted as all remaining players now had less than twohundred. Though the turn after that Helen was back in a substantial lead, but she had a belly with one girl worming her way through it and another one neatly packed away at the end, not far from where another girl was still idly lapping at her lower set of lips. Even if the girl down there had trouble getting good access and thus doing a proper job, it was still very pleasant, so all in all she was content with just keeping on playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time Olivia had to admit that Iris was lacking company. She had digested the girl quite thoroughly and although she insisted on getting out, she as far as Olivia was concerned wanted company first. Unfortunately Olivia was in last place, but she had a few tricks up her sleeve, even if she'd removed her blouse a few hours ago. A rigged flush brought her back to the safe side of hundred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't need to cheat before that and after the game was going her way anyhow, soon she was in tied first place with Mindy and the hand after that in the lead with a whopping twohundred and eighty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Alex, Sarah and Cindy she couldn't quite determine who'd want to join Iris, so she decided to let the game continue for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turn after that held the surprise of Helen dropping to eightyfive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the really interesting hand was the one Carol dealt, first the usual by now, ten to see the flop when Helen had the blind, then a bet on the flop, which revealed a pair of kings and a five and the turn another ten and though Helen kept betting, the others kept calling, and by the showdown it was revealed that the two pairs on the table were the highest there were, but Helen did in fact have the highest kicker, a queen that ate all opposition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething that made her remember something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,  for the interruption girls, but I need to stretch my belly a bit...\u201d Helen excused and stood up from her chair and moved over to where Mary had sat before because that part of the table was clean of markers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVera get up here.\u201d she said and tapped the table in front of her. Vera getting out from under the table stood up and placed her butt on the indicated surface and before she could get her feet up Helen had already grabbed her legs by the knees and then quickly brought them up towards Veras shoulders. Thus making Vera curl onto her back and into a little package, while at the same time exposing her vagina to her 'owner'. All in all she held a semblance of a turkey with Mary being the stuffing that bloated her middle and just what Helen seemed to be trying to suck out of her through her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a slobbery and noisy affair, not made less so when Vera started squirming and squealing. The thing that came as a surprise was the sudden silence, for like when something suddenly blocks the vacuum with a 'vump'-ing sound, Vera suddenly lodged herself in Helen's throat, blocking the tube leading south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell there Helen started licking the bloated girl all over, accompanying her actions with moans of appreciation. But soon the girl started edging into the throat and before long Helen's throat stretched to allow for something to slide on down and settle in her stomach, leaving just a hint of a bulge, but it was being covered by Helen's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI almost forgot I bought you because I wanted to taste you.\u201d Helen snickered as she left Mary's chair and returned to her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Vera had got so carried away that she had almost digested Mary, to Mary's surprise that didn't happen. When she'd heard and felt Vera twitch ans moan she was certain that she was a goner. Once in Helen's stomach the girl had calmed down though, which allowed her to keep Mary safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a moment to realize that she and Mary were the only ones in there though, which made Vera all sorts of uncomfortable. Still she couldn't help thinking of where Wendy and Gina were, which didn't help her state of anxiety any. From her previous position she'd had gotten a good long study of Helen's body, her belly in particular...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mindy dealt an interesting hand, not because of the action, but because of the pause afterwards as Olivia counted her markers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwohundred and ninetyfive.\u201d She announced with a grin as she saw the tremor running through the broke girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had also brought Carol down to twentyfive, so she was a bit reluctant to toss in the blind as Helen dealt the cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe constant betting made her fold only to see that as the game ended she would have gotten the wining pair, now the pot went to Mindy instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it was Mindy's turn to deal again Carol was down to her last marker. <br>\r\nAt least it gave her a discount to join, but that was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy herself had thought that she'd been given a lousy hold, with a seven of diamonds and a five of spades, but the flop revealed six of clubs as well as eight and nine of hearts giving her a straight. Helen too liked the flop as it added an eight to the two she had on hand. <br>\r\nThen the turn presented another nine, one of diamonds which changed things in Helen's favour and turned things into a betting feast, one that Olivia had no interest in, she'd been hoping for a five or a ten, either which would have given her a straight as well, but even if the chance remained the stakes were getting high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Mindy called and the river showed a four of hearts. No-one had any hearts to go with the three on the table though and Mindy already had a straight, five to nine, so she didn't need the four.<br>\r\nOn the river Helen bet again though, Mindy doubted Helen had a flush, but she were still wary so she decided to call, the pot was big enough anyhow.<br>\r\nShe was glad she did, seeing Helen's full house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol sure regretted her actions, for not only had she gone broke, but the game had ended, because Helen put yet another stack of markers on the table. Meaning that if she had just folded, then she wouldn't have had to become someone's bitch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...\u201d Helen mused as she leaned back in her chair while letting her fingers play on her belly. \u201cI think...I'll have...Sarah.\u201d She said abruptly turning to the girl seated to her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright...\u201d The dark-haired girl sighed and turned to her buyer, holding forth her hands as she did. Not that Helen had given her any instructions, but she figured; \u201cWhy not?\u201d and sucked the hands into her mouth, before slowly taking in the rest of the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked a little strange as the girl disappeared into Helen's mouth, certainly so by the time her hips and legs were all that remained outside. Obviously her whole torso should be inside, but there was only a small bulge in Helen's neck that only reach a few inches down. Though it did inch its way further and further down as more of Sarah entered and then when she was all inside it travelled down and disappeared into Helen's belly. Which received some appreciative rubbing from it's owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for that show Helen.\u201d Olivia commented before continuing. \u201cNow on to the auction. We do have three lovely ladies right here. But first, everyone put in hundred markers in the middle, you can't buy anyone with 'yourself'\u201d Olivia said making citation marks with her fingers as she said 'yourself'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, the remaining money you can now buy someone for, but as there's three girls to buy and three of us, this seems fairly simple. Seeing as I have the most markers left I can outbid you two and Helen can outbid Mindy. I guess that means we can just pick one each with me going first, Helen second and you going last, Mindy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrat...\u201d Olivia thought for herself, she hadn't known earlier whom to choose and now she had first pick. Alright Mindy seemed to be staring down Carol, so she could just as well skip her then. Next in line was Alex...\u201dYeah, why not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...I take Alex.\u201d Olivia announced and as the girl walked over to her, she stood up and promptly wolfed the girl down, in a few seconds only Olivia remained, rubbing her flat taunt stomach, which in turn was already busy turning Alex into Iris's room-mate. Iris awaited the girl somewhere inside Olivia's tight little butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen too noticed Mindy's eyes fixed on Carol, so she went for Cindy, not saying anything, just waving her over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, when you get in here.\u201d Helen said patting her flat belly. \u201cGet Mary out of Vera and then start an orgy. I want to feel some girl-juice in my stomach. Is that clear?\u201d Helen instructed, neatly avoiding to mention that Wendy and Gina were no longer in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, miss.\u201d Cindy acknowledged and with Helen's help while she offered her owner her hands, she ended up almost diving down Helen's throat. Cindy hadn't been expecting the 'help', but there was little she could do about it but slide on down and settle in the slender middle of the sultry beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also saw no reason not to follow through with Helen's instructions, which turned out to relieve the tension of both Mary and Vera, to the point that they were soon all enjoying themselves and eachother in a warm and wet foursome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Mindy just smiled as she went over to Carol, who remained seated and watched with trepidation as she short lithe blonde walked over and leered down at her. Only to have the vision exchanged for the dark interior of the girl's mouth and throat as she descended upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy leaned back and Carols legs were sent skywards, then as gravity aided she slid on down and soon her feet slipped in between Mindy's lips and as they travelled down the girl's neck it returned to normal.<br>\r\nShe made a sizeable bulge in Mindy's stomach, but unlike the other two Mindy didn't hide anything, okay, her meal was partly hidden, though it still gave her quite a large potbelly, but she didn't hide the fact that she was digesting, loud gurgles and wet noises emanated from her middle just moments after Carol had settled inside it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy couldn't help it, Carol had been in the lead several times, she'd been in the position to end the game several times as well, and been able to buy girls, had she wanted to. In fact Mindy had been in trouble several times along the game and she had feared that she might end up inside Carol, not that Carol would have been worse than anyone else, it was just that she was a possibility, only two other girls ever were and none of them were broke by the end of the game. Carol was, and that made her the most satisfying meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo feeling Carol melt in her stomach was a pleasure, and so was feeling her shrink away as she made her way through Mindy's intestines. Mindy hadn't eaten today, so Carol felt nice in her gut for several reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrooking an eyebrow Olivia watched Mindy's somewhat lacking grace and announced: \u201cThat takes care of the auction I guess.\u201d Then she turned to Malinda and Candice who looked quite pleased. \u201cYou ladies enjoyed the show?\u201d To which she received affirmative nods. \u201cCare to join in next time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe...\u201d Malinda said avoiding a straight answer. \u201cDepends on the game, this one seems plausible.\u201d She added, having come to the conclusion that one can do like Sarah did early on and just keep folding, that way the game should be over before one runs out of markers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I'm game for a round of this.\u201d Candice said. \u201cAnd I suppose we carry six potential players as well.\u201d she added patting her own and Malinda's bellies in which girls were still enjoying one another, but the pace was pretty slow by now. \u201cWhen do you suppose another one could start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh...\u201d Olivia hadn't really expected them to be interested, since they didn't want to join in the first place, but then added. \u201cThe night is still young, so I suppose in an hour. These girls are still our bitches for another hour, so after that.\u201d She said patting her flat belly and thus faking that there was actually any girls inside it, well there was one, if you counted the now liquefied Alex, but she wouldn't play anything in an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we can meet back here in an hour then and see if there are enough girls interested for a game.\u201d Olivia said as she bid farewell and went downstairs with the rest of the girls in tow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Things seemed quite relaxed downstairs with the girls that had been there for a while being the most laid back and the newer arrivals fuelling the action some. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kayla had left things weren\u2019t as digestion oriented anymore, in fact it reminded more of some decadent orgy where the participants tasted eachother a bit more thoroughly than might be expected at a normal one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said there was still risk of digestion, not that anyone occupied the toilets yet, but  Olivia after having let the other girls pass her snuck back up to the bathroom on the second floor, trying to avoid the girls from the poker-game noticing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there she found that Helen had lingered, waiting for the girls to leave before moving in that direction as well, so she was about to close the door when she saw Olivia come up the stairs and motioning for her to wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them snickered as they made it inside and closed the door, though Helen gruffed as Olivia stole the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I was here first!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you shouldn't have let me in then.\u201d Olivia grinned and her stomach let loose a long wet gurgle. She hadn't been quite done with Alex, but speeding up digestion a bit would take care of that and soon the girl caught up with Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Alex giving Iris a push, Olivia relaxed and let the girls slide on out, she was glad the advanced class had tackled reducing a meal first. She knew many girls didn't know how to, but she'd had gotten quite a bit of practice by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus as Iris emerged from Olivia's tight little butt nothing looked out of the ordinary, and as Alex easily slipped out in the shape of a solid turd and landed on Iris that didn't change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia got up, knowing she was clean and gave the girls a final look, before hitting the flush-button. That was the best part she thought, that now she had no trouble flushing her meals down a normal toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped over to clean up as Helen took the porcelain chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen was also a student of the new advanced class and like Olivia, she thought reducing the remains was one of the more useful things they'd learned so far, though she liked the different aspect of it as well, that one could really absorb more of a meal, making it sate ones appetite better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething the girls in her stomach should have appreciated if they knew the circumstances. In a different scenario where Helen wouldn\u2019t have been able to get as much out of a meal it wouldn't have been unlikely if they'd gotten the pleasure of exploring the rest of her gut, not just her stomach and thus join Wendy and Gina on their flumride down the sewers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia waited  for Helen to finish and when she went to wash her hands, Olivia noticed that the girl had a bit of a bulge in her stomach after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you still have some in there?!\u201d Olivia remarked indicating the bulge below Helen's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I just released two.\u201d Helen clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, I released all of mine, but then, I only had two. Heh, I suppose Iris hadn't expected to come out of my butt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, neither had I.\u201d Helen admitted. \u201cI was certain it'd be mine someday. How was she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTasty, but not very filling, luckily I got another one to help her out in that department.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, what was her name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh..I don't remember...Not that it matters, does it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess not.\u201d Helen said and moved towards the door. \u201cShall we?\u201d She said and opened the door a crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeaking out to make sure no one was watching. She couldn't see anyone, so she snuck out and back downstairs with Olivia in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the main room they saw Mindy sitting fairly close to the toilet, she was still busy digesting and her focus was on her gut.<br>\r\nThey had to look around a bit to spot the other ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalinda had apparently coughed her meals back out only to have Candice take the opportunity to get a more filling meal and now Candice was rubbing a quite large belly that rested in her lap where she sat in a corner, observing the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside were not only Malinda and Natalie with her former belly-bulges, but Candice had also slurped up Erin and the final TA, so all in all she looked quite pleased with her catch and had let it spill out a bit to enjoy it better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls had, perhaps not tired of eachother's company, but the extra variety that putting all of them together was appreciated. They also seemed to like the aspect of doing something else in an hour. Being stuck in a warm dark stomach is only fun for so long, even if the company is good and they'd all had their share of orgasms by now...though a few more wouldn't hurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so all they could manage was a quite lazy pace, yeah doing something else for a while to rest the batteries might not be such a bad idea.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Olivia had gotten the impression from Candice that the girls had indeed wanted another game, and well, she wasn't against it, so she had started asking around again. With Kayla gone there had been quite a few new people arriving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo back up stairs the girls gathered again. <br>\r\nCandice let out a flow of girls and bulging bellies, which then flattened out as yet more girls travelled back up throats and emerged in, the to them, quite bright light of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy was there again as were Vera, Mary, Cindy and Sarah, the last four had only been released on the condition that they did join the game, not that they found that requirement much of a bother, especially Vera, who was longing for some payback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also some new faces, like Chandra, Roxanne and Lilia, who'd come looking for Erin for some private fun in her stomach only to eventually find Candice claiming to have the Asian girl in her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had asked them why they wanted Erin in particular and they had said that they'd heard she could offer them a roomy stomach to have some fun in. <br>\r\nHearing this Candice had hid the belly that had filled her lap.<br>\r\nIf the bulge had disappeared completely was a bit hard to tell between the woman being a little soft and her position. But the girls had been thoroughly impressed, no less so, upon hearing that there were at least six women in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice had gotten an idea and the girls thought they had sensed a hint of a draft as the woman had suddenly started gulping down air and as a result her stomach had started bulging out, getting a perfect spherical shape. For comical release Candice had on a whim taped it like a drum before stating that there'd be ample of room for them in there now and if they still wanted privacy they could still ask Erin for a place in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls hadn't declined and after some fun inside they had agreed to join the poker-game the girls there were apparently waiting for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia had also found a few others, first two gullible freshlings, whom she considered eating and digesting on the spot, but stopped herself partly because she wasn't hungry and partly because she wondered what they'd do if they actually won a girl in the poker-game. <br>\r\nThey'd introduced themselves as Roberta and Theresa anyhow. Something that'd made Olivia considered eating them again, just to put them out of their misery, but then she realized that it was really the girls' parents that deserved a trip down the poop-shute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a girl whom Olivia had been reluctant to let join, in fact she was quite certain that she was the reason a few other girls didn't join as this Rose-girl had been overhearing Olivia's discussion with them and stated that she wanted in. Olivia couldn't very well say no, even if she would have preferred to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end it might have been for the better, because Olivia had been unaware of the other recruits, they were in fact approaching the maximum possible number of players, and that's not usually a good thing as it means that almost all the cards are in play all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose, last time she was here, which had also been her first, she had first narrowly escaped getting eaten by the red-headed girl in the middle of the room, that she later noticed seemed to eat everyone she could get her hands on.<br>\r\nBut she decided not to be scared away by that and had tried fraternizing with the other girls there, even if she stayed well away from the hungry one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing here she hadn't been met with the reception she'd hoped for, she'd heard good things about this place, but no-one seemed to want her to join their fun.<br>\r\nWhile the women did talk to her it just never got anywhere beyond that and it wasn't any real conversations either, mostly they just wanted her to go away. Eventually after the hungry one had digested all her catches and left, Rose had introduced herself to a couple of girls who didn't shy back as she approached. Which she at first had seen as something positive, but the two of them had called her \u201cRosie\u201d and then gone on about how long it was since they had some nice juicy beef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was something Rose disliked, it was being called Rosie, if there was something worse than that cow-name, it was actually being referred to as a cow, so she was pretty worked up when the two girls attacked her, half squabbling over who'd get to eat her. <br>\r\nWhen it hit her that they were actually going to eat her, something in her had snapped and sandwiching the two girls together she had forcefully crammed them down her throat and started digesting them almost before they were fully inside her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had felt good to show those two cows who was the meat for eating. Unfortunately the scene had played out in the middle of the main room, so after that no one wanted to be even close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd figured she'd give the club another try this evening and had arrived late because she'd overheard the girls the last time that the hungry one usually left pretty early and didn't come back after that.<br>\r\nUnfortunately no one wanted to have anything to do with her this evening either. That until she overheard a pretty redhead trying to convince a couple of girls to join a game of poker with modified rules. It had sounded like fun, so she had said that she wanted to try it and although the redhead had seemed reluctant she had still said okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust now though they had all rearranged the available tables and chairs only to find that they just narrowly fit around them. Still she seemed to be one with the most room, Chandra to her right seemed to lean towards her friend Lilia and Roberta on the left seemed to do the same towards her friend Theresa. <br>\r\nShe couldn't complain though, less chance of anyone seeing her cards she figured as Olivia stopped shuffling the cards to go over the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the door opened and four more girls barged on in, one tall ample blonde leading the group and three identical petite little brunettes clustering beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, a game!\u201d The large girl exclaimed. She'd been curious as to what all the people going upstairs were up to, she admittedly was a bit surprised to see the veritable crowd settling around the table. \u201cWe're in!\u201d She announced. \u201cGirls' find a seat.\u201d she added to the three little ladies that scurried around her. They circled the table and squeezed themselves in wherever there was a bit of a gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal the large blonde took a look at the table and gave a few girls nods of acknowledge and greetings before turning towards the seating problem, there wasn't room, certainly not for a girl her size, not fat per say, she was still a bit soft around the edges and with curves to add to the appeal they also gave her a bit extra width.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no room for another chair, so she decided to vacant one. Thus with a quick pounce she descended on a girl and a forceful swallow was followed with a noisy slurp as two legs disappeared and the last of a girl that was seen was a lump moving down Crystal's throat and vanish between her large breasts, the stomach below did not reveal that someone had just been sent to occupy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then promptly took up the seat that the girl had occupied and motioned for Olivia to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl that had been removed from the game was:</span></div></div>",

If you want her back you'll have to play your cards right.\u201d Crystal said as she released the girl and motioned once again for Olivia to continue.<br>\r\nRoberta seemed to recover her composure surprisingly quick, then again they had come here for some throat diving and the assurance from Crystal that Theresa was okay in there, even if there wasn't as much as a jiggle in the larger girl's flesh to tell that her friend was in there, did put her worst fears at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal on the other hand had toiled with the decision of whether or not to digest the girl, but figured she might just as well wait. It'd no doubt be a while before anyone got broke anyhow, so she might just as well enjoy the girl's struggles while they lasted. At any rate if Roberta hadn't been faking it, she wasn't much of a threat, and her tasty friend certainly wasn't, Crystal concluded as she idly rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia quickly covered the rules, they were the same as last time, though she clarified that the blinds plays as a bet this time, meaning that if one wants to join a hand one has to at least meet the blinds if no one has raised the bet. But there was one difference, the game wouldn't end with an auction until eleven-hundred in markers were stacked on the table, due to the increased number of players.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that covered the first hand was dealt, with Cindy and Vera pitching in the blinds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seating followed after Vera with Mary, Sarah, Helen, Malinda, Jessica, Julianne, Candy, Stacey, Natalie, Candice, Erin, Roxanne, Lilia, Chandra, Mandy, Rose, Brandy, Roberta, Crystal in that order going clockwise and completing the lap with Olivia who had appointed herself the dealer for the first round yet again, after having given everyone their markers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was because it was the first round, but everyone entered except Malinda and that meant that the pot became quite substantial, not that many dropped out after the flop either, though on the turn most folded, despite the lure of the big win, no thanks to Olivia raising the bet yet again. The river left only Crystal seeing Olivia's raise, but with a flush of spades there was no contest, she'd been the only one with two spades in her hold, the ones that had remained the longest had hoped for a spade on the river, but alas it had turned out to be a three of hearts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that initial pot alone, counting a whopping twohundred and seventyfive Olivia passed the threehundred mark, though with no one broke yet for obvious reasons she was at least in a good position for hands to come, much like she had planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal had been the one in the worst spot, but after a betting match with Helen and Sarah she managed to make a full recovery and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the next hand Vera couldn't hide her satisfaction as Helen became the first girl to hit the half-broke mark, she didn't win the hand though, Stacey did, but seeing Helen placed last was satisfying no less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile turned to a frown though as the next pot went to Helen, what she had held she never revealed, as everyone folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as if she needed more markers Olivia took home two decent pots in a row, putting her at a staggering total of fivehundred and nintyfive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Crystal and Jessica split a pot, they'd had the same pairs and kicker, problem was that the pot wasn't dividable by two, so the final marker went to Jessica because she was the first one seated after Malinda, who'd been dealing that hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hands later offered the surprise of Malinda not folding, she figured she'd be a lot safer if she had one win in the luggage and for once she had decent cards. It was still a gamble, but one that paid off. The pot was almost as big as the one Olivia collected in the beginning, in fact it brought Malinda up to a total of threehundred and ten. Still no broke girls yet, but by now there were several girls holding on to just a few markers, perhaps she should gamble a few away so that she wouldn't be forced to buy someone and lose a hundred in the process?</span></div></div>",

After all there could only really be one winner, that did mean twenty-one losers and it was showing. She felt certain that she'd be forced to buy someone any time now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Malinda had just dropped below the three hundred mark, it was currently her obligation to take care of broke girls, she could live with that. Certainly so as Crystal's belly-rubbing was a bit of an eyesore. Though while Crystal herself looked safe for now, all three of her cousins had faired far worse, in fact Brandy was down to her last marker and Mandy to her last two, Candy while in a better seat was not fairing well either. <br>\r\nThe one that surprised Olivia the most was Erin, who also had just two markers after being forced to put in the blind for this hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand after that Lilia became the first girl to go all in after Roxanne had raised the bet on the turn and she was relieved to see all but one of the girls after her fold, that left just herself, her friend Roxanne and Candice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice had remained because she now had the markers to spare and after the flop she'd almost had a straight, the turn gave her a pair, but still no straight and she'd considered folding, but thought \u201cWhat the heck\u201d as almost everyone had folded and then the river revealed another eight giving her an unexpected three of a kind. When she raised, Roxanne folded and that just let her and Lilia whom up until the river had had the best hand but Candice's three of a kind beat her two pairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus Lilia was the first girl to become broke and Olivia didn't feel too bad about being forced to buy her.<br>\r\nShe wasn't hungry, even if sitting next to Crystal this entire time had given her a wanting feeling, but then there was the fact that there was just simply no room for the girl beneath the table, so she stood up and placed the stack of markers on the table before pushing the chair back and motioning for Lilia to come on over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia had never seen the short copper-haired girl before this game, so she was a little surprised when the girl walked up to her that she was so small. <br>\r\nThere was a brief pause as Olivia considered what to do, but then decided to just get it over with and get back to the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly Lilia was quite disappointed when the lithe redhead just picked her up and shoved most of her torso into her mouth before lifting her legs towards the roof and then quickly gulped the rest of her down. In just a few seconds she was curled up in the taunt flat belly of the larger girl, who was nearly seated back at the table before she herself had reached the bottom of the girl's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndaunted by Lilia's fate Brandy tossed in her last marker in the hand that followed. Surprisingly Jessica lead the betting that followed, to the point that after the turn was revealed, she too had tossed in her last marker, meaning that at least one girl would go broke this round. The two eights in the flop had given her three of a kind though and the remaining three girls had so far only two pairs each. The river would determine everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt changed nothing, Jessica couldn't raise the bet so no-one did meaning that all four remained in the showdown and the pot remained the same, still the four of hearts had played in her favour. Thus Brandy was out and with Olivia still holding over fourhundred markers she was already sold.<br>\r\nJessica on the other hand could finally breathe a bit easier as she collected the winnings, failing to notice the grunt from Malinda who realized that she would have gotten a full house had she stayed in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia realized as she put forth the second stack of markers on the table, that Brandy was already at her side waiting, she also realized that it was one of Crystal's cousins.  Something about the girl made her quite certain that she could get the other little girl in her stomach moving, which she wasn't doing much, but that energy could be put to use in a different place as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you scoot on over a bit?\u201d Olivia asked Crystal, who noticed that Roberta had already moved on over to Rose in an effort to get as far away from the girl who up and ate her friend for no reason earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the extra room Olivia stepped up and motioned for Brandy to get under the table before seating herself again, this time with her legs on either side of Brandy's head, leaving the girl little doubt of what was expected of her and she went to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia had been reluctant to gobble down Crystal's cousin, not knowing quite how the girl would take to one of them getting digested by her, not to mention that the girl still had two sisters in the game, even if their positions didn't look promising at the moment, Mindy and Carol showed in the last game that positions can change. <br>\r\nSo playing safe she decided to have the girl outside of her stomach for now. The girl that was in there though she couldn't care less about, her only hopes was that she'd start to struggle soon and was looking forward to that almost as much as Brandy getting her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the distraction she found the hand Chandra was dealing taking up most of her attention, Mandy had been forced to pitch in her last marker as a blind bet and at the flop Sarah had put her last one on the table as well. Rose nearly bet herself into oblivion as well, but as neither she nor Jessica raised the bet on the river she still had a marker left when the showdown forced them to reveal their cards.<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her and Jessica, who both had two pairs, of which Rose's kings and sixes were better than Jessica's queens and eights, both Mandy and Sarah had a flush of hearts. And as Sarah had the ace in her hold, so she got the winnings and Mandy got auto-sold to Olivia just like her sister had been the hand before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia looked at the girl, perplexed as to what to do, swallowing her would probably lessen the eagerness of the girl between her legs. At the same time she couldn't very well fit the girl in anywhere else and she wasn't about to have a slave stand around idle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving the girl close she whispered to her. \u201cGet down there...\u201d Olivia motioned under the table \u201c...and make her crazy, swallow her legs and suck on her hips like a piece of hard candy if you have to.\u201d She liked the grin those instructions put on Mandy's face before the girl disappeared from view.<br>\r\nBecause she was sitting in a hard chair Brandy wasn't getting very good access, she might have gotten better, but Olivia would have a hard time playing the game in any position that'd grant her that. This way Olivia figured there'd at least be some real action going on, she was looking forward to how Brandy would react to the scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Olivia was forced to pay attention to the game again, this last purchase had used up her last extra markers and now she found herself in fourth place, Malinda had taken the lead, followed by Candice and Roxanne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin followed this hand with interest as well she'd gotten a pair on jacks in her hold so she'd tossed in her last marker and to her joy another jack was revealed on the flop. She couldn't bet anymore though and there were still four more girls playing. She'd been more nervous if she knew that three of them were just waiting for a card to get a straight and it wasn't even the same card, thus increasing the chances of one of them succeeding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turn did not reveal such a card and as a result no raising the bet, which also meant that they all stayed in for the river. A seven, ten or queen would spell disaster, the turn had been a five of clubs and the river revealed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA queen of diamonds, just what Roberta had been hoping for as it meant she got an eight to queen straight, while Erin's three jacks remained the second best hand. As the river had trashed the remaining girls's hands they all folded as Roberta raised the bet, Jessica holding naught and Cindy knowing her pair of nines would serve her no better than Sarah figured her pair of queens would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Roberta collected the pot and Erin was forced to admit that she was broke. At least the pot was the smallest so far so Roberta didn't even pass twohundred, meaning no-one was forced to buy her just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia noticed to her delight that Brandy was getting excited, she herself got excited by the fact that she got a straight on the flop, three diamonds on the board meant that the likelihood on someone having a flush was pretty high though, She guessed that Natalie might have that as she even tossed in her final marker. That made most girls fold, leaving just the two of them and Crystal. Then the turn revealed another diamond, a five, replacing Olivia's five of spades in her straight and thus giving her a straight flush! Crystal and Natalie could keep their flushes, there was no way they were beating her hand, unfortunately, Natalie had no more markers to pitch in and she just couldn't seem to lure Crystal into a betting-match, something that surprised her later as Crystal turned out to have the ace in her hold, thus giving her the highest possible flush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell at least the pot was hers and as a bonus Natalie now joined the broke Erin.<br>\r\nCounting her markers she emitted a grunt though, three hundred and five, just enough to be forced to give a hundred of the up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the dilemma of what to do with the girl she bought, not to mention whom that would be?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Beneath the table Mandy had been going slow, Brandy's knees were still sticking out of her mouth and she had pretty much stopped the progress there. Moving forward would only bring the girl's legs closer together and cut off her access to where she had both her hands busy, in Brandy's groin, and she was getting results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia delighted in the moans coming from between her legs and the erratic attention she got herself, though luckily for the scared girl in her stomach, it was mostly a psychological enjoyment of the scenario being played out and not a physical one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie took a look at the strange sight as she crawled under the table. As Olivia had had no clue of how to instruct her she'd simply commanded her to help Mandy pleasure Brandy. Natalie couldn't tell them apart, but there was only one pleasuring the other so she was fairly certain of whom to please, that just left how...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Brandy being a fair bit above the floor, being perched between Olivia's crotch and Mandy's mouth, held up in one end by Mandy and the other by her own arms, Natalie figured that she should get underneath and see what she could do from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some manoeuvring but she finally managed to get her own legs in-between the legs of Olivia's chair, so that she lay more or less in a sixty-nine position with Brandy. And as Mandy still hadn't swallowed anymore of the girl's legs she pried her thighs apart far enough to insert her own head where Mandy's fingers had been playing, finding the folds there already warmed up and moist. Her arms she brought up around Brandy to grope the girl's bottom, but mostly just to keep herself from falling back down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy found that with Natalie there, her hands had little to do and figured she might as well do what Olivia had told her earlier and suck on Brandy like a candy.<br>\r\nQuickly sliding forward and pushing the girl's hips into her mouth, Mandy in the process pinned Natalie in place as well. <br>\r\nAnd again Natalie was in the way, sure she could slobber around the both of them, but the only part she could really get a good taste of would be Brandy's butt, but that'd require turning her over and that'd remove Brandy's access to Olivia's groin. So instead Mandy moved a bit more of the girls inside her and reached her hands out for Natalie's lovely bottom instead, groping and massaging it, lifting the girl up in the process, so that her sister and the larger girl could grind against one another, even if Brandy was doing most of the grinding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the game continued without much action, the girls with few marker holding on to them like the lifelines they were. Something that some of them regretted, like when Olivia dealt her second hand and Julianne would have gotten a flush had she joined the game and Candy would have gotten a straight, instead the pot went to Chandra who had had the guts to go all in and won with two pairs, queens and tens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia had considered cheating, now that she had the opportunity to manipulate the cards first hand, but saw little need to, and frankly she was honest enough with herself that she could admit that she was too distracted at the moment. Brandy was clearly starting to enjoy herself and the moans she emitted made Olivia wish she had a better view of the action, instead all she could do was to look down from time to time and gyrate her hips into Brandy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy's deal forced Mary to throw in her last marker as a blind bet and received lousy cards, so unsurprisingly she didn't collect the pot and looked on anxiously as Roxanne counted her markers, the girl being just one shy of being forced to buy one of the broke girls, meaning she took the first place from Malinda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia didn't know the cause, but she could definitely tell when Natalie got into position, the girl knew how to eat a pussy and the effects on Brandy was hard to miss. By the time Mandy had swallowed up her hips Olivia had to steady herself on Crystal and Cindy as Brandy's first squirming orgasm threatened to topple her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Mandy swallowing more of her up, Brandy had less with which to squirm about on the outside though and the help to stay upright meant that she could wrap her arms around Natalie instead of using them as legs. That didn't mean that the squirming was any less the second time the two girls got her off, only that this time it was Mandy that struggled for purchase so that the two girls wouldn't worm their way down her throat entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen dealt a hand that made quite a few girls join, only Rose and Cindy stayed out, Malinda would have if she hadn't been forced to pay the blind. Jessica started out with two aces in her hold, which looked quite al-right and both Vera and Sarah aimed for a flush, both of them holding two hearts and two more were played in the flop one of which was a king which made Crystal and Roberta stay while Olivia did so because of the other, a seven. Then unexpectedly the turn revealed yet another seven, placing Olivia in the lead with three of a kind.<br>\r\nSuch an open playing field made most stay, Vera had no choice though as she'd played her last marker.<br>\r\nThen the river revealed yet another seven, which meant that three girls had full house and Olivia had an amazing four of a kind, originally she'd only stayed because she could afford to lose the markers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera cringed as she saw the card, a seven of clubs, the one of hearts already played, she knew she was broke, her chance of revenge foiled. Her mood not improving when Olivia revealed the seven in her hold.<br>\r\nNeither did it help that the twohundred markers in the pot meant that Olivia had to buy yet another girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden twist of the game had forced Olivia to pay attention and try as best she could to ignore the action below, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Olivia felt Brandy shudder yet again, noting that Natalie and Mandy had certainly not stopped giving her a good time. But hardly had she finished that assessment before she felt Brandy gasp and suck violently, as passionate surges coursed through her body. The result causing the table to lift a couple of inches with a bang before settling back down again disrupting the markers on it a bit. The bigger change were underneath it, where Olivia's hips had crammed into the little girl, rump first, and now Olivia's knees were at her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey wai...!!\u201d Was all she managed before another convulsion from below silenced her with a loud wet slurping that ended in some very satisfied feminine moaning, but then that got silenced as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne moment Olivia had been there, the next she slipped from view and was gone.<br>\r\nVera looked under the table and was met with the view of one of the triplets rubbing one hand on her shrinking belly and the other one trying to reach around the diminishing bulge to access her lower lips.<br>\r\nThe commotion had clearly caused her sister and her playmate to slide down her throat, so that now only she remained. What went on inside she couldn't tell, though that shrinking looked kind of ominous, not that Vera did mind that much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see other girls peeking under the table as well, then one of them got down on the floor and reached out. The girl of everyone's attention yelped as the woman grabbed her arm by the shoulder and pulled her from her hiding place with seemingly little effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Vera got her real surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice crammed the girl into her mouth and the girl seemed to vanish.<br>\r\nCausally reseating herself and pulling her chair back into its place at the table, Vera hardly noticed when Candice swallowed, sending the stuffed girl into her stomach with about as much ceremony as one would give any snack available at a more normal pokergame. <br>\r\nThe only expression she showed was one of confusion when she noticed that everyone's eyes were fixed on her, as if her act had been as natural as eating the provided snacks at a party and thus the attention was the unusual thing.</span></div></div>",

Before long a pair of feet emerged and the slick girl declined the offer of emerging standing up, opting instead to fall on her knees and thus use gravity to emerge quicker. The girl was clearly larger than the one who's mouth she was emerging from and soon her her head emerged and beneath the matted wet hair was Natalie's face. <br>\r\nHer arms were still inside Mandy though and as she leaned back the reason for that became clear as she helped pulling Brandy from the depths of her sister. So with a wet squelch she dislodged and landed on top of Natalie as they both toppled over and away from Mandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandy got up and helped Natalie to her feet, in doing so Vera noticed one thing in particular, that all the girls bellies were nice and flat, so where was Olivia?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia thought she was a goner for sure, when Brandy sucked her down her throat she knew the girl was lost in bliss and she could hear her stomach rumbling below. She managed to get some purchase much to her own surprise and was able to halt her decent just outside the girl's stomach. <br>\r\nIt was obvious Brandy had hidden her pretty thoroughly in the process and almost as obvious to Olivia that the reason she wasn't being digested was that the stomach was already all kinds of nasty and the girl's body didn't want any of it to spill into her throat, hence the sphincter was closed, even if it might still let things in if they pushed against it.<br>\r\nLuckily Brandy's throat wasn't undulating and pushing Olivia down any more and once in Mandy's stomach Brandy separated from Natalie and her excitement died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Mandy in turn got manhandled and found herself dropped into Candice's stomach a fall that jostled Olivia from her perch and she too dropped into a stomach, Brandy's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now though it was nearly calm and despite having gotten nothing but air to digest the juices had luckily drained, leaving Olivia, much to her relief in a large friendly stomach, it's owner and the world around her seemed to move about quite a bit though, but at least she seemed safe for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice disrupted the scene as she grabbed Brandy and in the process the girl's attention as well. \u201cCough her up.\u201d She repeated the command she'd given to the girl's sister moments before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia was thankful when she spilled out onto the floor and looked up to see Candice offering her a hand. \u201cThanks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy pleasure.\u201d Candice said and licked her lips. Olivia wasn't sure what that meant, since she didn't know what she'd just been inside the woman's stomach. Candice on the other hand knew that Lilia was still in Olivia's stomach, which made her one of only three with that knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia wiped a bit of the goop off of herself as she looked about, noticing that all of her 'bitches' were also wet. \u201cI thought I got swallowed by Brandy and that she got swallowed by Mandy...but why are Natalie and Mandy wet too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I got carried along for the ride.\u201d Natalie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I did say it was my pleasure to help out.\u201d Candice repeated, giving her belly a pat for emphasis. \u201cHad to assess the situation you know...if worst had come to worst we couldn't have 'bitches' running about without a mistress, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf cour...se.\u201d Olivia trailed off, her expression becoming more thoughtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the two triplets she owned, \u201cWhich one of you is best at hiding?\u201d Brandy raised her hand and Mandy just nodded in Brandy's direction.<br>\r\nWithout blinking Olivia reached out and before Mandy could even yelp, half her torso was inside Olivia and the rest of the girl followed quickly. Olivia licked her lips before she continued.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that leaves you two...\u201d She said to Brandy who was eyeing Olivia's flat belly, and Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia went over to the game case and picked up a special 'lucky-coin'-marker and pointed to Natalie saying \u201cHeads...\u201d and Brandy when saying \u201cTails.\u201d, then flipped the fake coin.</span></div></div>",

You get to play my next hand, but first swallow me and Brandy and hide us if you can.\u201d Olivia said, then on a whim she grabbed the small brunette and gave her a close hug from behind so that Natalie could and would have to swallow them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could protest Natalie followed orders and launched herself on the girls, taking in both their heads and shoulders in the initial strike, then she apparently crammed them in while she started to hide them, which made them shrink from view all the quicker, soon leaving just a large bulge going down her throat and settling as a potbelly at the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the bulge the four girls made was hardly noticeable as she took Olivia's seat between Crystal and Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so where were we?\u201d Natalie queried, she hadn't followed the game for a few hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, Olivia were to buy another 'bitch', before we could continue.\u201d Crystal pointed out, making Natalie notice just how many markers were piled up before her. The piles used to be neat stacks, but had gotten roughed up when Olivia disappeared beneath the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a quick count Natalie tidied up a little, before placing a hundred stack on the table where the other four stacks were.<br>\r\n\u201cI guess since I'm playing for my mistress, that means I'm buying for her too. So what does the market have to offer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMary...\u201d Candice said, pointing to the curvy girl in question. \u201c...Vera...\u201d Candice's hand moved a seat to point at the redhead on Mary's right. \u201c...and Erin.\u201d She finished, giving the little girl next to her a pat on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll go with Erin.\u201d Natalie said and watched the little Asian girl hurry around the table to her new mistress. Erin wasn't the only one surprised when Natalie guided her under the table and shoved the girl's face in between her legs.<br>\r\nSeveral girls considered protesting, but Olivia had said that Natalie got to play her hand, so Natalie did get to play her hand however she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalinda gave her daughter a surprised look, but then started dealing the cards, making Jessica put one of her two remaining markers on the table and Julianne her final one, as they were the ones to pay the blind bets. Almost everyone joined at first, but as Natalie carelessly kept raising more and more dropped off until only she and Roberta remained and it turned out that they'd have to split the pot as both of them had an eight-queen straight and Julianne only had two pairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCounting the markers in front of her Natalie finished up with saying \u201c...and three-hundred and five...\u201d Indicating that 'she' had passed the barrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her time evaluating the available girls though, grinding her hips into her Asian pleasure-slave while she did. Finally she settled for Mary. She didn't stop Erin though, she just leaned and turned somewhat sideways as the girl approached. Picking her up and leaning back as she ate the girl while the Asian continued to eat her moist centre. Then as Mary slid from view and joined the bulge below her breasts Natalie reached down and slid her chair back a bit before she raised the Asian to her lips as well.<br>\r\nThen Erin too slid between Natalie's lips and transformed into a bulge travelling down the girl's neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie sat there rubbing her bloated belly for a while before she stood up and started coughing the girls back up again. It wasn't too long before they were all out and Olivia looked pleased with the two new additions to her harem. She didn't seem to upset with Natalie's stunt of having Erin pleasure her, though she figured that it was a good thing she'd just allowed her to play one hand and not more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia pondered for a second or two, before she bent over and out of her mouth slid Lilia quickly followed by Mandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErin, I want you to play my next hand, but first swallow all of us for some fun in that giant stomach of yours, me last.\u201d Olivia instructed and watched the tiny woman wolf down girl after girl, all of them larger than herself, even if Lilia was just barely so and neither Brandy nor Mandy were particularly large either. Olivia found that fact a little dissatisfying so she did a quick survey and realised that all the large girls were still in the game, Natalie and Vera were the largest ones out and they were average height and weight at the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted by Erin picking her up and opening her mouth wide below her. Despite the somewhat expected surprise she managed to notice the girl's bulging belly and managed a \u201cHide them, Eri...\u201d Before the petite girl closed her lips and swallowed Olivia down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her belly Erin had saved a sizeable bulge in order to better feel the girls moving about in there, but she had her orders and as she rubbed her belly it quickly shrank away, leaving nothing but a smooth flat surface that was the usual look for her belly.<br>\r\nShe then hopped into Olivia's chair and scooted it up to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but look to her right as Crystal loomed over her, looking down with a friendly yet unnerving smile, making Erin feel really small, though she felt a little more secure when she noticed the almost depleted stack of markers in front of the large blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal couldn't help herself, her appetite wetted by seeing this delicious little morsel of a girl and knowing that inside her were a small crowd of women acting as a lovely filling. So inside her a girl twice Erin's size stopped struggling and quickly melted away as Crystals belly began salivating and squirming as well, luckily her large frame provided enough insulation to almost completely silence the sounds, meaning that no-one noticed as her belly bubbled and moaned while it worked it's magic on Theresa, shrinking the girl as well as transforming her, while also moving her southwards, towards Crystal's large shapely bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin did like Natalie, she raised when she could, it's easy to spend someone else's money. Amazingly she too pulled the stunt off, but instead of sharing with Roberta as Natalie had done, she took all the winnings for herself...or Olivia as the case may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe readied another stack of a hundred in markers, as unsurprisingly Olivia had yet again passed the limit, but unlike Natalie, Erin didn't buy anyone, instead she stood up and started regurgitating her meals and first up was Olivia who emerged head first, stopping Erin with her body movements before much more than her neck was out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDone already? We hardly got started in here.\u201d She then looked towards the table. \u201cSo how are we doing?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mouth full Erin couldn't exactly reply, but she motioned for 'their' markers and the stack of a hundred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat well, huh?\u201d Olivia mused \u201cOkay, buy and swallow Vera and play a couple more hands for me.\u201d Olivia said before she pulled herself back inside and wiggled down the Asian girl's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin just shrugged her shoulders and put the stack further onto the table before she herself walked over to Vera and standing behind the girl, Erin opened wide as she leaned forward and engulfed Vera all the way to the seat of her chair. Once there, Erin stood back up and let the girl slide into her belly, which still remained flat.</span></div></div>",

On the river Erin let them have it though, five girls had followed her and that meant a lot of markers spent at any rate, she only held a pair of threes, but it was unlikely that they'd fold now, so she did instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice was thankful for the Asian girl's persistent raising of the bet, because that meant that she could collect the second largest pot of the game and enough markers to bring her over threehundred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice looked over the options she had, there seemed to be only one broke girl available and she hadn't seen the girl before. Facts that made her choices simple, so she waved the slim little dark-haired girl over. <br>\r\nJulianne didn't even come to a halt before Candice sucked her into her mouth. There she got to experience the older woman giving her a thorough tasting, at first she thought it'd be nice, but Candice didn't seem to be into pleasing her 'bitch', only tasting her and as such she handled the now quite tiny girl in her mouth roughly enough that after a few minutes Julianne was almost relived when the throat opened and she was pushed into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then the game had long since resumed, so the tiny bulge she made went unnoticed, as did the scream she made as Candice's hungry stomach greeted her.<br>\r\nUnfortunately for everyone involved, Julianne was in all fairness a small delicate little girl, even if she became a lot smaller with the help of Candice's digestive tract, and Candice was a fairly big hungry woman. Meaning that Julianne didn't fair too well, by the time she reached Candice's ample bottom her future looked like it was ready to go down the drain and Candice in turn was still left hungry, a more filling meal had indeed not just been preferable but actually a necessity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Malinda joined the fun, she only called, her pair of kings looked good, but not that good, still she called and it paid off in the end as the river revealed a third one, meaning that she got another steady pot, that made her pass the fourhundred mark. Though looking around the only broke girl visible was Erin and she was already bought and doing her mistress's bidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one had objected as Erin continued to play and play aggressively, so on the River everyone had folded and she could collect the pot without revealing her cards and that meant that Olivia was again over the mark. There were still no broke girls, though the hand to come would force both Chandra and Rose to use their last marker for the blind-bets, so there would inevitably be at least one soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs no-one pointed out the fact that 'a couple' typically means two, Erin prepared to play her fourth hand in Olivia's place after her last order, her mistress being so tiny that if she was giving any orders, not even Erin could hear them.<br>\r\nAs for the hand Erin was certain she had the pot in her palm when the flop gave her a seven to jack straight, likewise most other girls had folded, except the two who had been forced to go all in and Roberta who was feeling pretty confident about her three aces.<br>\r\nThe river made Erin a little unnerved though as it placed a ten on the board connecting four of the cards, luckily only four girls remained and two of them, not by choice.<br>\r\nHowever the showdown showed that that pesky ten of hearts had given Rose an eight to queen straight, thus beating Erin's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sigh of relief from Rose was matched by one of dismay from her neighbour and Chandra let out another one as the markers in front of Erin still numbered over three hundred. So  Erin prepared another hundred-stack, but was halted by Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey didn't Olivia say you got to play a couple of hands? How many have you played now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been caught Erin didn't want to push the issue, so she got up and started coughing the girls in her stomach onto the floor. It was pretty impressive, where once just a little petite girl had stood there were soon eight, seven of whom were larger than and covered mostly in the small girl's saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, somebody give me an update...\u201d Olivia asked the girls still in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell after Erin swallowed Vera down to join you all in her stomach, Candice won and bought Julianne...\u201c Helen informed, but seeing Olivia's confusion she added. \u201c...the svelte little dark-haired girl that sat over there.\u201d she said pointing. Olivia glanced over to Candice, who winked at her as she gave her belly a small pat. In reality she should have given her butt a pat, but she didn't feel like making Julianne's fate known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen Malinda collected a pot...\u201d Helen continued \u201c...and now I guess you passed three hundred, because Erin was about to buy Chandra...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey how many hands did Erin play?\u201d Olivia protested, realising that the math didn't add up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c....Four I think...\u201d Helen answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see...\u201d Olivia said as she turned to give Erin the evil eye, but she just couldn't and in all honesty it wasn't as if the game had gone badly in Erin's hands. So she turned to the table and the stack Erin had prepared, placing it towards the centre of the table she waved Chandra over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing Olivia realised that Chandra was yet another little girl, why wasn't Crystal broke yet? She'd like to see someone tiny eat her ass, like one of her cousin's or something...yeah that'd be nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute...\u201d Malinda protested. \u201cChandra is mine...\u201d She said and placed a hundred stack on the table. \u201cI didn't get to buy last round because there were no broke girls around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia was almost relieved, she had already placed a hand on the broke girl and had been about to swallow her down unceremoniously, because she didn't spark any interesting ideas in Olivia's mind.<br>\r\nSo instead of eating her, Olivia, shoved the girl in Malinda's direction and retrieved the hundred markers she'd been about to pay for the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalinda, in turn shoved the girl under the table, seeing her friend get handled in such a way brought a gasp from Lilia and that in turn made Olivia realise that the copper-haired busty little thing wasn't in her stomach anymore, something that she decided the girl should be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia made the process short with her, her mind really on what to do with the rest of the girls and it was semi-stuck on Crystal's cousins. Realising she couldn't tell them apart she remembered which one had been the good at hiding her meals so she commanded: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrandy, swallow your sister.\u201d and watched with amusement as one clone engulfed the other and once the bulge she made in the neck had disappeared beneath the girl's collarbones there was no trace of the second one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwallow the rest of them as well.\u201d Olivia added, motioning to the remaining girls she owned. Erin being the first to go, then Vera and Mary and finally Natalie settled in Brandy's slightly bulging stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over Olivia put her hand on the small girl's belly and told her to hide them if she could and to her delight the bulge did go away. That only left the question of whether to swallow the girl or join the girl's in her stomach. She'd had luck with the girl's playing for her and it had been fun too, so Olivia decided that she should join the girls in Brandy, but she really wanted to deal when it became her turn and with both Roberta and Crystal in a tough spot she decided not to let Brandy play all three hands till then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Brandy, you get to play the next, two, hands for me, then I want you to cough me back up.\u201d Olivia said emphasising two and that she wanted out the way she got in, just to avoid confusion. \u201cNow swallow me.\u201d She added realising that she'd forgotten that part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandy wasn't slow to react, though with a girl in her stomach Olivia was a bit of a mouthful, even so she soon slid smoothly if not quickly down the petite girl's throat. Luckily Olivia was unaware that her presence ruined the girl's figure as Brandy was unable to hide that much she was left with a quite sizeable potbelly.<br>\r\nThough scooting up her chair next to her cousin Brandy had still no trouble sitting at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the two before her Brandy didn't raise when able, she was more at home with just calling. The first hand though was over quickly, Roberta making the right call and gambling her two last markers and in return getting a small, but lifesaving pot back.<br>\r\nThe second hand though was more interesting as both Crystal and Candy went all in, only to see everyone but Rose fold and eventhough Rose had a pair of kings on her hold, what gave her the pot was the fact that with either of them she could make a straight.</span></div></div>",

She slyly runs her arms around Stacey, getting a feel of her assets. \"I have a feeling that you and I are about to become VERY close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Stacey could utter any kind of response, she finds herself with a mouthful of tongue as the girl suddenly locks her into a french kiss. The TA closes her eyes and kisses back, succumbing to the pleasures this amorous girl will soon offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Outside Malinda's belly, Erin has her ear placed over Malinda's bulging gut. \"They're really going at it in there.\" Erin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing better than love in your tummy.\" Malinda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's much more in mine, care to join in?\" Kayla butts in, her massive belly shifting with the movements of it's occupants, unaware of their fate. Everyone quickly turns towards Kayla and shakes their heads \"No.\" to the woman. \"Heh, your loss.\" She replies, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Erin, get back over here! Let's have some fun!\" Jessica says, motioning her over back to the couch she and Julianne are on.</span></div></div>",

Do you two have anything specific in mind?\" Erin says as she sits back down between the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite, we were wondering if you had some desire.\" Julianne says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing in particular.\" Erin admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we take turns on ourselves?\" Jessica suggests. \"Since you've already enjoyed this sort of fun before, would you mind being on bottom? So to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why limit our enjoyment to ourselves?\" Erin says, attempting to take her friend off the subject of sending her down into a belly. \"There's plenty of nice meals around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, how about you point out a good few?\" Julianne suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin takes a look around the room, trying to find a few girls to placate the two ravenous friends surrounding her. Luckily, on a couch nearby are two girls who seem to be engrossed in watching Kayla, currently swallowing another poor woman. She recognizes them as Mary and Cindy, regulars to these meetings, Mary, on the left is an attractive woman with short, black hair. She's at least five and a half feet tall with sizable assets.<br>\r\nNext to her is Cindy, she's somewhat taller in comparison, but less plump, her blond hair stretches down far, all the way to her lower back, the two are good sports, not making a fuss if somebody decides they would make good stomach filler, although that isn't to say that they aren't skilled predators themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you go after those two?\" Erin says, pointing toward the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit, they're fine looking ladies, meal-wise, but there's three of us and two of them. How are they supposed to fill all of us up?\" Julianne replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm fine with staying back and watching, go get 'em\" Erin encourages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica shrugs. \"Fine by me, the one on the left looks quite tasty, dibs on her.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll take the bigger one. Let's go.\" Julianne replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls depart from the couch toward Mary and Cindy, taking caution to avoid getting too close to Kayla on the way. As they approach, the two girls on the couch turn towards Jessica and Julianne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you two are enjoying the show.\" Jessica says, making an arm motion toward Kayla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's always fun watching Kayla eat, besides, it's good to keep track of who you aren't going to be seeing here again.\" Mary replies. \"She'll probably be digesting soon, maybe after one or two more girls, then we can forget about her, and the fun can really start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Julianne says. \"You'd think people would be even more cautious around her if she's emptying herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no.\" Cindy says. \"She always takes her leave after digesting her catches. Just stay clear of the path to the bathroom, and then from there to the front door. She never passes up dessert if it's in the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the advice.\" Jessica says. \"But for now, how about we enjoy her little show?\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy giggles. \"How about we make our own?\" She says as she scoots over, putting some sitting space between Mary and herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we can't refuse.\" Julianne replies. She and Jessica quickly sit down together between the two girls, with Jessica next to Mary, and Julianne next to Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the room, Erin grins, and prepares herself for a little self-pleasure as she watches. \"This is going to be good.\" She mutters to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne immediately strikes, grabbing Cindy and engulfing her head, after securing her arms, she slowly begins to swallow her down, taking her time to savor her taste. As Cindy is slowly devoured, Mary watches and giggles, not minding her friend's situation one bit. As Erin watches from the distance, she begins to finger herself, enjoying the sight of Cindy being swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like she just couldn't wait.\" Mary comments, giggling. \"But I'm sure you'll be a dear and have a little fun first.\" She says, turning toward Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Jessica replies as she draws near Mary. The two lock lips and begin to kiss. As Jessica closes her eyes, Mary sees her opportunity and stretches her mouth open, then quickly pulls Jessica's head into her mouth. Surprised, Jessica struggles as Mary begins swallowing her down, a fruitless effort as in only a couple seconds, her shoulders are pulled into Mary's throat, trapping her arms. As the terrified girl travels down the woman's throat, she realizes that there's no chance for her to escape on her own, and since Julianne is too busy enjoying her own meal, she can only hope that Erin will rescue her.</span></div></div>",

On the way, she draws a little too close to Kayla, and barely reacts in time as Kayla attempts to grab her leg, making a perfectly timed leap. Erin then quickly makes her way to Mary, just in time to watch Jessica's legs slide down Mary's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello Erin.\" Mary says, grinning as she rubs her engorged belly, not making any effort to hide it. \"Enjoy the show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I always do, Mary.\" Erin says. \"But that was a friend of mine, I can't just sit by and watch you eat her.\" She says, her tone a little too friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine.\" Mary says. \"I didn't bring any purgative, so I'll need a little help getting her out of me, you mind volunteering?\" She says, a bit seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Julianne finally finishes her meal, rubbing her belly as she feels Cindy shifting within, she's a bit surprised to see that Mary's eaten Jessica, but then again, Jessica was always a bit too trusting for her own good. She's at a loss of what to do, seeing as Erin's here, and Mary seems to be willing to let her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go run along.\" Erin tells Julianne. \"I can handle this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then.\" Julianne replies. \"Now that I'm full, I'm going to hang with the family.\" She says, pointing toward Malinda and Natalie. Julianne's belly quickly shrinks, hiding the tasty girl contained within. After making sure Julianne is far enough away, Erin's expression quickly changes to a lewd look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you out of there, Jessica.\" Erin says as she gets on her knees in front of Mary. Mary lifts her belly up and spreads her legs, allowing Erin to lean in and begin eating her out. Mary then drops the heavy, meal-filled belly onto Erin, securing her in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of Mary's stomach, Jessica breathes a sigh of relief as she heard Erin's voice, she brings her hands upward, expecting Erin's hands to emerge from the sphincter to retrieve her. But no such hands ever come, Jessica soon learns that something is wrong as Mary begins to moan in pleasure. \"What's going on?\" She shouts, confused. She gets no reply, except for of weak acids beginning to secret from the stomach walls, causing Jessica to tingle all over. \"Erin! She's starting to digest! What are you doing?\" She screams, panic setting in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin pauses for a moment to speak. \"I'm helping Mary here get you out. What else?\" She says, chuckling, before returning her attentions to Mary's pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica realizes just what's happening as she hears Erin's voice coming from below. The acids now get stronger, and Jessica begins to soften up. \"You're my friend! You seriously can't be doing this!\" She screams. The stomach walls now start to become active, closing in on Jessica to help work the acids into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary's my friend too you know.\" Erin says, pausing again. \"And friends don't let friends go hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You bitc-\" Is all Jessica manages before the stomach walls suddenly close in hard, beginning to crush her while working the increasingly powerful acids into her. With no warning, Jessica hears Mary scream out in orgasm from Erin's efforts. The stomach now goes into overdrive, acids pour in at an alarming rate while the walls squeeze Jessica relentlessly, who desperately squirms, accomplishing nothing but washing more enzymes over her. Within only a moment, she is reduced to a thick pulp, which is then immediately drained into the intestines to be absorbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the help.\" Mary coos as her belly rapidly shrinks, freeing Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always willing to help a friend out.\" Erin says as she stands back up, grinning sinisterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! She's already ready to come out, I'm getting faster at this.\" Mary says, a pressure forming in her rear, her body finished with Jessica. \"I can take it from here.\" She says as she gets up and heads to the bathroom. As soon as she's left alone, Erin's own belly begins to gurgle, she realizes that she hasn't eaten yet. She brings her attention toward Julianne, she's laying down on the couch on Natalie's lap, her Cindy stuffed belly hanging out at full size. She's discussing something with Natalie, while receiving a rather sensual belly rub from her. Malinda's moved to a nearby chair, rubbing her belly as she feels Stacey and Mindy inside. The sight of all these women nearly makes Erin drool, she immediately begins choosing her meal.</span></div></div>",

Unlike Julianne, Mary works quickly in swallowing her meal. Jessica's breasts squeeze into the skilled predator's mouth, and are quickly swallowed, Mary doesn't pause, and swallows down her meal's flat belly, followed by her waist. Jessica shudders as Mary's tongue only briefly passes over her sensitive spots, before the throat around her pulls once again, and with no more wide parts in the way, Jessica's legs constantly slide into Mary's throat, following the rest of the girl into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her meal, Mary allows her belly to bulge out, the struggles of Jessica within clearly visible to all. Turning to her side, she check's on Julianne's progress with her friend, and notices that she's made little progress, busy enjoying the taste of Cindy's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having trouble?\" Mary asks jokingly. Julianne is surprised for a moment to see Mary with a bulging belly, having expected Jessica to have done to eating. She simply shrugs and shakes her head no, making Cindy's legs flail about. \"Just taking your sweet time then, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary diverts her attention to the other guests, and notices Erin, obviously having enjoyed the sight of her devouring the new girl. She briefly considers approaching her for a round of fun, but quickly decides not to, as she realizes just who's going to beat her to the punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin, lost in a haze of pleasure, gasps as somebody suddenly forces her legs together, trapping her hand between her thighs. As she come to her senses, she gasps as she sees Kayla, having crawled up to her as she was distracted by the show Julianne and Jessica were putting on for her. Before Erin has any chance to struggle, Kayla engulfs the girl's feet and with amazing speed begins to swallow. Erin only manages a quick squeal before she finds herself completely inside the deadly predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erin enters Kayla's stomach, she finds herself quickly tangled up in the middle of several women, some struggling, some having given up and are making love in their final moments, and a certain three not even aware of their fate, and are confused as to why all the other occupants are struggling so much. Before Erin could do anything, powerful acids begin secreting into the stomach, which begin to squeeze hard on it's contents. Everyone inside Kayla only has a brief moment to struggle, scream, or do both before the acids and the churning take their toll on their bodies, quickly reducing everyone into a thick liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Mary gets off at the sight of Kayla's belly beginning to shrink, her intestines absorbing the remains of the poor girls that were inside. Julianne was too busy enjoying her meal to have noticed Kayla devour Erin. While Stacey and Jessica are secured in different stomachs, unaware of anything happening outside. Soon, Kayla's body is finished with the girls, and she heads to the bathroom to let them out. Mary turns back toward Julianne, and find that she's finally finished with her meal, and gives a slight burp after swallowing Cindy's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough.\" Mary says. \"You just missed Kayla digesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph.\" Julianne grunts. \"Well, I enjoy having a meal more than watching others being a meal.\" Her belly gives an audible gurgle in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now, you'd better not be digesting her.\" Mary says. \"If anything happens to her in there, your friend here is going to be nutrients.\" She warns, giving her belly a poke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not, I'm not.\" Julianne assures.</span></div></div>",

Everybody eventually learns about the etiquette at these gatherings, a few chicken out after learning, and some end up learning the hard way. But the rest will remain for various reasons. Myself? I grew bored of constant \"catch and release\" play with my friends, always swallowing, never digesting. I find things more exciting with these folk, I could stew away in a stomach for hours, worried every second that whoever had me, could digest with no repercussions, besides, call me a freak, but I find the sight of someone digesting very erotic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're some kind of suicidal thrill seeker.\" Julianne points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary shrugs. \"Sort of, you may have gotten the wrong impression, we normally don't see as many digestions as we've had today so far. Most of the time, aside from Kayla's catches, one or two people end up being a meal all the way. I've been swallowed at least ten times at these gatherings, and I'm still here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Kayla exits the bathroom, now fully clothed. Everyone steps away from the exit as Kayla makes her way toward it. As she opens the front door, one very unlucky lass that was about to enter the building is on the other side. Without stopping, Kayla seizes the poor girl and swallows her down with amazing speed, giving her still-flat belly a little rub, she turns around and closes the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take note, that's what can happen if you arrive late.\" Mary informs Julianne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne watches as the crowd becomes more active, more and more people are willing to cross the center of the room now that there's no worries of Kayla grabbing at your ankles. And after several minutes of watching the activities, a woman approaches Julianne and Mary. Like many of the other women in the building, she has shed her clothing, her long, red hair extends all the way down to her buttocks, her breasts rival those of Mary's while the rest of her figure is rather plain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Olivia, what's up?\" Mary says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got quite a lot of digestions today.\" Olivia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what about it? You scared and wanna go home?\" Mary taunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we're actually starting to approach a new record for digestions done in a day, so I've gathered quite a few girls upstairs willing for a round of please or eat, so we can actually reach it.\" Olivia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please or eat? Is that some kind of game?\" Julianne asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like a twisted, sexier spin the bottle, with vore involved, a few girls thought it up during a rather dull night, we never did find a better name for it.\" Mary explains. \"Basically, everyone takes turns spinning the bottle, and whoever it's it ends up pointing at, known as the target, ends up eaten by the spinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... is that it?\" Julianne asks. \"Sounds really basic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was getting to the next part, there's no digestion or hiding meals allowed, except for the next bit. If the target has someone in her stomach, the spinner has the choice of either skipping her turn, or pleasure the target the best she can for five minutes, so yeah, if you don't like girls that way, it's not the game for you. Anyway, as you probably know, it's rather difficult to hold off digestion when someone's got her fingers up your cooch. During those five minutes, the spinner has to try to get the target to digest her meal, accidental or otherwise, if she does so, you get to eat her afterward, also, if the spinner already has someone inside them, and she fails to make the target digest whoever is in her, she has to let her meal out of her, and back into the game. The game lasts until a predetermined number of girls are digested, what's the target tonight, Olivia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far, including myself, we've got ten girls ready, and we're playing until six digestions, then we'll have a new record.\" Olivia explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make that twelve.\" Mary says. \"I've already got a girl in me right now, and since she's in me, she's in the game too. Anyway...\" She turns toward Julianne. \"Are you and Cindy in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne replies.</span></div></div>",

Stacy also sported a belly herself, but it only looked to be six months pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mailnda. I see you are going all out this time.\" Olivia remarked to her friends big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that. Really I'm just trying to be part of  another game that Stacy here came up with, but she needs her friends to play it.\" Malinda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the game?\" Mary asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call it stuffers bounty. Two players eat 3 people each and keep them inside her belly. Then she goes around the club stuffing herself with other people. 30 minutes is the time. After times up, the two come back to compare belly sizes. The large one get to eat and other player. The 3 inside each player helps to eat the other people that arrive inside to allow their captor more room to eat. In Julianne?\" Stacy explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet. But I still needs Jessica and she's inside her.\" Julianne points to Mary. <br>\r\n\"They need some more people to be part of please or eat and Mary wants to use Jessica as her starting person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can fork over some people if that will help. How many you need?\" Mary offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Guess these girls must peak your interest huh Malinda? We only need 4 more. Start coughing up Jessica Mary.\" Olivia said to the girl as everyone started coughing up there meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving up Cindy and Mary giving up Jessica along with the coughed up prey from Malinda. Mary and Olivia left to go play there game. Jessica was brought up to speed about what her friends are planning to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in. So whose stomach I go in?\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which she was promptly swallowed by Julianne. It happened quicker than she went with Cindy, rapidly swallowing her friend in a matter of only a few seconds. Giving her a belly that showed she was 3 months pregnant. She didn't even waste anytime on Stacy either as she quickly grabbed her friend and pulled her in. She wasn't sure if it was because of the atmosphere around her, but she felt that it would be much safer and better for her and her friends if she was the one doing most of the work given how Erin isn't with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just need one more person.\" Julianne said.</span></div></div>",

Though from what I seen happens here, I almost regret not coming here sooner.\" Josephine greeted back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was honestly a bit stumped on what to do until I overheard what you girls were doing. It sounds like fun to be riding in someone else and getting stuffed. So can I play too?\" She asks giving a little shake of her breasts to them. Julianne couldn't resist anymore, she didn't know what this woman's reasoning was, but if she was willing enough to let herself be eaten for their game, she would not say no. She gently grabs hold of Josephine, finding the woman's lack of resistance to show that she is willing, before staring up slightly at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't eat my friends while you're in there ok? I feel there's only one left then I'm digesting.\" She warned her. Josephine seemed unfazed by this and only smiled before she saw the back of Julianne's throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne wanted to take her time with Josephine, as she tasted very good, but find it would have been improper to hold up Malinda. So she took large swallows of her large prey, taking in her large mammaries with relative ease and proceeding down towards her stomach. She used her tongue to try and feel around for anyone inside Josephine but came up short, telling her that there was no one in her, or if there was, they are nothing but soup. She had to use her hands in order to fit Josephine's giant ass into her mouth, this being the first time she ever swallowed someone so curvy, but still enjoyed her taste. It took a few seconds before she was done with her legs and feet and she could finally take a breather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her stomach showed that even with her hiding, she still looked like she was heavily pregnant. Either overdue with 1 or 6-7 months with two. Either way, she knew that even though she could manage the weight of them, she's big enough to the point that she would be a nice meal for any hungry person in the the club. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be lying if I say I'm not jealous of not getting to taste her. But I can always look forward to it after I win and force you to cough her up before I eat you.\" Malinda admitted confidently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah just let me get them some fresh air.\" Julianne said before burping up the old air in her and swallowing some fresh air. She felt her newest addition settle inside along with two more inside her stomach. Meaning that Josephine was keeping her promise and not eating her friends. <br>\r\n\"Ok, ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Its now 11:30.\" Malinda said taking a glance over at the clock.<br>\r\n\"We'll meet back up at exactly 12. A minute late and its automatic forfeit. Also, even though I'm sure you wouldn't do this, you can't leave the club area, go outside the entrance, and get anyone else. I hope you get big and filling for me~\" Malinda teased before disappearing into the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Julianne was by herself, she needed to figure out how to play this. If she starts randomly eating people, then they may have friends who would get her back. Though she can't just take her time and find loners here and waste the 30 minutes. And camping by the entrance may also take a while. She looked around until she saw some groups people going in different places, deciding that they would be her best bet at getting some starters.         </span></div></div>",

We've got ourselves a game for sure, let's go!\" Olivia says as she guides the two girls upstairs. On the second story, Julianne and Mary are guided into a room upstairs, within the room are six girls, three of them with large bellies, already filled with a catch of their own, sitting in a circle as they wait. Among them is Natalie, still filled with her sister, Kerri, in the middle of the room is an empty, green glass bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, girls, we've got enough participants for sure now, but before we start, let's have a quick introduction. I'm Olivia, and to my left here is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Julianne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And inside her is Cindy. To my right is Mary, and inside her is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica.\" Julianne speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Natalie, and in me is my sister, Kerri.\" Says the young woman in the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Gina.\" One of the girls in the circle speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Carol.\" A full-bellied girl says. \"And in me is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy!\" Calls a muffled voice from within Carol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah.\" Calls another girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Helen, and my meal is Iris.\" The final well fed girl says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Alex.\" The last girl says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, before we begin, I would like to remind you all that at least six of you are not leaving this room as anything but shit, understand?\" Olivia says. Everyone nods in agreement, except for those currently trapped in a belly. \"Okay then, let's begin!\" All the girls quickly scoot around, allowing enough room for everyone to sit beside one another, arranged as a circle. \"First spin will decide who the first spinner is.\" Olivia says as she spins the bottle. It spins quite a few times until it finally stops, pointed toward Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you know!\" Olivia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You did that on purpose!\" Helen argues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, can it, let's keep going.\" Sarah says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia spins the bottle once again, this time with not as much force, after only a couple rotations, it stops as it's pointed toward Julianne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, I get to go at the newcomer, spread 'em, Julianne.\" Olivia says as she places the bottle aside and crawls toward the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne nervously obeys, and Olivia quickly crawls forward and plants her face directly at Julianne's nethers and begins licking away, the moment she made first contact with Julianne, one of the girls set an electronic timer for five minutes. The girls watch entertained as Olivia pleasures Julianne the best she can, however, after five minutes, the timer goes off, Olivia backs away, leaving Cindy, within Julianne's stomach remaining whole and alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good attempt.\" Natalie says. \"Anyway, since you were targeted last, you get to spin now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne retrieves the bottle and spins it as hard as she can. The girls have to all wait quite some time before it comes to a stop, and soon it does, facing toward Mary. Julianne, not wanting to try to promote Jessica's digestion, and wishing to keep her own meal, decides to forgo her turn with Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pass.\" Julianne says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I was hoping I might get to join Cindy in there.\" Mary says, a hint of disappointment in her voice. \"Whatever, my turn!\" She says as she spins the bottle. It goes round and round until it stops, and once again it's pointed toward Julianne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what the!\" Gina says. \"Her again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary giggles. \"Well, Cindy, it was nice knowing you.\" She says as she approaches Julianne, spreading her legs and assuming a position not unlike Olivia's. As her tongue laps at her cunt, Julianne lays backward as she finds Mary's technique much better than Olivia's, and reaches heights of pleasure she has never seen before. She doesn't even notice Cindy's struggles as her acids become active, quickly reducing the girl into a fine fluid. It isn't until Mary suddenly stops until Julianne figures that something's up. Sitting back up, she gasps as she finds her belly reducing in size, and Mary's mouth engulfing her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary gives Julianne a quick wink before she skillfully swallows her down, her belly bulging out further has Julianne joins Jessica, the girls all reposition, rebuilding the broken circle. \"Since Julianne isn't here to spin anymore, Mary has to spin to see who gets the next turn.\" Olivia explains. Mary obeys, spinning the bottle again. It stops pointed toward Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time! My turn!\" She says as she quickly spins it lightly, it doesn't even get a full rotation in before it stops pointed toward Gina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, poo.\" Gina says as she presents her feet to Alex, who eagerly takes and swallows them, it takes only a few moments until the somewhat skilled Alex has her belly bulged out with Gina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite tasty.\" Alex comments as she spins the bottle again to determine who gets the next turn. It stops pointed toward Olivia, and without comment, she spins it with enough force to have to rotate around five times before stopping on Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh, good luck Iris.\" Olivia comments as she spreads Helen's legs as she approaches. Despite her best efforts, Olivia can't bring Helen anywhere past simple moans during the five minutes as she eats her out, and after the timer rings and Olivia backs away, Helen comments, chuckling. \"Heh, is that it? I know gay men that could eat pussy better than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and spin it.\" Olivia says, annoyed. Helen spins the bottle, and after one exact rotation, it stops pointed toward herself. \"Respin.\" Olivia says. Helen does so, and it stops pointed toward Carol after a few rotations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yay!\" Carol says excited as she practically throws herself Helen's way, who accepts her with open arms, one of Helen's hands works it's way sensually down to Carol's moist center, and quickly gets to work, probing in and out and dancing all over the place down there. Helen's other hand rubs Carol's belly, while occasionally giving her breast a tease. Once again five minutes pass, and Wendy remains undigested, Helen reluctantly lets Carol go, who scampers back to her spot with a little disappointment. \"It was a nice effort.\" She comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen quickly throws Iris up, and the group scoots about once again to accommodate the \"new\" girl before Carol spins the bottle, which stops on Mary. Carol crawls toward Mary and spreads her legs. \"I hope you're ready for this.\" Carol says before she dives in and begins tasting at Mary's puss, her hands try to reach past the large, Jessica and Julianne filled belly to have at Mary's breasts, but she just can't quite reach, so as her tongue works at Mary's most sensitive spot, her hands settle with rubbing and tickling the massive, bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Jessica and Julianne embrace, fearing for their lives as they hear Mary's moans grow more intense, she's obviously enjoying Carol's attentions too much for comfort, but it seems that she's holding off digesting rather well. Soon the five minute mark approaches and something gives, the two girls shriek as she they themselves beginning to burn, acids flooding the chamber, as if Mary is digesting the two completely on purpose. The two barely have a moment to react before they are both dissolved and fed into Mary's intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job Carol.\" Mary says in a very pleased tone. \"Enjoy your meal.\" She says as she almost shoves her arms straight into Carol's mouth. Carol greedily swallows Mary down, who nestles comfortably beside Wendy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're rather enthusiastic about being eaten.\" Wendy says loudly enough from within Carol for all to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary's always been a bit of a wierdo, anyway, let's continue.\u201d Olivia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, everyone scoots forward reform the circle, and Carol gives the bottle a spin, which stops on Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time!\" Natalie says as the spins the bottle again, it makes one full rotation before stopping on Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you're quite good.\" Alex says as she spreads her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was taught very, very well.\" Natalie says lewdly as she begins fingering Alex, who moans loudly in pleasure despite Natalie touching no other part of her. It isn't even until half of the five minutes until Alex's belly gurgles loudly and begins to shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" Alex manages to work out between gasps before Natalie seizes her head and swallows it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie swallows down Alex slowly, taking quite some time to enjoy the taste of her breasts and hips until she's swallowed completely, joining Kerri inside of Natalie's lightly gurgling gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that makes four digested girls so far, two to go.\" Olivia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't done anything yet, I haven't even been so much as tasted.\" Sarah says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful what you wish for Sarah.\" Olivia warns.</span></div></div>",

LET'S GO!\" She says as she spins the bottle very hard, the girls all watch anxiously as the bottle rotates again and again, until it finally stops pointed toward Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit!\" Helen says as Carol makes her move, engulfing the girl's feet and quickly swallowing her down, as Helen enters Carol's stomach, it begins to bulge out extremely wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You realize that with how wide you're getting now, you're quite a big target for the bottle now.\" Olivia points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh! Said like a true empty belly.\" Carol taunts as she spins the bottle again, this time it points toward Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn, finally!\" Sarah says as she spins it, and as if predicted by Olivia, it stops on Carol, whose huge belly does make for a large target. \"Oh jeez Carol! You're going to make me spend all day on the toilet when I'm through with you!\" Sarah taunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get too ahead of yourself.\" Carol says. \"You still gotta get me to digest first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh! No problem!\" Sarah says as she is upon Carol. Carol's strategy is turned against her as Sarah savagely works her cunt with her tongue, while her hands rub and massage her belly. Sarah constantly changes up her patterns, working her tongue in different ways, even probing her finger into her anus briefly. It isn't long until loud gurgles fill the room, the wiggling from within Carol's belly ceases, and the various bulges made from the girls inside smooth out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Okay! You win!\" Carol says as her belly begins to shrink, her digestive tract getting to work on absorbing it's digested victims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's seven digested girls! Congratulations, Sarah.\" Olivia speaks out. \"We may have broken the old record, but today's not over, we may have even more digestions down with the rest of the group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol briefly considers running, but doesn't reach a decision in time before Sarah engulfs her head, Carol puts up a little bit of a fight, but Sarah is clearly the more skilled predator, and quickly manages to work the still-plump girl down into her throat, sending her on the way to the stomach. Sarah's stomach quickly shrinks as Carol is deposited within, and loud gurgles from within clearly display what's happening to the girl inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, make that eight digested girls in one game of please and eat.\" Olivia comments. \"Let's head back downstairs now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, that's quite a meal you've got there.\" Natalie says as she approaches Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again, what about you? Are you going to have at those morsels?\" Sarah asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, my sister's in there actually, and I found a nice girlfriend for her, judging by how those two are acting in there.\" Natalie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, you took your sister to a game of please and eat? That's just evil.\" Sarah says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, she was the one who talked me into it.\" Natalie points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I thought Mary was screwed in the head.\" Sarah says. \"Anyway, let's head back.\"</span></div></div>",

You've done this before? It was my first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, my third time, seriously. First time I played, I was eaten on the first spin, and I literally spent all game inside the girl afterward.\" Natalie says. \"She ended up getting pleasured with me inside her three times, I seriously thought I was a goner the second and third times. But as you can see, she thankfully let me out after the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, who was it? Must have had a lot of self control, or had some bad partners.\" Sarah asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter who she was anymore, my sister Marie made a meal out of her right after she got me out. Another close call, if my sister would have gotten to her a moment earlier I would've joined her in digestion.\" Natalie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she would have had a sister snack and probably would have never found out.\" Sarah says, in a slightly joking matter. \"And you're still attending these after all those close calls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yup!\" Natalie says, chuckling. \"A few close shaves aren't going to stop me from having fun. Besides, Marie would never let me live it down If I chickened out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, the two girls have made their way back to the main room, Natalie briefly looks around for the rest of her family, no sign of her mother or older sister, probably in another room, somebody's stomach, or got turned into shit while she was upstairs. She shrugs, figuring that she'll find out where they are eventually. She does note that a lot more people have shown up now, business as usual, people tend to call their friends over when they've made sure Kayla's gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems the crowd's here now.\" Natalie comments. \"Want to find an empty seat while there's still a few?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I guess I could hang with you a bit while I digest.\" Sarah says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two quickly find a nearby empty sofa, Sarah quickly sits down on the end, sitting at an angle as she rests on the corner. While Natalie lays down on the other end, leaving no space for anyone to take. The two girls go through some idle chatter for a while, discussing nothing too interesting as Sarah's belly slowly shrinks away. After quite some time, Sarah's intestines finish absorbing everything it could take from the liquefied girls, leaving them as nothing but waste to be dumped, Sarah gets up off the sofa, taking a moment to stretch afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, time to say goodbye to the girls.\" Sarah comments. \"Who were they again? Uh... Jennifer, Jenny, Sheena? Wait, no, that one started with a G...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares?\" Natalie interrupts. \"They're all just shit now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but I like to try to remember who I digest.\" Sarah says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing you haven't had that many meals in that case.\" Natalie says. \"Just dump it and forget about it, toilet's that way.\" Natalie adds, pointing toward the bathroom. Without saying anything more, Sarah makes her way there, thankfully there's a lock in the door, for even with the toilet designed for extra large loads, she's going to be spending quite some time on it. After making sure nobody is going to interrupt her, Sarah sits down on the porcelain throne and pushes to relieve the pressure from the girls packed in her colon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the remains slide out without much strain, and after a few minutes of pushing, Sarah flushes what's currently in there away to make room for more. Many minutes pass as Sarah relieves herself, and after much effort and many flushes, she's finally emptied herself of her digested meals. As Sarah cleans herself, an impatient girl begins knocking on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, I'm almost done!\" Sarah says as she finishes wiping, and flushes one last time to dispose of the toilet paper used. \"Okay! Done!\" Sarah says as she unlocks the door, immediately the door opens to reveal a redhead Sarah doesn't recognize, who quickly steps around her, pushes her out of the bathroom, then closes and relocks the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh! Some people.\" Sarah complains as she makes her way back to the sofa that Natalie was on.</span></div></div>",

She momentarily forgot about her new friend and bounced up from the sofa, and walked carefully over to her mother. As she walked her belly gurgled and growled, reminding Natalie that she was particularly hungry, she had to get her sister out and fast.<br>\r\n\"Hey mom!\" Natalie cried out, as she caught her mother's attention. When she had reached her, Natalie sat down on the couch that her mother was on.<br>\r\nMalinda responded, \" Hi, hun, what have you been up to? I see you still have Kerri there.\" <br>\r\n\"I just got done with a game of Please and Eat, one girl managed to eat just about everybody.\"<br>\r\n\"And I didn't get to eat anyone!\" came a third voice to Natalie's left. The two women turned to see Olivia coming up to them.<br>\r\nNatalie recognized the redhead, and cheerfully remarked, \" Well you weren't any good at the 'pleasing' part of please and eat.\" At this statement Natalie smiled at the bump she got from Alex's acknowledgment of Natalie's competency. Natalie then stood from the couch and gave a gesturing poke at her belly. \"See? When you're good you can get rewards like this one!\"<br>\r\nAll this did was set off the girl, and Olivia responded, \"Well I am pretty good at the other part of the game.\" With that, the naked redhead grasped at the young girls arms, Malinda noticed what was about to occur and chuckled. <br>\r\nIn swift fashion, Olivia shoved Natalie's head and shoulders into her maw, before Natalie could vocally protest. In a good position now, Olivia pushed the young girl in farther to pin Natalie's arms down, she only briefly savored the young girl's breasts before she stretched her jaw in order to cover her extended Kerri and Alex-filled belly. This was effortless for Olivia, she had downed full meals countless times, and Natalie would be no exception. Kerri and Alex continued to pleasure themselves within as they had been, the momentary shift in gravity barely had an effect on them. Soon enough a disappointed Natalie plopped into Olivia's taut belly which barely showed a bulge, hinting at her true experience.<br>\r\nMalinda had watched Olivia with lustful intent at Natalie's ingestion. \"I got room in my belly, and there's two others in there if you want to mess with them.\" She smiled coyly.<br>\r\nOlivia stepped forward and let her true intent known. Malinda spoke  again as Olivia's eye's came closer, \" Or I could join my daughter in there, If that's what you want.\" Malinda then raised her hands up offering herself to the experienced predator. Olivia graciously accepted her gift and spread her mouth over the mother's outstretched arms and down to her upwardly faced face, the hands making a slight moving bulge in Olivia's fine-skinned throat that got larger as Olivia continued downwards over Malinda's shoulders. Once here, Olivia then swallowed and let her throat muscles do the rest of the work, and in a matter of seconds, onlookers could watch Olivia's throat, as first Malinda's head disappeared into Olivia's bear chest, followed by her own breasts making well defined and shrinking bulges, her own Stacey and Marie filled belly, still wriggling, her proportioned waist and hips which then tapered off until Olivia's mouth closed and her belly got a little bit bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the inside Natalie spoke to her newly arrived mother, \" Serves you right for letting her eat me.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh hush, it was a fun ride and you know it,\" Malinda responded, as Olivia's stomach settled and Olivia sat in Malinda's seat and reclined, outstretched. Once settled Olivia let her taut belly expand outward to let all onlookers see her plethora of meals. Her belly now resting to cover the rest of the couch filled with her six meals, at least one of which who had already digested a girl tonight, which added to the total mass. <br>\r\nNatalie upon getting better room, responded, \"Yeah it was fun, being surprised like that, It hasn't been a while since I've been eaten, and we've already beaten the digestion record for the night, so it's not like she wou-\" Natalie was cut off by a rumble as Olivia pushed hard on her stomach, and kneaded it. In a violent rush of struggle Natalie and her mother pushed against the churning stomach, but in less than a second the powerful predator had reduced the mother and daughter into a dead mush of dissolved muscle and bone. Onlookers were somewhat happy with this secondary show, by none other than another redhead, like Kayla, but not as tall. Olivia's now round belly began to shrink as the liquid remains entered her intestines, and her stomach's confines finished dissolving it's contents. When her belly had shrunk enough Olivia got up from the couch, with her hands holding up the mass over her gurgling belly, it's liquid sounds slopping and emanating with each step she made. She was weaving through the impressed crowd to the bathroom as her belly rapidly shrank, as she felt the first parts of her meal packing into her bladder and then colon, probably Alex's digested meal. She was right outside when a girl's backside had bumped into her still gurgling belly, she remarked at the infraction but decided to push her way into the bathroom when in front of the girl was another predator, mouth open wide.<br>\r\nWhen she got in, she saw all the stalls seemingly filled, but being the impatient girl that she was, she pushed hard on the doors until she found one unlocked. The smell of girl's business hit her, but didn't phase her as Olivia entered. The dark haired girl protested, \" Hey, it's occupied, you slut!\"</span></div></div>",

It wasn't long before she had begun to let the girls out, she didn't particularily enjoy this part, but she was hungry so it had to come to this. The echo of flushes from the other stalls were testament to the extremely high volume of digestions tonight, in fact, to Olivia's note, a far higher volume than she had counted, the girls were really letting themselves go tonight. After her second flush, she was about done, so it wasn't long before she wiped and opened the stall to find the dark haired girl still waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia spoke up, \"Hey, the stalls were full, and your's was unlocked, you were lucky I didn't eat you, right then and there.\" Olivia had a devious smile on her face.<br>\r\nThe dark haired girl didn't respond as she charged at Olivia her full intent quite obvious to the young but experienced girl, Olivia stepped back and pushed the girl backwards.<br>\r\nThe dark haired girl once again defeated, caught her balance, and decided with a look of disappointment, to just get back in the stall to finish her unfinished defecation of her last sex partner. Olivia right before she left simply said, \" By the way my name is Olivia.\" With that Olivia pushed the door out, and returned to the party, intent on sparking up some more fun.</span></div></div>",

Surely she's gone home since Sarah was busy in the bathroom, after all, she was in there for quite some time. Or perhaps she's simply gone to some other room. Or maybe she's being pushed out of the behind of that redhead that pushed her out of the bathroom. Sarah accepts the possibility of all of these, and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that it's probably best to not go around looking for her, Sarah decides to simply sit and wait for a while, either for the possibility of Natalie returning, or when Sarah finds something else to do, whichever comes first. Looking over the women, she watches the strangely erotic sight of many ladies being devoured before her very eyes, including one that was swallowed slowly head first while another woman was pleasuring her orally, who doesn't even stop as the swallower makes her way to her meal's hips, and begins devouring her too. For a moment, Sarah imagines herself in that situation, squeezing through someone's throat while someone plays with her moist center during her trip into a gurgling stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door to the bathroom that Sarah was just in opens, the redheaded girl walking out. As she walks away, Sarah briefly stares at her butt, which may or may not have just squeezed out Natalie. The uncertainty plagues Sarah's mind, even though she just met her, she would like to know what happened to her, so she briefly considers asking that redheaded girl, who might not have even seen Natalie, let alone make a meal of her.</span></div></div>",

Sarah reacts fast as she steps backwards in order to move away from the fast moving woman. Instead she bumps into another woman who was on her way to the bathroom. \"Hey, bitch! watch where you're walking!\" Sarah turned quickly to react on the woman, only to find her rush into the bathroom, and all she sees of her is long light red hair that streamed down her backside, reminding Sarah of the girl who was now apparently behind her. <br>\r\nSarah then felt the woman's hand grasp on her right arm, but reacting quickly, Sarah moved her left arm out of the woman's short reach and pivoted around to where she faced an opening and wide mouth. With her left arm Sarah grabbed the woman's arm that was not grasping her tightly and shoved it into her own mouth, quickly, and much to the attacking girl's surprise up to her shoulder. The girl tried to do the same to Sarah's arm but was already far too close to Sarah's mouth, as Sarah quickly widened her mouth and engulfed her attacker's head coating her bleach blonde head in saliva before continuing on. In struggle at this point, the woman let go of Sarah's arm and pushed at her, managing only push directly onto Sarah's breast, which only startled the woman more, but Sarah utilized this by pushing the woman's hand harder onto her supple chest. At this point she had the control of the situation completely, and took a moment to sit back down on the corner of the couch with the woman's hand still being forced to grope her erect nipple, and her elevated legs flailing behind.<br>\r\nAfter sitting, Sarah remembered her reason for getting up in the first place and decided to speed up the pace, and regrettably swallowed the girl's other shoulder and arm, wanted to enjoy the girl's chest but found it terribly clothed, and in disappointment swallowed her down to her waist and finding the skirt, just decided to swallow the rest of her. Sarah let her belly full out per usual, and scanned the area to find that redhead again.</span></div></div>",

Most of the denizens stared awestruck at the speed at which this woman reacted, and started to back away from the door, all except for one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl Sarah recognized from the please and eat game, denoted by her long red hair, Olivia, was busy staring at the tall amazonesque woman's belly writh and bulge with the girls struggling within. The woman noticed the young girl's trance-like state, and ran straight towards her. Olivia barely had time to react as her eye went wide, and the woman's mouth went wider. Soon Olivia joined the other two in the woman's large and bulging belly. After this, the woman meandered over to an empty couch on the far side of the room and actually began to remove her clothes, before caressing her belly and it's struggling occupants. Figuring the disturbance was over, the attendees went back to their chatting and frolicking in each other's own desire, as a few more girls followed the tall girl inside and made their way to the same couch the tall woman was sitting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at Vera, all Sarah could respond with was, \"Well that was interesting!\" It was this moment she realized that her digestive tract had finished with whatever-her-name-was and she was quickly packed into her colon, the sight of vore had stimulated her digestive system it seemed. Natalie had at least given her good advice before leaving for the sewers, she should just not worry about her meal's names. \"Vera, sorry but your friend has for whatever reason, decided that she wants out of my bowels.\" Vera nodded and turned away as if distracted by something else suddenly. Sarah thought about gulping her down, but as she did her eyes drifted downwards to her ass once again, those same cheeks that squeezed out a Natalie turd not fifteen minutes ago, and decided that she would have other uses for this girl, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah made her way to the bathroom for the second time of the night, she realized that she was really beginning to like this place, before she had come here she had hardly thought about how easy it was to simply digest and forget. Before she had been sympathetic to those who fell victim to her hungry whims. Now her mind seemed to treat them as simple food. Her mind continued to wander as she entered the bathroom, found a place to sit, and in less than a few seconds her bladder began to void itself of her meal's moisture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then imagined how Natalie must have looked coming out of Vera's ass, her form reduced to simply brown waste, her once luscious young form becoming nutrients to fuel Vera's. As she imagined this, she barely payed any attention to the former girl falling out of her anus, turd by turd. She snapped out of it as she felt the pressure in her lower belly subside. She wiped, and stood up, she began to turn to flush, but felt the pressure again, and sat back down right before she almost missed the toilet, it hit her so fast. Apparently the girl had, been containing an extra meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sarah's face grimaced as she pushed out one long huge mass, she couldn't ignore this one. Once it landed in the bowl with a smack on top of the rest of the contents, she wiped, and then felt her belly for anything else. Satisfied she stood up, flushed, washed her hands, and left the bathroom. She wasn't exactly sure at first what she was going to do now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind wondered as she stared from one girl to the next, imagining how each one would taste, and how they would feel going down, before Vera reappeared into her mind's eye, as well as the tall blonde girl.</span></div></div>",

Her brain exemplified the similarities between Natalie and who she would presume to be her mother or aunt, but it was obvious they were related.<br>\r\nSarah cautiously moved across the room where the woman sat on the couch with another older woman, each sporting a rather large belly. She noticed and then took note of the tall girl still sitting in the same couch, her belly still wriggling with the contents of Olivia, before she turned to greet the two women.<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Sarah said smiling once she got Malinda's attention. \"I couldn't help but notice, but you look just like a friend of mine, her name was Natalie, you wouldn't happen to be related to her?\" She innocently inquired.<br>\r\nMalinda smiled at the girl and turned to speak to her companion, \"Well Candice, am I related to anyone named Natalie?\"<br>\r\nThe other woman, who happened to still be wearing a sweater, her belly round and large, but her pants seemingly missing, responded, \"Well, Malinda, I'm pretty sure that she is one of your three daughters.\" she answered as she lifted her legs and lounged on the arm of the sofa, letting her belly hang from the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah frowned as she realized that she would have to tell this predatory mother, about two of her daughter's unfortunate digestion, she felt that she would have to be strategic if she didn't want to end up joining whoever else was in her belly. \"Well, ma'am, \" she tried her best to be polite, it wasn't one of her strong suits, \"I saw you and presumed you were related, I thought you might be an older sister or something, but to get to the point, I was playing a game of Please and Eat,\" she paused as she saw Malinda become attentive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We both managed to make it out, I managed to get most of the prizes, she managed to get one girl, and added her to her sister. She didn't digest. When I came back from the bathroom I found out, that she had been eaten and digested along with her sister, and flushed down the same toilet I had just left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalinda was about to respond when she suddenly began to feel a kicking from inside her belly, she then proceeded to speak to it, much to Sarah's confusion, \"Marie, don't make me digest you! You better behave!\" It seemed she had eaten her own daughter, Sarah was baffled at this strange family dynamic, she had a brother of her own, but she wouldn't imagine eating him, it would be too risky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard a voice come from inside the belly, \"Mom! That girl that you sent down, I ate her and she wants out, and I can't let her out in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, fine, I was getting hungry anyways.\" Malinda responds before she briefly stood, bent over, and pushed down on her belly, Sarah watched as her chest bulged slightly, and the very well endowed mother's bare breasts jiggled, she couldn't help but be turned on by this sight. Her throat soon bulged after, and shortly arms pushed out of her mouth, followed by a wet-haired head, and soon enough, Marie was lying on the floor. She only layed there for a few seconds before she got up. Sarah was expecting the girl to be sporting a bulge, based on what she said. When she did not, she put two and two together. Marie simply said, \"Thanks.\" before running off to the bathroom to let the last of the TA's out of her anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah watched Marie walk away, noticing that Marie resembled Natalie only a slight bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalinda cleared her throat, in a way to bring Sarah's wayward attention back to her.</span></div></div>",

Did you have something else to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah is about to speak up, but then stops herself. \" Nah, it doesn't matter, can I meet your family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, oh look here comes one now.\" Natalie responds as she turns around to see Kerri with a large protruding Alex filled belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerri is running straight towards Sarah now, Sarah even braces for impact, unhinging her vorish jaw, right before Natalie speaks up, \"Hey Kerri, meet Sarah, she was the digestion winner of the Please and Eat game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerri responds, \" Is that so? Mom will want to see this girl.\" With that, the three girls make their way to the couch where Malinda was sitting.</span></div></div>",

I'm just saying you should probably be more careful with what you ask for. Anyway, Natalie, would you spin so we can continue?\u201d Olivia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie gets up with some difficulty, her huge wiggling belly is in the way, so she pauses for a moment and it quickly shrinks away until she just looks slightly bloated. Then bending down she gives the bottle a good swirl before taking her seat again and letting her belly spread on out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround and round the bottle goes until it slowly grinds to a halt, painstakingly shifting from one girl to the next, making Sarah squeal, thinking it'll stop pointing to her, but the shout dies in her throat as it edges onto Helen who also gets her hopes up, before those too are dashed as it continues onto Iris, who in turn just looks dumbfounded and looks around getting affirmative nods after a few seconds. It finally stopped, pointing at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave the bottle a quick spin, she wasn't really here to eat, she had been in Helen's stomach for a reason, watching other people eat was more her thing, even if that meant watching herself get eaten. Still she couldn't help but get a little excited when the bottle stopped pointing at Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww man!\u201d Sarah complained, but still offered Iris her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you did ask to be tasted.\u201d Olivia pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah usually did the eating, so the aspect of her getting eaten intrigued Iris, even if she'd have to do the eating herself. Luckily she didn't struggle, for Iris wasn't sure she could have gotten the girl down if she had, as it were she slowly crammed the girl in part by part. Sarah clearly couldn't wait for the undignified act to end, but Iris wasn't good enough to get it over very quickly. Eventually she did slide down and come to a halt inside the girl's bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem grumpy, Sarah, if anything Iris, gave you a proper tasting.\u201d Olivia teased. Iris, felt Sarah twitch, struggling mostly not to answer and encourage further teasing, which Iris realised was unfortunate, because she liked meals getting teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling with her gut, Iris managed to get the bottle rotating a couple of times before stopping, pointing towards Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, my turn!\u201d She said and flicked the bottle spinning it nearly four turns, before it stopped facing Iris again. \u201cOh, what do you know...\u201d She grinned as she crawled over to the girl, poking her belly before addressing the occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you're already inside a gut, Sarah, but would you like to explore mine? I'm quite sure you'll make a delightful little turd.\u201d Olivia teased, she'd already failed twice today to get girls to digest their occupants, but she knew Iris was a pervert that liked this kind of teasing, she she figured she'd give it a try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had worked, as she dove for the girl's lower lips she found them already soaking wet and nearly quivering, so despite her lack of skills, after just a couple of minutes she could hear gurgles coming from the dome over her head and Sarah cursing, but she soon quieted down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that point there was little doubt that Iris was quite busy digesting, so Olivia wanting to feel Sarah churning inside her reached out and while opening wide crammed Iris' bottom, hips and lower back into her mouth before with a mighty heave managed somehow, to sit upright with her face towards the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shift left Iris' bottom clearly visible though Olivia's upper torso as she curled up on her bloated stomach which gurgling sprawled across the girl's face to continue over it and droop behind her head. Her legs were pushed to either side sticking first up and then bent at the knee leaving her feet slightly behind either of Olivia's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGravity seemed to be edging Iris down her throat, but not content with that, Olivia managed to stretch her mouth and throat open as she swallowed, so that Iris toppled inside and she closed her lips around the girl's calves, before swallowing again and depositing the girl completely inside her now much more pleasantly filled belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling Iris' belly churning away at Sarah was nice, not quite as nice as doing the churning herself though, but it'd have to do for now. Putting a hand to her bloated gut she did have a wanting feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Iris was inside her, she'd have to spin to see who of the four remaining girls got a turn. So giving the bottle a swirl, Olivia took her seat and watched as the bottle turned and turned again before coming to a halt, pointing at...her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh, me again!\u201d She giggled and came to her feet almost unhindered by her Iris-sized gut and gave the bottle another spin. This time she remained standing and watched as the bottle turned again and again, stopping this time to point at Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, you look tasty Helen.\u201d Olivia teased as she stepped over to the girl, before opening wide and leaning over her, dropping down on her bloated belly and cramming most of Helen's upper body into her throat in the process. She worked her legs back under herself before standing back up. Then grabbing Helen's thighs Olivia raised the girl's legs over her head and let her slide on down to curl up next to Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Helen too in her stomach Olivia had to once again spin the bottle to determine who's turn it was. But bending forward her belly wasn't just in the way, it almost caused her to topple over, so steadying herself and standing back up she put her hands to her double girl-sized lumpy gut and beneath her palms it quickly shrank away until there was just a small bulge riding high on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlender once more she bent over quite gracefully and set the bottle in motion, before she took her seat again and like Natalie before her let her belly surge on out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf the original fourteen girls only three bloated ones remained actually playing, each with two squirming girls in each of their stomachs and at least one non-squirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia had managed to give the bottle quite the spin, but after a dozen or so laps it stopped facing Natalie, who leaned on forward, her belly shrinking away as she did and flicked the bottle again sending it on an almost as wild a spin once more, it eventually came to a halt, pointing at Carol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie had a hard time getting between Carol's legs as it were, so she left her own belly small, in fact as she wiggled in under Carol's belly she shrunk her own even more, to the point that it was almost flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Natalie wasn't given that much to work with, but as Alex had experienced earlier, Natalie really was quite good at this and enjoying the ministrations she was getting, Carol couldn't help but lean back and enjoy the experience, much to Mary's and Wendy's displeasure as they found their previously so spongy and nice accommodations suddenly becoming all sorts of unfriendly. Mary managed to force herself more than halfway into Wendy before the stomach walls closed in on them and locked them in place, from that position she got to experience just as Carol spasmed though a climax, how Wendy melted away from around her, just before she herself met the same fate and they both got squirted rather than drained into Carol's intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoying the show Olivia still couldn't help butting in as the dome of Carol's belly receded. \u201cThat makes seven digested and means that the game is over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping long enough to protest \u201cGame over?\u201d in a clearly miffed manner, Natalie pushed Carol away, so that the girl, slid across the floor on her bum, but grabbed the girl's ankles as they slid past her and then jerked those towards her mouth, shoving the feet down her throat in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Carol all lined out by the sudden motion and her belly nowhere near as big as it was moments ago Natalie sucked mightily and slurped the girl up like a noodle, quickly dumping the girl into her stomach to get wedged in between her sister and Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe extra meal added to Natalie's bulging middle, but she quickly got it under control as she got herself off the floor and it shrank back to almost flat as she hid the girls in there, she figured she and Olivia would go back down now that the game was over. A quick glance told her that Olivia had likewise hidden her girls as the tight redhead was as slim as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the girls only Carol knew what she really wanted to do as she'd soon have five girls wanting to get out her backside, she sincerely hoped Natalie would cough her up soon.</span></div></div>",

She is making out with a girl she just met inside that girls mother. She has never been more turned on. As the two continue kissing Marie opens her mouth and engulfs Stacey's head and begins licking her face. She figures she is about to make a trip into this girls stomach but then the girl releases her and keeps kissing her like before. So she returns the favor and engulfs Marie's head like she had done the her. This continues for several minutes as Marie's hand finds it's way to Stacey's outer lips and begins to finger her. She engulfs Stacey's head one more time but doesn't stop this time. She expands her mouth to take in the girls shoulders and swallows pulling her further in while continuing to finger her. Stacey is fully aware of what is happening but doesn't seem to care. She want to be in this girls stomach. Marie keeps pulling Stacey in, now to her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, They're really going at it in there.\u201d  Malinda say laying back rubbing her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Marie had to remove her hand from between Stacey's legs as her hips were entering Marie's mouth. She quickly slurped up Stacey's legs and gave a small burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for sending that girl down mom. She was fun.\u201d Marie says to her mother who just smiles and gently pats he gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the couch next to them Jessica  was busy swallowing Julianne feet first and had gotten to just beneath her breasts. A moment later  Julianne's hands were sliding down Jessica's throat. With a final gulp she went into her friends stomach. Erin reached over as Jessica lays back and began rubbing her middle feeling Julianne getting comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere hon, why don't you let your sister out so she can have some fun too.\u201d  Malinda says rubbing her daughters bulging belly. She reaches into a bag and grabs a small bottle and hands it to Natalie .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on mom. Can't I keep her for a little longer?\u201d She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes you do. Now take a sip.\u201d She hands  Natalie the bottle and she takes a sip. A short moment later up comes Kerri head first. She slides out of her sisters mouth onto the floor in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Sweet, my turn.\u201d Kerri says. Licking her lips she looks around.</span></div></div>",

Startled, she turns toward whoever got her attention, and is rewarded with a close up view to a very large pair of breasts. Surprised, Stacey steps back to get a full view of Malinda, who had stripped herself of all clothing sometime between letting Marie up and now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, Stacey.\" Malinda says. \"Just cut loose and enjoy your stay here, believe it or not, Marie lets most of her meals go free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because most of her meals are people she knows, it's the first timers that she keeps.\" Jessica points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Marie knows you now, so I assure that you'll be perfectly safe during all future ventures into that snug belly of hers.\" Malinda informs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I guess.\" Stacey says, although she doesn't quite take her word for it. \"So... why are you naked?\" Erin asks, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothes won't be practical where I'm planning to go.\" Malinda says sensually as she briefly pats Stacey's flat belly. Stacey blushes, having not expected the attractive woman to be so forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is going to be great.\" Erin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalinda brings her arms forward, and Stacey opens her mouth as Malinda's hands touch her lips. Stacey moans as Malinda presses her arms into her throat, enjoying her taste. After they're secured within, Stacey swallows, engulfing Malinda's head and shoulders. As she travels slowly down the esophagus, Malinda enjoys the vibrations around her as Stacey moans, taking her time swallowing so that she may enjoy her flavor. A moan escapes from Malinda herself as her breasts are squeezed into Stacey's mouth, and are immediately kneaded by her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show goes on for about a minute as Jessica and Erin watch Malinda's form within Stacey's throat squirm in pleasure, but soon Stacey grows tired of tasting Malinda's luscious breasts, and continues swallowing slowly, As Malinda's hips are squeezed into Stacey's mouth, she considers going for a round of pleasure, but quickly decides that she's delayed long enough, and continues swallowing. As always, the legs are easy to swallow, and slide in with little resistance. Soon Malinda's feet disappear behind Stacey's lips, and in one more swallow, the rest of Malinda is sent down into the stomach, in which Malinda quickly curls up into position the moment her feet emerge from the sphincter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my.\" Stacey says as she looks over her bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my indeed.\" Erin says. \"Malinda usually isn't so insistent on getting swallowed. You must have been real good going down if she was willing to return the favor like that.\" With that, Erin's belly gives out a gurgle, she's not quite hungry actually, having enough energy from recent meals to keep her going for quite a while, it's just that her belly demands fore something to be put in it. She considers trying to get the two large-bellied girls around her into her, plus Natalie is still nearby, but even with her skills it may be a challenge. And to her, it just isn't fun asking them beforehand.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erin is a bit hesitant at first, being indecisive about how she should start on Jessica and Stacey, she's sure that one would retaliate should she devour the other, and they're too far apart to attempt to push them together and take them at the same time. There's also the issue of Natalie's presence, but Erin doesn't mind it as she's much more likely to just stand back and enjoy the show, so Erin figures that she'll decide if she'll have her too after she's done with Stacey and Jessica. As for the two TAs, she comes to the decision that she should be able to get them down without a problem, as long as she acts quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoying the feeling of Malinda shifting within her stomach, Stacey sits down on a nearby chair to make herself more comfortable, as she idly rubs her belly, she doesn't even notice Erin's movements, her massive belly making effective cover for the small girl to get in position in front of Stacey. Jessica notices Erin crouching in front of Stacey, and wonders just what she's up to, but quickly learns of her plan as she watches Erin grab Stacey's legs and pull them into her mouth. Should Jessica have blinked she would have missed much of the display, as before Stacey could figure out what's happening, Erin had lifted her off the chair and quickly swallowed her down, bulging belly and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazed and shocked, Jessica looks at Erin, whose belly remains completely flat despite it containing more than twice the amount of mass than Erin has herself. Without further warning, Erin leaps, diving toward Jessica. Knowing that she won't have enough time to dodge, Jessica attempts to counter her dive by opening her mouth as wide as she can in an attempt to catch the small girl. Unfortunately for Jessica, Erin had her own mouth stretched open even wider, and with amazing speed, Jessica is squeezed into Erin's throat faster than she falls, and by the time that Erin hits the ground Jessica has joined Stacey within her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erin picks herself up off the floor, a tiny bulge is visible on Erin's belly, which shifts a little as the two girls within struggle out of a mixture of confusion and brief panic, which soon ends as the two realize the situation, figuring that Erin will most likely not digest them, and escaping without her consent is nearly impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Natalie comments, amazed. \"I've seen Kayla down girls real fast but I've never seen someone with that kind of speed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't believe some of the girls I used to work with.\" Erin says, chuckling. After finishing her sentence, she gives out a little grunt, and the tiny bulge on her midsection quickly flattens, a look of horror comes over Natalie as she notices it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really just...?\" She pauses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just hid them a little more.\" Erin says. \"I find going about with a bulge silly, it just shows everyone that you're worth two or more meals for the effort of one, although, in theory, one could swallow enough to have a large enough belly to block most from being able to manage them, but there's always some vores around that have specially trained themselves for swallowing massive objects, there's even been rumors going around that one girl swallowed a whole bus full of people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has to be bullshit, a whole bus?\" Natalie bluntly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's just a rumor, but I personally believe it's possible, but if that happened in public I have no idea how they kept everyone who witnessed that from spreading the word.\" Erin explains. \"That's enough anyway, hold still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Natalie replies before Erin takes her head and pulls it into her waiting mouth, and after one quick swallow Natalie is nothing more than a tiny bulge wiggling down Erin's throat, which disappears as it moves downward into the stomach. After Natalie settles alongside Stacey and Jessica, Erin gives her midsection a little pat, enjoying the feeling of the three girls within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun.\" Erin thinks to herself, looking over the club, not that many people seem to have arrived yet. Counting, she spots at least seven people in the living room, not counting anyone who's busy filling a belly, or Kayla, who even with Erin's skills, is too much of a risk to approach, although it seems that she may leave early judging by the size of her belly, Kayla always seems to limit herself when it comes to how many meals she'll have, perhaps for the good of the club as if she were to really eat her fill, then there wouldn't be anybody to spread the word. \"Perhaps it's time to relocate.\" Erin thinks, licking her lips as she approaches a small group of strangers. She's had plenty of practice holding large groups of people.</span></div></div>",

With at least seven new arrivals, Erin begins to have second thoughts about her plan, although she's sure that she could handle everyone, including the newcomers, but she doubts that even with her honed hiding techniques, they would be comfortable with all of them in her belly, and after letting them all out, one of them could make sure that she won't be able to pull something like that ever again. Then again, she could just let her stomach have it's way with them, but removing a large portion of club attendees just like that will be more trouble than it's worth. Ultimately, Erin decides that the three (or five) girls within her belly is enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Shouts a girl entering the doorway, toward her friends still outside. \"Get in before people start looking in!\" Erin silently agrees. At least half the girls here are naked, including herself, that alone would raise unwanted attention should anybody take a peek through the open door, but there's also the issue of anybody spotting any of the girls sporting large, bulging, squirming bellies, especially Kayla's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking... er, thinking of which, where did she go?\" Erin thinks, finding Kayla absent from her usual spot in the center of the room. It's a bit unsettling, Kayla's not in her usual spot, and Erin doubts she would miss the unusually loud noises Kayla makes when digesting, so she can't be at the bathroom right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin takes a quick look around, just to make sure she hasn't simply moved elsewhere in the room, but doesn't see her anywhere.

Before she could investigate the matter further, her attention is brought to the seven girls that have just made their entry, namely one tall teenager that is currently approaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You're Erin, right?\" The black-haired stranger says, stopping to disrobe herself, as is somewhat normal for some attendees, as clothing tends to just dampen the experience of vore, for both parties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... who're you?\" Erin replies, a bit distracted as the girl takes her shirt and bra off, exposing a pair of very shapely breasts, in direct contrast toward Erin's thin, short frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Roxanne, but you can just call me Roxy. You know Mary, right? She's told me about this club, and you.\" She explains as she slips off her pants and panties together, exposing the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Erin says. Mary is a regular attendant to these gatherings who Erin occasionally hangs around with, she wonders just that Mary has been saying about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She told me that whenever you ate her, she'd basically end up in a room-sized stomach! Is that true?\" Roxy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, actually, it's a much more advanced hiding technique, it not only reduces the bulge your belly makes when filled, it also gives your meals more room to move about in your belly. Believe it or not, I actually have three girls comfortably seated inside me right now.\" Erin explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That's awesome!\" Roxy exclaims. \"Wait here a moment!\" She says before returning to the group, and shares excited whispers with two others. Most of the girls have already stripped themselves of their clothes, one of them still has her underwear on, while two haven't shed themselves of any of their clothes, aside from shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Roxy and her two unknown friends converse, Erin watches as one of the nude girls approaches the underwear-clad girl and embraces her in a deep kiss. At first the other girl is surprised by her advances, but soon begins to clearly enjoy the kiss. It only lasts a short moment however, as the nude girl's mouth suddenly stretches open, engulfing the other girl's head. It's clear that the nude girl has quite some experience, as her meal is rapidly sucked into her, and in only a short moment the other girl is nothing more than a bulge in the nude girl's midsection, which wiggles and bounces for a short moment before suddenly stopping, smoothing out, and beginning to shrink away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck? We haven't even been here five minutes and you've digested Kate!\" One of the clothed girls screams out, mostly out of annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nude predator gives out a slight burp. \"Hey, I told her that I was hungry, and she just kept teasing me about how I could never get any meals during the trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't have to digest her just because of that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, she was so concerned about how often I ate, so I figured she wanted to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two girls argue, Roxy and her friends approach, to her left is a short copper-haired girl, although not as short as Erin is, who feels a slight twinge of jealousy at the similar sized girl's significantly larger assets, her breasts somewhere in the c-range. And to the right is a dark brown haired girl, standing at an average five feet, at most aspects of her appearance, she is utterly unremarkable, although her butt is kinda plump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here she is, girls.\" Roxy says, presenting Erin to her friends. \"Erin, these are my girlfriends, Chandra...\" She says, giving the girl to her right a light slap on her ass, who half-gasps half-giggles at the attention. \"..And Lilia.\" She says, patting her short girl at the same height, which for her is just on her lower back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, she's small, you're saying that her little gut can hold us all, without making a bulge, while still giving us plenty of room to move and more?\" Chandra says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! In fact she has a few inside her right now!\" Roxy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, that would make a problem then...\" Lilia says. \"I would prefer if this were... private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, can't stand having an audience, or maybe a few joiners?\" Chandra speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilia's always been the shy type, how about you let your guests out for her?\" Roxy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I'd rather not let them out.\" Erin says, worried that Jessica, Stacey, or Natalie will not be amused when released. \"Why do you need privacy anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see... it's like-\" Lilia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Threesome in a gut, I guess you can call it a fetish.\" Chandra interrupts, Lilia gives a shamed look as Chandra speaks. \"Come on, Lil, it's time you grow a spine.\" She says as she pushes Lilia forward. Erin, taking the opportunity opens her mouth wide, and lets Lilia stumble inside. After the small girl falls over into her mouth, she closes it and sucks the small girl into her, swallowing her in less than a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, she's quick, come on Roxy!\" Chandra says as she grabs onto Roxanne, and the two step toward Erin together. Who grabs the two of them, pulling Roxanne's head into her mouth, and begins swallowing her alongside Chandra. It takes a little bit longer, but she still manages to down the two quickly, the bulge containing Roxy and Chandra barely visible as it travels down her throat, carrying the two down into her stomach.</span></div></div>",

So she pats her taut bulge before retiring to a nearby vacant sofa. As she sits down she feels squirms and wiggles in her belly as her occupants' world shifts with her sitting. In sitting she here a scream suddenly get muffled, she turns to see what made the noise, and what silenced it, in doing so she sees the same nude predator slurping up the legs of the clothed one. Erin simply smiled as the girl bulge traveled down into the stomach of the nude girl, where the bulge quickly shrank away, and she headed to the bathroom. 'Some girls just never learn, you don't try to reason with a born predator.' Erin's attention is then focused on a sudden movement in her belly, seems they were getting frisky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the inside of Erin's rather spacious gut, Jessica, Stacey, and Natalie were surprised at their three new neighbors. Even more surprised when they noticed how much the three were moving, and grinding... The three girls were rightfully going at it, and it was beginning to cramp the other three quite a lot, despite the comparatively large accommodations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie,was impatient, and also without a meal of her own, so she wasted no time in maneuvering herself in between girls, and latching her mouth on a toe, and then a foot, she then proceeded to feel around with her hands in the complete lack of light, to find the other foot. Once she had her grasp on both feet she proceeded to slurp up the girls calves and thighs, before she even realized what was happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n One girl happened to be working at her sex, and took a strong notice of a head creeping towards her own, and she pushed back just in time to avoid Natalie swallowing her as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point everyone else in Erin's belly had noticed Natalie's devouring, but it was too late for her meal, the other two girls simply continued pleasuring each other as Natalie's mouth crawled over the now struggling girl. Soon enough her breasts were traveling down Natalie's gullet and quickly following was her head and arms. Natalie after finishing the swallow, shrunk her belly down fast to make more room for the other occupants. She didn't digest her, at least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the outside, Erin, eyes closed, was enjoying every moment of the movements and shifting of her belly. When she noticed someone approaching her.  She opened her eyes to see Kerri staring her wriggling midsection.</span></div></div>",

She probably digested the girl, just to spite me, she's not getting out until we leave the party.\" Kerri smiled, her exact intentions were not clear to Erin, then Kerri's eyes went back to her waist, and then traveled down to her groin. Soon followed by her hands and fingers which began to work vigorously at Erin's sex. Then she began to lower her head.</span></div></div>",

Seeing Kerri's head lowering in between her thighs, her position was perfect! She pressed in her stomach and pushed her own head further, opened her mouth, and with her hands pulled in Kerri's thick-haired head. All Kerri could manage was a muffled verbal protest before her chest and arms joined her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the inside of Erin, the occupants began to feel Erin's throat contracting, as well as a small yelp as Kerri was quickly being relocated into the stomach with them. Quickly thinking, Natalie maneuvered herself to be in a good position, and decided to greet the newcomer. No sooner than when she entered the stomach did Kerri find herself, going down another throat. Natalie noticed that this one tasted quite familiar, she thought about spitting her back out into the stomach, but, as familiar she tasted, she also tasted good. With the advantage of gravity on her side, Kerri fell straight into her younger sister's stomach again. Meanwhile Jessica and Stacey finally gave in and began to enjoy each other's company, while the two others are still going at it, neither pair seemed to even care about Natalie's gluttonous tendencies. Natalie once again considered digesting, the only thing that stopped her this time was the fact that she didn't know how long she was going to be in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin, still quite intent with the conditions remained in her seat, much to the pleasure of the onlookers she had now attracted, Erin closed her eyes for a second as she rubbed her belly, this was bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened her eyes,  she had to think for a second about what she saw going on on the other side of the room, Kayla, had just gotten up from a different seat, her eyes intent on the girl who had just left the bathroom. Erin instantly remembered her, the girl who had just devoured both of her presumed 'friends' and likely just let them out in the toilet. What was surprising though is that Kayla was now halfway down the naked girl's throat, her belly hanging out of the girl's expanded mouth, and now several other girls were watching in earnest at Kayla getting what she deserved. Once Kayla had made the girl's belly large, quite large in fact, she let loose a small burp, she then turned to a very ecstatic girl who was in arms reach and quickly downed her as well. The rest of the guests could only watch as the girl's belly shook violently, rounded, and shifted. It wasn't long before her belly began to shrink rapidly. Erin couldn't help but notice that some of the onlooker's bellies had begun to shrink too, as they pleasured themselves on watching this new girl digest Kayla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Erin could think was about was how awesome that was. That is, until she considered how little this girl cared about digesting, she would probably digest anyone here without a second thought. Once again this was confirmed as another girl stepped out of the bathroom and soon found herself immersed and joining the soup of girls in her gut. She was actually worse than Kayla! She would probably digest most everyone here, and then what they would do with future parties? Erin smiled, she guessed that they wouldn't do anything since they would all just be waste, clogging the toilets.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erin notices the predator looking around now, and then she sees the girl pay her a look over, and Erin immediately froze, her instinct was to shrink the small bulge in her belly, but she had a hinting feeling that the predator was going for the girls who already had extra meals, most of these super preds were like that, so if the predator thought that the bulge was natural, she may look on to others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the nude predator turned away, and Erin let out a sigh as the predator went straight toward a pair of girls near the entrance. She still was on her nerves, what this girl would do, was at the very front of her thoughts. The thoughts ran through her head, she thought about running for it first, then she thought about ambushing the predator, but then she would be forced to digest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She glanced around, looking for something, or someone... Then she spotted her, a friend she'd made previously at one of these events, Mary. She had always been a little bit weird, but she might help Erin with this predator. So Erin tightened her belly and quickly made her way to the couch where Mary was sitting. When she got up to her, Erin opened her mouth to speak, only to be interrupted by a rather loud gurgle that came from Mary's bare belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Hey Erin,\" Mary said as she rubbed her nearly flat stomach, \"Did you just see that awesome girl who downed Kayla with ease?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who didn't,\" Erin casually responded to the dark-haired girl. Erin glanced around to make sure that the predator couldn't hear, and then thought of something to say to disguise her nervousness, Mary might take advantage of it, \"Umm, so where's Cindy? You always come to these things with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary smiled wide, \"Well she should be about here,\" Erin was confused only for a second or so as she watched the well figured and nude girl turn around and point directly at her well shaped ass as she pointed directly toward Erin. Mary was always perverted when she talked about vore, why should expect her to be different? Mary then turned back around and smile again as she saw Erin's positive reaction. \"I didn't plan on digesting her exactly tonight, but that predator girl's fun was contagious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin's eyes darted again, \"Yeah, about her, she gives all the tell-tale signs, I get the feeling she needs, erm, removing. I don't think she will or can hold back from eating, and digesting whomever she pleases.\" The intonation behind her words got her point off well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary's face contorted in conflict, she would enjoy watching her down so many every night, and she herself wouldn't mind getting in her belly, but she knew no one who would enter would ever come out. \"Yeah, I guess I can agree, I suppose I would prefer a variety of shows over a one girl show, that could get boring rather quickly I suppose. So do you have a plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was always unnerved by the way Mary casually handled the prospect of other predators. But to be honest in between Mary's disposition, and her belly's wriggling but hidden contents, she hadn't actually came up with a plan yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was hoping you could come up with something?\" Erin said as she sat down on the couch next to Mary finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I'm not an ideas girl, silly. But I'll try just for you.\" Mary said as her belly let a low gurgle to announce that Cindy had finally finished her trip. \"But we should make it quick, I got to visit the little girl's room soon.\"</span></div></div>",

Eventually Mary's eyes drifted to another group of newcomers who had just walked through the door. Mary began walking towards them, despite the relatively close proximity to the mystery predator, and also despite Cindy's rather insistently annoying need to leave her ass. Mary made sure the predator eyes drifted somewhere else as she closed the distance, and she quickly looked back to make sure Erin was following her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was definitely close behind her comparatively gigantic friend, her eyes constantly darting around, Erin was not usually on edge like this, but that girl... Made her more nervous tonight than she'd ever been, nervous enough that she had just about forgotten the contents of her belly, and she directly went from thought to thought until she realized that the once frequent movements in her belly had completely ceased, \"Hold on a sec Mary, \" she said as she gulped down a large bit of air, and made a rather large belch as she expelled all of the old gas from her many occupants. This gathered a bit of attention from girls nearby, who payed her a glance, Erin freaked out momentarily as she scanned for the predator, but she was nowhere to be found. Momentarily placated she realized she couldn't feel the her belly-fillers move at all, so she gave her well hidden gut a small poke, and it jiggled, to her delight, and at least someone moved, she felt. So her gut hadn't started digesting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going on, on the inside was something different entirely, during Erin's time wandering around on edge, Natalie had gotten increasingly impatient with the situation, she never took kindly to going down someone else's throat, which was probably because the disproportionate amount of time all of her older sisters and mother had done it to her growing up. This added to the fact that the other four remaining inside the confines of Erin's spacious and jiggling belly, were all enjoying each other's company a pretty good bit. Natalie had herself determined that she was going to eat someone else while she was bored in here, so she ran the possibilities through her head, there were those two unknown girls, but they already knew that she had eaten their friend, and one would probably retaliate if she couldn't eat them both quick enough. Then there was Stacey, who had eaten her mother, and whether or not Stacey had already digested her, Natalie was not willing to risk digesting her own mother. Which left Jessica and her Julianne filled belly.Natalie subconsciously licked her lips. With her mind set she began putting her hands around the dark confines, and her hand eventually comes to a very erect nipple, and she then took her down a little lower to try and find a bulge, it was here that she realized how hard it would be to determine who Jessica was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie's wanton feel-up was instantly interrupted as someone's hand grabbed hers and jerked it up right into her mouth. Natalie, startled, pulled back, and when that didn't work, she tried to push off with her other hand, but this was a big mistake, because once the girl felt the hand on her chest trying to push off, she pulled that hand into her mouth as well, and slurped hard, and she briefly felt lips on her face, before that too was pulled in. Natalie's chest was hanging outside her captor's lips when she felt a hand almost dive into her nethers. Which to Natalie's mixed relief and disappointment was shortly removed, but then replaced by a tongue, Natalie could hardly protest getting eaten now. And before long her pleasurer stopped and she was pulled the rest of the way into the stomach, where she heard her predator speak. \"Hey, Lilia, I thought you didn't like extra company.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that girl had eaten Chandra, so she had to be her replacement.\" Lilia responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy sat feeling up her belly, her meal felt pretty heavy despite her size, and she supposed that her recent prey must have been eating before she had eaten Chandra, and Chandra happened to be a good friend of hers so, she wasn't planning on digesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the inside of Roxy now, Natalie was relieved at the currently non-volatile conditions in the significantly tighter confines of the less-experienced Roxanne. Feeling a little light headed with her encounter with her pleasurer, her hand drifted down to her belly, only to find it feeling quite a bit smaller, Natalie half smiled, her attempts to keep from digesting for the time being had been foiled, and it felt great. Of course, she had no idea she had inadvertently turned two of her sisters into soup. Heavy from the exertion she had been doing recently, and the much welcomed nourishment from meals Natalie drifted to sleep within her warm confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Roxy was just getting started, Lilia continued to caress her body as Roxy had maneuvered her way through Erin's belly toward where Stacey and Jessica were. And Roxy found herself only finding one girl, who would be Jessica, you see, what Natalie had mistaken to be the two of them enjoying each other, was actually the two of them in contest to see who would eat who, and Jessica had been the winner. Cautiously Roxy recoiled her hand, and lunged herself toward the TA, her mouth wide. Jessica, had barely paid attention to the other girls in Erin's belly thus far, and was quite surprised to feel another's hand tough her, needless to say, she shortly found herself chest deep and causing Roxy's throat bulge out nicely with her large gut, much to Lilia's pleasure as she rubbed Roxy's throat as Jessica made her way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica soon found herself next to a slumbering girl, who she identified, by the smell of her shampoo, of all things, to be one of Malinda's girls, and she presumed it to be Natalie, due to her proximity to Erin when she was eaten. And Natalie didn't budge from her slumber as Jessica wrapped her lips around her sweet smelling hair, and Jessica figured she could take all the time that she wanted on the sleeping young beauty. As she pulled Natalie's head and shoulders down her throat she moved Natalie's arms from her chest and belly an put them to her sides before she took time to relish in the taste of Natalie's exposed and young breasts, and quickly moved to licking up her folds, which had been left moist from Lilia's recent exploitations. It was from this that Natalie groggily woke up again, and she let out nothing more than a moan, which was all the incentive Jessica needed to finish swallowing the girl. And in displeasure, Natalie, had once again been swallowed, and yet swallowed again, as she found herself go from one throat and into another. This time however, she was greeted by a familiar voice, \" Natalie? Is that you?\" Malinda spoke up through the now tight confines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the conditions, Natalie responded casually, \"Yeah, Mom, and who's this?\" She asked as she poked what seemed to be her mother's very bloated midsection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I do believe it was one of those girl's Erin brought with her, I was about to let my stomach at her.\" Malinda said as her hungry belly made a gurgle as it claimed Julianne. She had been hungry since before she let Stacey eat her, and she had been quick to slurp up whoever entered Stacey's belly first. In fact, she probably would have accidentally eaten Natalie if she had wound up here before Julianne. As her belly steadily shrank to give more room to her daughter Malinda spoke again, \"So I've felt a good deal of commotion, how many girls are we within now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie, bewildered by her recent experience only responded, \" I have no idea mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the outside, Erin had been oblivious to the shenanigans deep within her belly so when she poked it, the movement she felt was actually Roxy and Lilia separating from each other. Erin heard a muffled sound from within, it was Roxy snapping out of her pleasure, \"Woah, glad that Erin chick stopped us, you probably almost made me digest, and I do not want handle anything that big while we're stuck in here, and besides, Chandra's still inside that one girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilia made a frown, despite the lack of anyone being able to see it, and simply said, \"Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter unknowingly saving her friends from being digested by the girl she just met, content with her belly moving again, Erin looked to see where Mary was, and found her chatting up two new attendees. Curious, Erin quickly crossed the room towards them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erin is walking briskly now, she was eager to see what Mary had in mind, even though it usually ended up with Mary or herself in a belly, Mary's plans were always fun, and she was quite certain that Mary had no plans in being digested. I mean, she would think of her own safety first right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin stopped in her step when she saw Mary smile at the two rather young looking girls, and then make an abrupt turn and then beeline to the bathroom, luckily the predator was not paying any attention, Erin made sure. Erin was a little bit more surprised when Mary gave her a glance. Figuring that, that meant to come in the bathroom with Mary, Erin took the cue, as she moved her small form across the room to where Mary was opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few girls noticed as the two went in, but no one actually did anything about it. Once inside, Mary pulled Erin's arm to the far side of the bathroom. Erin blushed, \"Mary, if you wanted to get kinky we didn't have to go into the bathroom for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary smiled, and rolled her eyes, \"Not right now silly,\" Mary motioned her eyes to the door, \"I just want a good view of that doorway, if the pred comes in, I want to be able to at least try to fight back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why the bathroom anyways?\" Erin asked as she looked around the still empty bathroom. Before returning to the girl who still had her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone but that pred is afraid to come in here, and I need to talk to you in private.\" Mary's eyes closed briefly, \" And I already told you, I need to use the girl's room.\" With that, she let go of Erin's arm and went to the nearest stall. In an awkward position now, and still clueless to whether or not Mary had even come up with something, she then heard a sigh of relief and a rather loud hiss to her side, where she noticed her friend hadn't even bother to close the stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww, Mary, I know you're naked and all but you could have at least spared me this,\" she said as she motioned to close the door. Mary only grinned as she began Cindy's bowel evacuation. Erin knew that Mary simply didn't care, and she was somewhat aroused by remembering Mary's ass in her face when she had indicated Cindy's location. This kept Erin occupied long enough for Mary to finish and flush the girl away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary exited the stall and briefly washed her hands before turning to Erin, who was still standing against the wall, her eyes now looking Mary up and down. \"Hey, hey girl, we can have some fun after this predator is in the sewers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, about that, do you actually have something in mind?\" Erin's eyes were now back at Mary's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I do!\" Mary was somewhat prideful in the fact that she thought up of something good, this time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary ran it through her head but then realized Erin was still waiting patiently, \"Well, what have you got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary took a surprisingly serious tone for the moment, which unnerved Erin a bit, \"Well, those two girls who are waiting outside, are complete newcomers, saying they had heard about this place during a local class,\" Erin's thoughts went straight to the three TAs who were still somewhere in her stomach, \"Anyways, they don't seem to really have any idea that digestion is so common at these things, their \"friend\" must have been planning on eating them tonight, but their friend seems to be missing. And the best part is that neither one seems to be able to eat anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was taking in what her friend had said, but still was clueless as to what she wanted to do, \"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was figuring we could use them as bait!\" Mary was getting excited now, her serious demeanor giving way to her naturally lively self, \"You see, we can have one of them casually tell the pred of a private party upstairs. And then the other one can be behind you as the two of you are seen going up the stairs! Then once we get up there you can jump the predator when you see her coming up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Erin clutched her belly, \"Well I guess that might work, but if the pred girl is as good as she seems, she might just use gravity against me and I'd have a one way trip into her digestive tract.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, that's where I come in, I can wait at the bottom of the stairs, and grab her ankles, and start swallowing until she coughs you up. Then I'll swallow her down anyways!\" Mary responded, quite confident in her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin, had an inquisitive look about her. Her thoughts were interrupted however, as the door hinge creaked open, and both girls turned the head to see who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat relieved at the sight of a rather short blond girl, who blushed at the sight of the two girls staring at each other against the wall, and just simply made her way into the stall closest to the door, either she wasn't afraid of the predator, or she simply didn't know. Either way, the two were briefly put on edge, and both had a silent agreement to leave the bathroom before that girl finished up releasing whoever was unlucky enough to go into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin could only think of so many bad conclusions to her friend's seemingly infallible plan, 'What if Mary can't get the pred to cough me up, would she just swallow and digest? I guess it would be for the good of the club, but was she willing to risk herself like that?' Then Erin felt a wiggle, and was instantly reminded of all the girls in her tummy. \"Wait, Mary\" Erin grabbed the girls arm, \"I got some friends in here I want to get out before we try this scheme of yours.\" She said motioning at her flat belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in the relative privacy of the bathroom, Mary poked her friends belly, \"Really? I hadn't even noticed! I think you could have had a car full of people in there and I would have never known. Anyways, be quick about it.\" Mary's eyes glanced towards a stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no,\" I mean they're still in my stomach, Mary almost told her to digest quick then, but Erin spoke before she did, \"I'm letting them out of alive, their those tasty kind of friends, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary smiled again, \"Well Cindy was really tasty too, you know. But still make it quick, I don't want to find out our bait was snatched up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was almost as good as getting girls up her belly as getting them down, and she used all the right muscles, and before long her small throat had a tiny bulge in it before that bulge grew in her mouth and spilled out as mass of wet copper colored hair. In less than a few seconds Lilia found herself on the cold bathroom floor, and soon a very big bellied Roxy came out too. Surprised, Erin felt around her belly for anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilia, who regained her composure much faster than her engorged friend, spoke \"Don't worry, the rest of your belly is in Roxy's.\" The small but busty girl smiled and patted her lover's belly. \" One of em has Chandra, so she's not going to digest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin, amused but somewhat angry, responded to the girl, \"Well I want to see all of my friends out now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy, who had just wiped her hair out of her face responded, \"Well...\" Her face suddenly lit up, \"Oh hey Mary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary, now recognizing her acquaintance with the girl, \"Well Erin, I see you ate up these girls, I met them in a belly at the last club. But we don't really have time for her cough all of your friends up. If you would Roxanne, be a good girl and let Erin's friends up, we wouldn't want to see you end up as a toilet filler, when Erin feels like revenge.\" Mary's mind wandered for a second, ' I guess, actually, I wouldn't mind that, as long as I got to see Erin do the deed.' Mary then opened the door to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne was more than happy to find Chandra, so she began the belabored process of getting the girls up, Roxy wasn't exactly experienced so this might take a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an empty and growling stomach, Erin followed her friend out the bathroom.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erin reentered the club main, and found Mary talking again to the two girls. She turned left and walked the short distance to them. It was on her way that another thought went through her head, 'How exactly was Mary going to convince these girls to do exactly what they needed to do?' That short blonde girl seems to have gotten in the way of Erin being able to refine Mary's crazy idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary then turned around abruptly ,\"Hey Erin, I was just telling these two all about you! We're going upstairs to enjoy each other's company, you coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin, smiled as she understood what was going on now, these girls really were that gullible. \" Yeah but you know it wouldn't be a party without,\" Erin paused, nervously she realized that she had to come up with a name, \"Julia, yeah, sorry, Julia, she's over,\" Erin paused again as she glanced over the room looking for any sign of \"Julia\" and she spotted her sitting on a stool, in a rather empty room. Erin had to remember, 'What's that room called again?' She pointed to her and quickly put her hand down, \"Julia is in the Kitchen. The two girls had to adjust themselves in order to see the flat bellied girl sitting on a stool her eyes to the side so she hadn't noticed Erin pointing her out, much to Erin's relief as she realized the attention she could gather by raising her arm like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary, still playing the part of the welcoming friend, asked a casual question, in order to unease the girls, \"So, I never got your names,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first girl to speak up was of medium height, somewhat tan skin and had jet black curls that went halfway down her back, \" Mine's Roberta, and this is,\" she gestured to her friend, who had a lighter brown hair color, and was a little bit shorter than Roberta, but no less curvy, \"Theresa.\" Roberta finished introducing her friend and she stood waiting, her face obviously happy in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin felt a bit safer around Theresa, something just seemed soothing around her, compared to her jumpy and excitable friend, she reminded Erin of Mary, actually. \"Well Theresa, we can get settled upstairs, Mary and Roberta will go get a few more people.\" Theresa now seemed a little bit uneasy. Both girls were still clothed, more proof to how little they knew of these events, she actually mentally praising Mary with her plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Erin and Theresa were walking towards the stairs, Mary was convincing the eager girl to go and lure \"Julia\" into their trap. \"I'm going to go get a few of my friends who are in the far part of the room, can you go get Julia over there, she might see you as a threat and eat you, but just tell her about the party upstairs.\" Roberta only nodded before she crossed the room toward the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary herself made it look like she was going to go get a friend, just in case Roberta decided to look back. Sensing a rather lack of danger, Mary noticed that few more girls had been visiting the bathroom, and she realized that she hadn't seen anyone she knew, namely Roxanne and company, come out yet. Well, to be honest, her back was to the bathroom for a few minutes, so they might have already came out, either way it was Erin who cared, not her. Now at this point, she had made her way to a couch that gave a good view of the kitchen, through a wide opening in the wall. She hoped that Roberta wouldn't give away her location to the powerful predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoberta ecstatically approached the nude girl, her light blond hair which adorned her well sized body, with her bare ass sitting plumply on the cushioned stool her face now turned to the wall, she was hoping someone would come.. Showing her complete innocence in the plot she simply greeted the girl, \"Hi there!\" The predator turned her head rapidly, and almost swallowed, but the girl caught her eye. She questioned her judgment for a second, \"Roberta!\" the predator exclaimed, unbeknownst to Roberta, the predator still had a Kayla and desserts filled belly, and they were making their way through the blonde beauty's intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julia's\" belly let out a small gurgle before Roberta Recognized her, \"Oh um, hi, Jacky...\" Roberta was a little bit flustered, the two had met each other in her first vore class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have something to say?\" Jacqueline, had momentarily not eaten the girl, but she wouldn't hesitate from doing so if they need would arise, and besides what was she doing here? Sure she had no idea how to vore herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Roberta was torn, she had agreed to get this girl upstairs, but she couldn't help but be suspicious of how they called her Julia, even though she was sure her name was Jacqueline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer curiosity gets the better of her though, so she rolls with it. \"Well, two girls who say they know you want you to come upstairs for some fun. They told me to take you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacky's eyebrow raised, \"Really? Interesting, I suppose we should go then. By the way, In the company of others, call me Haley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoberta tilted her own eyebrow in confusion, but didn't worry, probably some stage name or something, Jacky seemed the type. Her thoughts cleared again she barely withheld her excitement, limiting it to a little skip in her step as she walked towards the stair case. She was wierded out a bit when she noticed that everyone had been staring at the two of them once they left the kitchen. Roberta wondered why, but decided not to worry. She looked around briefly for Mary, but Mary had been watching from well distanced spot, and she dove for cover behind the side of a couch when she saw Roberta scanning the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacky followed close behind the dark-haired girl. Hopefully she could get a few more meals from this endeavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the two had reached the stairwell, Roberta had noticed that no one had even been near the two, as if they were actually avoiding them, but that wouldn't make sense, Jacky had been in the same basic vore class as herself. Meanwhile Mary was sneaking up and getting into position so that she could enact part B of the plan if they needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoberta stopped to make sure Mary wasn't waiting for them, and didn't notice when Jacky had brushed past her and started going up the stairs. At the top, Erin lay waiting, and Theresa was nowhere in sight, in fact, Erin had decided to eat the lass, she reasoned she would be a good bit of added weight to force down onto the predator. And she wouldn't have any problems digesting both of them. Erin's nerves were on fire at this point, this was all or nothing for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into view now, Erin identified the predator, and made her move, her brain just on repeat, 'This is crazy! This is Crazy!' She closed her eyes and let her own inner predator take over, her mouth opened to an impossible size as she lunged straight down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacky, was raised her head only to see a big gaping red cave before her, the height and width covered the entirety of the stairwell, there was no hope of outeating this girl, so she stepped back in an attempt to dodge her, however Erin was unblocked by anything, and so her lips past Jacky's face, chest, waist and legs before a normal vore would even be able to swallow. Within a fraction of a second Jacky landed in the belly of this girl, just she felt a large thud. Erin had eaten Jacky all right, but she forgot in her predation that she should have caught her fall, so she ended up face-planting onto the carpeted floor. A few lookers chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoberta stood in front of Erin with surprise, \"Woah! Why'd you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin, laid on the floor for a moment, before sitting up, \"Well, that will hurt in the morning,\" Erin said, feeling up her forehead.</span></div></div>",

Erin questioned her previous assessment and brought her other hand up to her head, trying to contain the pounding headache as it escalated. <br>\r\nShe even had a nosebleed, for once she was glad of her Asian decent, had she been Caucasian she'd most likely broken her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell had she thought? Jumping head first down a flight of stairs without checking her fall or even breaking it with her hands?<br>\r\nThe predator had made her all riled up, she clearly hadn't been thinking clearly, still she deserved the pain for her stupidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nausea joined the throbbing pain, someone was beating her arm. \u201cWhy did you do that?!\u201d She heard someone shout at her, demanding an answer, the assault being pathetic, it was still annoying, so she got up quickly in order to face her assailant and scare her at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body didn't like the sudden movement, especially not her head and she felt queasy, her stomach let out a wet grumble which at least shut the shouting girl up as she resorted to stare open mouthed at Erin's belly instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin nearly doubled over, as she felt a sour taste rise in her throat and threaten to bubble up into her mouth, she forced her body not to throw up, even though it clearly wanted to. Then she felt an obstruction in her throat, unfortunately so did her body and it wanted to clear it, Erin had been fine with that if it involved swallowing the item back down, but her body wanted it to go up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand playing tricks in the back of her mouth irritating things was all it took for her long forgotten gag-reflex to make a comeback. She hadn't felt it since last she had some of that awful orange stuff, but this was even worse, not the least because of the naked girl that spewed forth from her mouth and onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin could tell right away. Of the two girls she'd had in her belly she could have lived with coughing one up, but this was the wrong one.<br>\r\nEven so her stomach groaned again and threatened to evict the other occupant as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she could do was to step back and try to calm her protesting body as she watched the clearly miffed blonde getting up from the floor, no less irritated by the fact that she was more or less covered in a liquid that made her skin itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow would be a good time for Mary to bail her out, Erin thought, shoving Roberta aside as she continued to back away.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mary had, at this point realized what she had gotten her friend Erin into, she scanned the situation for anything she could tip into her favor, the wet and slimy predator was staring down at Erin who had just fallen back onto her ass, one hand gripping her stomach, the other holding her swaying and rocking head steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary would have to act fast if she wanted Erin safe, she would miss her cave belly, otherwise. She could have just watched from the sidelines and watched as the predator devoured her wounded friend and most likely Roberta, the predator likely hadn't even noticed Mary as anything worth worrying about, that is, if she had even seen Mary at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary made up her mind though quickly enough though, she reviled the taste she was going to get from doing this, but she felt some sort of strange obligation to doing it, already in a good position to get her from behind due to the strategic placement the two had planned for, she stepped forward. Her mouth couldn't open wide as Erin's could, but she was significantly larger than the short girl, at least the same size as the predator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacky, furious at the situation stared down the small and battered girl, and stepped forward, only to feel a tight grip on one arm and then the other. She let out a small yelp but Mary quickly swallowed her enzyme covered head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin watched through her blurry eyes as Mary devoured the girl, and smile formed amidst the blood dripping from her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoberta, on the other hand was not so happy, she recognized that Mary was now eating up Jacky, and she realized she had been tricked into getting this situation underway, but where she was confused was why they even needed her at all, obviously they knew something she didn't, regardless she was couldn't bring her eyes from Mary as her mouth was going quickly over Jacky's bare, glistening chest, and quickly down the rest of her soaked body. In mixture of confusion, anger and amazement, Roberta desperately wanted to eat Erin and Mary right then and there, but that urge was quickly quelled as she was quite aware she lacked the practice to eat much more than an orange whole. So she stepped back and watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary finished up slurping Jacky's toes, and sent the girl down to her awaiting belly, she spared no time in letting her body have at the predator, but the taste she left in her mouth was so awful she started spitting out the leftover digestive fluids from Erin's belly. She looked around for anything she could wash her down with, displeased Mary just resorted to continue spitting onto the carpet. Erin meanwhile had began reclining her head on the foot of the steps, her belly finally calming, and making steady gurgles as Theresa began to break down, without the gurgles, no one would have known she was digesting anything, Erin's belly still remained trim, her skilled hiding techniques keeping in check despite the condition of her battered head and face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gurgles were especially ambiguous because of the fact she just threw up an entire girl. So, Roberta had no idea that Theresa was well on her way to becoming a fine soup within the tired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecognizing her friend's weakness, and possible concussion, Mary in swift compassion, something that she would realize wasn't exactly one of her strong suits, as she picked up the small girl and began rushing up the stairs, mostly in order to keep any opportunistic girls from picking her up in a different way, which wasn't really an issue, as most girls were there for a good time, not to see anyone get bloodied up, still Mary was quite impressed with herself at this moment. Erin could feel Mary's jiggling unhidden belly bobble as she was taken back up the stairs from which she had just dove off of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary went down the hall and found a room with a bed and quickly put Erin onto it, Erin's eyes were looking around as she landed on the soft mattress, some of the initial nausea subsiding, \"Wow, so your plan worked!\" was Erin shakily said before taking her hand back up to her nose to wipe off some of the blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well that bitch isn't coming back up now,\" Mary said as her belly made a loud wet gurgle, claiming Jacqueline and the digesting remains of Kayla and company. Mary knew she would have a large load to handle in a bit. She was more worried with putting on weight than that though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin briefly touched her forehead again, just to make sure her head wasn't bleeding, it wasn't but she did find a nice lump swelling up. Before she remembered her own belly, \"Erm, well,\" she paused feeling her flat stomach, \"I guess when I was woozy down there, I started digesting her..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary realizing that she must have eaten Theresa while she was waiting responded, \"Well, no matter, you were going to digest her anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin shaking her head, trying to get rid of the cobwebs and throbbing pain, wiped her nose again, happy to find it stop bleeding. \"She was nice though, nice to eat too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary smiled, happy to see Erin wasn't as badly hurt as she had thought, \"Well at least she will be nice coming out, I know my food won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my dinner wasn't very agreeable with me either, glad you spared it from me.\" Erin laughed, \"Ow!\" laughing apparently wasn't something she wanted to do and Erin laid her head on a nearby pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary was brought from watching Erin to looking back towards the hall as she heard someone rushing up the stairs. Mary was relieved when she saw Roberta come through the open door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoberta, full of questions, had came up here seeking answers, but was taken aback when she saw that Mary's body had already shrank down to little more than a mid-sized bulge in the middle of her belly. In fact as her body processed the multitude of girls who actually were making their way through her intestines, were taking quite a while, and the bulge was only shrinking slowly after the initial liquification. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoberta, now speechless, stood in the door, Mary didn't want to bother talking to the curly haired beauty, so she didn't spare any time in running straight at her, a trip to her belly would likely shut her up, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Mary run at her, she tried to turn and run away but, there was no use, she found Mary's hands around her and was reminded of how she saw Mary down Jacky downstairs. Furiously the spunky girl thrashed her head around, and managed to knock her head against the roof of Mary's mouth before she swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary barely noticed the girl's attempts, she was too busy realizing that Roberta was still fully clothed, and was cursing the fact that she couldn't catch a break with these meals, which reminded her of how good Cindy tasted, this was probably justice for the fact she wouldn't be able to taste her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary had eaten down to the girl's waist before she realized she had actually forgotten that she was in the middle of eating here, and an idea crossed her mind, she turned Roberta around in her mouth and throat with her tongue, a skill she was quite proud of, with her mouth keeping Roberta in place she took her hands down the the girl's skirt, and was happy to find it buttoned on. Mary thought, 'I did promise her a good time.' She undid the skirt and quickly slipped down her panties, Mary would have smiled if her face wasn't Roberta filled, because she found her quite wet, 'I guess she's already been having a good time!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoberta couldn't do much of anything as Mary skillfully swallowed up to her hips, arching Roberta's back with her head in Mary's esophagus, licked over her now bare bottom with her tongue briefly, 'She's not Cindy, but I could get used to eating her,' Mary thought as she quickly turned the now moaning girl around in her mouth again so she could lick at her quite moist folds. Quickly Roberta was taking in all she could get, her hands reaching down and grasping at Mary's slippery tongue. Very intrigued with this, Mary made a mental note to keep this girl around a bit, but she really should keep an eye on Erin so she finished swallowing. Mary ended the fun a little too early, because she could feel an apparently displeased Roberta still moaning and now touching herself in her belly, not quite brought to climax, Mary however smiled, 'At least she will want more later.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary turned around to see Erin sitting half upright on the back of the bed. \"Hey, don't digest her, that was fun to watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary looked up, \"I wasn't planning on it. She was really, really good.\"</span></div></div>",

I was worried that someone was in the middle of turning you into a fresh pile of soup to go down into the toilet.\" She said walking over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why what's wrong? Oh and this is Mary, an old friend.\" Erin asked and greeted as she pointed to Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you. I'm Jessica. But let's just say that a lot happened while we were inside your belly. After you ate those three new girls, Natalie ate one of them and then got eaten herself cause I ate her when one of the other girls ate me after I ate Stacy. When we got out and let everyone out, we found Julianne missing along with one of the girl's friend and the other sisters of Natalie. We found out that Malinda digested Julianne and then a Stacy ate her back. Natalia tried to get back at her but she got eaten by one of the other girls. And to sum it up Stacy said that she rather stay inside my belly for the remainder of our time here since it's the safest.\" Jessica explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Sorry about Julianne, really thought that wouldn't happen inside Malinda.\" Erin apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. We knew this was going to happen eventually. But speaking of which, what happened while we were in there and you were outside? You were moving around a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point Mary decided to interject. \"Long story short some new girl came in and ate Kayla and Erin was scared that she was going to do the same to the rest of the club, so I came up with a plan to digest the girl with Erin getting a meal on the side as well. And I'm keeping some last girl to play with for later.\" She explained to Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Quite the eventful evening so far. We still continuing?\" Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hoping so! The night is still young and since the major digesters are gone, their are a lot more girls willing to become meals.\" Mary said eager for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not for me. After all that drama, I can use a nap.\" Erin said yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you can rest with Stacy.\" Jessica said before lunging at Erin and shoving her head intimate her mouth. Erin enjoyed the feeling of Jessica's warm mouth and esophagus pass over her head and shoulders. And she enjoyed even more when she felt her chest pop in as well and feel Jessica's tongue go over them. Pretty soon Jessica reached her sex and started tonguing her into an orgasm before finally swallowing all of her done to join Stacy. With Stacy snuggling up next to her and waiting to see who else comes through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary was also aroused by seeing how well and good Jessica swallowed Erin. \"See you know your way to swallow a women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. That's what a TA is supposed to know. But still know anywhere else a girl could fill herself and her friends up?\" She asked.</span></div></div>",

Or was it for someone standing around talking and not watching? Well, Mary was on the couch to her left, and there were two girls sucking face, leaning against the wall on the right side of Erin's couch. Erin's not the only possible target here, so she needs to decide whether she should react or not. In fact, if she reacts unnecessarily, it might attract the attention of the predator whereas she might otherwise have been ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin mentally prepared herself to get up and start moving if she locked eyes with the predator, while hoping to see the girl's feet angle to either her left or right. It was, of course, also possible that the girl was full right then and was just trying to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't worth the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime began to slow down in Erin's mind. One step, arm shifts, lock of hair on forehead bounces upward, another step, arms shift again, the hair comes down. Eyes are still not meeting... still not... still not... but they're not catching the eyes of any of the others either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she'll be close enough that in order for her eyes to not be looking at anyone, she'd be staring directly at the wall, which of course would also give away that she's pretending not to look to get close in the first place.

Her mind flickered back and forth and her eyes blinked quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all too much of a sudden, she realized she was facing a pair of breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were dangling in front of her, pointing towards the ground. Connected to those breasts were the chest of the predator, who was bending over, looking at Erin full on in the face, a broad grin on her face with her tongue between her teeth. Before Erin managed to do anything more than shift violently in her seat, the girl opened her mouth incredibly wide and just leaned forward, putting her tongue under Erin's chin before the head ended up between her cheeks. The movement didn't stop at the neck, and the predator's head continued downward to engulf past Erin's shoulders to the elbows. At that point, the predator straightened up a little bit, lifting Erin right off of the couch, legs kicking in the air. The girl used her arms to steady Erin before leaning back a little more and slurping up everything from the midriff to the tips of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the predator's throat, Erin could see nothing as she went down, only feeling the tight constriction of the wet flesh around her. The tongue shoved her feet over the edge in the back of the mouth, and Erin accelerated downwards, where she and all the contents of her belly started to dissolve. Her skin took a second to start burning, and her entire head was submerged in acid as sound washed out from her ears. When the acids receded, the stomach contents had all vacated to the intestines. All nine girls were starting to deposit their good parts to their captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the club, the rest of the girls in the room were rapt with attention. All eyes were on the predator, who had run around swallowing and digesting some of the most capable girls that frequented these events in a single night, unhindered by anything. Well, almost anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name,\" she said smirkingly to the crowd of silent gawkers, covertly putting a hand over her anus, \"is Haley.\" She lightly sprints to the bathroom, leaving everyone else standing in place.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Haley, opened the door to the bathroom, it was still empty from the last time she came in here, which was to her liking. She could feel the heavy weight from deep within her, her body working on down and reducing the remains of her many meals, she opened a stall and planted her still naked form on the porcelain, she wasn't quite ready to go yet. You see, Haley hadn't actually came here for the easy meals, this was actually part of research she was doing, she wanted to see how well she could absorb from meals after all of her previous work. Not that she disliked gorging on so many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls she had eaten first were displeasing, she obviously didn't spend enough time absorbing them, mostly because she was actually quite famished, she had refrained from eating for the past two days because of her plan to pay a visit to this club, having heard about it from two interns from Blainey's team who payed a visit to the Hawthorne offices three days ago in order to welcome them to the neighborhood. You see, she had acted the friend role to get their trust. Long story short, she digested them way too fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she emerged from the bathroom the first time she sought out targets she could absorb well, so she purposefully went after her two main targets because she knew they had good undigested meals already. She had seen that short Asian girl eating several girls when she had entered the club, and well she saw that red haired girl have a pretty huge gut, and was also eating 2 other girls by surprise at the far end of the club when she had entered. This added to the girl she ate while she was washing her hands when Haley went into the bathroom the first time and the two others near the bathroom when she ate the redhead, gave Haley a great idea of how much she had eaten, the only discrepancy came from that annoying Asian girl, Haley thought, 'If only she wasn't hiding her belly.' The absorption was going nicely and the small bulge Haley had in her powerful belly from hiding all of them was shrinking slowly but surely, and Haley could feel all of the meals. \"Wow a lot more were in there than I thought.\" she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer intestines were pulling the nutrients from her many, many meals rapidly now, and Haley could feel them crawling her small intestines, her body reducing them more and more, the multitude of girls being pushed through and through. Haley had no idea how many girls she had actually eaten, If you were to count them up, you have to count all the girls in in Erin's belly, then the fact that Kerri who had eaten Marie, who had eaten someone else. Then you'd have to count all of Kayla's meals and then add them to the other two girls who she ate after Kayla. And now they were all slowly working their way into the young girl's large intestine, no longer recognizable from their ingested form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley let her body continue to drain and compact the girls as more of their remains entered into her colon. \"There we go,\" she said to herself as the first bit of the girls reached her anus. With little effort she let the first mass of digested girl flesh fall into the toilet bowl, then another, and another. There was a brief pause as she let her body compact the next bit, soon after it too passed, the all of the girls' remains completely un discernible from the rest, Haley's powerful body reducing them to virtually nothing, their thoughts, wants and dreams reduced to waste, as if that was all they ever were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fairly large mass was next, she was wondering when this part would come, and even though it was extremely large, her body passed it with ease and it landed in the toilet bowl with a thud, causing the bottom of the bowl to expand in order to accommodate it. All Haley did was sigh, as several more masses left her body. Almost done, she let her bladder release the processed liquid remains of the girls. In a few more short minutes she had managed to finish. Haley, sensing the emptiness in her bowels finally wiped and stepped up and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, Haley had managed to eat and digest twelve girls inside and including Erin, 15 girls containing and including Kayla, as well as the three unlucky girls near enough to be collateral damage. So in total Haley had digested 30 girls and reduced them to a shit comparable to that of a normal vore's 2 or 3 meals. Haley hadn't brought any means to record it, so she simply made a mental note and went straight to the sink to clean up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was satisfied with her hygiene for the moment she swung the door open, to seeing a mixture of grimacing and fidgeting girls, who undoubtedly digested their meals when they watched Kayla, but were afraid to enter the bathroom, and who could blame them. The other type she saw were girls who cheered at her reappearance, then there were a few girls talking amongst themselves and glancing back at her, she would pay these girls first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon approach Haley was interrupted by a underwear clad girl, who had taken it upon herself to stand within  3 feet of her before opening her mouth wide and trying to suck her down. Haley simply turned direction at the last second, and then proceeded to head back to those girls. The party seemed weirdly empty to Haley, the fact that she ate 30 attendees would never dawn on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Haley neared the table where no more than 3 of the remaining were sitting, then much to her surprise the girl stood and spoke, which stunned Haley. She said, \"I heard you say that your name was, Haley right? Would you happen to be Haley Hawthorne?\" Then Haley couldn't ignore the fact that so many eyes were watching her now. Haley recognized the chance and rapidly devoured the questioning woman. Suddenly, and it was as if she knew what to do. Another girl at the table had managed to escape right before Hayley had devoured every person within hearing range, meanwhile the escapee was headed straight to where she worked for Blainey. With another very fueled belly Haley meandered her way out of the front door, leaving a total of two people at the club not including the escapee, to continue her story</span></div></div>",

Kerri crawls over to Erin like a predator stalking its meal. She climbs partway onto the couch and stops when her face is even with the back of the couch and opens her mouth and throat so wide Erin can straight down into Kerri's stomach which Kerri has expanded to look like a deep cavern. \u201cHey Jess, you should slide over and check this out.\u201d she adjusts a nearby lamp so the light shines straight down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica slides over and peers down Kerri's throat. \u201cNow that's weird.\u201d she says. \u201c It looks like it almost 20 feet deep.\u201d  She pulls away and looks at Kerri. \u201cHer belly is barely expanded\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think the is crazy. You should see how much her mom can do.\u201d Erin says. Kerri gives a low rumble to let Erin know to quit talking and get in. \u201cOh, I think that means to get down there. See you later Jess.\u201d She says with a wink. \u201cOr not. You never know.\u201d With that Erin places her feet into Kerri's mouth and gives a little push from the top of the cushions and quickly slides down Kerri's gullet with out a single swallow. Jessica watches in amazement as Erin falls out of sight. She moves over to get a better view and sees Erin slide to the bottom of Kerri's stomach. She watches as the stomach walls collapse on Erin rolling up the throat till Kerri closes he mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, Erin really know hows to go down.\u201d Kerri says as she takes her place on the couch allowing her belly to bulge a little and give it a nice rub down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was so cool. Do you think I could join her down there the same way?\u201d Jessica says gently rubbing Kerri's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy certainly. Did you see what Erin did?\u201d Kerri says with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I did.\u201d she says climbing on to the back of the couch. \u201cI am a little bigger than she is. Are you sure you can take my even with Julianne in my belly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I can.\u201d she says while getting back into position. Jessica finishes getting into her position on the back of the couch and Kerri takes her place. She opens just her mouth at first wider than before. Wide enough to have taken Erin and Jessica at the same time. With the light positioned she opens her throat and expands her stomach revealing Erin comfy in the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Erin. You want some company down there?\u201d Jessica says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell ya, get your sweet ass down here.\u201d Erin replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica places her feet in Kerri's mouth and prepares to push off. Kerri give a low rumble and Jessica pushes off and begins her decent. As she begins falling she continues looking and Erin when the walls of Kerri's stomach collapse on her again. This time Jessica thought she saw a green looking liquid just before the walls collapsed. Less than a second later the walls open up again and Erin is gone. Before Jessica can respond Kerri's throat closes around her and shoots her down into the stomach her friend was just digested in. Immediately upon entering Kerri's stomach it turns hostile and turns Jessica and Julianne into a nutritious soup squishing through her intestines along with Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit Kerri, you knew I was going to eat Erin tonight.\u201d Malinda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry mom.\u201d She replies. \u201cYou know how I get when I am hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry about it. I will just have to find a replacement meal.\u201d She says rubbing her bulging belly. \u201cMaybe the one I already have in here. Or maybe even you.\u201d She looks over at  Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on mom. Kerri is the one who ate Erin not me.\u201d  Natalie says.</span></div></div>",

I really need to get in that bathroom but I want to wait till she leaves.\u201d Kerri says rubbing her lower abdomen. As if on cue.

Do you need a time out.\u201d Malinda says rubbing her flat middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo we don't.\u201d The girls say in unison. As they sit there Kayla's belly continues to smooth out and the bulge shrinks and moves lower. She gets up and heads for the toilets. Once she is in the bathroom people move about to get better spots before she finishes and heads for the door.  One girl, a rather short girl waves a small group as she heads for the door. Not looking where she is going another woman gets up to maybe head her off before she reaches the door and places herself in the small girls path. She opens her mouth and waits. At the last second the girl turns around and is looking down a dark throat. Without think she opens her mouth even wider and sucks the woman down her throat. The larger woman barely makes a bulge as she travels to the girls stomach. She waves to her friends again as her stomach rumbles to claim her new meal. When she arrives at the door to gather her clothes, a new group of girls arrives lead by a tall blonde with hair down to her knees, large double d breasts and a ample waist. The small girl pauses but the new arrivals pay no attention to her. The three girl with the new tall girl are in stark contrast to her and oddly enough appear to be identical triplets. All about 5 feet tall with short dark hair and maybe b cup breasts. To say they were petite would almost be an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marie, I was hoping you would be here tonight.\" the tall blonde says moving towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crystal, I haven't seen you in ages.\" Marie says as the to women embrace. \"Are these your cousins?

At this point she doesn't care and continues to let her belly have her daughter, and in fact she doesn't even think of Stacey any more, and really she shouldn't, I mean her friends are already gone.</span></div></div>",

All she is doing now is scanning the room for an unsuspecting morsel, and she spots a very convenient meal across the room, who happens to be in the middle of orally pleasuring her neighbor.

On the other end of the room, a luscious blond-haired lass is bent over in front of a chair, too busy pleasuring the buxom brunette sitting on it to notice Natalie approaching from behind. The blond's legs are conveniently placed aside each other, providing an easy place to begin swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the distance is closed, Natalie brings her head down to the ground, level with the blond's feet, and opens her mouth wide in preparation. After stretching her jaw to a suitable level, she pushes forward while swallowing. In one quick gulp, Natalie engulfs the blond's legs up to the knees, and before she can react, Natalie brings her arms forward and grabs the blond's hands, holding her arms still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette on the chair, eyes closed to focus on the feelings of her lover's attentions, doesn't quite grasp what's going on as the blond suddenly begins squirming, determined to keep her to her task, the brunette closes her legs and places a hand on her head, holding her in place, which also blocks any of the blond's attempts to communicate, her voice muffled by her nethers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie grins as she sees the brunette unwittingly assisting her. She continues swallowing, pushing herself forward so that she won't end up pulling the blond away from the brunette. As Natalie swallows the girl's hips, a devious idea forms in her mind. Working quickly, Natalie pulls the blond's arms up against her sides, and swallows again, trapping the blond's arms with her mouth. She then reaches for the brunette's feet and pulls together, pressing the brunette's legs against the sides of the blond. She then makes another quick swallow, making the brunette join the blond as Natalie's meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now the brunette figures that something is wrong, and opens her eyes. She gasps at the sight of Natalie, her lips crawling up her partner's belly. She attempts to free her blond friend by spreading her legs, but only manages to tug against Natalie's throat a little with her feet. Picking up the pace, Natalie begins swallowing hard, and in only a few gulps Natalie works her way up to the brunette's waist, completely engulfing the blond in the process. As Natalie works her way up, the brunette tries to push against Natalie's head, but Natalie takes the opportunity to grab her arms and guide them into her mouth. With all limps trapped, Natalie has little but ineffective squirms to deal with as she continues her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more gulps, Natalie finishes off her double meal, and after the two girls settle down into her gurgling stomach, Natalie rises up and takes her place at the chair she just removed the couple from. For a few minutes, Natalie enjoys the couple struggling within her, but soon hunger takes over, and Natalie allows her digestive tract to begin it's work. As Natalie relaxes, the two girls struggle harder than ever before as they feel the sting of the stomach's acids, but within moments the struggles die out as Natalie's stomach squeezes and churns, quickly turning the two tasty girls within into a thick pool of nutrients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Natalie's bulging belly shrinks away, gurgling loudly, quite a few of the women around take notice and move away, not wanting to be within reach of her. Natalie watches amused as one unfortunate woman backs away, not quite paying attention to where she's moving, the woman's heart skips a beat as she bumps her back against someone else, someone... large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla, who had finished digesting her meals as Natalie was busy swallowing the two girls, was on her way to the bathroom, she wasn't quite ready to squeeze her digested meals out, but she knew that she would be very soon. She hadn't expected anybody to approach her on the way, so being bumped was quite a surprise, a very welcome one. Unsurprisingly, she grabbed the woman and speedily swallowed her down as she still moved to the bathroom. The poor woman was dissolved with haste as soon as she entered the stomach, as it was already filled with powerful acids that were busy breaking down what was left of Kerri. Natalie takes note that it would probably be best to hold off on visiting the bathroom until she knows that Kayla has left.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By now, Malinda's digestive tract has finished with Marie and Stacey, packing what's left of them tightly in her rectum. However, she's not quite ready to relieve herself of them, having been paying attention to Kayla's movements she knows it's not safe to be anywhere near the bathrooms at the moment. Scanning the room, Malinda looks around for something to get her mind off of the pressure below coming from her former daughter and the TA's rather insistent attempts to take their leave of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, she notices some friends of hers gathered around a table in a neighboring room, Closest to her is Pauline Goff, a chatty brown-haired woman, it's her information spreading that raises awareness among the vores around town about this club. But not everyone appreciates that, as she keeps attracting the types of girls that kick and scream if someone swallows them without consent, and even though nobody in the club will help, it's very annoying and it raises the chances of attracting the attention of those outside. Plus there's always the risk that she will unwittingly leak the info to someone who would see to putting an end to these meetings entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the left of Pauline is Anita Moreno, a woman from Spain who's become well accustomed to local culture and the English language, if it weren't for her somewhat stereotypical appearance and accent, it would be near impossible to tell that she wasn't raised in this nation. It's quite a long story how she got to know vore and made herself known to the other women here. She's very offended by those who try to pin stereotypes on her, those who do usually go through her personal brand of education, which proves effective, as the remains in the sewer never discriminate among each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext along the table is Monica Whitley, a businesswoman type, a combination of natural talent and being trained at a very young age by her mother has left her highly skilled with vore. Her talent went mostly unused, as the thought of consuming another person was very unappealing to her. After moving out, she landed a job working in the offices of a very large corporation, she worked her way up to quite a high position, until she was suddenly fired after a rival coworker had framed her for being the one causing many problems around the office, so that she could take the promotion that was undoubtedly going to be Monica's. Something snapped in her that day, and her coworker found herself too busy becoming a pile of Monica shit to show up to work the next day. She had met Malinda soon after that, who helped her come to terms with what she really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd last, but not least of Malinda's friends was Bethany Williams, her incredibly sexy figure, lewd attitude, and habits in bed have earned her the nickname \"Black Widow\" among those that know her. Man or woman, vore or nonvore, anyone that she pleasures ends up as a post-sex snack. A little \"fooling around\" isn't uncommon at the club, so until the attendees caught on to her quirk, many vores have ended up digesting away in her taut belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso among them is a young woman Malinda knows as Olivia, a buxom redhead that seems to enjoy the sight of someone swallowing almost as much as having a meal herself, there's no doubt that she's probably trying to set up some kind of game as an attempt to get an up close view of some vore action. Curious, Malinda decides to approach, desiring to at least know what sort of game Olivia is planning to make her lose friends over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Malinda makes her way to the table, she notices that Olivia is shuffling a deck of cards as she explains what seem to be game rules, but Malinda can't understand any of them, having missed most of the explanation. Soon Olivia notices Malinda standing nearby, and pauses her explanation. \"Ooh! Welcome Malinda.\" Olivia says. \"I didn't think you were here since I haven't seen any of your girls around, shall I repeat the rules for you?\" Pauline groans in annoyance, the rules for this game must take a while to explain, and Pauline was always the impatient type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I don't plan on getting digested because of a \"lucky\" roll of the dice or dealing of the cards from you.\" Malinda not so politely refuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself sweetie.\" Olivia says, grinning. Malinda recognizes that grin, it always means she knows something she isn't going to point out. \"But feel free to watch if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't suppose it will hurt to watch you girls eat each other because of cards.\" Malinda says as she pulls up a chair, sitting next to Olivia. Picking up where she left off, Olivia goes back to explaining the rules of the game to the women, which soon she finishes, and begins dealing cards among the players.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaying attention to the game, it appears that the women are playing a variation of old maid. As the players take cards one at a time from each other, placing pairs on the table as they receive them, Malinda can't help but wonder just what kind of a twist Olivia has put in the game. The game goes on relatively normal until Monica suddenly giggles as she removes a pair of queens from her hand, placing into onto the table for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queens!\" Monica announces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spades and diamonds.\" Olivia says, pointing out the two suits that Monica's queens belong to. \"So which one do you choose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hearts. And I know you have it Beth, you took it from me two turns ago.\" Monica says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany giggles, taking the queen of hearts out of her deck and showing it to everyone. After everyone confirms that she had the queen of hearts, they all place their cards onto the table. Olivia quickly gathers them up while discarding the queen of hearts. While she does this, has been raising her legs, presenting them to Monica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica takes Bethany's feet and eagerly pulls them into her mouth, as she slowly swallows Bethany, savoring her taste. Olivia watches to the two closely while shuffling the deck of cards at the same time, Olivia must be quite good with cards to accomplish that without paying attention. By now, Monica's lips creep over Bethany's waist, her tongue rolling around, tasting every bit of flesh it can access.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, yes! Eat me while you eat me!\" Bethany coos as Monica's tongue briefly rolls over vagina. Despite being the one doing the eating, Monica is a little freaked out given Bethany's reputation, so she immediately ends her tongue play and quickly swallows her meal down, and after a few large swallows, Bethany's trim belly disappears into Monica's throat, followed by her plump breasts, and finally her head and shoulders pass through the lips. Monica's stomach shrinks away as soon as Bethany is secured within, the speed of which is shrinks, along with the lack of struggling within show that Monica is simply utilizing hiding techniques, allowing herself to sit at the table without a bulging, woman-filled belly being in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that was the warmup round.\" Olivia points out. \"We're playing for keeps now!\" She says excitedly as she deals out the cards once again. The game goes as normal once again, with the girls taking a card one at a time from each other, discarding pairs as normal. Quite some time passes until an almost ecstatic look comes over Pauline as soon as she takes a card from Olivia's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queens!\" Pauline announces happily, showing off the queens of diamonds and clubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia grins. \"Who has the last queen? If I had it, I would have said so before Pauline took mine.\" She says with a slightly devious tone of voice. Everyone shows their hands, and complaints are voiced as nobody has the queen of spades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever had it must have hidden it!\" Pauline points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never hid anything! Monica can say so, she had her eyes on my cards the whole time!\" Anita claims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your cards?\" Olivia questions. \"She was staring at your tits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way she was looking at my cards!\" Anita points out. \"Malinda, you were watching us, did you see the queen of spades pass by you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't really paying attention for it, but I don't think I ever saw it.\" Malinda says. \"I'm a third party though, I can look for it.\" She says as she gets up off her seat.</span></div></div>",

She wonders how the hell it got there without her feeling it. She suspects that Olivia had something to do with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olivia! How did you do tha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything!\" Olivia says, interrupting Malinda. \"You all saw me deal the cards, my hands weren't anywhere near those bouncy tits of hers.\" To Malinda's horror, everyone agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares!\" Pauline says as she gets up. \"We can waste time playing CSI: Game Room, or I could just eat the bitch that had the queen!\" Pauline says, impatient as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalinda was about to break into a run, but Olivia, always a step ahead grabs her leg, causing Malinda to fall over. As she tries to get back up, hands suddenly grab her at her shoulders and pull her up. As she raises her head upwards she barely gets a look at Pauline's open mouth as her head and shoulders are pulled inside it. Pauline greedily devours her meal, pausing only for a moment to squeeze her breasts inside, after they're dealt with, Malinda goes down smoothly, and in only a few moments Monica is squeezed into Pauline's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalinda doesn't even have a moment to properly orient herself before the stomach begins to churn and secrete acids, the girls eye Pauline's belly as it's occupant thrashes about, sending the bulging orb sticking out of Pauline bouncing about. After a moment of struggling, Pauline's belly stops moving and smooths out, the enzymes having made short work of Malinda's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish you kept her alive longer, I love watching a strong struggler.\" Olivia comments as she approaches Pauline, placing a hand on her belly to feel the lumps of Malinda's flesh dissolve away. \"Anyway, I gotta run. I hope you girls had fun!\" See adds as she hastily makes her leave. As soon as she's out of line of sight of the women, she brings her hand downward, slipping a few fingers into her vagina. She can't help but moan a little as she opens her vagina as wide as she can, and pulls a rolled up queen of spades out. \"Nobody ever bothers to look there.\" She says, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The perfect crime.\" Olivia thinks to herself, having slipped an extra queen of spades onto Malinda earlier today, a relatively simple task to accomplish while she was busy digesting her daughter, that woman was always oblivious to what was going on around her when enjoying a meal. Then she gathered all of her eager friends for a game, knowing that Malinda couldn't help but at least sit by and watch, after that, all she had to do was rig the game to make sure that neither herself or Pauline were eaten in the warmup round. But the payoff was great, she always wanted to watch somebody devour those plump tits of hers, although it would have been better if Pauline wasn't so hasty with her devouring, but it was necessary to have her get the queens, as she was always the impatient type, anyone else might have wanted to keep looking for whoever slipped the card onto Malinda.</span></div></div>",

This realization is in no way a deterrent to Natalie's desire to feed however, so she continues looking around the room for a different potential meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Natalie spots her target, an attractive middle-aged woman standing lone near the entrance, with long, somewhat curly black hair, sizable breasts pushing visibly against her tight green sweater, and rather plump hips fit snugly into a pair of jeans. Natalie stares hungrily, trying to form a plan of getting this woman into her gurgling stomach. Perhaps she'll try to get behind her and take her by surprise, or she could try seduction in an attempt to strip her tasty flesh of her garments before consumption. \"Or maybe she'll just let me have her if I ask really, really nicely.\" Natalie jokingly thinks to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thought, Natalie reasons that the woman's just arrived, seeing as she's still in full, dry clothing, and since Natalie's never seen that woman before, she assumes that she's new to these gatherings. So she quickly forms a simple plan, simply walk up to the woman under the guise of a welcomer, and down her as soon as she lets her guard down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looks over the girls in the room, she hasn't attended in many weeks so she looks forward to meeting all the new attendees, while also keeping an eye out for any of her old friends on the off chance that any of them haven't yet taken the tour of some girl's intestines. As the looks over the crowd, she notices a naked girl approaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, she sees me, no turning back now, just play it cool, act friendly.\" Natalie thinks to herself, trying to keep her cool as she approaches the new woman. As she gets within distance, she extends her hand in greetings. \"Hey there! Welcome to the club, I'm Natalie, who're yo-\" Natalie is interrupted as the woman quickly grabs her hand, pulls it into her mouth, and swallows. Natalie only has time to let out a quick gasp before the woman quickly moves her hands behind her head and pulls it into her mouth, and then quickly follows it up by sucking the rest of the girl into her mouth. The woman takes a moment to taste the meal within her mouth a bit, throwing her about with her tongue before swallowing, sending the well-hidden girl traveling down the woman's throat, visible only through a tiny bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Candice.\" The woman utters slyly under her breath as Natalie is deposited in her stomach, which doesn't bulge out, not even a tiny bit, showing off, or rather not showing off the woman's staggeringly large amount of vore experience. Candice gives her flat belly a little rub, deciding to allow her meal to remain whole and alive within, for now, at least.</span></div></div>",

As Candice screamed, Natalie did so too, out of fear and surprise as the stomach immediately became hostile, the powerful acids and churning dissolve Natalie within seconds. The sound of Candice's moans drown out the churning of her stomach as it draws the liquefied remains of Natalie into the intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Candice pants in the afterglow of her orgasm, Malinda crawls onto the bed on top of Candice and embraces the woman in a deep kiss. After a moment, knowing exactly what Malinda wants, Candice leans upward and stretches her mouth open, Malinda responds by pushing forward into her throat. After taking a moment to taste her lover, Candice begins swallowing slowly, making sure to taste and please Malinda as she travels down into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being swallowed, Malinda happily curls up inside Candice's empty stomach, unaware that her daughter had just passed through, and is currently below her, now a turd being packed into the colon, ready for expulsion. Unlike Natalie, Malinda is sure that Candice would never do anything to harm her, and welcomes her stay inside of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Candice lays on the bed, allowing her belly to expand, Malinda's form easily recognizable within the bulge. After taking a moment to catch her breath, Candice gets off the bed, and makes her way to the bathroom to dispose of Natalie.</span></div></div>",

Powerful young redhead?\" Malinda asks hopingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice stops for a brief moment, \"That Kayla? The one who always comes to these things and digests everybody she meets?\" she pauses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalinda responds, \"Yeah that one, well she was just finishing her digestion before you got here, so she is probably in the bathroom, might want to wait that one out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha. I guess girl-turd will have to wait.\" Candice giggles as she sits her unclothed posterior on one of the many couches that line the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalinda laughs, \" You don't even remember your last meal's name? That is just so like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice honestly couldn't remember the poor turd's name, she knew it was one of Malinda's daughters, but she wasn't about to tell her glorious lover that, not that would ultimately matter now. Just then a group of three very young girls walk by laughing, and one sporting a very large in comparison to her skinny body size, round protruding bulge that was shrinking by the moment. Headed to the bathroom. Candice just shakes her head and smiles to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice passes the time by rubbing her fully distended belly, and keeping a watchful eye out for any would be predators, it is long before Kayla barges through the bathroom door, catches a startled girl who was walking by, and shoves her down her gullet into her displayed freckled chest, where the girl joined the other meals in her belly, before heading straight for the door, her prideful belly set outward jiggling with her strut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice simply stepped up from her comfy seat and then made her way into the bathroom, she noticed all four of the stalls were empty, \"Kayla really cleaned house.\" She said aloud. Then she stopped as she felt a bang on the inside of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Malinda caught Candice's attention good, \"You mind letting me out? I just remembered I gotta go too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice, considered letting her out the natural way and smiled, before responding; \"Sure thing, coming right up! But you have to promise me one thing, you have to get back in afterward!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalinda responded, \" Sure thing, you know I wouldn't pass that up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice focused on her inner muscles as the bulge in her belly pushed upwards expanding her ribcage and her well developed chest expanded outwards as Malinda was pushed up into her now bulging throat and first out of Candice's mouth was Malinda's bare feet, followed by her slender glistening legs, her grown womanly hips and waist, then her pert breasts with her nipples erect, wet with the liquids of Candice's innards then came Malinda's gasping, and moaning mouth and face and last her arms, and she landed on the ground standing straight up. \"I hope you don't mind, I decided to leave my clothes in there.\" Malinda smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind at all,\" Candice responded in a seductive tone looking over Malinda's shining body. \"I think eating all these young girls really does keep us looking younger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Is all Malinda says with a huge grin on her face before she turns to the stall door. \"Sorry, really gotta go.\" Before she steps in, and locks the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice then turns to her own stall and makes her way in. Both women already pant-less, waste no time in sitting on the seat and letting the urine flow, each can hear the other, as each one begins to let one turd after another fall into the custom designed toilets. Malinda strains a few times and Candice chuckles as she hears her grunt. Shortly after Candice finishes and exits the stall,  and heads to the sinks. When she's done cleaning up she notices Malinda isn't finished yet. \"Geeze, girl, what did you eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalinda finishes up shortly after and after an audible flush after disposing of her daughter and Stacy, walks out from the stall, heading for the sink. \"Sorry but I had a few girls.\" she deviously smiled. \" Hey I have an idea, how about instead of you eating me again, we go find a meal each to ourselves in the party, and then see who can make the other digest first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice considers the idea for a moment.</span></div></div>",

She considered playing with her for a moment, but decided that she would much rather fill her belly instead as she took her arms and sucked the entire woman into her mouth in one quick motion. With Malinda completely inside her, Candice walks back to her seat, playing and teasing the treat inside her mouth as she moved, exploring every little bit of her tasty treat with her slick tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes pass with Candice thrashing the miniature Malinda, who enjoyed every moment of the slick muscle's attentions. Until another woman approaches, calling out to her with a bold \"Oh, hello there!\".

Everybody finds me too delicious to digest, they just gotta keep me around to taste again.\" She says confidently. \"Well, except maybe Kayla.\" She adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a dangerous claim to make, what if they find someone even tastier?\" Candice points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's gotten me this far.\" Cindy says, shrugging as she takes a seat next to Candice. \"Anyway, I'm guessing Malinda's in there.\" She says, giving Candice's flat belly a poke. \"I saw her with you a moment ago, turned away for a sec, and then she was gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, and I believe that she may enjoy the company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well, I'm not going in there, if that's what you're asking.\" Cindy says. \"Mary wants me around for something she's got planned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't asking.\" Candice says as she grabs the girl and pulls her into her mouth, swallowing the tasty treat in a single gulp, which travels down her throat as another tight, almost unnoticeable bulge. As the girl is deposited into her stomach, Candice thinks for a moment, trying to decide what she shall do next as she rubs her belly, feeling the two women within moving about.</span></div></div>",

So Candice makes her through a few groups of people and into the bathroom only to knock on all the stalls each and find each occupied. She crosses her arms in patience as she feels more of Natalie eek her way into her rear end. For a mere second she considers digesting Malinda here too, but reconsiders, and then rubs her belly again and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer moment of fun is interrupted though by the bathroom door opening and laughter as three girls with obviously very low belly bulges, 'Ugh,' Candice thinks to herself, \"These bathrooms are packed tonight, there wasn't always this much digestion, must be more vores around these days...\" The four patient women wait for any stall to open up, and Candice notices one blonde girl with an exceptionally large bulge especially considering her very slender thin frame, squirming as she continues to hold back nature's call. Then she hears a flush as a stall door opens up and a stark naked brunette casually leaves the bathroom. Candice eyes wonder before she steps towards it, only for the squirming girl to beat her to it. The stall door closes, her presumed friends talk amongst themselves, \"Allison really needed to go!\" the shorter one says. Candice hears a great sigh of relief, and for a moment agrees with the friend, before she is reminded that Natalie really wants out, and she looks down at her squirming belly again. Interrupting her thought process however the taller girl asks, \"Hey aren't you going to digest that one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice smiles and replies, \"Oh, no, she's my lover, there's already a meal wanting out of my backside.\" as she says this Malinda squirms in ecstasy again, Candice pats her tummy, and hears another flush. \"Do you guys mind?\" Both girls shake their heads and Candice steps towards the stall.<br>\r\nA brash looking redhead in the near nude steps out from the stall, and her lips curl into a smile as she sees the three girls. \"Mmmm... Desert.\"<br>\r\nCandice recognizes the girl but even with her experience her reaction is too late, as Kayla full of her massive meal's energy gulps down the black-haired woman, her tongue slides over her sweater, and her shapely full-grown hips, Kayla happy that she refrained from re-clothing her lower half, but in split seconds Candice is in Kayla's gaping belly. The other two girls have began to rush to the door silently but quickly, but Kayla doesn't skip a beat, as she expands her mouth over top of one girl and her arms grasp at the other, and soon enough Kayla has another three meals. At that moment, Kayla hears another flush and a rather young looking but somewhat shapely blonde steps out. She doesn't even get a fighting chance as she lets out a yelp, before joining the other three parts of Kayla's desert. Afterward Kayla, quite content pulls the door handle and steps out, deciding to hold her deserts for pleasure until she gets home.</span></div></div>",

As the contents jiggle, Candice is relieved to find that Kayla hasn't digested her and her belly mates yet. She says, \"It looks like we're luck girls, Kayla is going home with us. That means we might still have a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so? When she gets home we're still going to be Kayla shit.\" one girl remarks.<br>\r\n\"Well, this isn't the first time I've been in a situation like this, in fact I've done extensive training in avoiding that very fate. I have should enough know-how and strength to push ever so delicately on the opening of Kayla's esophagus, to get us all up and out of here. There is just one thing, I need you guys to push me through first, afterward her throat will be open enough for you all to follow me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA different girl responds, \"OK, so you push on her throat? And we push you up and follow?\"<br>\r\nCandice responds in a low tone, \"Yes, we need to do this quick, once she feels us, the attempt will probably fail.\" Candice then shifts herself around. \" Ok, the three of you find my ass, when I say 'go' squeeze hard and push. A little awkwardly the three unlikely allies find the woman's bare and still Natalie filled bottom, and put their hands in place. Candice, concentrates hard as she fingers the opening above her, and as she does so she pushes Malinda, still unaware of the situation, further into her body, so that she will have more room to work with. Once she finds the correct muscles to push, she presses hard with both hands through the opening, kneading the esophagus walls, being careful to not move too fast. Then she feels the push from below as the girls pushed Candice up, a little too strongly, as Candice is forced quickly up to her chest and then waist into Kayla's neck, she hadn't told them to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla of course notices, as a huge bulge appears in her throat, and she feels whatever is causing it continue upwards. She stops dead in her tracks, and begins furiously swallowing, the first swallow reverses Candice's actions rapidly forcing the woman's toned abdomen back into the stomach followed by her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace now realizing the dire situation yells, \"GO!\" And with another forceful heave, the girls force Candace back up. Kayla coughs, as her swallowing goes in reverse briefly, then she swallows hard again. She then smiles as she begins to let her stomach secrete acids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry!\" one girl yells at Candice, \"It's getting wet down here!\" Candace kneeds the swallowing muscles as she makes her ascent, soon her thighs are pushed in, followed by her feet, another girl's hands gripping them tightly. Forced to heave over now, Kayla still fursiously trying to swallow Candice back down. Her hands grip her belly hard. Candice's hands are in Kayla's mouth now, at this moment she feels the grip on her hands loosen, as she hears screams below. She assumes the worst as she reacts fast pushing her hands out of Kayla's mouth and pulling herself up by gripping the top and bottom of the redhead's mouth. Kayla tries to swallow one last time, but Candice's head is already out of her mouth, Kayla reacts to this by pushing back on Candice with her own arms, but fails again as with one big pull and then push out, Candice's breasts force their way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla heaves as Candice pushes on Kayla's windpipe with her feet, and then finishes finishes her escape, her wet body glistening as she lands on the floor, and a gasping Kayla, trying to recoup doesn't notice as a very tall blonde girl had been watching the scene with predatory intent. She opens her mouth wide and devours Kayla, bare ass first. The blonde woman then reaches down to Candice, as Candice turns around, and is greeted with a hand, she gladly accepts it, and she pulls hard.<br>\r\nThe blonde then pulls as she helps the soaked Candice to her feet. \"Hey, nice one, never seen anyone get out of Kayla before, at least not that way.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Is about all the exhausted woman can muster. <br>\r\nThe blonde smiles, \"Whats your name? I don't think I've seen you here before.\" <br>\r\nCandice glances at her bouncing taut belly, as Kayla continues to struggle within, \"My name's Candice, what yours?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, my name is Julie, I don't plan on eating you, if you were worried. and it's not likely you'd stay down anyways.\"<br>\r\nAs Candice calms down, her body reminds her fervently, that a once young girl is still trying to get out of her. \"Sorry, but I have some unfinished business that your meal interrupted.\"<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself.\" the blonde smiles again, and holds her belly up with both hands, jiggling it's<br>\r\n Kayla-contents.<br>\r\nCandice proceeds to give Malinda some breathing room as she turns around and quickly runs to the bathroom. She pushes her way through the door, and into one of the empty stalls, finding that only one was occupied, with who she assumed was Allison, she will not be pleased to hear the fate of her friends. She makes short work of her three Natalie turds, her experienced digestive system effectively minimizing and compacting it's meals. Once done she exits the stall, and says to her belly, \" Hey Malinda, you might want to see this, so you're coming out.\"<br>\r\nMalinda retorts, \"Awww, ok i guess.\" Shortly thereafter Malinda is back out of the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back out on the party floor Julie is making a little show herself. \"So do you all think i should digest her or not?\"<br>\r\nA resounding cheer follows with a loud almost unanimous \"Digest!\"<br>\r\n\"I would be honored,\" is what Julie answers, and soon Kayla's struggles cease as Julie's belly smooths.<br>\r\nMalinda and Candice make their way out just in time to see guest cheering and simultaneously getting off at the sight of Julie's belly shift lower as Kayla is drained into the intestines. Not long thereafter, Julie makes her way past Candice and Malinda as she too enters the bathroom, Kayla and her unnamed digested occupants, and their own unnamed digested occupants, all begging to be let back out. Julie is only happy to oblige them. Candice explains the situation while the club not so silently awaits the return of the blonde showstopper. A little while later Julie, opens the bathroom door back up to be welcomed with cheers, \"That took a little longer than I expected Candice, did she have a few other occupants?\" Candice only responds with a smile and nod, before turning back  to Malinda.</span></div></div>",

She was going to hold it and take in the crowd's enthusiasm, but she felt Malinda squirm, and she smiled deviously, as she turned to go to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom was vacated before her arrival per usual, and she made her way into a stall hurriedly leaving the door ajar, she couldn't wait much longer, and sat down on the porcelain, and leaned back to give her Malinda-filled belly some room. Meanwhile on the inside Malinda was feeling her daughter's liquefied remains emptying the stomach, but was surprised when new acids didn't take their place. \"Hey Malinda, few people get to know their true future or fate.\" Kayla spoke to her stall-filling bulge. All Malinda could respond with were what equated to muffled noises almost akin to gurgles, as she spoke through her tight confines. Her own Stacey and Marie filled belly squishing her even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well here comes your future!\" Kayla exclaims, then moans as a rather large mass is pushed out in between her light skinned cheeks, followed by a flood of urine. Kayla relishes in Malinda's very apparent squirming as she could easily hear the splash and the hiss. \"Oh looky, another one!\" This time Kayla grunts as another larger mass is pushed out and floats the bottom of the bowl. Shortly followed by another even larger mass. Kayla feels another one start coming out but stops herself just in time. \"Oops I almost clogged it!\" She smiled as she rubbed her belly again taking pleasure in Malinda's struggles, and feeling the energy flowing in through her body from Kerri's absorbed and now solidifying remains. She then flushes the toilet, and prepares again, and then pushes hard on the largest one yet. It falls with a massive splash into the now empty toilet bowl followed in succession with another two smaller ones, that she didn't even have to push out. \"Oooh,\" Kayla then sighs in relief as she feels another move in. It doesn't stay long before it too is pushed out to join the rest. She begins pissing again as she speaks to Malinda again, \"Thanks again for the extra portion, I think that last splash was it.\" With this Kayla then lets her digestion run it's course, dissolving Malinda and her digesting meals in a matter of seconds. With a gurgle Malinda begins her decent through Kayla's innards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla closes her eyes in enjoyment as her body absorbs the last three, when her eyes open suddenly. \"Guess I was wrong here comes that extra helping now!\" With this she lets go another decent sized turd that would account for Kerri and her digested meals. From this point on she sped up Malinda's digestion. She turned and flushed another time for good measure before she heard a noise. The bathroom door opening, she remained as quiet as possible as she heard footsteps approaching. Then the door was pushed open, and much to Kayla's amusement was a very surprised Natalie rubbing a distended belly. This was one of Kayla's lesser known tactics, leave the door ajar so that she might be lucky enough to have someone think that the stall was empty, as usually girls at these things would be in a big hurry to do their business and get back out to the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla however doesn't waste any time before pushing herself from the toilet seat and opening her mouth onto the surprised girl. Natalie lifts her arms up and pushes onto Kayla's chest in some attempt to push her off, but is immediately distracted by Kayla's very erect nipples, and in this split second of distraction Kayla slurps Natalie up to her own naked breasts followed up closely by her distended gut, then Kayla's freckled cheeks spread out as she swallowed Natalie's young but shapely hips, then her wriggling legs. Finishing her desert Kayla then sat back down. \"Well, you're in luck Natalie! Mama was just about to leave, it would be tragedy for you to miss her!\" With her sadistic disposition Kayla then squeezed hard as a few smaller less compacted turds made loud quick splashes as they fell from her ass. \"You're next!\" and with a final rub of her struggling belly, \"Kayla let her body have at Natalie and it wasn't long before she and her captive were added to the toilet. Finally done, Kayla then wiped, flushed, washed up and left the bathroom. Kayla is somewhat displeased that no one got in her way on the way out, and her drive home was uneventful, but she had, had a great night, she was quite happy, and she would be, until her stomach started growling again. She couldn't wait until next week's Vorgy!</span></div></div>",

In event of all of this attention Kayla felt nearly all-powerful as she bowed and turned to return to her throne, she planned to digest Malinda slowly, even though she could feel the remains of the first 12 girls beginning to reach their end, and Kerri wasn't far behind, as her nutrients could be felt from throughout her body, Kayla of course didn't care who was who, or what was what of her now digested victims. But Malinda was special, she was a very experienced and powerfully recognized vore, she was a well known independent researcher, and had collaborated with local university programs, and now she was struggling in her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe faced her audience on all sides of the room taking in all of their own<br>\r\ncollective enjoyment as her own. She sat upon the chair in the center of the room and closed her eyes and moaned in pleasure for her audience, cupping her fully expanded belly from underneath and stroking her hands upwards, and then downwards. She herself began to get into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla being the powerful predator that she was at this point left herself completely vulnerable, and for a fraction of a second Kayla considered this but it was dismissed fast as she groped her breasts with her right hand feeling her hard pointed nipples. This moment of vulnerability was exploited by a girl most affected by this powerfully exorbitant woman relishing her prideful victory, Natalie. Though she was the youngest, she was only by a slim margin at the age of 18, her sisters barely older, she was in no way less experienced than them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case the scorned and hungry young woman stealthily approached the redhead, whose head was now leaned back as she nearly screamed in pleasure with her hair flowing freely and dangling from her vulnerable scalp. Natalie, reacted fast, she knew she would only have a few seconds to do this on the far more powerful Kayla, and Natalie stretched her mouth wide on Kayla's face and gulped hard. Kayla moaned again, but the sound Kayla heard back echoed around her skull, and at this moment she felt a hard wet pressure pushing down on her head.<br>\r\nShe reacted immediately by using her very flexible leg to kick her devourer, only to be met with the resistance of her lower belly filled with the digesting and digested remnants of Malinda, Kerri, Marie, Stacey, Julianne, Erin, Jessica, and the twelve other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla then attempted to struggle with her arms but the vengeful Natalie had already swallowed enough to pin them to her sides, Kayla queen of the vorgy was done for. Natalie quickly gulped four more times, and the audience watched as the young woman's throat expanded and then retracted as more of Kayla traveled into her belly. Natalie with a very full stomach, let her body have at the redheaded meat, and sat upon her meal's throne in the center of the room, her undying hunger satiated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would not make the same mistake as Kayla and kept a keen view of the room around her as the festivities of the event continued to take place around her, the constant sounds of the<br>\r\nbathroom door shutting and closing. No one even made an attempt upon her as she digested.<br>\r\nSoon enough Natalie felt the first of the former queen begging to be let out of her final prison, and Natalie full of the digested energy of her meals wearily made her way to the bathroom, before lowering herself upon the toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to let her out before she decided that she would wait until all of her had made it to the end, she would leave how she entered, in one piece. Natalie smiled, but then grimaced as the pressure in both her bowels and bladder increased to painful levels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tortured herself for an agonizing fifteen minutes more before she really couldn't take it anymore and her body let go, and Natalie sighed in relief as a constant stream of feces and urine flooded the bowl, the toilets in this building were purposely designed for a vorgy and allowed for enormously large meals but even this one couldn't contain the massive requirements of twenty digested women, and Natalie regrettably was forced to flush once during a small break in the stream, she knew she wouldn't be able to tell the difference from her family and the rest of the digested remains but she intended to wait a moment in silence as she looked upon the remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until the pressure built up again and she felt her lower belly finish emptying into her bowels that she flushed and immediately sat again, and the last remains slid from her young body bit by bit until she wiped, flushed, and was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what remained was what to do next, she had avenged her fallen family and had garnered some respect from the local vores, her mother had encouraged her and her sisters to attend a local university in order to study vore, but Kerri and Marie always insisted they didn't need any further education in that regard, and Natalie had reluctantly followed suit.</span></div></div>",

Her large grin slowly faded away into a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How has it been going with the advanced vore classes?\" Jessica asked, awkwardly putting her arms to her side. \"You've been able to get a car into that gut of your's yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, yeah, the professor said the only way to increase capabilities is to eat more, so I've been pretty busy at that. Trying to ace the course, and the only way to do that is to fully digest large things.\" Erin said, her neck craned to meet Jessica's gaze. She was backpedaling away from her towards the car, the two other TA's still inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You managed to actually do it?! How many people a day does she have you digesting a day to accomplish that?\" Jessica asked, surprise evident on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As many as I can, but professor said a minimum of fifty, that's what I was working on before you arrived. Spent the last hour or so clearing out the club, and I was just about to start on the locals in this neighborhood.\" She patted her taut stomach. \"Got about thirty so far, but between the surrounding area and the late comers to the club, I think I'll make my quota.\" Erin said, standing in front of Jessica's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thirty? That could keep me fed for a month, if I don't binge.\" Jessica said, a look of slight disappointment on her face. \"Not really the most pragmatic approach to feeding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose not.\" Erin said turning towards the car. \"But the results aren't exactly the most pragmatic approaches towards feeding themselves. It's kind of like a parallel thing.\" With that, Erin bent forward, exposing her tight, surprisingly large rear to Jessica, and went at a ninety degree angle. Her attractive face stretched impossibly wide as she engulfed the front of Jessica's car. She swallowed, and with a groaning sound, the automobile lurched forward some 1.5 meters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin, what the fuck are you doing?!\" Jessica shouted in stunned bewilderment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin swallowed again in response, consuming the hood of the car, her lips on the windshield. Screams were heard from inside. The door on the passenger side flew open, but another gulp from Erin slammed it shut and brought in the car halfway. The back-left seat was thrown open as well, from which Stacy tried to jump out, but Erin once again swallowed. The door flew back into Stacy's leg, pinning her between the door and the car's frame. She screamed in pain as the steel contraption was dragged further into the minuscule body of the Asian woman before them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin then clenched her hands into fists and rose, taking the car with her such that the remaining bit of exposed car was perpendicular to the Earth. Then, she relaxed her esophagus. The car (and the still screaming Stacy) slid into her in a smooth motion. A slight bulge, similar to that of a three month pregnant woman's appeared in her midsection. She closed her lips and looked back to Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp.\" Erin practically stated as a wry grin grew across her face. It had taken fifteen seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin!\" Jessica exclaimed, snapping out of her shock, \"Let them out, let them out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin only looked down to her belly, and both women watched as the slight lump convulsed, shrunk, and shifted in about ten seconds. The diminutive girl lifted her leg slightly and farted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bad, steel always gives me gas.\" Erin said smiling. She began walking towards the house where the club was meant to be located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin, Stacy and Julianne are Blainey's TA's, and advanced students! She's going to be livid if you don't let them out!\" Jessica shouted, incredibly flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were Blainey's TA's, and I'm on my way to let them out right now.\" Erin stated smugly, continuing towards the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do that?\" Jessica said, her voice faltering, \"You already ate thirty fucking people Erin!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny girl turned around. \"Practice. Food. Because they tasted great.\" she said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were my friends.\" Jessica said, breaking out into a sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I thank you for bringing them to me.\" Erin replied, no hint of remorse on her words. \"Now get over yourself, I'm going to go shit your \"friends\" out. If I come back, and you've gotten a hold, we'll clear out the neighborhood together, like old times. If you're still here sitting like a hysterical mess, you can join them inside of me. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica thrusted her head into her hands at the thought of the loss of her good friend Julianne and her potentiality for friendship in Stacy. Erin rolled her eyes and walked away, once more breaking wind. Jessica watched her \"friend's\" ass slightly part as she did so. After a few seconds, Erin was inside, and Jessica was left with the smell. It was rank.</span></div></div>",

Do you know when it begins?\" Jessica asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it starts at seven tonight, will probably go on throughout the night, though we should arrive a couple hours late, by then they ought to have just enough alcohol in them to let us slip in, and enjoy a few.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so we'll meet at your place at nine, so you can take us there, is that okay with you?\" Stacey asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, we should get ready in the meantime.\" Julianne says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three young women part ways, and prepare for the party at their respective homes. And as 9 'o clock rolls around, Stacey and Jessica meet over at Julianne's place. Stacey and Julianne have dressed casually, while Jessica chose to leave little to the imagination, wearing some low-cut shorts, along with a loose tank top that reveals her cleavage nicely, tucked neatly into her shorts to hide the slight bulge in her belly that may remain when hiding a meal or two. After the three exchange their greetings, they make a bit of final preparations. After making sure they haven't forgotten anything, they all get In Julianne's car and head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're going to be doing all the talking.\" Stacey says as she gets an eyeful of Jessica's choice of apparel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you two were the ones who didn't dress for taking advantage of drunk, horny guys.\" Jessica comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because we don't have the assets for it.\" Julianne grunts as she drives. \"Just convince the guys to let us in, it'll be easy enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but after that, you two can seduce your own meals.\" Jessica says. \"I'm not just going to throw people into your gullets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the rest of the way, the three discuss a few code phrases, which will allow them to discuss vore while among others. And after agreeing on a good few, the three find themselves at a large house, many people inside partying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the place!\" Julianne says, parking nearby. As they approach the front door, Jessica takes the lead and knocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hello!\" A cute, slightly drunk guy opens the door, answering. \"What are you all doing here?\" Jessica notices the guy's eyes point straight to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here for the party, sweetie.\" Jessica says in a pleasant tone. \"Mind letting us in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course! Come on in!\" He says, stepping inside the let the three in. They quickly make their way past him and blend into the crowds, all along the house there are people sitting down at tables, having drinks, the girls expected for the majority of the party to be guys, but are surprised to see that there is about an even ratio between men and women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! That was easy!\" Jessica says, chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you so, the dolt didn't even ask our names!\" Julianne says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's the plan?\" Stacey says. \"Are we splitting up or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go find a nice guy to enjoy.\" Jessica says, meaning she's going for a meal. \"I'll leave you two to do whatever.\" She says, separating herself from the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to enjoy the party myself for a bit, maybe have a drink.\" Julianne says. \"Take care of yourself, Stacey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then.\" Stacey replies as Julianne wanders off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParting ways, the three women enjoy the party on their own for now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Julianne hadn't really thought about how she was going to get a meal here, it was a bit crowded, but she was sure that an opportunity would come if she waited for it. Well, that's why she went for a drink first. She walked casually toward where she saw people gathering around what appeared to be a long snack table, in the center was some sort of red punch and under to the table on the floor was a cooler full of beer. Julianne opted for the punch, she didn't want any chance of being tempted to get drunk, that might not end so well if she gets the urge to eat the first person she sees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pours out a cup, and is a bit startled as she hears her name, she turns around abruptly, and sees a couple, 'They don't seem familiar, ' Julianne says to herself as she looks them over, one guy who was kneeling down to grab a beer, while simultaneously holding the girl's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julianne?\" the woman goes on, \"Don't you remember me?\" She pauses briefly as Julianne scans her over, \"We were lab partners in biology?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne still couldn't remember the girl, there was nothing striking about her features, she just had black hair and nothing exotic rang about her, but one look at her presumed boyfriend, and Julianne was certain she would have remembered him if she had seen him before. Nonetheless, she faked remembering her, \"Oh yeah, I remember now, what was your name,\" she pauses, \" That was ages ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling now, the girl responded, \"Cassandra, but you always called me Cassy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne legitimately remembered now, it was 3 years ago, before she had even started studying vore, they had actually been pretty good friends before. Julianne had hardly thought about this, since she began studying vore, everything before had seemed useless, her relationships, her parents, school, everything. \"Yeah, Wow,\" Julianne mock held her head, her hand pushing up onto her forehead. \"We had some good times didn't we?\" She could remember countless parties like this one rush back into her memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we did!\" Cassy said as she gripped her presumed boyfriend's arm to her side. Cassy's disposition was certainly off-putting, Julianne had come here to eat random people she didn't know, not to chat up random old friends, but part of her really wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne casually continued, \"So who've you got here?\" She once again looked down Cassy's male companion, while taking another drink of the punch, the taste was a bit off, it might actually have had some alcohol in it, though not enough for it to effect many normal people, let alone Julianne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't recognize my boyfriend Daniel? This is his party!\" Cassy responded, finally taking the Daniel in question away from his beer and causing him to give Julianne a glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between drinks he simply said, \"Yeah, I specifically told Bruce not to let anyone in unless he knew em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne instantly remembered the drunk guy at the door, \"Yeah, well one of my friends has ways of persuasion,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy tugged at Daniel's hand, he responded again, \"I guess any friend of Cassy's is a friend of mine.\" He then went to forcing a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy definitely had this guy whipped around her finger, and Julianne figured she didn't want to eat an old friend, despite the fact she probably couldn't get away with eating either the the host or hostess without someone figuring out that something was amiss. Conflicted she stood there gulping down the punch in contemplation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel paused from his drink again, \"Well don't limit yourself to my free drinks!\" He chuckled before Cassy shot him a glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was nice seeing you again, but we're going to go say mingle with a few more people, you can come if you want, you might remember these people too.\" She said motioning Daniel to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell despite his good looks it seems Daniel was a complete jerk, typical of some rich college snob, he probably would still make a tasty meal though, Julianne just had to figure out when and where, definitely not here. Though, she might find someone more accessible elsewhere than within the pantheon of the host and hostess's friends. Or she could go and find one of her TA friends, to see if they had any more luck.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Julianne was a tad unsure about this, she wanted to go with her old friend but her stomach was saying otherwise. But she might actually have fun mingling with these people, she had rarely spent time with non-vores since she began being a TA, it was hard to not be involved, that had become her life, she was hoping to someday join the research team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, she thought, maybe I can even find a cute guy to lure out somewhere, like she said to herself earlier, \"opportunity would come if she waited for it.\" So she filled up her cup again with the fruit punch and followed the couple across the open room, that spoke well of Daniel's parents' wealth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to follow them into another smaller room, and stopped as Cassy and Daniel stopped in front of a group of people all reclining on a sofa and love seat combo with a coffee table that held the majority of the groups' drinks, in the corner of another room, presumably a more private living room, Cassy noticed that she followed and beckoned Julianne over to the group of people. Julianne graciously smiled and then turned her head eyeing the people over, she didn't initially recognize anyone, and most of the people looked tasty, she knew she couldn't eat anyone here at least until after the party, but she couldn't help as her stomach as it growled at the prospect as she sat down on the smaller sofa on the other side of the coffee table. She had somehow forgotten that most normal people were nothing more than food to her now, and it was really hard to think of them otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne was busy covering the noise from her stomach up as she was being introduced by Cassy, and to be honest there was a lot of nodding and unthinking answers as a few people greeted her. Her mind was elsewhere, she couldn't help but think that all of these people are food, and she would readily eat any of them except Cassy in a heartbeat, if she had a chance to. She faked a few laughs at some of the people's jokes, Cassy had introduced a few people that Julianne might have known. \"And this is Luke,\" she would say, Julianne would lie nonchalantly, \"Yeah! I remember him, but I don't know where, mind if I ask?\" This type of discussion would go on for a painfully long time. She did remember some of the names though, and she was relieved that none of the women seemed familiar from any of her vore classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ugh, why do I torture myself like this?' Julianne said to herself, she had to find a meal, these people were making things way to hard. If she had the ability to do so, she wouldn't mind devouring everyone in the room, it wouldn't be too hard to conceal it in this room, would it? The prospect lingered on Julianne's mind as the group continued to idly chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne abruptly stood up, \"Well it really was nice catching up, but I think I want some fresh air and check up on some of my friends I came with.\" She left before Cassy could stop her, of course she didn't care if it seemed rude, she could always just apologize to Cassy later, the rest of them were just potential food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reentered the main room she looked around for any sign of her companions, she looked to where she had left Stacey, and she smiled when she noticed that Stacey and the girl she was with both be missing. 'Guess she found herself a meal.' Julianne really wished she had as she is not so subtly reminded by her growling belly. She continued to look around the room, scanning for potentially easy meals as well as Jessica. She could obviously spot a few drunk guests, they were always good potential meals, but she wanted something that didn't have the possibility of upsetting her stomach by puking in it, that was not a thought she wanted to entertain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she decided to go outside for a bit, maybe some more interesting people would be out there, and by interesting she meant, \"tasty and not drunk\" naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went out the back door to a rather open wooden patio with an awning over top of it, and found even more crowds of people, these people though weren't so inebriated, so she probably would find a more suitable meal here. There were was a guy and 2 girls off the patio, holding back throwing up in the grass, so they were to be avoided at all costs. She continued scanning the patio for someone who looked tasty. She spotted a guy with medium length brown hair leaning on the guard of the patio, and alone. \"Perfect!\" Julianne said to herself, as she approached the man, putting her now empty cup on a windowsill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe casually leaned into the rail and started looking out towards the open yard like he was doing. Though she tried not to, she looked over the guy, all he had one was a plain black t-shit with a plaid buttoned shirt over top of it, the collar purposefully unbuttoned and what looked like plain blue jeans. He wasn't unattractive but not overly so either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy of course couldn't help but notice the dark-haired attractive girl looking him down, \"The breeze is nicer than the smell of stale alcohol isn't it?\" He said without even giving her a proper look, his eyes seemingly fixated on the multitude of trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ok, this guy knows exactly what he was doing,' Julianne thought to herself, 'he's probably here to just prey on girls like me. But he has no idea how exactly I plan to prey on him.' Anyways Julianne played along, so she turned herself around trying to get him to look at her form. \"I know right? I just don't understand the fun behind getting drunk at these parties, they just steal from the real fun!\" She said this in full knowledge that Jessica was probably getting hammered and possibly raiding bedrooms and eating all occupants, but that was Jessica for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at this thought as the guy turned around, he obviously thought the smile was directed at him, so he responded, \"Yeah, all of my friends are in there, all hoping some girl wants to go home with them, drunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This was way too easy,' Julianne thought as she responded coyly and jokingly at the same time, \"Well I don't tend to like my guys drunk, I can't imagine that many girls would, but I can imagine most guys would like it the other way around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the bait, \"Yeah? Not me, I have no interest in persuading a woman to come home with me drunk. Being unable to speak or react sensibly to other human beings are not things I find attractive.\" He thought he was in full control of the situation, he had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne decided to throw him a curveball though, hoping to catch him off-guard, \"Yeah, well I actually think those people are extremely attractive, mind telling me where I could find your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne's plan worked, as she saw his face fluster, trying to come up with a response, \"Well.. I, uh, um.\" His game was broken, he knew he wanted her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne realized she had sent all sorts of mixed signals, but she wanted to test to see if he was genuinely interested, \"Just messing with you, \" She reassuringly smiled, \"I just said I didn't like my guys drunk silly, it was a joke!\" She laughed.</span></div></div>",

I mean the night is still pretty young around town, we could maybe go go a club. Maybe get to know each other better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne already had her response the moment he started talking, she just waited for him to stop, \"I would, but I came here with my friends, and you came with your friends, it wouldn't be right for us to leave without them would it? Besides, I thought you didn't like drunk girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught off guard yet again, thinking he offended the cutie in front of him, the guy stammered, \"Um, erm,\" maybe she would dictate his lie about being here with friends, the fact was he came here with his girlfriend who happened to be mingling with her own friends namely the people Julianne had just been with, and he honestly couldn't stand them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Julianne chuckled again, \"I still wouldn't mind doing something with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervous about blowing his cover, he desperately didn't want to be found by her girlfriend a few rooms away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though what I want to do shouldn't be confined to the indoors.\" Julianne purposefully glanced out to the open yard, glancing out at the trees under the cover of night, she realized it would be easier to eat there, she wouldn't have to worry about anyone finding her in a room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervous again the guy, responded, \"Erm, are you sure, that you um, want to? I mean it's not exactly a warm night, and it's probably pretty wet out there.\" even though he questioned her, he really thought he was in great luck, she would probably never find him with this girl out here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne responded, turning her face out to the yard, \"Yeah, I have this thing for you know, grass tingling on me while I'm with someone. It's just so\" she paused on the last word, \"invigorating.\" She was desperately hoping he would fall for this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was giving all the hints to the guy and he couldn't resist, he was under the full assumption that she had come out here looking for a guy like him now, and he was all to eager to fulfill the role. \" But you haven't even told me your name!\" He wanted to take control of the situation again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne's stomach let out a low growl, she was getting impatient with this guy, \"Sshhh, worry about that after your pants are off,\" She said getting close to him and pulling his arm with her as she left the patio, the guy didn't resist, he was done, this girl was in control, and he was all to willing to leave it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few people saw the two leave off into the darkness amidst the trees , but all they had seen was the backs of their heads. Julianne lead him past a few large coniferous, it was obvious that the pine needles wouldn't exactly be comfortable, but she could use the shade they created would serve it's use, looking forward she found a spot dark enough to conceal anything she did, but it had enough moonlight coming in from behind the tree so she could make sure he went down easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the shadows behind the tree, Julianne not so subtly said, \"Woah, complete darkness, I hope this turns you on as much as it does me! Let's get those clothes off now.\" Julianne was quick to remove his shirts, pulling both over his head and down into the grass, then she basically pushed him into the grass and landed down on him, her lips meeting his, she thought about ingesting him right there but, she would prefer her man-meat without a coating, so she maneuvered her hands down to his pants, skillfully undoing them, while he assumed to start pulling up her blouse, his hands rapidly covering her back as he continued fervently kissing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled away from him as she tugged his pants off, he took the cue to pull her blouse off of her head as she pulled away, Julianne's decently sized breasts now shaking in the cool of the night as she worked his pants and then his boxers. He wouldn't admit it openly but the primal nature of being naked in the grass with the moonlight reflecting off of her bare skin was quite alluring, he would have to try this sometime with his real girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne pulled didn't bother pulling down her own jeans, she wasn't planning on it, she landed back on top of him, her lips revisiting his, and his hands went to undoing her bra, she began to feel him hardening up against her, and she thought of having a little fun with him, but ultimately decided not to, she was way too hungry. With her hands on the back of his neck now, Julianne was kissing down his chest and her hair had landed in his face as she positioned him at a good angle. In position, with her knees in the grass, and his legs in between, she raised her head up and her black hair back causing his busy arms to fall to his sides, and then quickly pulled his head forward, and up to her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He was curious as to what exactly she was doing, but so far all of her plans had been quite nice for him, so he didn't question it. He was questioning it as instead of lips touching him he found something wet touching both his forehead and his chin, he quickly opened his eyes to even more complete darkness than what had been the cool grass that was bristling his back as he was pulled up, he tried to push with his arms but found them completely stuck in place, as Julianne had presumed to move her knees to being on top of each of his hands.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He was now kicking uselessly, and Julianne was thankful he hadn't even cried out before his head had fit into her throat, she leaned over again her bare back arching the night, and her now barely clasped bra to fall onto his chest, Julianne was too busy to notice of course. Now in position to quickly slurp up his torso, she let go of his hands and quickly pulled in his shoulders and chest, once again pinning his arms down, her throat bulging in the moonlight as he filled it. Still on her knees she continued to pull him with her arms and throat. His bare legs were kicking in the air now she continued to lift him skywards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow completely vertical, gravity did the rest as the bulge in her throat tapered off as his hips entered her stomach, his body making it bulge out even further than her throat had. Soon enough, Julianne had come to his feet, which were still coated in a glaze known as 'rubber shoe', much to her disappointment in herself, too often did she leave those pesky things on. But they soon joined the rest of the man in her belly. Finally given food her belly quickly got to work on it's contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about hiding her meal and getting back to the party, maybe she could have more fun with a full belly, but she was way too hungry to get up right now. So she just let her belly spill out below her, and she idly caressed it, she inherently knew how to get her belly to digest fast enough when she needed it to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before her mystery man had stopped his fruitless struggles, and soon her belly had began breaking him down into a pulp sending him into the intestines. After a few minutes of content relaxation combined with the natural serenity of her situation Julianne had nearly fallen asleep, but was quickly reawakened by her meal, as he was beginning the final leg of his journey. Her awareness back, she looked down at her nearly flat belly. She would have to get back in quick before... 'Well, so much for getting back to the bathroom,' she thought to herself as he began to be packed into her colon, his digested remains quickly accumulating as Julianne scooped up his clothes, which she quickly devoured, regretting the bitter taste, but at least they didn't smell of alcohol and whatever else they could have, had she chosen a less appetizing meal. She spent a few seconds looking for her discarded blouse, she then got down on her hands and knees before she looked down, being reminded of how he had removed her bra, as she found her bare breasts hanging down below her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his good taste, and along with her inconveniently bare chest, his insistence to leaving my behind isn't very assuring for his character, Julianne thought, as she was searching for her bra which he had inconveniently removed before becoming food. For a second she was worried that she had accidentally eaten it with him, but she found it as the guy's clothes were firmly dissolved and were on their way to their owner. She brushed some of the loose grass off of it, and quickly put it back where it belonged, she couldn't help but shiver as the dew laden bra recovered her chest. She was worried about her nipples reacting to the cold, but figured that her loose blouse would take care of that. Then she put on the blouse and found it a little wet as well, she shrugged it off, she would just have to make sure there were no issues in the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when it hit her again, she had taken way to long out here, and her meal couldn't wait, the fibrous material of his clothes had finally added to his remains and were just more to push out of her bottom. Reluctantly she pulled down her pants that she didn't want to remove earlier, she noted, along with her panties, and squatted down, she was desperately hoping no one who knew her would find this out here, she was glad she picked a spot far from the house though. She looked at her spot and decided to turn away from the tree, the slight slope from the roots would do. Finally situated her bladder unloaded itself into the grass, the sloped ground carried the urine remains of the man down away from her, though it wasn't long before the rest of him began coming in, Julianne didn't waste any time as he was pushed out bit after bit, her squatting making it quite a bit easier. Julianne was considering the advantages of the situation, for instance she wouldn't need to worry about clogging the toilet, which is a clear advantage in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It wasn't long before she finished, his remains slumped over underneath the tree, looking at it briefly Julianne said to herself, \"I hope to God that no one finds this out here any time soon!\" She pulled up her pants and after re-buttoning them she began walking from the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe followed the light coming from the house as she navigated from within the trees, she was worried about anyone on the porch who had seen her with the guy asking needless questions so once she saw the patio, she went to the side of the rather large house, but was stopped when she came to a fence, it wasn't all that high, so she pulled herself over with her strength, thinking for a moment that she maybe didn't need to have held the guy down, maybe grabbing his hands would have been more fun, him in the full knowledge that she held all power over him, the idea tantalized her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had come back to the front of the house she casually walked back in the front door, the doorman strangely missing, she had to admit she had forgotten him in her plan, so his disappearance was completely welcome. The party hadn't changed from her disappearance, she wanted to find her friends now though, see if they could initiate something fun. But her thoughts were interrupted by Cassy approaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I remember you saying you were going to get some fresh air, and I was wondering if... \" Cassy was cut off as another girl chimed in, Julianne recognized her from their introduction as a girl named Courtney, \"If you'd seen my boyfriend, Trevor? You see, I got a call, from my roommate about a water leak in my apartment, I was going to go and make sure none of my stuff was damaged, but he was my ride as he had the keys, and I remember him saying he was going outside for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne resisted the urge to smile, \"Nope, haven't seen him, I was only outside for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney cocked her eyebrow as she looked down, and Julianne got nervous remembering the damp state of her clothes. Regardless, Courtney and Cassy realized asking Julianne was fruitless and turned around and continued looking for her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne had a good thought that the poor sod she had eaten was Courtney's boyfriend, and probably whatever was left of the car keys were in the pile of Trevor she left behind that tree. Which made Julianne realize that she had forgotten to even look in the pockets for any money. Her hunger had made her far too hasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReminded by Courtney glancing at her chest she headed to the bathroom to make sure she wasn't sporting thermometers too apparent under there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rounded the halls a bit looking for a bathroom, eventually she came to the empty room, she also had came in to make sure she was clean in the places that mattered, and unsurprisingly, she was so she pulled back up her pants and went to the mirror to make sure she was good, as it was hard to tell from just looking down at her own chest. Upon glance she realized her nipples were definitely showing, but nothing too spectacular, she adjusted herself and returned to the party, unsure of what to next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Exiting the bathroom Julianne decided to try and find her two friends, and remembering from before, that she had seen that Stacey had been talking up a girl earlier, and decided that she would most likely be better able to find her than find whatever fun Jessica could be having right now. So she first looked down the hall to find three doorways, two on the let side of the hall and one at the very end of the hall. Julianne assumed they would be bedrooms, considering the size of the house and the wealth of the owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne casually walks down the hall toward the first door, and is about to open, but she hears something first, so she presses her ear to the door, upon doing so she hears a serious of low feminine moans, and makes out a man as well, either way she wasn't looking for a snack at the moment, and neither one sounded like her friends so she moves on, not wishing to interrupt the couple. She approaches the next door, which is completely silent, intrigued by the closed door, Julianne grabs the doorknob and finds it locked, which does nothing but heighten her curiosity. Still, Julianne can't open the door so she moves on, she notices as a somewhat tall girl had entered the hall and as she walks down the hall, she scoffs under her breath as she had noticed Julianne putting her ear to the door. Julianne simply ignored her and moved on, she had little care at what these people thought of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to turn the knob of the final door, when it began to turn itself, slightly startled Julianne had a brief thought to run, as if feeling guilty but she decided to remain in place, at least a bit defensive. The door opened, and Jessica came into view, \"Yo! Julianne!\" is all she said. Julianne sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, but unsure of what exactly she was afraid of in the first place, Julianne said, \"Oh hi, I was looking for Stacey? Have you seen her around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, no, can't say I have, now if you excuse me, there is a persistent couple who have a date with the bathroom.\" Jessica said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, we should probably not talk about that stuff so openly here.\" Julianne lowered her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right,\" Jessica smiled and said a little loudly, \"Julianne, can you direct me to the bathroom, I need to 'tinkle'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne resisted the urge to chuckle at her friend's disposition, and replied, \"Yeah it's right down the hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nearly skipped down the hall, and Julianne decided to walk down that way anyways, partially to explore, and the other part thinking Stacey might be there as well. She noticed Jessica grab the doorknob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, locked!\" is all she said, before she left the door and went the opposite direction, taking a more casual walk now, back out to the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne moved on, not surprised that Jessica had been raiding bedrooms, but somewhat surprised that she hadn't tried to get drunk yet. Anyways, Julianne had probably just decided to look for more morsels instead of waiting for the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown this side of the hall was only two doorways one that lead to the room she had been in with Cassy earlier, and upon seeing the other, it was an open double door which lead to a wide kitchen setting, and she could certainly see a few of what looked like possible storage rooms or possibly pantries, Julianne was somewhat certain she wouldn't find Stacey there. She also noticed a fairly large screen door, which seemed to lead back out to the porch. Which obviously reminded her of what Cassy and that Courtney were doing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Julianne thought about it for a moment, she didn't even have any idea where Cassy and Courtney had left, they might not even be outside right now, so she decided to continue her searches for Stacey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey however was doing her best to not be found, she had lured a girl into a rather secluded bedroom upstairs and had eaten her, and was now rubbing her belly atop the bed, planning to take her time digesting this particularly tasty morsel. She moved two fingers across her gurgling engorged gut, the girl's struggles were dying down now, not because of the digestion, but because Stacey had stopped sending air down. However, Stacey was not ready for her to stop just yet, so she she burped up the bad air and gulped down fresh. Stacey then closed her eyes feeling the renewed fruitless struggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I guess I could probably take a nap here if I wanted, I did lock the door didn't I?' She then backtracked her mind, and remembered following the girl back here, then she removed her clothes, and yes, it was then Stacey locked the door before jumping the girl. Then she remembered what the girl was doing as her mouth opened, her mouth was opening as well! Stacey smiled, 'Maybe she was a vore too? Well, not that it matters obviously she was planning to do this to me.' Stacey closed her eyes again and circled her distended belly with her fingers, pushing down into it just enough so she knew the girl could feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed, Stacey was starting to fall asleep, when she heard a rather loud crash somewhere in the house, somewhere quite close. Stacey decided that maybe, she should check it out, I mean it wouldn't hurt would it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she stood up from the bed and proceeded to shrink her belly down to a rather taut and otherwise unremarkable bulge, and straightened her clothes, and walked to the door, and was about to open it when she heard footsteps outside, a little bit unnerved she almost didn't open it, but heck, it was a party she couldn't get skittish every time a person was going somewhere, so she opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy however was far more surprised to see the girl come from the door than Stacey was to see her, this surprise changed pretty quickly when Stacey saw the rather large potbelly Cassy was attempting to hide. But both girls, their attentions heightened noticed someone coming up the stairs. Stacey turned her head to the stairs before turning it back quickly to the girl. Cassy freaked and began to run down the hall into the bathroom, hoping that the girl would dismiss her rather sloppily hidden Courtney bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey was relieved when the girl who came up the stairs was Julianne, her eyes brightening at finding her friend. \"Stacey! I've been looking all over for you, did you get that girl I saw you ogling over earlier?\" Julianne grinned as she leaned on the stairs-railing pointing to Stacey's belly, \"You're hiding her aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey smiled, \"Yeah, it's like you can see right into my belly,\" It seemed that Julianne hadn't noticed the sprinting girl who ran into the bathroom just now, Stacey would worry about it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you want dessert?\" Julianne said her eyes motioning back downstairs, \"Plenty more, and I figured we could work together like we always do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey looked back behind her for a second, uneasy about the girl she was certain was vorish in the bathroom behind her. She almost said something pertaining to her, but decided just as well not to. \"Sure, I'm still taking my time with this girl, if you don't mind, but I'm sure she would enjoy some company!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's settled then!\" and with that Julianne and Stacey returned back down the stairs. Though Stacey couldn't help but hear something similar to a flush behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the bottom of the stairs Stacey was somewhat uncomfortable, she couldn't help but feel people could see her bulge, so she looked down past her breasts and was relieved that the still faintly struggling girl was barely visible, she pressed her finger in, just to try to get her start up again, but she was exhausted at this point. Her worries sated, she noticed Julianne had already moved on to finding potential meals, she was talking to two rather nice dressed guys near the snacks table, she took a deep breath and stuck her chest out as she approached the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, this is my friend, Stacey,\" Julianne motioned over to her friend, Stacey gave the boys a coy look and smiled at Julianne before turning around to get punch, Julianne could tell at least one of the guys had looked towards Stacey as she bent slightly over the snack table, and the other had his eyes glued on herself, 'It's almost like these guys want to be eaten,' Julianne thought to herself, it was here that out of the corner of her eye she spotted Cassy after she had come down the stairs, and she remembered a very crucial aspect of predation she learned from downing the last guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Cassy!\" called Julianne, waving her hand, \" I was just introducing these guys to me and my friend Stacey,\" Stacey hearing her name being mentioned to a 'Cassy' perked her ears, and she turned around smiling with punch in hand, but upon seeing the girl, her face went pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy however didn't notice the very stunned Stacey and walked over to the group, \"Hello, boys, I haven't met you two tonight but I suppose you're friends of Daniel's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two smiled and nodded, truth be told neither hardly knew the party's host, they just had friends who let them in. Cassy was observant though, she knew just about everyone they had invited to the party, in fact it was never even supposed to be this big, but she didn't really care, anyone who caused any problems she would personally escort out of the party. She was a bit worried when 'that' one girl saw her upstairs, so it was extremely unnerving when she glanced over to the girl Julianne had been introducing. She saw Stacey looking her up and down, 'OK, something has to be done now' Cassy thought to herself, but Julianne would probably find her friend missing rather strange wouldn't she? If she mentioned it, Cassy considered her options, 'I guess, I would have to eat her too,'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, she couldn't try anything so Cassy pretended to move on, when in reality she was just moving to the other side of the room to watch them from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her back was turned, Stacey nudged Julianne rather quickly and hard, \"Ow! What was that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here,\" Stacey motioned for Julianne to get lower and away from the boys, she whispered into her ear, \"That girl,\" she paused, moving her eyes to Cassy, \"She had a gut upstairs, right before you came upstairs, she got startled and ran right into the bathroom, and now look at her,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne moved in to whisper to her, \"Cassy? I've known her for years! She couldn't be a vore, I've never even seen her take a course!\" Although Julianne didn't believe her at first, she couldn't think of a reason Stacey would lie to her, \"I guess we should confront her about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she knows I saw her, so she probably wants to eat me, to make sure I don't tell anyone about it,\" Stacey predicted quite precisely, she knew that she herself had faced this problem many times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne thought it through, Cassy came downstairs, but there was no more Courtney, that's where she could get her, \"Stacey, do you have that girl?\"<br>\r\nStacey nodded. Julianne continued, \"Well, we're going to have to show her, that we're vores as well, and that her secret is safe with us, she'll trust me, I'm sure of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys were none the wiser of this conversation, and were most likely discussing which of them would get which girl, when Julianne spoke up, \"Well boys, we have to take care of something, but I promise we'll be back,\" Julianne winked and the two boys smiled.</span></div></div>",

They made it only a few steps in the direction before Stacey nudged her friend again, \"Wait,\" she paused, causing the determined Julianne to be a little impatient, \"Shouldn't we go with Jessica? I mean wouldn't it be safer with the three of us, we have no idea how strong she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne had already thought through the idea, and smiled at Stacey replying, \"Yeah, Jessica would probably make it safer, but do you have any idea where she is?\"Julianne had some sort of an idea but she wasn't about to break her own argument. Stacey's silent pause allowed Julianne to continue, \"Exactly, we could probably search for her, but that would give her time to react, if she knows we're not vores, she's probably got the same reaction you would to being found out, she has to eat the evidence, and, she IS the hostess, she knows this house far better than we do. One wrong turn and we could end up like the meal you saw her with.\" Julianne realized another point as she finished her strategy, \"Besides, she wouldn't expect us to come directly to her, that would put us in the advantage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey was unable to come up with a good counter argument, \"Yeah, well I'd still feel safer with Jessica, but you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne looked at her friend in the eye and smiled, \"Well I'll approach her first, you just be ready to sport that belly of yours.\" Stacey nodded and the two continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy unaware of the conversation had noticed the two coming near to where she was and decided to move on, she had gone down a hallway, she didn't even consider for a second that the two were following her, she was just interested in getting into a good position to devour them if they happened to pass the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne was somewhat confused as to where exactly Cassy had gone to, but she didn't let Stacey know, so she kept a vigilant scan across this area of the room, it would make things a lot easier if she remained in the large room, she wouldn't eat them there, and she could make their case with less risk. But she found it fruitless and continued looking, the most logical place she went was down this hallway. Neither one noticed as Cassy was waiting on the corner to the left of the hallway entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdentifying the two quickly, Cassandra made her move the moment they were out of the line of sight from the main party room, and wrapped her arms around the girl at the back, namely Stacey and lifted her into her wide mouth. Soon any yelp from Stacey was too muffled by Cassy's own throat to be heard outside the hallway, but Julianne heard it just fine, she whipped her head around to see Cassy's lips covering Stacey's breast, the rest of Stacey's hair dangling from Cassy's chin, she only saw a flash of it though, because within a split second Cassy's lips covered her waist, then legs and then gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy had been watching Julianne the whole time, and was completely unnerved by the growing smirk on her face. She did admit to herself that she hadn't thought about the other girl running before she made her move, but Julianne was just standing there silently. Julianne saw the disbelief of the girl's face and made her own move. Cassy tried to open her mouth as Julianne lunged toward her, it didn't matter because soon enough the hostess was stuck inside the belly of Julianne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom here, Julianne had actually thought this situation out as well, she just had to find a bit of privacy, so she opted for the first door she saw, but found it strangely locked, and a familiar response returned from the other side, \"Just a minute, I'm almost done!\" The voice belonged to none other than Jessica. She then looked at the bottom of the door and noticed that the carpet of the hallway gave way to the linoleum tile of a bathroom. \"This house has an interesting layout,\" Julianne thought to herself before going to another room directly adjacent to the bathroom, she made sure no one saw her enter before she turned on the light. The room seemed like an unused bedroom, mostly due to how empty the walls were, and the lack of anything that would seem personal, the room was perfect. Glad to find a lock on the door, she shut the door tight and took herself to plopping on the bed. Now the confrontation could actually begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke to her belly, letting it protrude out over as she laid on her side, her arm reclining on the covered pillow, \"Ok, Cassandra,\" She circled her belly with her finger poking inward slightly at various spots to get Cassy's attention, \"If you haven't figured it out, I'm a vore too, and I particularly don't like the idea of girls running around and eating my friends, so it's best you cough her up, or else you're not leaving my body the way you came in.\" Julianne smiled and let those words sink in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cassy took weight of the situation carefully, she hadn't began digesting the girl yet, her mind was still reeling over the fact that Julianne was capable of doing everything she could, and was probably better than it than she was. Should she even try to escape and eat her? They were friends weren't they? Did that even matter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy dejectedly spoke, \"OK, ok, you got me Julianne, I'll cough her up, just don't digest.\" Cassandra decided to comply at least for now, she was in no position to refuse the demands of her captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne smiled and rolled over from her side so that her belly would face to the ceiling, it jiggled in the process, jostling it's contents. \"Well get on with it, I want to see my belly get bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy was hoping she could let Stacey out when she was out, in this position it would be kind of hard, but she was willing to try. Curled up in the tight confines with her own fairly large unhidden belly, she decided to ask for some assistance, \"Could you give me a little more room in here? It's really tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne sighed, \"That would make my belly smaller silly! I want it bigger, I'm beginning to think you don't want out.\" Julianne was only really entertaining the thought of digesting, she didn't really want to hurt Stacey, but she had to convince the hostess so she stopped holding back digestion just for a second to give the predator a hint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy squirmed as the acids doused her skin, \" OK OK, turn off the pipes I'll let her out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good girl,\" Julianne poked her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra focused on her abdomen, she never really got the hang of hiding techniques so well, so there was little she could do in the way of making Stacey more manageable. Stacey on the other hand was completely unaware of the fact that Julianne had eaten her captor, but she was excited at the prospect that Cassy was going to let her out. That's when she felt a huge pressure and push on her from all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey immediately began squirming and struggling, Cassy never in fact had been holding digestion, Stacey had just been trying to limit her oxygen intake in hopes that her fellow TA would find her a way out. This wasn't her first time in a belly, so she became very afraid when all of the walls began to push on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy was hoping that the girl would figure out the plan soon enough, her struggling was a sign that her clenching abdomen was making her think she was getting digested faster, hopefully she would try to push up her throat, that was the easiest way for Cassy to get her out in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey on the other hand was frantically shoving on all sides of the belly as the acids continued to cover her body, then she found  leeway, she shoved her hand through the opening to the esophagus, and hid her own belly as much as she could and tried to force herself though the tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy was doing her best not to swallow her back down, which was somewhat torturous in her position, given that she was curled up on her side, but soon enough she felt fingers in the back of her throat. On instinct she swallowed the girl back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey, frustrated pushed back up rapidly, and a now more careful Cassy let her up, and when her fingers were back at her mouth she instead of swallowing, coughed hard, hoping to get the girl up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Julianne noticed a new bulge begin poking through her belly as Cassy coughed the girl up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat confused as she noticed that she had left one belly and entered another Stacey pulled her hips through Cassy's lips and tried to make room for herself in the tight confines. Once her legs had entered Julianne's belly she curled up in a similar position to Cassandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne noticed that finally the commotion had stopped inside her now gargantuan tummy sprawling out in front of her and spoke, \"Oh, Cassy very good! And Stacey, poke the belly if you hear me.\" A poke coming from the side of the belly closest to her face satisfied Julianne, and she responded, \"Well then, you're coming out again, get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne rolled back over in the process of getting out of the bed, it was a bit cumbersome with the two unhidden women in her belly, but it was nothing she hadn't managed before. And she noticed a flush coming in from the next room, she could still digest them if she really wanted to, Jessica would probably never question it, and she could probably make Cassy the excuse that Stacey didn't show up to class, but she honestly didn't want to bring any harm to her friend, she had no reason to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Standing up, she made a mockery of Cassy's struggle at coughing Stacey up, quickly clenching her belly, forcing it inward and forcing Stacey up. Stacey pointed her hands upward, and kept her belly tucked in as she was was being forced up. Cassy saw her chance and grabbed onto Stacey's ankle, Stacey yelled through the throat, \"No get off, stay down there!\" shaking her leg in protest. Even though it sounded more like a muffled mess to Julianne, she could feel what was going on, but she had already assumed that this would happen, and had a plan. Once again, Stacey found herself coming up a throat and into a mouth, a wide open mouth that was waiting for her ascent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey poked her head out, and then her arms, still kicking at the desperate Cassy clinging onto the climbing girl. Making very visible bulges in Julianne's hardworking throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she forced the rest of her chest and torso out, Julianne bent over letting her fellow TA use her hands to control her fall. Her hips slid out rather easily and soon Julianne felt Cassy coming back up her throat, her hard gripping hand on Julianne's tongue. She reacted fast though, and once only Stacey's single leg lay out of her mouth, she swallowed hard. Cassy had no choice but to loose the girl's leg. The swallow had sent most of Stacey's leg back into Julianne, so her lips were now touching her now almost naked backside, and she had maneuvered her other leg to where it was resting on Julianne's shoulder. Julianne couldn't help but blush at the sight of her friend's near naked form as she quickly spit out the rest of her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally done, Stacey's legs fell to the floor and she breathed heavily, letting herself land on her juice soaked chest, her hands sufficiently breaking her fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne on the other hand was hardly exerted, and sat back on the bed, admiring her Cassy filled belly once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Cassy, I think it best you learn a lesson.\" Julianne teased, poking the struggling and distended gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy made her pleas audible, \" Please! Please? You don't need to digest me, it's obvious I'm not a threat to you! We're friends remember!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last I checked, Friends didn't try to make meals out of each other.\" Julianne let the words sink in before continuing, \" That's why I'm not going to make a meal out of you,\" Julianne couldn't believe she had let that sentimentality out, but she had plans for this girl.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Julianne was still stroking her belly waiting for a response, but little to her knowledge, Cassy had actually began digesting Stacey long before Julianne had even tried the bathroom door. Despite the fact Stacey had a completely live meal within her already, the majority of both girls had already been broken down inside Cassy. Cassy was hoping that her silence might convince Julianne to let her out, as in she was pretending that she couldn't hear the domineering TA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne knew better though, she knew that Cassandra could hear her every word from within her belly. \"OK, Cassy, I'm going to the bathroom, you have until the time I sit on the toilet before I start digesting.\" She had said this, hearing a flush and a faucet from the next room, signalling Jessica's exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy was going to have to change her strategy if she wanted to make it out of here alive. So she finally spoke up, \"Oh, Julianne I didn't know!!\" Julianne rolled her eyes, she knew where this was going, she had to be firm though if she wanted Stacey out, but she let Cassy continue, \"I can't let her out, I never mastered the ability to!\" This was a lie on Cassy's part, she knew very well how to cough up a meal, but there really wasn't much of a point in coughing up a half-liquefied one, she tried to slow down the digestion in progress to make it seem like she still hade a live meal. Cassy's attention was heightened again as Julianne rolled over and leaned up, the shift in gravity all too apparent to the dark haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne couldn't believe her luck, there was a door to the bathroom right here in the bedroom! She wouldn't have to bother hiding her meal to leave the bedroom. \"That story better change quickly.\" Julianne said flatly, even though her mind had already been made, she enjoyed feeling the girl squirm, even though she was still hoping that Cassy had been lying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so.. sooo.. sorry! I promise I can get more meals if you let me out! Don't forget, this is MY party!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy was just begging for her life now, Julianne rolled her eyes, \"Girl, I could eat half this party in one sitting,\" Julianne knew she was exaggerating a little bit with that last statement, but her skills in vore were not exactly anything to ignore either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy with this last word and with every step rippling her entire environment, began sobbing quietly, she really couldn't cope with the situation, she was supposed to be eating whomever she wanted at this party! \"Fine!\" she paused, \"Digest me! Your friend is already soup fueling my body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Julianne opened the unlocked door to the bathroom. And was quite surprised to see Jessica still occupying it. Her panties still around her ankles, though she was standing up . Julianne looked up to see a very wide mouth greeting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess-\" quickly cut off as she found herself going down her fellow TA's throat, despite her belly her small frame quickly fell into the busty blonde's stomach, in fact Jessica didn't even notice the bulge. Her eyes had been shut the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssssh now, food doesn't talk.\" Jessica giggled to her somewhat distended belly as she shrank it down to silent Julianne's protests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Julianne was cursing quite loudly trying to get Jessica's attention. But with the last giggle and her slowly expanding surroundings she realized that Jessica was drunk. She was as good as dead, that didn't stop Julianne though and she continued trying to get the attention of the drunk bombshell as she sat back down on the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica grunted, passing the last of her previous to Julianne meal. \"Ohhh, quiet down now, you're going to help me get more meals.\" With that Jessica took her hands and squished her breasts together and giggled again. It wasn't long before she felt her meal dissolving, her struggles ceasing. Shortly thereafter the three girls found themselves closer than they had even been before, all three of them mixing together as a thick mix being drained through the drunk blonde's intestines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica giggled again as she felt the first of the mix of girls finally reach her rectum, \"Leaving so so soon? You had gotten so quiet in there, I thought you were going to stay the night! But sure, you can go now.\" Jessica laughed as if it was the funniest thing anyone had said. And in doing so, the majority of the contents of her ass fell out as she was laughing. Once she finished, she grunted again as a rather large portion of the girls fought it's way out of her asscheeks. \"Ohh, you were a big'un huh?\" She said before another compacted mass pushed it's way out. \"Almost done, girly, I told you I was, you should have waited.\" Jessica finally pushed the last bit of the three girls down on top of the mess that already inhabited the toilet. She wiped rather quickly, and stood up. She hadn't bother flushing during the whole thing, a drunken mistake naturally. Though the alcohol was wearing off a bit because of her meal. \"Daaaang, I forgot to flush, you were a big one weren't ya?\" She didn't bother trying to flush the huge amounts of waste and quickly washed her hands and went into the bedroom. She wondered briefly whether Juli or Stacey would find her here, shrugged, shut the door and plopped onto the bed, falling asleep almost immediately.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Julianne thought about finding her friends but quickly discarded the thought, 'They're probably fine,' she thought to herself as she walked back out to the front room of the house which was the main room for the party. 'Maybe it's time for seconds!' She scanned the room looking for just about anyone who looked both tasty and preferably not drunk, and this time preferably female, for variety's sake. After a while she spotted Courtney again, and she was splitting up from Cassy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Julianne said under her breath, she could get two things she wanted out of this, Courtney wouldn't be snooping around for her rather crappy boyfriend anymore and she'd get a rather satisfying non-drunk meal. Cassy might get in the way again, since they probably were both searching for the same thing so she had to strike at the right time. Courtney was now entering another hall that was across the room, so Julianne crossed the room making sure not to bump anyone, she didn't want interruptions while she was on the hunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne made it to the entrance to the hall just in time to see Courtney going up a set of stairs at the other end of the hall next to an open doorway she presumed to be the kitchen, she waited until Courtney's shadow disappeared from the lighted staircase before she stepped toward it slowly, and began making her way up the stairs, her sneaking wasn't for her prey but rather for anyone who had might have noticed her going up the stairs, especially if Cassy was around, she didn't want to have to answer any more prying questions about her dietary habits, and hopefully eating this lass would end them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached the top of the stairs she met yet another hallway, wider and more spacious than the downstairs but still another hallway, it had four doorways, two on either side, and what looked like a bathroom at the end of it. Julianne made note of that and smiled, she was briefly distracted by a strange noise from the farther room on her right, but she was certain Courtney had gone into a room on the left judging on the door she heard close. Stepping carefully to the door she pressed her ear to it. She heard some shuffling, but nothing out of the ordinary, and she was certain there was only one person in there, she briefly considered what she would do if she was wrong but came to the conclusion, that at that point she would probably eat any and all occupants then, she had come to far to stop now. She broke from her thoughts though as she heard footsteps getting closer. Now frozen, Julianne ran the situation through her head, as soon as the door opened she would open wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door knob turned, and Julianne prepared herself, she wasn't the fastest eater but she would try to push the girl into the room once her head was muffled enough not to protest. When the door swung open though she first saw a very engorged half-covered belly, which caught her off-guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess-?\" Her words cut off by lips which quickly surrounded her head, and in a matter of seconds Julianne found herself making the girl's belly even larger, she didn't even get a glimpse of who ate her, \"Damnit,\" she said to herself, \"Hey, this is Julianne! Jessica or Stacey, whoever you are let me out immediately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her protests, her predator didn't particularly hear any of the protests from her belly as she compressed and hid it down. But the other occupant inside the girl heard Julianne, \"Hey, July, this isn't Stacey, and-\" she was cut off as Julianne responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica?\" Julianne recognized her fellow TA's voice in the dark wet confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jessica responded, \"This girl whom in we now reside was just some chick who came into the room I happened to be digesting a rather drunk guy I had brought up, and she came in, and was startled, so naturally I reacted fast and tried to get her down, but the black haired bitch opened her mouth and basically jumped on me, I found myself here in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne instantly knew who had eaten them then, she was having a hard time wrapping her mind around it though, but she didn't get a chance to speak up, as the two girls found themselves being emptied into the intestines in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied to digest now that she had reached the bathroom, the predator let her belly at the two, she didn't really know either of them was a vore nor did she have any knowledge that one of them actually had a meal, it didn't matter now though, because both of them were exploring her intestines. As well, Julianne would never know how right she was as Cassandra pulled down her pants and sat upon the toilet. Soon Julianne, and Jessica found the reason Cassandra was up here in the first place as they found themselves packed up into the last of Courtney, she wouldn't need to get to her apartment in her current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing she would be here for a bit, Cassy pulled out her phone as the first liquid remains poured into the bowl, the first text was from Daniel, and she laughed at a joke his friend had told him to say as she squeezed the first bit of Courtney out, she was about to text back but she had to let a rather large bit out, and she clenched hard. She had heard about some girls being able to reduce their meals, she really had to look into that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Cassy found herself on the can a little bit longer than she had expected, but still after a few flushes the girls found themselves leaving the party a little bit ahead of schedule at the hostess' insistence. Cassy presumed to wash herself up, she didn't want to smell like some other girl when she was around her boyfriend, and especially not one those girls. She did feel a little bit of remorse at her eating of Julianne, but no one should know her secret, and what done is done. She thought briefly of how her clever plan had gotten complicated, she knew the house so she had asked for Courtney to look upstairs before she went into the kitchen and then snuck up on her in the stairwell and devoured her there, then she heard someone in the next room so she ate the girl she found there, she didn't belong in her room anyways.</span></div></div>",

She wanders around the crowds for several minutes, looking for something that interests her, after a while, she spots a girl sitting alone at a table, enjoying a drink. It's a bit of an odd sight, normally there should be somebody sitting with her, considering how attractive she looks with her red hair, tight, revealing outfit, and considerable assets to boot, if Stacey had her mind on food at the time, she would consider her downright scrumptious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Stacey takes a moment to examine her, a couple guys approach her and begin to speak with her. A bit too far away to make out their conversation over the hustle and bustle of the party going on around her, she can only really read their body motions.

As the guys wander away disappointed, Stacey makes a good guess on what this girl wants, and makes her way toward the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl notices Stacey approaching, her eyes seem to light up while a subtle grin creeps along her face. \"Why hello there!

Elise's cheeks turn a little red, showing that Stacey's already making progress. \"Hmm, this should be even easier than I thought!\" Stacey thinks to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aren't you a bit forward!\" Elise says. \"But I rather enjoy your look enough at the moment, what further incentive do I need?\" She's definitely trying to play hard to get, if only a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey gets up off her seat, confident this next move will get her willing to follow. \"Well, maybe I'm willing to let you touch too..\" She says, rubbing her hands across her hips, showing her curves. \"...but you'll have to follow me to find out.\" Stacey teases as she begins to walk off, if this doesn't get her to follow, she doubt anything will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Stacey slowly walks away, she notices Elise get up off her seat, leaving her drink behind. The redhead quickly brushes up against her, rubbing against her a bit. \"Let's go.\" Elise whispers, no longer able to stand her teasing. Stacey moves quickly, trying to find somewhere private. Soon, the two girls find themselves in one of the house's hallways, this one devoid of any other party-goers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching the hall's rooms, Stacey tries to find one suitable, first the two decide against a study, as there's a lack of any soft surfaces, not even a carpet over the wood floor. As they approach the next door, the two girls can hear moans coming from the other end, they move on, choosing not to interrupt whoever is occupying that room. Next is a bathroom, would be convenient, but she doubts the girl would be willing to go with her in there, but to her surprise, Elise speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that'll do!\" Elise says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Stacey says, a little surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The door can lock, so that's good enough for me.\" She explains. \"Plus the rug on the floor looks like and soft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a look back in there, Stacey doesn't really find anything all that bad, the room looks like it's just recently been cleaned, and although the floor is covered in hard tile, the large rug Elise mentioned looks very soft and shaggy.

As Stacey turns back toward Elise, she sees that she's eagerly removing her shirt, taking her first step toward disrobing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stacey enjoys the little show as her meal-to-be disrobes in front of her, and after slipping her shirt off, she immediately unhooks her bra, giving Stacey a nice view of her bare, sizeable chest. Elise gives her breasts a little squeeze, showing off just how plump they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like em?\" Elise says, proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I just can't wait to taste them.\" Stacey says, barely holding herself back from devouring the girl right then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's see yours now.\" Elise says, giggling as she grips Stacey's shirt. Playing along, Stacey raises her arms, playing along a bit. As Elise rolls the shirt up, she unhooks Stacey's bra along the way, letting it simply fall off. The shirt is then rolled over Stacey's head next, and Stacey lowers her arms, letting Elise pull the wadded up shirt away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey attempts to move her arms downward to help remove Elise's shorts, but is interrupted as Elise suddenly grabs them. Taking advantage of Stacey's brief confusion, Elise, in one smooth motion opens her mouth wide and engulfs Stacey's arms up her her elbows, while moving her own hands to grip Stacey's shoulders. Before Stacey could react in any manner, Elise opens her mouth even wider and pulls, forcing Stacey's head and shoulders into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey screams in panic, her voice muffled within Elise's mouth, as she attempt to pull herself free, Elise unbuttons Stacey's jeans, holds tightly onto them, and begins swallowing, sucking her meal right out of her remaining clothing. Elise quickly devours her meal, and after reaching Stacey's lower legs, she simply pushes the jeans off of her, takes a moment to remove her shoes and socks, and wasting no more time, she swallows the rest of the girl down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Stacey enters the girl's stomach, she begins to struggle as hard as she can. But she doesn't have much time, for as soon as her feet pass through the sphincter, the stomach begins squeezing hard, strong acids starting to flood the digestive chamber, and within only a minute, Stacey has melted away, but before she's sent on her way to the intestines to be absorbed, Elise swallows her clothing, which quickly melt away in the pool of acid mixed with Stacey, even her rubbery shoes are dissolved in a manner of seconds, and after Elise has disposed of Stacey's belongings, she sends her on her way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elise's belly begins to shrink, she removes her own pants and sits down on the toilet. \"Thanks for finding the bathroom for me, sweetie.\" Elise coos as she rubs her rapidly shrinking belly. After a few minutes, she feels pressure building up in her rear, and immediately squeezes Stacey out of her rear, pausing to flush the toilet before the bowl is filled up too much. After about a minute of excretion, she wipes herself, flushes one last time, gets her clothing back on, then makes her way out, back to the party. Stacey was just another meal to the Elise, who didn't even consider the possibility of Stacey being a fellow vore, which doesn't matter anymore, as she's now nothing more than pile of shit making it's way into the sewers.</span></div></div>",

I do read the mail here if not every day and I am available at Eka's, if you know where that is. (Eka's is better since I get a notification for new private messages.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther the contents of the story can be discussed here:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://aryion.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=20419&amp;start=0\" target=\"_blank\">http://aryion.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=20419&amp;start=0</a><br>\r\n------------------------------------------<br>\r\nBasic rules:<br>\r\nOnly human female predators, only humans as \"people\", that is no furries or mutants or other not naturally occurring things, that includes ghosts and other supernatural things such as soul-talk and thus soul-vore. (Soul-music is allowed though, but only just. :P )<br>\r\nNo magic, vore might be weird but try to keep it pseudo-scientific.<br>\r\nNo unbirth. <br>\r\nAnd keep in mind this is a semi-real world scenario, digestive tracts does digest stuff put in it. However predators are trained here, if someone isn't being digested it's because the predator is skilled enough and holding back, possibly because the prey is her practice partner from class.<br>\r\nThorough digestion is encouraged. <br>\r\nBecause of the constant teaching of new predators there will be quite a few of them so if plenty of them get digested there are more still lurking nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and please keep the characters roughly the same in each thread even if events play out very differently. That is if Kim is a short blonde who's afraid of horses in one thread then please keep her that way if you include her in other threads, similarly it would be convenient if she had the same friends and family members in all threads (ok so you can kill some off, but don't have a Stephanie big sister in one and Stephanie being the name of the mom in another.)<br>\r\nConsistency, like this enables writers and readers to get to know the characters better without expanding every thread into huge novels by themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOptions: <br>\r\nAt the end of every chapter a writer can usually leave two alternative options for readers to follow, or writers to add to. Please try to formulate these as character choices or similar non-predetermined outcome choices. <br>\r\nExample:<br>\r\n1: A thinks \"I should eat that damn B-itch!\" (alt: A tries to eat B.)<br>\r\n2: A thinks \"I don't dare, but B really deserves to get eaten.\" (alt: A decides now might not be the best time to eat B.)<br>\r\nThat is A LOT better than the nowadays common:<br>\r\n1: A eats B<br>\r\n2: B eats A<br>\r\nWhich both ruins the suspense of what\u2019s going to happen because the option is already a synopsis of the coming chapter, which also means that there\u2019s no freedom for the writer who would add to the chapter, meaning that those chapters are often left hanging.<br>\r\nThis is a classic occasion where I can mod, if you have a good idea to follow up on a chapter but the choices don\u2019t fit, I\u2019ll change the options in a jiffy, just write anyway and email or PM me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story was started before the stupid 10000 character limit rule, so I can't edit chapters that are larger than that. (Which is quite a few of the older ones. So unfortunately the options in those will remain weird.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and I still have a few ideas that I want to fit in, so if you add to the \"1\" option in the \u201c111111...\u201d-string at I <b>might</b> move your chapter to the \u201c2\u201d option, if it doesn\u2019t fit with the turn of events I have planned. <br>\r\nAny other threads, options and whatnot, are up for grabs though. \uf04a Please add and have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright on with the story:<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a strange feeling, she never knew what to expect and every year it was the same thing. Usually they\u2019d be well behaved, which was a load off her chest at any rate, but would they be interested and would they hold any potential at all? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor had to admit to herself that she was glad this wasn\u2019t taught at grade school level. Nowadays kids are obnoxious brats, granting them the knowledge and power that her students can archive if they are lucky and willing, is a nightmare she\u2019s glad she\u2019s not going to have to put up with. Although admittedly it would have meant that if some poor schmuck had gone through that hell before the students got to her she wouldn\u2019t have to start from scratch and risk losing the ones with potential to boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are two sides of every coin, there\u2019s no denying that, even if there are those who try hard to convince themselves and others otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s always the issue of how careful one should proceed, most girls probably don\u2019t know what class they\u2019ve signed up to, seeing as it\u2019s not really what\u2019s in the folders. <br>\r\nAlthough no doubt a few of them suspect as much seeing as that there aren\u2019t that many classes that have their students sign waivers of disclosure. Well there\u2019s a bit more than that in the waiver, but who reads them anyway? The important thing is that they\u2019re not allowed in class without having signed one, so that should be the end of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill there\u2019s always the risk of dropouts either from boredom if one proceed to slowly and on the other hand it\u2019s all too easy to scare students away as well, neither of course is desirable because you never know who it is that leaves. Losing a few good for nothing talent-less students she could care less about, but potential researchers for her team is another matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell there\u2019s no need stalling it any further.\u201d Professor Blainey thought to herself as she got up and straightened her suit before heading to the lecture hall. The teaching assistants should all ready be there and so should the new students for this year\u2019s vore class, or \u2018A feminist perspective on modern biology\u2019 with the course code v101 as it was listed in the catalogue it\u2019d all start as soon as she was ready and as far as she could tell she was.<br>\r\n</td>",
