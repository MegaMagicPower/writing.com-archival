Marge tried to keep her eyes closed out of fear off seeing what her outfit had become, however when Marge did open her eyes she was horrified to discover that her plain green dress, had been replaced with a sparkling and glittery tight black mini dress. Not only that but the dress was very tight around the waist and chest and left very little to the imagination. At this moment Marge also realised that she was not wearing her regular plain old white panties and bra, and where instead replaced by a black laced satin pair with a little heart on the front of them which even Marge could see due to how short the dress was. Not only that but Marge realised that she now had tons of silver bangles around her wrists, and that her finger nails were painted red. Also Marge realised that she now was holding a highly fashionable black mini purse that was filled with nothing but make up products. Finally Marge also caught on that her regular earrings and necklace had been replaced, as the pearl necklace now was a choke collar with diamonds on it, and her red earrings were replaced with silver hooped earrings, also Marge realised that her flat red heels had been replaced with a pair of glass platform heels. Needless to say Marge was feeling pretty embarrassed about her new appearance, and Helen was not helping.<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god Marge, you look so fashionable and sexy now\u201d heckled Helen as she laughed at marges humiliation.<br>\r\n\u201cFashionable? I look like some sort of hussy, oh please Helen change me back Please I\u2019m begging you, this is soooo humiliating\u201d cried Marge.<br>\r\nHowever Helen only chuckled at Marge\u2019s pleas for normality.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Honey, but no deal I love this new sexy look for you way to much\u201d giggled Helen, making Marge blush harder than she already was. \u201cNow what to change next about your life?\u201d Said Helen considering the cosmic power she held in her hand. Until she snapped her fingers and realised what to do next. \u201cI know I will change your profession, a stay at home housewife is such a boring job, let\u2019s make you do something more exciting\u201d laughed Helen as Marge only sat back in fear scared of how her life was going to change now.

We can really get creative here!\" Then she read on......\"Worms: Less Gummy, More Gooey\", \"Is this some kind of joke?\" \"They're all like that, Lisa. Just a bit too macabre for my taste, no pun intended.\" Nevertheless, Marge put them on a shelf with the rest of her cookbooks.

How about Carrot Cake?\"  The lights suddenly flickered in the kitchen. Marge and Lisa looked at each other quizzically.
