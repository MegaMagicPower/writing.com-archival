No matter how many times you do it, stepping into those lights makes you feel invigorated.  There is a little time to play to the crowd.  Chances are that most of them expect you to lose.  That does not matter though.  It is always more fun to surprise the crowd and it makes the experience a lot more entertaining for them as well.  Your opponent may have a few feet on you and his girth shows he is very successful, but there is no doubt in your mind that you will win this fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter playing to the crowd you take a much closer look at your opponent.  He is almost your opposite as far as fighters go.  Your well toned muscles are those of a quick and lethal predator while your opponent has the fat and slow, yet extremely muscular, body of someone that is used to using sheer overwhelming power.  By the way your opponent is licking his lips you can tell he expects you to make him just a little fatter and slower.  To you, the fat body looks absolutely delicious.  It will make for a nice meal to start out this tournament.  You will probably need the extra nutrients later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cage begins to lower.  It looks heavy enough to keep either of you from escaping.  There are long spikes all over the cage and you would be surprised if it was not electrified as well.  No escape, that is perfectly fine with you.  A few opponents in your past have managed to escape through the crowd and it is nice to know you did not have to worry about that here.  It is time to concentrate on the opponent before you now.  The bell will be ringing soon and you doubt he will hold back while you admire the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still need to come up with a strategy to beet the stegosaur before you.  He did not get that big by being stupid and careless.  There are a couple of ways you could go about this.  You could go on the offensive immediately and use your overwhelming speed to finish this match quickly.  It might be a good idea to stay on the defensive though.  You should be able to avoid anything he can throw at you and tire him out.  That way he would struggle less as he slide down your throat and all those spikes would be a little less uncomfortable as you added his own girth to your own.</span></div></div>",

Then add a quick double kick to his chest, staggering him. Carefullly avoiding his plates and spikes you continue to soften him up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast is already a few seconds behind you. Your kicks to his stomach make it wobble.. Your forclaws grab its head and start to wrench, continuing a frenzied assault. Even as you grapple you start tot taste that meaty armflesh, your tongue rubbing against it again and again, moaning at the pleasure.. The sweet hide just makes your drool run more and more.  perhaps you should do hit and runs.. but if you keep attacking you can trip him up.... You add a strong one two set of kicks to his knee, scoring telling blows, the feel of bone under the fat is quite obvious.</span></div></div>",

It will probably wear him out so he will not try to claw your throat on the way down.  The poor little guy never really stood a chance you laugh to yourself and lick your lips in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to penetrate the raptor when he starts chuckling.  That seems weird for somebody in his situation.  Then he says, \u201cYou leaf eaters are all the same, all brawn and no brains.  What do you think your dealing with, another one of your smooth footed companions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel something pointy against your leg.  Crap, you had forgotten about those lethal feet of his.  He had kicked you a few times, but it was his head he had been using as his primary weapon.  Now you had left your own leg open to a vicious attack from his free foot and the raptor was taking advantage of your carelessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a loud ripping sound as the raptor\u2019s claw tries to tear up your hamstrings.  You roll off of him before he can completely cripple one side of your body.  The cut was still bad.  Not bleed to death bad, but you were definitely going to be even slower on your feet than before.  That was not much of a disadvantage though.  Your back was well protected and he would have to come at you from the sides or come in for a head on attack.  The little raptor would also have to do a lot more damage to you than you would to him in order to take him down.  It would only be a matter of time before he made a mistake and you got your hands on him once more.  And your arms were perfectly fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raptor is charging, jaws agape.

The stegosaur tries to get anther headlock on you, but when you are within inches of him your jaws snap closed and you go for another kick to his injured leg.  You really dig in with your claws and he cries out in pain.  Then you dart back from him just before he can take your head off with his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stegosaur is now clearly unstable on that leg.  That should make it a lot easier for you to get off as many hit and run attacks as you want.  You would not want to get in his grip again.  It would not be good if he tried to rape you in the middle of the ring once more.  You are not really afraid of being raped, it is just that you have a little surprise for those that try to have sex you and want to keep it a secret until you encounter some of the larger opponents in this tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, what\u2019s the matter?  Does the big bad herbivore have a little trouble walking on that delicious looking leg?\u201d  You figure taunting will help make him a little sloppy.  The crowd is also cheering.  It seems that it has once again become a match of the little guy overcoming all odds to beat his monstrous opponent.  He might have the strength of an enraged opponent, but you are already faster than he is and you should be able to dodge him even better if he does not put much thought behind his attacks.  The stegosaur snorts and you think you have his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sprint back in and he looks a little better prepared for an attack to his legs, which is why you go for the arm you bit before.  This time you just bite down and try to swing your head back and forth to tear up the arm before backing up immediately.  You are not going to make the mistake of enjoying his flavor while he still has a free arm to grab you with.  That had been a stupid mistake and it had been embarrassing to get caught by the stegosaur that way.  Your raptor ancestors would be ashamed.  There will be plenty of time to enjoy his flavor once you have him sliding down your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way his arm looks; you might have actually hit something vital this time.  His arm is hanging limply and now he only has one good leg and one good arm.  You lick your lips, sensing a kill.  This might be over faster than you had thought it would be.  \u201cDid that hurt?  Don\u2019t worry; I\u2019m sure all the pain will go away after I\u2019ve digest you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You play to the crowd a little bit since the stegosaur is not going to be having any sudden bursts of speed.  The crowd loves it too.  None of them want the match to be over too soon anyways.  They want to get their moneys worth out of these fights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go in and delver a kick here, a bit there, and the occasional claw rake to the stegosaur.  The attacks do not do much damage, but the crowd has fun watching you do them while the stegosaur tries to grab you.  All of these attacks do serve to tire the stegosaur down as he continues to make angry, but sloppy, swings at you.  It eventually becomes so easy to dodge him that you are letting him come within inches of getting you before pulling away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go in for one more kick to his leg.  Right after you do so, you are taken by surprise as he attempts to lay on you.  There is just enough time to dance backwards before his immense weight flattens you.  That was a lot closer than you would like the crowd to think.  Then you notice the stegosaur is not getting back up.  He had not done that on purpose.  He had just fallen over and he did not look like he could get back up.  Beating up on a standing opponent was one thing, but the crowd would turn on him if he tormented someone who could not even stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to your fallen opponent.  He makes one more weak attempt to attack you with his good arm.  You just grab his arm and shove it in your mouth.  He tries to shake his arm out of your mouth, but he is too weak to do that anymore.  You swallow his arm all the way up to his shoulder.  Then your jaw starts to expand as you take his head and chest into your mouth.  Now is the time to savor your opponent, before you have to deal with those spikes.  Whatever the stegosaur has been eating has made for excellent seasoning.  This is one of the best stegosaurs you have ever eaten.  In fact, he tastes so good that you do not even notice when the spikes hit your throat.  The meal is just so delicious nothing else matters.  Your mouth and throat expand impossibly as you try to force a meal larger than you are into your belly.  Even the sounds of the roaring crowd do not register with you as you enjoy your victory.  All that is left of the stegosaur that is outside of you is his spiked tail.  It tries to use it to whack you in the side of the head in one more futile effort to defeat you and escape.  You had been anticipating that and caught his tail with your hands.  A few more gulps and you had slurped the tail down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only wish the stegosaur had been a little bigger.  It is a little sad that the meal has to over so soon.  You let out a satisfied belch and take a good look at yourself.  It looks like you have grown in more ways than one.  You are a couple feet taller than you had been and your belly still drags pleasantly against the floor.  As you lick your chops to and rub your belly happily with both hands as you let out another belch as you wait for the cage to rise so you can get out and the next match can begin.  This is a good way to start this tournament out.</span></div></div>",

It had been a while since you had been able to participate in something like this and an even longer time since you had been guaranteed to be able to introduce your opponent to your belly.  You had been so excited you put in a lot of extra training to prepare for this event.  Now not only were you 30 feet tall, now you had muscles on top of muscles.  You look at your opponent and your round belly gurgles in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that your opponent looks quick and lethal is lost on your stomach.  What matters to it is that your opponent looks like a long furry noodle.  The dragon may be longer than you are tall, but you still think you have the weight advantage due to how thin it is.  You wonder what its strategy will be to beat you.  Its limbs are a little short to defend that long body.  They are not that short, they just look that way compared to its body.  It just looks like it would be awkward to bring limbs placed so far apart into play in a fight.  If you could pin down one half of its body you doubt it would be able to do anything but lash at you with its tail.  You are pretty sure you could deal with that pain as you sucked him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bell rings you lick your lips in anticipation of a good meal and the many more meals to follow.  \u201cI hope I\u2019m not hungry half an hour after this match,\u201d you taunt the eastern dragon.  It does not look that bothered about what you just said.  Then again, dragons and other reptiles never show much emotion in your opinion.  Those stiff faces of theirs did not allow them to.  That does not matter much to you though.  Whether they have a stiff face or not is not important.  The only thing you care about is how they taste as they slide down your throat.</span></div></div>",

I just hope you don\u2019t taste as funny as you look,\u201d the dragon sneered.  You let the insult slide right off of you.  There had been a few opponents that managed to get their jaws around you in the past and they said you tasted quite nice.  Then you had gotten them off of you and sent their delicious bodies to your own stomach and thanked them for the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected things to go much the same this time.  Then again, if they do not go your way that means you will get digested so there is no point contemplating that future.  Well, it is time to get this match started.  You go right in on the attack.  The dragon looks like it is just waiting for you.  You will show it what a mistake it is to just wait for you to come and get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the dragon displays what it can do with that awkward looking body.  As you try to grab its head it leans back out of your reach.  You are not used to an opponent that can lean that far back while keeping the lower half of its body well within attack range.  A swift kick to your gut followed up with a tail lash make you pay for that mistake.  The dragon\u2019s tail is sort of whip like and it hurts a little more than you had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is not the best way for you to start out a match.  But, it looks like the dragon is about to make a mistake as well.  It looks like it is about to follow up on its attack with a punch or a grapple.  The dragon must not have fought a cave roo before because its head is on the same level as one of your more powerful kicks would be.  It had pretty much it admitted never tasting a cave roo before with its taunt and you doubt he was aware of how easily you could bring your large feet into play.  As the dragon comes in for his attack you lean back on your tail and aim both your feet at his head for one powerful kick.  The dragon did not see that coming, but it had some quick reflexes and only took a glancing blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and your opponent back away from each other while you really think about what it can do with that funny looking body.  By the way it is looking you up and down you think he is thinking the same about you.</span></div></div>",

When it dodged your attack it had to get in a pretty awkward position.  If you had been expecting that type of flexibility it would have been pretty easy to trip it up.  You thought of how you might be able to force it to dodge an attack the way you desired or force an awkward attack that would leave it off balance.  Then you would show that noodle what you could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon looks like it has thought of a strategy of attack as well.  It is charging you and it looks a lot faster than it had before.  You prepare to grapple with the dragon, but you have misread its intentions.  The dragon ducks under your arms and wraps itself around your body and uses its tail to trip up your legs.  You fall to the ground and the dragon performs one of the most complicated leglocks you have ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis might have been a good move to use against most opponents, but not you.  A move like this requires leverage, which the dragon did have, but they also required a lot of strength to maintain.  If you had not been training so much since you heard about this tournament this dragon might have had you.  But now you use some of the most powerful legs in the animal kingdom to break the hold and kick the dragon halfway across the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon is up and charging across the ring once more before you have a chance to get up.  You swing around and use your tail to try and trip it up before it can get near you.  It stops in time to keep from tripping and the upper half of its body moves in for the attack.  That is the mistake you had been looking for.  You spring into the air in hopes of landing on the dragon\u2019s midsection.  It is doubtful it will have to ability to force you off of him once you have him pinned to the mat under your bulk.</span></div></div>",

Even though you were a kangaroo most people just did not think something as massive as you could jump that high.  They should not underestimate kangaroos, especially ones that had survived long enough to get as large as you are.  Then you land right on the middle of the dragon\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is struggling beneath your weight as you sit on top of it.  You let him struggle for a while.  The best he can do is move a couple of inches across the mat.  This is perfect.  All his speed will not do him a bit of good in a situation like this.  Then again, there are only but so many things you can do to him as well.  Most submission moves you know would be very difficult to pull off on something with a body built like this dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon exhausts itself trying to escape while you sit around rubbing your chin and think about what to do with him.  It tries using its body like a whip to make you get off of him.  The position it is in is just too awkward for that to work at the moment.  If its\u2019 entire body was available to it that just might work.  For now, all it can do is annoy you.
