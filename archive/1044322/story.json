I knocked on her door and she seemed very eager to get me inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, come\" she said, acting a little too friendly as she took me into her spacious kitchen. \"Just stand over there, please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why over there??\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, just go\" she said, now begginning to physically shove me over to a spot in the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im not just gonna go!!\" I shouted at last, sort of throwing her arms off of me now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, sorry...\" she sighed, now going behind her cabinet to get something \"Guess I should have told you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim takes out a silver laser gun of some sort. I jump back startled but after a while of her not firing, I decide to hear her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I have to do a project for science...\" Kim explained \"And I decided for my project to shrink one of my friends...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What??\" I asked in shock \"You mean you wanna... make me small??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3 inches tall\" she answered \"But only for a while, pleeeease??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I dont know...\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked again and I...</span></div></div>",

Kim didn't seem quite as big as before.  But everything else was still huge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blast it,\" said Kim.  \"I just shrunk myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Kim's sister came rushing past us as she came home from a friend's house.  It felt like an earthquake.  When it was over, both Kim and I decided to make for the dollhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a lot, and I mean a lot, of hard work and walking for what seemed like miles, we reached Kim's room.  Luckily, Kim had a phone in her room, and we were able to climb the cord and get in the dollhouse.  We were both sweating profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick break, Kim showed me around the house.  Stan, the genius in our class, had helped her rig it with such things as running water and a miniature radio (he couldn't make a TV that small).  Kim had even put doll clothes in the closet.  After the tour was over, Kim grabbed a dress and disappeared into the shower to clean off all the sweat.  After she was done, I grabbed some doll jeans and a T-shirt and followed suit.  Surprisingly, the doll clothes fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of us were exhausted, and we realized that it was almost eleven at night.  Deciding that we'd worry about our \"small\" problem later, we made for the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd wouldn't you know it.  This humongous dollhouse (well, it seemed fairly large from our viewpoint), and the only beds were a crib for a baby doll and a double bed for Kim's husband and wife dolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim cast me an awkward look.  I cast one right back.  Neither of us was too thrilled about sharing the bed.  We may be good friends, but we weren't boyfriend/girlfriend.  At this point, I was too exhausted to care, and apparently so was she.  We flopped down and were asleep right away.</span></div></div>",

I could see Kim's mom, 20 years older than the last time I had seen her with my \"own\" eyes. I saw Stan and his family, strange that my friend Stan was my father. Everytime I looked into my new mother's eyes, I knew that Kim was behind them, watching me develop and hoping one day she was released from her perpetual prison also. It felt so terrible, worse than being imprisoned. I was there, right there! I knew who I was, knew what to say.... but I couldn't. Not yet. With the feelings of hope, weeks passed, and then months, soon years were flying by. I was such a well behaved baby. I could tell what was happening, and never made a mess or cried at night... or cried at all. I was making friends who were 2 or 3 years old, and to say the least, it was interesting. Then it finally came. I was walking through the house one day, when I tripped and my bottle flew out of my hands.<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" I squeaked. <br>\r\nWow. I think I'm the first baby in history to have a curse be his first word. Then a shadow loomed over me. I looked up to see \"mom\" looking at me, frowning.<br>\r\n\"No, no, we don't say that w..... Oh...oh my god!!!! Stan! Stanley! He talked! HE TALKED!!!!!!\"<br>\r\nIndeed I did.... perhaps, when I can force more words out, I'll tell my story to them.

How is this possible?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" began stan, \"I think your soals mended together upone injestion.It makes sense if you think about it. Once they were inside of you, you began to digest their physical being but not their mental being. So the mntal being needed somplace to go, so it went into your mind, they have been able to see and feel what you have been doing this whole time, as if it were them doing it.\" Marissa just sat there mesmerized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"still the genius you always have been!\" i said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I am so sorry...\" she began\"...i ruined your lives and prcticaly killed you, and kim is till inside me...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yes,' i replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i am going to fix this!\" said stan \"i must fix this, i am sure i know how to create a machine that will set back time, i just need the right material.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"are you sure that is possible?\" i asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well, i helped make a shrink ray, That is even less possible.\" And with that he rushed out of the room, and i continued to live my life as a young kid. We haldly ever saw stan for the next year, but we knew that he was doing what was right, and i knew Kim knew what was happening, i saw it every time i looked into Marissa's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It was a cold december when stan announced his discovery. He told use he had developed a machien that will turn back time, and leave our memories blank of all time in between. It works by spinning a large barrel inside, causing a gravitational pull, then magnetic fields bend this gravity in one direction to foarce a large arm to spin at great speeds. These speeds should bend time enough to send everything back, depending on what speed it is spinning at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"okay, according to my findings, the set speed will send everything back to the day of the experiment, lets just hope that it goes differently....\" stan said, and with that he flipped the switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"so what did you want me to do for this experiment?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i was going to try to shrink you, but for some reason all the power got sucked out of the ray gun, as well as every other battery in the house, and the car battery. And according to the news, every other battery in the world. stan said it was caused by some large bending in the fabric of th universe that needed allot of power\" replied Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well who cares, for all we know he could have caused it, want to go get a pizza?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ok\" Replied kim. Then you both left and walked dow the street, the whole 24 years wiped from your memories.</span></div></div>",

I backed off a bit, feeling embarassed she had seen me peek but that was the least of my worries for the moment... I was getting SHORTER!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats what you get, you perv!\" Brittany sighed, seeming to look at me and point her view down more. The more she stared down, the further DOWN I got, until I was only a few inches high. \"Now come here, you!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down and plucked me off the ground squeezing me tightly between 2 of her now massive fingers. I screamed and squirmed as she dropped me into her palms. I was completely helpless now as she stared down at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, LITTLE pervert\" Brittany said with a satisfied smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...ok... Brittany...\" I stuttered \"Ive uh...learned my lesson,okay? Please... unshrink me now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I dont think so...\" Brittany said with an evil smile on her face \"Youre gonna STAY small... for a couple days at least\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...? No!\" I gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet, gnat\" Brittany yelled. Of course she referred to me, as I was now about the size of a gnat. She couldve squished me if she wanted but apparently she took more joy in seeing me live as a bug. She now plucks me again and plunks me on the floor. \"See ya, short stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left me on the floor... I couldnt believe it!! I was so tiny now!! Then...</span></div></div>",
