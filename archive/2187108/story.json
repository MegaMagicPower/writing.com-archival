            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mick (5'7'' 20 years old): An average looking guy and quite short for his age. He is skinny but still has some muscle, has dark blond hair and prefers to spend his days playing games and listening to music.

She attends high school and everyone knows her due to her desire to always be noticed. She's skinny but has some nice feminine shapes, has long blonde hair and sings in her spare time with some friends and her boyfriend in a small band.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before we begin, some descriptions for side characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa(5'6'' 19 years old): Alexa was a new friend for Mick, they'd been partnered up on some projects and hit it off pretty well.<br>\r\nShe was almost the same height at 5'6'' and was quite skinny. She has some perky B-cup breasts and long red hair flowing down. She is currently 19 and was just like Mick in freshman year of college. She is a jeans kind of girl, likes to wear feminine shirts, jeans and shorts, but almost never wears a skirt and is a very modest type of girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish(5''5' 20 years old): She'd been a bit of a loner but did know how to enjoy herself. She usually wears black clothes ranging from jeans to shorts and tops that weren't slutty, but were still feminine enough. She is quite skinny, but also kind of pale. She has black hair in a ponytail and was quite creative but shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrissie(5''7' 19 years old): She is very vocal and outgoing, always trying out crazy stuff. She has beautiful legs and smooth skin as well a pair of C-cup breasts she loved showing off.. She has wavy blond hair and can get a bit of an attitude if things don't go her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooklyn(5\"7' 20 years old): Blonde way out of Mick's league, or so he thought. She was quite down to earth and very friendly with everyone in addition to having good looks. A radiant smile could almost always be found on her pretty face, which was framed by her long, straight blonde hair that reached halfway down her back. She lives in the same building as Mick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddy(5''6' 19 years old): A cool, energetic tomboy Mick also found quite attractive. She wasn't extremely boyish looking, but she wasn't incredibly feminine either, not one to wear skirts or dresses ever. In terms of looks, Maddy was less curvy than Brooklyn, but she was still a looker. She had a great butt and perky B-cup breasts too. As usual, her shoulder-length dark brown hair was pulled back into a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah(5\"5' 19 years old): She is more of a cute nerdy type. She is somewhere between Brooklyn and Maddy on the femininity spectrum. She has black hair cut in a feminine bob style and she wears designer glasses. She had the most slender build of the three girls and she had B-cup breasts like Maddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, how does our trait swapping story start?</span></div></div>",

She had some perky B-cup breasts and long red hair flowing down. She was currently 19 and was just like Mick in freshman year of college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today was rough, glad we got to hang out during most of it to work on our project together.\" She said as she placed her bag in font of her.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, same, so glad it's almost weekend.\" Mick sighed as she relaxed a little.<br>\r\n\"You doing anything this weekend?\" Alexa asked curiously.<br>\r\n\"Not sure yet, was just planning to hang at home honestly.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't have anything planned either, just sit around in sweat pants all day maybe.\" She giggled as she looked down at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa was currently wearing some dark blue skinny jeans, hugging her legs tightly, she was wearing some ankle high boots and had a black and pink hoodie on with a tank top underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look nice though, would much prefer to see you in those skinny jeans.\" Mick said jokingly teasing her.<br>\r\n\"You don't know what it's like to wear these clothes, they're fine for school and they fit fine, but at home, most girls prefer to wear something a little more comfortable, not like you guys have that issue.\" She explained as she looked over Mick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick was wearing some gray guy skinny jeans, but not quite as skinny as her own obviously, they didn't quite hug the legs as much. He was also wearing some black sneakers, a light gray t-shirt and a black jacket. He preferred darker colors and often wore stuff like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I don't have to deal with it, my jeans are still comfortable enough at home.\" Mick teased as he just received a glare from Alexa.<br>\r\n\"Hey Mick? Would you mind hanging out tonight?\" Alexa suddenly asked, much to Mick's surprise.<br>\r\n\"Sure, sounds like a lot of fun.\" Mick smiled back causing Alexa to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa's smile however, quickly turned into a grin as she nudged Mick in the side and got ready to whisper something in his ear.<br>\r\n\"Since we still have a way to go until our stop, the bus is really quiet and because your clothes are apparently so comfortable, I kind of want to try out your ..... \" She whispered as Mick's eyes widened.</span></div></div>",

Mick's jeans fit Alexa pretty well, as they were very close in size. Alexa got comfortable quickly as she saw Mick pull up her jeans over his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick managed to put on Alexa's jeans with some effort, able to pull them up with minimal struggle. The jeans were a bit shorter than his own, but he managed to close the zipper, button up and close the belt, but he did have a bulge visible in his new tight jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I look good in these.\" Mick declared as he felt the denim on his legs. He enjoyed the tight feeling of Alexa's jeans, it turned him on, especially because they were Alexa's.<br>\r\n\"The front pockets are too small though.\" Mick continued as he placed his phone in his back pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit they look good on you.\" Alexa giggled. \"These are much better than sweatpants by the way.\" She continued as she admired her roomy pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them relaxed a bit and started to talk about games and music, which were interests they both shared.<br>\r\nAfter a good few minutes of getting a bit closer....</span></div></div>",

I still have your jeans on!\" Mick said nervously as Alexa grabbed her bag and got up.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but we don't have time to swap back, you're going to have to keep my jeans until tonight, but I am not complaining!\" Alexa grinned as she looked at Mick's jeans on her legs.<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, my place or yours?\" Mick asked as she started to walk away to get off the bus.<br>\r\n\"Yours if that's okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, see you after dinner?\"<br>\r\n\"See you tonight!\" Alexa smiled and got off the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick watched Alexa get on her bike and waved back at him as she left. As he noticed his own jeans being worn by her, he looked down to see her jeans still on his own legs.<br>\r\nHe didn't hate the feeling however, they were still warm from her wearing them when they switched, it actually turned him on because of it.<br>\r\nHe rubbed his legs through the tight jeans and softly touched the bulge in his crotch area as stealthily as possible, which instantly started to shift it's position.<br>\r\n\"I have to admit, this feels nice.\" Mick thought to himself as he shifted a bit in his seat.<br>\r\nAs he was listening to some music, the bus arrived at Mick's stop and he grabbed his bag to get out. At first he tried to put his phone in his front pocket, but quickly realized he was wearing Alexa's jeans and put it in his back pocket instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got off the bus and drove home on his bike Mick got some stares from some cute girls, but everyone else seemed to either not notice his girly jeans or just didn't care.<br>\r\nHe arrived at his student home, parked and locked his bike and got inside. It was quiet as not many fellow students were home, it was Friday after school and most of them went home to their family, but due to the distance and because of his friends here, Mick stayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the fridge, grabbed a beer and sat down on his couch and turned on his game station. Before deciding on a game to play, he took this time to look over his new jeans. He looked in the mirror and checked out how they looked. They didn't look that bad actually, due to his slender frame they fit him pretty well, apart from the bulge in front. He did also notice his underwear causing some lines to appear as well, but he hadn't noticed until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment he considered grabbing a new pair of his own jeans, but decided he liked wearing Alexa's a lot and decided to at least wait for her to show up tonight. After making himself a quick dinner, he started to play some games while waiting for Alexa until...</span></div></div>",

Can I grab you a drink?\" Mick asks as Alexa relaxes.<br>\r\n\"Just some soda would be fine if it isn't too much trouble.\" She quickly responded.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Mick said as he went and grabbed a can of cola from the fridge and set it in front of Alexa as they sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they started doing anything, Mick saw Alexa starting to undo her belt.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Mick asked a bit confused.<br>\r\n\"Don't you want these back?\" Alexa asked, even more confused.<br>\r\n\"Well, honestly I kind of like wearing yours and it's not like anyone else can see us here...\" Mick said causing a smile to appear on Alexa's face as she quickly tightened the belt again.<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect you to sat that.\" Alexa said giggling.<br>\r\n\"Yours do look better on me anyway.\" Mick said with a smirk.<br>\r\nAlexa just rolled her eyes at the comment and took off her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that is why you didn't take them off yet?\" Alexa asked as they started playing a game together.<br>\r\n\"Didn't feel like I needed to, like I said, I'm comfortable with yours.\" Mick said as he shifted position a little.<br>\r\n\"Same here, I like yours.\" Alexa smiled as she poked Mick in the side to get an advantage in the game.<br>\r\n\"Hey, not fair!\" Mick said as he poked her back, causing her to simply giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter playing games for about an hour they decided to do something else instead, quickly resulting in them watching a movie when cuddling on the couch, something they hadn't done before.<br>\r\n\"Is it just me or is it getting hot in here?\" Alexa asked after cuddling for about half an hour.<br>\r\n\"I'd like to think we both are.\" Mick replied as Alexa let out a smile.<br>\r\n\"Not quite what I meant.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's because of your hoodie, it looks quite comfortable and warm.\" Mick said noticing the black and pink hoodie she was still wearing.\"<br>\r\n\"Might be, but like you said, it's comfortable.\" Alexa admitted.<br>\r\n\"I have a suggestion.\" Mick said as Alexa looks at him in anticipation.<br>\r\n\"How about we.....\" Mick suggested.</span></div></div>",

Regardless it felt really comfortable and was still warm from when Mick was wearing it. She gave it a quick sniff and quickly grabbed her tank top and pulled it over Mick's head from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what are you doing.\" Mick asked surprised.<br>\r\n\"Just sit still, let me help you.\" Alexa said giggling as she (forcibly) helped Mick put on her tight tank top.<br>\r\nShe really enjoyed how it looked on him, her tank looked great on his chest, though a bit too short, and fitted quite nicely.<br>\r\nAlexa attempted to touch as much of his chest as possible while she was putting the tank on him, slowly getting turned on by seeing Mick in her clothes and the warm feeling of wearing Mick's clothes herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards she grabbed the black and pink hoodie and pulled it over Mick's head and guided his arms though the tight sleeves, touching them as much as possible of course. Finally she straightened out both the tank top and the hoodie and managed to get them looking pretty nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so cute in my hoodie!\" Alexa said as she looked over her tight girly hoodie, now being worn by Mick. She could still see a bulge in the skinny jeans Mick was wearing, causing her to blush, apparently she wasn't the only one enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't have to help me put it on, but I do admit you were right, this is comfortable.\" Mick admitted as he looked over himself.<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to help you, but you look so cute.\" Alexa said as got back into position for a cuddle, which Mick gladly accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really enjoying wearing girl clothes aren't you?\" Alexa said grinning.<br>\r\n\"Only because they are your clothes, wouldn't wear them otherwise I can promise you that.\" Mick said proudly dismissing Alexa's suspicions.<br>\r\n\"And why is that?\" Alexa asked as she started to giggle.<br>\r\n\"It's hard to explain, just the thought I guess, that I am wearing your clothes specifically.\" Mick tried to explain. \"That's not to say they're not comfortable though, I like them a lot.\" Mick continued causing Alexa to move into a tighter cuddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you like wearing my clothes so much, how about we finish what we started?\" Alexa suggested with a grin.<br>\r\n\"You mean like shoes and jackets and stuff?\" Mick asked obviously knowing what she was getting at, but didn't want to admit.<br>\r\n\"Well, that too, but I was thinking a bit more.... personal.\" She said as she showed a bit of her panties to Mick.<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure about that Alexa.\" Mick said as he looked at the piece of clothing Alexa was showing him.<br>\r\n\"Come on, don't be a wuss.\" Alexa teased poking at Mick's pride.<br>\r\nAfter thinking it over one more time.....</span></div></div>",

He quickly laid down the jeans on his bed as he proceeded to take off his gray boxers, this was easily done without taking a lot of effort. Decided it wasn't necessary quite yet to take off the hoodie, but still took off his socks and laid them down. <br>\r\nMick grabbed a blanket and signaled Alexa to come back in as he went outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was quick.\" Alexa said as Mick stepped out.<br>\r\n\"Didn't have that much to take off yet.\" Mick smirked as Alexa grinned and went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa started as well with taking off Mick's jeans and laying them down, stripping out of them fairly easily. She then proceeded to wiggle herself out of her pink panties and laid them with her skinny jeans, which Mick laid on his bed.<br>\r\nShe then proceeded to grab Mick's boxers and easily slid them over her legs, making her very comfortable and excited at the same time. She quickly slid on Mick's jeans once again as she took off his T-shirt and laid it down on the bed separate from the other pieces. She unhooked her pink matching bra and laid it with the panties and the jeans. She then put Mick's shirt back on causing her breasts to jiggle during the process. Lastly she took off her socks and put on Mick's without much effort and looked over herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa was now completely dressed in Mick's clothes and they fit her decently well. She admired her now look for a moment until she went back outside and told Mick to get dressed again.<br>\r\nMick just nodded, not saying a word as he knew what he had to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mick stepped back into the room he looked over at the bed and saw Alexa's panties, bra, skinny jeans and socks laying there taunting him. He took a deep breath as he dropped the blanket which was covering his naked bottom halve and looked at the pink panties he was supposed to put on.<br>\r\n\"Damn it Alexa.\" Was all that went through his head as he slid the panties over his legs. As soon as he put them on he was filled with a mix of emotions. On one hand he was now wearing Alexa's soft panties, immensely turning him on, but on the other hand, this caused the panties to be even tighter for him, making him uncomfortable at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he controlled himself again, Mick grabbed Alexa's skinny jeans and once again slid them on, taking a bit more effort due to his boner. He was very lucky Alexa was close to his size and had a slender waist like him, or the jeans wouldn't have fit as well as they did. He proceeded to finish dressing his bottom halve by putting on Alexa's tiny socks and was now fully dressed, apart from the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to put on the bra, Mick took off the black and pink hoodie and the tank underneath it as well, going much more smoothly now that Alexa wasn't \"helping\" him. He laid them down on his bed once again and grabbed the bra.<br>\r\nMick struggled with trying to put it on for a minute before walking towards to door and letting Alexa in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why did you let me in, you're not completely dressed yet?\" Alexa asked confused as Mick showed her the bra.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to need your help with this, can you show me how to put it on properly.\" Mick said blushing as he handed the bra to Alexa.<br>\r\n\"It's not going to fit you well, due to you not having breasts and a slightly broader chest, but we'll manage, let me show you.\" Alexa said giggling as she instructed Mick to turn around and showed him to to put on the bra.<br>\r\nOnce it was on, Mick realized she was right, it didn't fit perfectly and was slightly too tight, but somehow she did mange to put it on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is very tight.\" Mick said as he put the tank top and hoodie back on as well.<br>\r\n\"The bra? I told you.\" Alexa said with a smirk.<br>\r\n\"Everything actually, but I am not complaining really.\" Mick said proudly as he finished putting the hoodie back on.<br>\r\n\"I can see that.\" Alexa said as she pointed towards the obvious bulge Mick now had.<br>\r\n\"Your panties and jeans don't really contain it very well okay?\" Mick said blushing again as Alexa made him spin around.<br>\r\n\"Your ass looks nice in my jeans.\" Alexa nodded with a smirk.<br>\r\n\"Just glad they fit well, much more comfortable than I initially expected.\" Mick admitted as Alexa giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, it is getting a bit late, but this was a lot of fun.\" Alexa said sadly as she hugged Mick as an indication she has to leave.<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do about our clothes?\" Mick asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, we could swap back if you want, or we can keep them a bit longer?\" Alexa asked with a massive grin.</span></div></div>",

However we don't have to decide right now.\" Mick said with a smile.<br>\r\n\"I'm still not sure what you're getting at.\" Alexa said placing her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n\"How about you stay over tonight?

Well, that has to be your jeans I think.\" Mick admitted as he looked away awkwardly.<br>\r\n\"My jeans? Really?\" Alexa replied surprised.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're tighter than my own, but I really love the feeling of wearing them, I liked it most when we just swapped them however, when they were still warm from you wearing them.\" Mick admitted as his face turned to red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you enjoy feeling my warmth?\" Alexa said as she moved closer towards Mick.<br>\r\n\"You could say that.\" Mick said as he stared back into her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Well, swapping clothes seems to really turn you on, so I wonder what this will do to you.\" Alexa said as she kissed Mick on his lips.<br>\r\nMick was caught off guard at first but quickly kissed her back as they started to lock into a passionate kiss with Alexa laying on top of him. Mick felt the tightness in his panties and jeans increase only more as Alexa's tongue entered his mouth.<br>\r\nAs their steamy kiss came to and end and both went back into a cuddling position, Mick felt Alexa rub the bulge which was very visible in his skinny jeans.<br>\r\n\"It's not just your ass that looks great in my jeans.\" Alexa grinned as she put her other arm around Mick's waist.<br>\r\n\"But you ass still feels better.\" Mick grinned as he slid his hand into the back of his former pants and squeezed Alexa's tight butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a bad time to tell you I have a boyfriend?\" Alexa suddenly said.<br>\r\nMick's face turned completely pale as his heart dropped to his nut sack. He just looked at her with look of Horror as he basically turned into a statue.<br>\r\n\"Or well, at least it looks like I am about to have one.\" Alexa grinned as she softly squeezed the bulge she was rubbing and instantly saw Mick's face turn from horror to relief.<br>\r\n\"You almost gave me a damn heart attack.\" Mick said a bit upset as Alexa giggled.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I mean, I might be lying.\" She said sheepishly as she bit her lip.<br>\r\n\"You're not.\" Was all Mick said as he moved in for another kiss, which Alexa gladly accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another steamy kiss they laid down cuddling on bed with Alexa still stroking Mick's bulge and Mick still squeezing Alexa's ass. They spent most of the night cuddling, doing poses for each other and getting used to each other and each other's clothes.<br>\r\n\"I have to say, after wearing them for the night, I'm in love with this feeling.\" Mick said as he admired his new look.<br>\r\n\"Wearing girl clothes?\" Alexa asked laughing.<br>\r\n\"Not just that, wearing your clothes specifically, swapping with you.\" Mick tried to explain.<br>\r\n\"So you like the thought of wearing my clothes huh? Good, I like the thought of wearing yours too.\" Alexa said seductively as gave Mick a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we strip out of these clothes and get under some sheets together.\" Mick said seductively back to her.<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a good idea.\" Alexa said as they stripped out of each other's clothes and laid next to each other in Mick's bed, which was a bit small for both of them, so they had to cuddle very closely all night, which neither of them really minded as they kept feeling each other up all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, Mick woke up first. Alexa still had her arms around him as she was peacefully still sleeping. Both of them went to bed naked, so all of their clothes, including their underwear was laying on the chair next to them. Mick gave Alexa a quick peck on the forehead before slowly getting out of bed without waking her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got out of bed, Mick grabbed......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mick considered grabbing his own clothes at first, but after seeing Alexa's clothes laid next to them, with him having worn them most of yesterday, he was starting to get used to them, really like them even. So Mick wasted no more time as he quietly grabbed his new girlfriend's clothes without waking her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed Alexa's pink panties as he once again slid them on, causing him to instantly feel excitement as they made contact with his skin. Along with the panties, Mick grabbed Alexa's bra and, thanks to her teachings yesterday, managed to put it on without too much difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing happily dressed in his girlfriend's pink underwear, he squeezed his legs into the tight dark blue skinny jeans as it tightly hugged his legs and waist. He closed the zipper, buttoned them up and continued by putting on her tiny socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his bottom halve being dressed, Mick grabbed Alexa's tight tank top and pulled it over his head as it stopped just a bit shy of the waistline of the jeans, showing a little bit of skin. He then continued on by putting on Alexa's pink sweater again as he felt it's warmth covering his arms and chest, just barely meeting up with his waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick looked over himself and couldn't help but smile as he was now once again dressed in his girlfriend's clothes, still enjoying the feeling.<br>\r\nEven though they were a bit tight, Mick loved wearing her clothes, not just for the feeling of the clothes themselves, but also because of the thought that they are hers, which was what made it so exciting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick looked back at his bed to see Alexa still peacefully sleeping. He gave her a quick kiss on the forehead as he left the room. Mick had a student home, which meant that he has to share a bathroom and kitchen with the other students there, which was a bit risky in his current situation as he was a bit nervous for anyone to see him like this, but he took the chance regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Mick arrived in the shared kitchen, no one was there and most of the rooms seemed empty. Most of the other students had already left to spend time with their family and the ones that were back, were still sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Alexa woke up in Mick's bed and attempted to grab him for a hug, but because Mick had already gotten out, she couldn't.<br>\r\nAs soon as she realized this, Alexa reluctantly got out as well, but seeing only Mick's clothes laid on the ground instantly made her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly grabbed Mick's comfortable boxers and pulled them up over her hips, smiling as she put them on. At first she started searching for a bra, but she quickly realized Mick would be wearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dressed in her boyfriend's comfy underwear, Alexa grabbed his jeans and slid them on, struggling a little to get her hips in them comfortably. She tightened the belt to get the jeans as tight around her waist as she was used to and straightened out the pant legs as she put on Mick's warm socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, she grabbed her boyfriend's tight fitting light gray t-shirt as well and pulled it over her head, messing up her hair slightly. She could feel her breasts jiggling underneath the shirt as she walked around, admiring the clothes she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, as Alexa was about to search for Mick, the door to the room opened as Mick entered with two plates of eggs and bacon.<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're up.\" Mick said with a smile as he sat down the plates on a table in his room.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I saw you got out and took my clothes, so I decided I might as well get dressed in yours.\" She winked as she gave her boyfriend a kiss.<br>\r\n\"I don't mind, you look cute in mine.\" Mick said back kissing her again.<br>\r\n\"You look good in mine too.\" Alexa winked as she smacked his ass.<br>\r\n\"Hey, is that the thanks I get for making you breakfast?\" Mick said grinning.<br>\r\n\"Don't lie, you liked that, besides, your fault, if you didn't want me to do that, you shouldn't have squeezed your ass into my tight jeans.\" Alexa giggled.<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" Mick said as he sat down to eat breakfast, quickly being joined by Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes after they were done eating, Alexa got a text as she was admiring their continued outfit swap, so she was slightly annoyed at receiving it because it took her out of her \"concentration\".<br>\r\n\"My parents are asking if I'm going to come home today.\" Alexa said with a slightly annoyed tone.<br>\r\n\"Do you want to go?\" Mick asked curiously. <br>\r\n\"I kind of do, but I want to spend the day with you as well.\" She said softly as she invited Mick to cuddle.<br>\r\n\"If you want to go I can go see my parents as well, they might find it nice to see me home. We have both been spending a lot of time in our student homes instead of with our parents these last few weeks.\" Mick said as he put his arm around his girlfriend.<br>\r\n\"I wonder what they will think of their son dressed as his girlfriend.\" Alexa grinned as Mick got slightly worried.<br>\r\n\"It'll be fine, I'm sure they'll like you too and they are not that difficult at all, so if I can explain it well, they won't really mind.\" Mick explained as Alexa gripped him tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you come with me? To meet my parents?\" Alexa suddenly said with a massive smile.<br>\r\n\"Meet your parents? Like this? So soon?\" Mick said nervously.<br>\r\n\"Why not? It could be fun, besides, it might be more comfortable for us to be like this together.\" Alexa reasoned.<br>\r\n\"I agree, though you should meet my parents too, I'm sure they'll just love you.\" Mick said as he kissed her on the cheek.<br>\r\n\"But I have you for that.\" Alexa said grinning.<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean like I do, at least, I hope not.\" Mick said as he shuddered.<br>\r\n\"But you're right, maybe it would be fun for them to see me too.\" Alexa said admitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple discussed their options for a little bit, eventually deciding to....</span></div></div>",

Though not as \"crazy\" looking, Alexa still looked out of character in Mick's looser jeans, socks, shirt and even boxers, which weren't visible of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's our plan?

Mick just nodded as he grabbed some other stuff like a toothbrush and other miscellaneous stuff he might need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm ready.\" Mick said looking over his stuff.<br>\r\n\"I don't think I need to bring anything, I still have some stuff over there.\" Alexa said as she grabbed the dirty plates they had remaining from breakfast.<br>\r\n\"Sure, if you need something of mine you can always just ask.\" Mick said as Alexa just nodded with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning the plates and grabbing everything like keys and money and the couple was about to leave and head to Alexa's parents.<br>\r\n\"Wait, we still have one thing to discuss before we leave.\" Mick said as he stopped at the door.<br>\r\n\"What would that be?\" Alexa asked confused.<br>\r\n\"Are we going to wear each other's jackets and shoes too?\"<br>\r\n\"I assumed so, but my shoes may be a bit small for you.\" Alexa giggled.<br>\r\n\"So are these jeans, but they fit.\" Mick said feeling the soft fabric on his legs.<br>\r\n\"And they look good on you too.\" Alexa flirted back as she slapped Mick's ass while giggling, causing him to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do?\" Mick asked pointing at their leather jackets, his sneakers and Alexa's boots.<br>\r\n\"How about we just wear.....\" Alexa suggested.</span></div></div>",

Then your feet won't hurt too badly.\" Alexa suggested as Mick nodded in agreement.<br>\r\nAlexa then took Mick's leather jacket while Mick took her tight blue jacket.<br>\r\n\"Not bad.\" Mick said as she straightened out the jacket as much as he could.<br>\r\n\"Not bad at all.\" Alexa giggled as she kissed her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were ready to head out, they took the first bus available and headed towards Alexa's parents, both really curious about their reaction. The bus was kind of busy, mostly consisting on college girls as most of them either giggled or simply stared at the couple. Alexa simply grinned back and squeezed Mick's ass through her tight jeans as Mick was simply feeling embarrassed to be wearing his girlfriend's clothes in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they found a seat, they say next to each other and quickly took up a cuddling position with Alexa quickly dosing off with her head resting against Mick's chest. A girl next to them started to whisper to him once Alexa nodded off. \"Why are you wearing that girl's clothes.\" She giggled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked to be fairly popular, she was dressed in a tight blue denim mini skirt, a pink tee, some black boots and had a visible amount of makeup on.<br>\r\nThe boyfriend looked to be your stereotypical \"cool\" guy. Was wearing a black sports jacket and white shirt with a pair of black sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is my girlfriend, we swapped clothes because we love each other and want to feel close to each other. These days a lot of loving couples are doing it, you're simply not as in touch with your partner if you don't\" Mick said without hesitation as he softly shook Alexa, waking her up without the other couple noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right, I would have heard about that.\" She then said with a bitchy tone, clearly insecure.<br>\r\n\"Apparently not, maybe you're just not as in touch as you think.\" Mick sneered, trying to convince her she was missing out on a new trend.<br>\r\nHe then saw her starting to become more unsure of herself, so Mick decided to push her a little further. <br>\r\n\"Not like you could ever convince your boyfriend to swap with you, he probably doesn't love you enough to wear your skirt. You probably are also too proud to wear his as well.\" Mick said as a final nail in the coffin<br>\r\nKnowing these girls were always a pain to deal with in his past, a little payback couldn't hurt. Seeing the girl insecurely staring it them, Mick simply kissed Alexa on the cheek as he pretended to nod off as well, but he did keep an eye on them for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, moments later, the girl started to whisper to her boyfriend. Mick saw his eyes widen as she was whispering to him, which gave Mick a suspicion as to what it was she was talking about. This continued for a good few minutes until finally, after checking if no one would notice them, he saw the boyfriend very reluctantly nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick's plan worked, the girl slowly took off her tight skirt and her gorgeous legs were now completely bare, though not like they were that covered to begin with. The guy took off his slacks, while softly complaining as he reluctantly passed them to his bitchy girlfriend, while he got her skirt in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy then looked like he was in hell as he squeezed himself into his girlfriend's extremely short skirt, while she was finding much more comfort in his black slacks. The guy's hairy legs looked awful with the skirt and unfortunately for him, his beautiful girl's legs were now completely covered, which pissed him off a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then proceeded to take off her pink girly tee and passed it to her boyfriend, he then took off his white tee and black sports jacket and reluctantly gave them to his girl. He then started to put on his girlfriend's pink tee, while she was putting on his tee and sports jacket instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I saw they were done for now, I pretended to just wake up and so did Alexa and the result was hilarious. The girl was looking back with an extremely smug look on her face, thinking she \"beat\" them, while the guy just tried to avoid eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick and Alexa had to resist to immense urge to laugh, but instead Alexa just whispered \"I love you so much.\" Into Mick's ear and she kissed him very passionately, to which the couple quickly reacted by kissing as well.<br>\r\nA couple stops later, the couple got off as the girl still had a big smug on her face, while the guy looked extremely uncomfortable walking in her denim mini skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should put you in a skirt as well.\" Alexa teased as Mick just started laughing.<br>\r\n\"I prefer these skinny jeans, thank you.\" Mick smiled as he thought at how stupid the boyfriend looked, almost feeling sorry for him.<br>\r\n\"I might not give you a choice.\" She giggled as Mick rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n\"At least I would make it look good.\" Mick bragged as Alexa giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, they arrived at their stop and after only a few more minutes of walking hand in hand, they arrived at Alexa's home. Mick looked over himself one more time before taking another step. He was now wearing Alexa's tight dark blue skinny jeans, which reached to about his ankles, he was wearing his own shoes, but his socks were clearly Alexa's. He felt the tight pink underwear squeezing in the front of the jeans as well as the bra straps digging into his chest, all while also wearing her tank top and pink hoodie as well as her light blue jacket, which he left open due to it being relatively warm today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa looked over herself as well, she was wearing her boyfriend's clothes in return. She was wearing Mick's darker gray jeans, fitting a bit looser than her own, she was also wearing his nicely fitting light gray shirt, as well as his socks, while still having her own boots on. Her hips were snugly dressed in Mick's comfortable boxers while her breasts were freely rubbing against the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing.\" Alexa said as Mick nodded.<br>\r\nAlexa opened up the back door with Mick following closely behind her. They were entering the living room when they saw her parents sitting on the couch watching TV.<br>\r\n\"I'm home! And I brought my boyfriend, this is Mick!\" Alexa said with a happy tone causing them to turn around to welcome their guests.<br>\r\nBefore saying a word, both of them looked at a loss for words as they saw her daughter and her new boyfriend dressed in each other's clothes.<br>\r\n\"What do you think of our little swap.\" Alexa then smiled while striking a pose.<br>\r\nAfter few minutes of exchanging looks, the parents....</span></div></div>",

He had short black hair and some scruff on his face, but he was always kind to his wife and daughter and only wanted the best for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like he didn't like our outfit change.\" Alexa giggled as her mom inspected Mick.<br>\r\n\"He's a very traditional man, you understand how he is.\" Mona said as she instructed Mick to do a spin, to which he awkwardly complied.<br>\r\n\"Young man, why did you and my daughter swap clothes anyway?\" She then asked as she walked over to Alexa.<br>\r\n\"It kind of started out as curiosity and more of a joke by swapping pants, but we kind of ended up swapping everything else as well and we liked it.\" Alexa then jumped in as Mick nodded.<br>\r\n\"I see, well I do have to say you both look very cute.\" Mona smiled. \"I'm going to go see your father real quick, you two have fun.\" She then said as she winked at Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom is cool.\" Mick said with a smile as Alexa nodded.<br>\r\n\"She thinks you look cute in my clothes too.\" She replied poking him.<br>\r\n\"I always look cute.\" Mick said as he wiggled his ass in Alexa's skinny jeans as she gave a big smack on it.<br>\r\n\"Hey, that actually hurt.\" Mick said as he rubbed his butt.<br>\r\n\"You asked for it.\" Alexa giggled as she took Mick's hand and dragged him up to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they entered Alexa's room, Alexa pulled Mick onto her bed and kissed him passionately while she pulled him on top of her. Her bed was neatly made up, at least until Mick and Alexa started making out, with clean white sheets. Her room had a mix of some bright colors including a lot of blue and white, really soft sheets, a rather large TV with a Playstation connected as well as a desk for her laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your room is amazing, it's like you're a goddess.\" Mick said as he felt the soft sheets underneath them as he was kissing his girlfriend.<br>\r\n\"Maybe I am.\" Alexa giggled as she switched places with Mick and pushed him to the bottom. \"Will you worship me?\" She giggled as she shook her beautiful red hair out of her face.<br>\r\n\"Always.\" Mick said as stared into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple made out for a couple more minutes before finally deciding to play some games together, then they took some pictures together and eventually cuddled while watching TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you lovebirds come down? Dinner is ready!\" They suddenly heard Mona yell as they got up from Alexa's bed and went on their way downstairs. As soon as they entered the kitchen however, they saw......</span></div></div>",

Alexa's parents have swapped clothes too and Harvey didn't look too pleased with it, this was definitely something Mona pressured him to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona was now dressed in her husband's brown slacks, loosely falling around her. She needed a belt to keep the pants from falling off as they were very loose in the waist. She was also wearing his buttoned shirt and even his underwear, all also fitting fairly loosely on her slender feminine frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarvey on the other hand looked really uncomfortable. He was wearing his wife's white skirt, but it didn't reach up to his knees like it did for his wife and the skirt was stretched at the waist as much as it could, he was lucky it was quite stretchy. He was also wearing her light blue blouse, which didn't properly fit on his chest, the sleeves didn't reach far enough and were a bit stretched, he couldn't close all of the buttons either due to it's tightness. His hairy legs were also now clad in the stretchy tights his wife had been wearing and lastly, he was also wearing her panties and bra, fitting tightly in both areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a word.\" Harvey simply said as Mick and Alexa looked at each other, both struggling not to laugh at the hilarious sight.<br>\r\n\"Dinner is ready lovebirds.\" Mona said as she served the plates, each containing a nice big steak and some vegetables, along with some potatoes as well on the side.<br>\r\n\"Smells good mom!\" Alexa said as she dug into her dish.<br>\r\n\"It looks very good Ma'am.\" Mick said as he started eating as well.<br>\r\n\"Please, it's Mona and there is more if you want.\" She smiled as she started as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarvey was the first to finish, quickly gave his wife a kiss and sat down on the couch to watch sports. Mona winked at Alexa and Mick while they finished their food and quickly went back up to Alexa's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was weird, seeing your dad like that.\" Mick said still seeing that image in his mind.<br>\r\n\"It was, you look a lot better.\" Alexa giggled as she pulled Mick onto her bed.<br>\r\n\"Better choose carefully tomorrow.\" Mick grinned as he give his girlfriend a kiss.<br>\r\n\"I have something in mind.\" Alexa giggled as she laid down with Mick on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young couple were messing around with each other a little as the night progressed until...</span></div></div>",

He stripped out of Alexa's clothes rather quickly, pulling off her skinny jeans and sweater much more easily this time.<br>\r\nAlexa quickly followed as she took off Mick's jeans and shirt and was left in only his loose boxers, while Mick was now standing there dressed in only a bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa wasted no time in pushing Mick onto her bed and perched up over top of him. She unhooked the bra behind his back and threw it on the floor. The panties and boxers quickly followed as they gripped each other tightly and covered themselves underneath the sheets. What followed was a very intense and hot night for both Mick and Alexa, who were fooling around for quite a long time before exhausting themselves eventually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa had been taking a very dominant approach the entire night as she was the one on top guiding both of them to a moment of amazing pleasure. Mick didn't mind letting her take charge, it actually felt really nice and she was spot on. Alexa was guiding Mick's hands to each of her most sensitive spots, they took up different positions, speeds and even sounds throughout the night, ending with both of them, laying on top of each other, soaked in sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa had already dozed off, but Mick was still awake, though only barely. His pleasure was keeping him awake a bit longer as he could still feel a sweaty, naked Alexa laying on top of him. She was his girlfriend now after all, but that couldn't have been any more clear after tonight. Mick tightly hugged the sweaty Alexa laying on top of him and promptly fell asleep as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, Mick woke up first. Alexa was still tightly hugging him but seemed to be in a very deep sleep. Without waking her up, Mick managed to not only get out of bed, but pick up his clothes as well, he didn't have any other clothes with him and these clothes were still fresh enough for him, but he might change at home, depending on if he feels like it later. The clothes now also clearly had Alexa's perfume smell on them. Mick loved this smell as he sniffed on them slightly as he got ready to take a shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a nice clean and fresh body, he got dressed in his own clothes, but due to the perfume smell on them, he could smell Alexa and almost even feel her due to it, which slowly caused a not very noticeable bulge to appear, but it faded again not long after. Once dressed, Mick went downstairs to the living room, where he noticed Alexa's parents were already up and were wearing their own clothes again, just like he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is good to see you wearing your own clothes.\" Harvey chucked.<br>\r\n\"Same to you sir.\" Mick poked back causing him to grin a little, but also blush in embarrassment.<br>\r\n\"I made breakfast for you, is Alexa up yet?\" Mona then adds as she points at the dining table.<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much and she was still sleeping just now.\" Mick adds as he walks over to the table and grabbed a plate and a sandwich, nodding to Mona in appreciation.<br>\r\n\"I'll go wake her up.\" Mona then smiled as she went upstairs.<br>\r\nIt was a bit quiet until she came back, Harvey felt too embarrassed to really talk but acted like it wasn't affecting him. Regardless, there was an awkward silence while they waited for Mona and Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, Alexa had woken up, taken a shower and finally selected an outfit for the day. She had to take extra good care because she knew Mick would swap with her again later today, so she wanted to make sure she made a good choice. After trying on some outfits, she finally selected one she liked and went downstairs to greet her boyfriend for breakfast. As she was coming down the stairs, she saw Mick look at her seductively as she winked back. Mick barely had time to remember their promise to swap again today. When he did however, he paid closer attention to her outfit. Alexa had chosen to wear.....</span></div></div>",

She was now wearing a short burgundy colored skirt, some black tights and a black long sleeved sweater tucked into the elastic band of her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look stunning today.\" Mick whispered as Alexa simply smiled.<br>\r\n\"Don't I always?\" She said jokingly as she got off of Mick's lap.<br>\r\n\"You do, but that outfit looks really cute on you.\" Mick said blushing. Alexa however wasted no time and immediately leaned in close and whispered into Mick's ear.<br>\r\n\"I'm more curious about how it looks on you later.\" She said with a mischievous tone as they both giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, I want to check something.\" Alexa then continued as she dragged Mick to the hallway.<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind?\" Mick asked suspicious he was going to have to switch with her immediately.<br>\r\n\"Try on my boots, I want to know if they fit you for later.\" She smirked as she gave Mick her boots.<br>\r\nMick complied and tried to squeeze his feet into Alexa's black tight boots and to his surprise, they fit kind of well, even comfortably.<br>\r\n\"They fit, I kind of like them even.\" Mick said softly blushing as Alexa giggled.<br>\r\n\"Then we should swap early so you can wear them al long as possible.\" She winked as she gave her boyfriend another kiss on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick then took off Alexa's boots and put on his own shoes while Alexa put on the boots and grabbed her bag.<br>\r\n\"Mom, we have to go now.\" Alexa said as she gave her mom a hug to say goodbye.

This time they weren't wearing each other's clothes so nobody really paid much attention to them other than the odd guy eying up Alexa, which Mick quickly deterred with an angry glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce finally at home, Alexa took off her boots and sat down on Mick's bed while Mick got himself a fresh change of clothes, changing into some blue denim jeans and a tight fitting light gray t-shirt and black sweatshirt.<br>\r\n\"So where do we go?\" Mick asked his girlfriend as she give him a seductive stare.<br>\r\n\"I have an idea, how about we....?\" She suggested.</span></div></div>",

They took the seat in the corner and finished their sandwich while admiring the weather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the couple was relaxing a little outside, a gust of wind came by, causing Alexa's skirt to flutter slightly.<br>\r\n\"This breeze is so nice.\" Alexa then giggled as she looked at Mick with a grin.<br>\r\n\"What are you suggesting?\" Mick asked suspiciously.<br>\r\n\"Nothing, just like the breeze that's all.\" Alexa said as she pulled herself closer against her boyfriend.<br>\r\nThe couple then continued to cuddle for a short while until....</span></div></div>",

Alexa nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey first laid their eyes on a couple, looking to be about the same age as they were. They were being very close and looked to be fairly open minded, judging from whatever conversation they could overhear from them.<br>\r\nThe girl was wearing some tight shorts and a red top while her boyfriend was wearing some cargo shorts and a light blue shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext they overheard an adult couple walking close to them. They were talking about going skinny dipping in a nearby lake. They were likely in their early 30's. The man was wearing some slacks and a buttoned shirt and some nice shoes. His woman was wearing a short white dress and a sunhat as well as some sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also spotted a pair of entertainers nearby, taking on all kinds of bets and requests for tricks. The pair was a guy, who was dressed as a magician with a hat, white gloves, nice clothes, typically how you would expect really. The girl was wearing a tight leotard and fishnet stockings. Both looked to be in their late 20's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, there was also a sauna nearby, it was one of those where you had to get fully naked but it was fairly well visited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay so that couple our age might be up for a swap, we could ask them.\" Mick suggested.<br>\r\n\"Not a bad idea, but I was thinking maybe we could follow that couple that just walked by, they were talking about skinny dipping, maybe we can snatch their clothes, leave them ours?\" Alexa grinned.<br>\r\n\"Devious, but I like it.\" Mick said.<br>\r\n\"We could also check out those street artists, those types always get mixed up in some crazy shenanigans.\" Alexa said scanning the area some more.<br>\r\n\"Or the sauna nearby might have some interesting possibilities as we wouldn't really know what we'll get in return if we do swap.\" Mick said as he finished his scan of the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick and Alexa talked for a bit before finally deciding to....</span></div></div>",

There looked to be pretty much no one else around. Mick and Alexa managed to hide behind some bushes taking a peek at the couple as they undressed near a bench. Each of them stripped down completely naked and laid their clothes on the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's undress too.\" Alexa said to Mick.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess we should.\" Mick nodded as he started to take off his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were fully undressed, Mick gave Alexa back her boots so she kept it with her clothes and vice versa.<br>\r\n\"Okay, time to switch.\" Alexa said.<br>\r\n\"They seem to be occupied with each other.\" Mick peeked through the bush and saw the couple to the side trying to hide from view and making out. But due to this, they also had no clear view of the bench.<br>\r\n\"As long as we are quiet we should be able to switch our clothes no issue.\" Mick then said as he took Alexa's bundle of clothes and looked to see if the path was clear from any other visitors and managed to make it to the bench. He switched his clothes with the woman's pile and Alexa's with the man's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he switched their clothes with the couple's, he got back to Alexa and gave her the man's clothing.<br>\r\n\"I got you a present.\" Mick smirked.<br>\r\n\"Aww, I love it.\" Alexa said searching for the man's boxers and slipping them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick quickly followed and took the woman's white bra and panties and slid them on as well, going fairly smoothly but they were a tad tight. He then quickly stepped into the sandals so he wouldn't have to dirty his feet much more and was lucky they were sandals because they were still quite tight, the woman had noticeably smaller feet. Then he pulled the white dress over his head and squeezed himself into it. It was at least a size too small for him bit he barely fit it. He finished off by putting on the sunhat and straightened the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Alexa had been getting dressed in the man's clothes. She was now wearing his dress shoes, slacks, buttoned shirt and of course even his underwear. All being a size or some too big for her but nothing too drastic.

She was wearing some nice pumps as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick already knew he was in for an exhausting day when he heard them arguing about how different they were, with Chrissie saying Trish dressed too dark and vice versa. Then arguing about art, there was no end to it the entire way to the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce finally at the pool however it turned out to be a lot of fun, they had some fun going down slides and bonding a little together.<br>\r\nTrish had changed into a black bikini covering herself pretty modestly, while Chrissie, like expected, was wearing a small white bikini showing off her body.<br>\r\nThis didn't really stop them from having fun however and due to Mick being there, the girls didn't get too many guys coming over to them, which is one thing both of them could agree on was nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day was nearing its end, the trio started to get ready to leave the pool and head back to the lockers to retrieve their clothes. They thought it was a good idea to keep the locker keys in Chrissie purse (,more like she insisted on it,) and made sure to remember who had which key, the locker room was kind of a maze and due to the busy day their lockers were a few corners apart from each other.<br>\r\nChrissie grabbed the keys and passed them around, being sure she gave everyone the correct ones as she claims to have remembered all locker numbers perfectly, which Mick was skeptical about, but decided to trust her after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick arrived at the locker that was given to him, but quickly realized he got the wrong key.<br>\r\n\"Damn it Chrissie, I shouldn't have trusted you to remember it correctly.\" Mick thought to himself as he started looking for her again with the wrong clothes underneath his arm.<br>\r\nAfter searching for a few minutes he couldn't find Chrissie nor Trish because they had already entered the changing stalls near their lockers. Deciding to simply give in to his fate, Mick swallowed his pride and entered a nearby stall to get changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's clothes ended up getting switched?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Mick entered the stall, he laid down Trish's clothes on the bench and looked over the outfit. He saw Trish's black denim shorts, her red tank top, her gray sweater, her black sneakers, hell even her black lace panties and bra.<br>\r\nThey weren't allowed to wear their wet swimwear outside of the pool, or otherwise he would have considered keeping them on instead, unfortunately, he couldn't afford to be kicked out like that as it would force him to take Trish's clothes with him anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Mick took off his swimming trunks and dried himself off with Trish's towel. It took him a moment to swallow his pride as he grabbed the black lace panties off the bench and slid them on. They were really tight and definitely not mad for a guy to wear, but nonetheless he slid them on as best he could before turning to the shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slid the shorts over his legs he felt their tightness with every inch he pulled them up, eventually reaching his hips and waist and made him realize just how slender Trish was. It was lucky (or maybe unlucky) for Mick that he was very slender as well, so he could pull up the shorts all the way and closed them up. Mick felt VERY uncomfortable however as almost his entire legs were exposed with a very uncomfortable bulge present in Trish's shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Mick managed to swallow his pride one more time, he grabbed the black lace bra and reluctantly tried to put it on.<br>\r\nIt took him quite a while before he managed to properly put it on, but luckily for him, Trish wore one that was fairly easy to figure out. Regardless of this however, it still was extremely tight on him as Trish had a slender and small chest. He considered leaving it off but realized it would be more awkward if someone saw him hold it and decided to take the risk on no one seeing it while he was wearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to cover the bra as best as he could as he slid on the tight red tank top and put on the comfortable gray sweater, leaving the zipper open as he was quite warm at the moment. The sweater and tank top weren't that uncomfortable, but still pretty tight, though they didn't make Mick feel as uncomfortable as the shorts did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, Mick needed to put on the black sneakers, but while the socks weren't an issue, the sneakers were definitely a size too small for him. Mick had small feet for a guy, but not quite as small as Trish's were. Mick couldn't fully squeeze his feet in the sneakers, but did a decent attempt as he managed to get his heel in just slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his feet being squeezed by Trish's sneakers, his legs being bare and exposed under Trish's shorts and his chest being squeezed by Trish's tank and bra, Mick felt exposed and uncomfortable, but he couldn't stay in the stall for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally gathering his courage, Mick stepped out of the stall and saw Chrissie and Trish waiting for him. Trish looked pretty much as awkward as he did. She was now wearing Mick's black jeans and gray t-shirt, as well as presumably his boxers. Her feet were loosely fit into his sneakers and she had his jacket on her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrissie on the other hand, had her own clothes on and was laughing uncontrollably at Trish and Mick's clothes swap. Which made Mick suspect she did it on purpose. <br>\r\n\"You look soooo cuuuute.\" Chrissie kept laughing as Mick ignored her and talked to Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know this was going to happen? When I found out I had your clothes I couldn't find you anywhere.\" Mick said annoyed.<br>\r\n\"I didn't realize until I was in the changing rooms, I looked for you too but the place is a maze.\" Trish said as she could hardly contain her giggles.<br>\r\n\"We should get back into a stall and swap back.\" Mick said with an even more annoyed tone.<br>\r\n\"......\" Trish responded.</span></div></div>",

The shirt barely fit due to her breasts but seemed to enjoy the feeling. She then proceeded to grab Trish's black shorts and slid her gorgeous legs into them, seeming not quite as excited about them however. Lastly she slid her small feet into Mick's sneakers, but they were a bit loose on her. As Chrissie finished putting on the clothes. adjusted her new shorts and shirt and put on Trish's sweater to cover her arms. She then nodded at Trish and she proceeded to pick up some clothes as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrissie kept Mick occupied by constantly blocking him and cornering him into a tight spot, but due to him not wanting to hurt her and not wanting to attract attention to him while naked, he couldn't pass by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Chrissie was doing this, Trish had her chance to pick out some clothes. She quickly decided to pick up Mick's black jeans and slid them on easily. She fastened the belt and adjusted them slightly on her hips and proceeded to pick up Chrissie's baby blue v-neck top and her pumps, which were about her size as well. Lastly, she grabbed Mick's leather jacket and put it on as well, finally signaling to Chrissie she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrissie got out of Mick's way and gave an approving nod to Trish. But Mick wasn't very approving of what was left for him. He started with horror at the items still remaining, which consisted of Chrissie's tight short denim mini skirt, Trish's red tank top, sneakers and on top of it all, he was still wearing Trish's underwear as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chrissie and Trish giggled, Mick reluctantly grabbed Chrissie's skirt and wiggled into them, but it took some effort to pull them on. He proceeded to put on Trish's red tank and her sneakers once again, resulting in a very uncomfortable feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh you look so cute.\" Chrissie said as she felt under the skirt Mick was now wearing.<br>\r\n\"Hey, keep your hands to yourself.\" Mick complained, but Chrissie didn't listen and continued to feel him up, but quickly stopped as she \"helped\" Mick wear his new clothes properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling a bit mixed up.\" Mick said defeated as Trish and Chrissie giggled.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we'll swap back later.\" Chrissie winked as she wiggled her ass in her new shorts.<br>\r\n\"Or maybe not.\" Trish added as she admired their new looks.<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do?\" Mick asked as the girl's faces got massive grins.<br>\r\n\"We're going to go home now, where else?\" Chrissie said as she smirked.<br>\r\n\"So when are we swapping back?

When inspecting them, it didn't exactly help to make him any happier. He was obviously swapping with a girl younger than him, the clothes were on the smallish side, but looked to not be too small to not fit him, at least he lucked out on that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he didn't luck out on however was the type of clothing. He saw a bra and panties combo laying on top of the pile, both were white and the bra looked to be a small cup, probably due to this girl's age. Looking further he saw a pair of pink skinny jeans and a yellow and white t-shirt as well as some (relatively) comfortable looking shoes with a slight heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just my damn luck.\" Mick sighed to himself as he heard the stall next to him open up with massive giggling following.<br>\r\nReluctantly Mick started getting dressed and pulled up the small white panties and managed to slid them on, though not all that comfortably. The bra went on without much issue as soon as he figured out how to hook them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he stepped into the pink skinny jeans, which proved to be a very tight fit, though with some effort he managed to squeeze himself into them, though they were a little short, showing a bit more of his ankles, but they managed to reach up to his waist okay. As Mick zipper up his new jeans, he felt something in his pocket, which turned out to be a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick laid the note to the side as he pulled the tight fitting shirt over his head, which fit him snugly and much like the jeans were a little short, showing off a bit of belly above the jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Mick sat down to squeeze his feet into the girl's shoes, which were too small for him unfortunately, so it hurt his feet a little as he tried his best to make himself able to walk in them, resulting in him eventually just tying them a bit looser and bending his feet in a way to fit into them, though like mentioned before, it wasn't exactly comfortable to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to finally read the note he found in one of the pockets, he noticed it was definitely a girl's handwriting, but it also looked to be a girl a few years younger than him for sure. Reading the note it said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I overheard you talking to those nasty girls, sorry about what they did, but I couldn't pass up this chance to try boy's clothes!

It were some small pale blue denim shorts with some hearts on them, along with a dirty pair of panties, a training bra and a white tank top with some pink trimming and a unicorn on the front.<br>\r\nMick stepped into the panties after removing the current ones, though it felt really dirty as he pulled the dirty panties over his butt and they quickly pulled tight into his crack, making it feel even more wet and dirty. The bra was a fairly simple substitute however and didn't take a terrible amount of effort.<br>\r\nHe then stepped into the shorts which were definitely too small. He pulled them on but they got stuck as it reached his butt, though he could get them over eventually, he couldn't close the zipper due to them being too small and made his ass feel incredibly tight. Luckily the top was a tank top, so apart from having to tactically maneuver his arms, it went okay to put it on, but it revealed a decent amount of belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look exactly like me!\" Cindy giggled.<br>\r\n\"No I don't and you know it.\" Mick complained.<br>\r\n\"Yeah you're right....\" Cindy said thinking.</span></div></div>",

The girl that stole her clothes appeared to be the closest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick then snuck down the street being careful not to <br>\r\nBe seen by anyone dressed as a 12 year old girl. Eventually though he found the girl hiding out in her house. Mick only had some information to go off from what Cindy told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls name was Tracy. She was 13 years old. And Judging by her tone of voice  she was bratty and probably loved to be pampered for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick went to knock on the door but saw that it was already unlocked. He snuck into the house. Nick was shocked by how messy the place was, \u2018I can\u2019t believe that this girls parents don\u2019t look after their house at all\u2019 where the thoughts going through his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick turned a corner and saw a pair of high heels in his face. He looked up to see Tracy pretending to be Trish with a smug smile on her face. \u201cWell well well, if it isn\u2019t Zoe what\u2019s a little girl like you doing in my house?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick didn\u2019t even hesitate to answer \u201cyou know why I\u2019m here Tracy give me back Trish\u2019s clothes!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Tracy just giggled in a high pitch voice annoying Mick. \u201cOh but I am Trish can\u2019t you tell by my stylish clothes now if you\u2019re just gonna accuse things of me I\u2019d want you to leave!\u201d mocked Tracy knowing Mick would do anything to get them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust Give them back please I\u2019ll do anything!\u201d Pleaded Mick knowing he was going to regret doing that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy then smiled at this knowing that she was going to have a lot of Fun with Mick. \u201cWell if you\u2019ll do anything Zoe there is one thing I\u2019d really appreciate a pretty little girl like you doing\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick cringed realising that whatever she was about to demand of him, he was going to hate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy then smiled and made her demands clear. \u201cFor two hours I\u2019d like you too...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But he knew when he saw Tracy wearing Trish's black denim shorts, her red tank top, her gray sweater, her black sneakers, and probably her black lace panties and bra. And looked down at himself seeing the pink frilly tank top white shorts and pink sandals he was wearing. He knew that he had to set aside his pride and accept his embarrassing fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh....fine I\u2019ll be your stupid maid and clean up this dump\u201d said Mick reluctantly, making Tracy giggle in childish glee as she dragged Mick into her room where not only was a slightly revealing maid outfit was waiting for him, but also a long stylish jet black wig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick cringed at the sight of everything before him. \u201cUm so I have to wear all of this?\u201d Asked a concerned Mick, however Mick didn\u2019t get a straight answer to that as Tracy just laughed in his face making him feel small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes my lovely Maid you\u2019ll have to wear that complete set and serve me diligently, oh and for the next two hours my name is Mistress Tracy to you understand?\u201d Explained Tracy enjoying the sight of Mick bring forced to grovel before her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mick could only sigh in embarrassment at what was happening to him. \u201cYes Mistress Tracy I\u2019ll get dressed in all of it right away to serve you\u201d. Tracy loves hearing herself be called mistress, it made her feel so powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left her room to let Mick get changed. When Mick looked at the maid uniform.<br>\r\nHe noticed that it was very short and skimpy meaning that a lot of himself would be seen while wearing it, \u2018just great first I have to be a 12 year old and now the maid to a 13 year old\u2019 thought Mick, embarrassed by how easily manipulated he was<br>\r\nBy the little girls. When Mick looked closer he also noticed something else, a name tag on the costume \u2018Milly\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick then sighed once again realising that he was going to have to act like a new person once again as he began to change clothes once again.<br>\r\nAnd after Ten minutes of agonisingly trying to fit into the small costume, Mick was now ready to unwillingly serve mistress Tracy as Milly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mick left Tracy\u2019s room he cringed, Mick was wearing a tight maids uniform with a short skirt and a girly long jet black wig to make it look more convincing. He wanted to scream but almost instantly he heard the squeals of the annoying girl Tracy. \u201cOh you look so cute and pretty don\u2019t you Milly, and remember to answer positively or else you can say goodbye to Trishes clothes\u201d. Smugly said Tracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick took a deep breath realising he would have to embarrass himself once again, and hoping that no one else would no about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy yes mistress Tracy I feel so cute in my little maid outfit and wig  and I love to serve you!\u201d Said Mick in a high pitch effeminate voice trying to sound upbeat and excited to serve Tracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy let out a small snicker after hearing this. \u201cGood girl, now hurry up and clean my house Milly, you have a lot of work to do\u201d mocked Tracy knowing how much this  must annoy Mick  right now as she handed him a feather duster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick just responded with \u201cYes mistress Tracy\u201d as he got to work, and for the next two hours Mick went through hell as he had to clean a disgusting messy house, dusting shelves, scrubbing toilets, mopping floors, etc. And what was worse that was on top of that Tracy would also call for his services, to fetch her a drink from the kitchen, or massage her feet for her while she watched tv or pose for photos just in case she needs to blackmail him at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the worst part of it all for Mick was that he had to serve Tracy with a fake smile on his face, while pretending to be a diligent maid humming tunes while cleaning and responding to Tracy\u2019s commands with \u201cYes Mistress Tracy whatever you want\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after two hours of cleaning with the house now looking brad new. Mick worked up the courage to ask Tracy something he might regret. \u201cMistress Tracy it\u2019s been two hours can I leave now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with the question Tracy smiled at him devilishly responding with....</span></div></div>",

Mick was somewhat careful to avoid being seen by anyone which made Tracy laugh and make jokes at his expense, with the most annoying number one for Mick being \u201cyou know if you stayed as Milly know one would ever think that such a cute little maid could be a boy\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Mick wanting to die of embarrassment as Tracy snickered, however the walk back wasn\u2019t all bad for Mick either as he actually did surprisingly start to enjoy being in Tracy\u2019s company. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Tracy thanking him for actually cleaning her house as it was supposed to be her punishment for just wanting to not wear a dress, Mick then learned how Tracy didn\u2019t have an easy life and was forced to be girly just like Cindy was, only Tracy never even seen her parents that often as they were usually busy with work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick felt bad for her and realised that he shouldn\u2019t try and be so judgemental of the girls even if they were embarrassing him in every conceivable way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick and Tracy then got back to Cindys where Cindy grinned upon seeing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow already one down, you must be quite the fast cleaner then Milly?\u201d Mocked Cindy, annoying Mick as he realised that Tracy totally sent the pictures of him in the maid costume to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Cindy wasn\u2019t the only person to be happy about Micks return as Trish eyes gleamed when she saw Tracy with her old clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy then demanded Trish to strip to which she was fine with as she quickly took off the embarrassing pink dress and hello kitty training bra and panties that she was tricked into wearing and handed them to Cindy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as Tracy was about to strip of Trishes clothes and give them back. A devilish idea entered into Micks head as he thought about how these three girls got stuck in this whole mess in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang on Tracy give me Trishes clothes I wanna wear them and make her Zoe\u201d demanded Mick as everyone looked at him in shock, with Trish being the most surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaat! But Mic-Zoe I wanna be me again I thought you were getting my clothes back for me to be normal again!\u201d Said Trish confused by Micks actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I did at first but the more I think about it, you started this whole situation just to embarrass me and now it\u2019s only fair that you get to stay embarrassed for much longer for what you did to me, besides I think you look adorable as a little girl\u201d. explained and mocked Mick making Cindy and Tracy laugh while Trish could only feel annoyed and embarrassed as she started to regret messing with Mick in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick then took of all of Zoe\u2019s clothes and flung them at Trish who unwilling put them on. Meanwhile Mick quickly put on Trish's black denim shorts, her red tank top, her gray sweater, her black sneakers, and the black lace panties with Mick feeling happy just to be wearing adult clothes again, even if it was meant for girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Tracy has put on her clothes again and decided to head home. \u201cWell bye Trish, I hope I can get you to be milly again sometime, after all I still have those cute photos of you\u201d mocked Tracy as she left Cindys house making Mick blush as he realised that Tracy might just blackmail him into being her maid for a while, making him regret feeling sympathy for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Cindy decided to ask a question. \u201cSo Trish who\u2019s  clothes are you going after next?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick took a second to think and decided to get.......</span></div></div>",

Thought Mick as he snuck around the mansion looking for any way to sneak in with Mick being happy to see a window open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick then snuck in through the window to be meet with a massive pink bed room that looked like something out of a Disney movie and Carol in Chrissies clothes sipping imaginary Tea sitting on her pink play chair, like a Bond villain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh there you are Trish I\u2019ve been waiting for so long I thought that you\u2019d never show.\u201d Mocked Carol confusing Mick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you know I was gonna be here?\u201d Asked Mick worried that he wasn\u2019t gonna like the answer he was given. With Carol smile becoming more devious as she gave him the answer he didn\u2019t want<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Cindy messaged me about you coming her next. She told me that you weren\u2019t being embarrassed for long enough and wanted me to pick up the slack. It\u2019s a shawm really, originally I was gonna have you drink tea with my stuffed animals dressed as tinkerbell. But now I think my new plan blows all of that out of the water.\u201d Explained Carol pissing Mick off as he realised  that Cindy was cheating once again to ensure that he would lose the bet and be stuck as her all summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then Princess what do I have to do to get Chrissies clothes back?\u201d Asked Mick planning to win this bet no matter how embarrassing it\u2019ll be while also planning on how to get Cindy back for everything she\u2019s done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol smiled at this as took a sip five her tea and answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you too</span></div></div>",

Mick reluctantly grabbed them and instantly regretted not keeping either Chrissie's or Trish's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outfit handed to him existed out of very little. It started with a tiny looking black thong, the woman wasn't wearing a bra luckily, so Mick didn't have to put one on, but instead, he did receive a very tight looking short black dress and strappy sandals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing his pride once again, Mick slid the thong on slowly, they were incredibly tiny and were a little wet as well, which felt really strange against his now tightly packaged privates. The back of the thong nestled in his butt crack easily and was filling him with all sorts of discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on the dress next turned out to be quite the task, the dress was very tight and it took him a second to find the proper orientation. After some trial and error, Mick managed to squeeze himself into the tight black dress, but it only reached just below is butt, so if he were to bend or anything, it would be wide open for all to see. The dress itself was very soft however and also a bit moist as well, it seems like this woman already had it on when she received Mick's clothes and decided to take them instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, Mick had little issue putting on the strappy sandals and other than the fact they still had a small heel, he could walk on them pretty well. Mick was about to exit the changing room and confront his nightmares when a note was slid into the room. It looked to be hastily written and it was a bit unclear on some parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt read:<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the clothes! I am unsure as to why, but you wanting to swap clothes with me was one of the most exciting requests I have had in a while, so I decided to accept this trade. I hope my dress fits you well, your clothes are really comfortable for me! I am only here on holiday and I need to run, so unfortunately, we will not have a chance to swap back, but your clothes will be the greatest souvenir I have ever received!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, NO!\" Mick said as by the time he had finished reading, the woman had been long gone.<br>\r\nThanks to Chrissie, his clothes now belonged to a random tourist who was about to leave back for her home country and he was now stuck with her short dress. Mick was infuriated as he stepped outside of the stall, where Chrissie and Trish had been waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish (in Chrissie's life) was laughing her ass off while Chrissie (in Trish's life) just stared at him with a massive grin.<br>\r\n\"You look so good in that dress, you swapped with such a hot woman, she looked awesome in your clothes.\" Trish said still pretending to be Chrissie.<br>\r\n\"You saw her? You have to help me catch up to her!\" Mick demanded as they both looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well......\" Trish said back as she adjusted her skirt.</span></div></div>",

First, he inspected the wallet, it contained quite a bit of money, the woman was in fact quite wealthy, making Mick question why she would want to swap lives with him. Inside the wallet was also the woman's former ID card, it read the name \"Esmeralda Perez\". There were also several cards in there including her bank pass, though without a pin number, not very useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging deeper in the bag he found the woman's phone, which was adorned with several accessories, most of which were pink. There was also a note next to it reading the unlock for it, Mick assumed she left it there so he could use it. Other than that, some random items from a hairbrush to a small mirror and a bunch of other items Mick would usually consider \"clutter'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess I am Esmeralda Perez now.\" Mick sighed as he looked over himself, wearing some random woman's tight dress.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it won't be too bad, she's a hot woman and you look hot in that dress.\" Trish then said as she forced her arms around Mick to support him.<br>\r\n\"Are you flirting with me?\" Mick smirked as Chrissie rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n\"I've seen how Chrissie looked at you before I swapped lives with her, so if I'm going to be her...\" Trish said as she smirked at Chrissie who was simply shocked.<br>\r\n\"But I am not Mick anymore, so you'd have to flirt with that woman in my life.\" Mick then corrected as Trish realized her mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, she asked us to tell you to call her whenever you could, to exchange some more information, mostly because she can't enter your phone right now.\" Chrissie said as she pulled Trish back towards her.<br>\r\n\"But she can answer, which is why I need to call, I have the log-in for her phone.\" Mick concluded.<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Chrissie quickly said as she help Trish's arm.<br>\r\n\"I may just go visit her in person, might be easier that way. I could even just go to her hotel for now, she was here on holiday.\" Mick contemplated.<br>\r\n\"Whatever you decide to do, it looks like we still have to adjust to our life swap.\" Chrissie concluded as she turned to Trish with an angry look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick considered his options carefully before finally deciding to...</span></div></div>",

There were two pictures that drew his attention however, one of them was her, wearing the dress he was now wearing and the second one was her wearing his own clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their age difference, they fit each other's clothes quite well, but Mick had no intention of keeping them, even if he liked them at least a little. If he was going to swap clothes with any girl again however, it would be either Trish or Chrissie, both of their clothes were way more comfortable and if the woman hadn't run off with his life, he would have switched with one of them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Mick started checking out Esmeralda's Facebook profile. She had lots of friends, her posts looked to be mostly selfies of herself as well. Some of them on what looked like a movie set, maybe while she was changing into costume, she looked pretty scarcely dressed in most of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter snooping around in the Woman's phone for a little while, the hour was steadily passing and Mick decided it was time. He refrained from reading her messages for now as to not invade privacy too much and embarked on his journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his way to meet Esmeralda, he got some weird stares and whistles from the people around him, making him very uncomfortable. He just glared back at the ones around him and eventually arrived at his (old) student room and quickly knocked on the door, wanting to get into a more private place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in!\" Esmeralda yelled as Mick entered the room, feeling little more than embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"My dress looks good on you! I was a bit worried we wouldn't properly fit each other's clothes, but it looks like they do just fine!\" Esmeralda said with a massive smile as she inspected Mick wearing her favorite dress.<br>\r\n\"I still feel a bit uncomfortable.\" Mick admitted as he looked over at the woman, she looked even more beautiful in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsmeralda was a very attractive Latina woman with long glistening black hair, impressive D-cup breasts, stunningly slender legs and waist, she was the same height as Mick at 5'7'' and had a stunning face, with no imperfections visible in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsmeralda giggled as she fixed Mick's dress on him and made him look \"cuter\" by making sure the dress fit perfectly on his hips, legs and waist.<br>\r\n\"You're just my size, maybe we can keep some of each other's clothes when we swap back lives?\" Esmeralda suggested while giggling as the pair sat down on the bed.<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that when the time comes.\" Mick said dismissing the suggestion for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do?\" Mick asked as Esmeralda sat down next to him.<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought....\" She said with a smile.</span></div></div>",

Esmeralda was visibly very horny and made some more advancements on Mick, but he still declined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were done exchanging information, they sat down and ate some dinner together and bonded a bit over time, both opening up a little to each other. Esmeralda told Mick she was bisexual, she told him about some past movies she made and overall just got to know each other a bit better on a personal level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an exhausting night of talking, Mick decided to not stay over, as him declining her advances might make that too awkward or difficult. He departed towards the hotel Esmeralda was staying at, he hadn't recognized the name of it before, but it was quite a luxurious hotel and he had a VIP room to boot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe staff gave Mick some strange stares, but after explaining the situation, showing them his new id and room key, they understood and he was treated like a queen. He was escorted to the suite and everything looked amazing, he was treated with some champagne and even a massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as this room was amazing, this wasn't convincing Mick to keep lives swapped with Esmeralda however, he liked his own life. Though there was something quite appealing about the high class lifestyle she lived, he could definitely get used to this for a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to change into something else before going to sleep and saw several nightgowns in the dresser. He eventually decided on a black nightgown with a small bow in the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled on the nightgown and looked into the large mirror. The nightgown looked weird on him with his hairy legs and arms and even a bit of his chest.<br>\r\n\"I really hope I don't have to deal with this for too much longer.\" Mick mumbled, a bit disturbed by the sight of himself in a sexy woman's nightgown and went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Esmeralda was flying back tonight and they were meeting this morning to swap back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick quickly got up and took a nice hot shower while thinking about the last few days. He had been enjoying living the high life, though he wouldn't have minded to not have to wear Esmeralda's skimpy clothing, all of her tops were revealing and she only had a couple pairs of jeans, which were way too tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts did make him wonder what to wear today, which he wasn't completely sure on yet. He grabbed a towel, covered himself and walked over towards Esmeralda's wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe skimmed through it for a while, eventually starting by grabbing a black hipster and bra combo, deciding to refrain from wearing a thong. He pulled the hipster over his legs and felt them comfortably hugging his hips, while the bra tightly packed around his chest, with the D-cups being completely empty in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on, he found a nice pair of black skinny jeans, he started to pull them up and noticed them being a little wide on the butt, but only slightly due to their small difference in that area. His waist was tightly gripped as he closed the button and zipped them up, feeling a bit more covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly he settled on wearing a revealing crop top, he didn't have much other choice. He settled on a white top which exposed his midriff and pulled them on. His shoulders were being dug into however as he finished by putting on the same strappy sandals he had been wearing all weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll at least be fine with wearing this home today won't she?\" Mick thought as he checked himself out in the mirror. He looked a lot less ridiculous than when he was wearing her dress or nightgown, but it still was strange, though he did get used to it a bit over the last few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick made sure he grabbed everything, ID, wallet, phone and put them all in a handbag which he threw over his shoulder as he went downstairs to meet Esmeralda, who was going to meet him here so she could check out of her room as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mick entered the lobby, he saw Esmeralda sitting there. She was wearing some of his gray jeans, a black shirt, some of his worn sneakers, it was very much unexpected considering her personality. She was also wearing no make-up, but she looked quite good still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, there you are.\" Esmeralda said as Mick walked towards her.<br>\r\n\"Yes I am, how have you been?\" Mick asked curiously.<br>\r\n\"Good, I've been enjoying your life a lot, it was nice to be someone else for a few days. How was your weekend?\" She asked back excitedly.<br>\r\n\"It was different for sure, but I'm ready to swap back.\" Mick smiled as Esmeralda giggled.<br>\r\n\"Well I was thinking, about our swap.\" Esmeralda started, which caused Mick's smile to disappear.<br>\r\n\"I think we should....\" She then smiled back as she gave him a hug</span></div></div>",

He checked Facebook as well and sure enough, they're in a relationship there as well.<br>\r\n\"How did this happen?\" Mick asked a bit shocked.<br>\r\n\"Well, your friend, I think her name was Trish, she explained to me she had swapped lives with Chrissie, just like we did. We started talking about our swaps and we started to kind of like each other, I'm bisexual, I told you and we kind of decided to date, even though we weren't in our own lives.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick's heart dropped. He's always been at odds with Chrissie and now she was his girlfriend? He had imagined what it would be like to date her, so he wasn't that upset about it, she was hot for sure, he was just worried about how she would react to it.<br>\r\n\"Does Chrissie know about it?\" Mick continued asking.<br>\r\n\"Trish is supposed to tell her today, the same day we swap back is what we promised.\" Esmeralda clarifies and Mick calms down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope you have a safe journey home.\" Mick finally said wanting to say goodbye.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I hope so too and I hope you and Chrissie will make a cute couple.\" She giggled.<br>\r\n\"I hope so too.\" Mick smiled as he grabbed his stuff and departed the hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Mick unsurprisingly got a message from Chrissie.<br>\r\n\"Hey, since we are supposed to be a couple, how about we meet up tonight and hang out a little?\" Chrissie sent, seeming calm about it for now at least.<br>\r\n\"Sure, my place whenever you're ready?\" Mick suggested.<br>\r\n\"Sure, see you soon <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\" Is what she sent back, catching Mick off guard, he didn't expect Chrissie of all people to sent him a heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI short while later there is a knock on the door,<br>\r\n\"That has to be Chrissie.\" Mick thought and he walked over to the door to let her in.<br>\r\nHe opened the door and saw this person definitely had Chrissie's life and clothes, he recognized the white skirt and baby blue v-neck she had been wearing Friday, Taking a closer look, he noticed the person in her life was....</span></div></div>",

How was it being Trish?\" Mick quickly attempted to change the subject.<br>\r\n\"Not all that strange at all actually, we're both girls and her life was a bit different, but nothing that felt too strange.\" Chrissie answered as she leaned in closer. \"But swapping with a boy would be more exciting.\" She then giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to swap clothes with me?\" Mick chucked as Chrissie excitedly nodded. \"I take it you want my life too?\" Mick then added with a sigh.<br>\r\n\"You did just get it back, so we don't have to, we're a couple now anyway, we'll have to get used to that as well.\" Chrissie suggested as Mick nodded.<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to swap?\" Mick then asked his girlfriend as she started to grin.<br>\r\n\"Everything we are wearing silly, our complete outfits.\" Chrissie said as she stroke a pose.<br>\r\n\"Let me think about it for a little.\" Mick then asked as Chrissie reluctantly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple got back into a tight cuddling position and continued watching the movie, of which they missed some scenes in the meantime.

First, she took a shower like normal and cleaned herself fully, she wasn't actually joking before, she did want to be clean. Next, she grabbed a towel to cover herself but didn't get dressed quite yet, she took her clothes with her however, but she did make sure to leave her phone in the bathroom as an excuse for later. Chrissie then walked back out to greet Mick, kissed him on the lips again and told him the shower was all his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrissie waited several minutes before making her move,once Mick was fully in the shower, she knocked on the door, holding her clothes with her, but out of view as much as possible in case he looked at her when she would walk in.<br>\r\n\"Babe, I think I left my phone there, mind if I come in to grab it?\" She asked, hoping he would let her take it and not give it to her himself.<br>\r\n\"Sure babe, we're a couple now anyway so it's not like you can't see me like this.\" Mick replied making Chrissie blush as she entered the room.

Once finally fully clean again, Mick stepped out of the shower, dried himself off and got ready to get dressed.<br>\r\n\"Oh dang you Chrissie you sneaky devil.\" Mick then said as he couldn't help but smile at the impressive trick she played on him.<br>\r\nMuch to Mick's dismay however, Chrissie had managed to.....</span></div></div>",

The cups were empty of course and it snugly and softly constricted his chest, but it wasn't terrible uncomfortable.<br>\r\nPutting on the last item Chrissie left him, he slid on the tiny socks over his feet and seemed to be just his size, which would mean he would fit her shoes too, though he shuddered a bit at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick finished up by pulling on his jeans and shirt and made his way out, only to find a smiling Chrissie sitting on his bed when he returned. His boxers were slightly visible from underneath the small skirt she was wearing, he also managed to get a glimpse of Chrissie's breasts underneath her shirt, but nothing too major, she looked fairly normal, it was hard to see the boxers or lack of a bra anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Notice anything different?\" Chrissie giggled as she gave her boyfriend a kiss.<br>\r\n\"Not really actually, or at least, no one else would.\" Mick smiled as swiftly gave her an additional kiss.<br>\r\n\"So how are they.\" Chrissie teased as she stuck her hand into Mick's jeans, touching the panties.<br>\r\n\"Actually quite comfortably, they are really soft.\" Mick admitted blushing.<br>\r\n\"So you like them?\" Chrissie teased again as she started giggling.<br>\r\n\"Maybe a little.\" Mick then smiled as the couple started to make out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a passionate make out session, Mick checked the times for the cinema and realized they had to leave now if they wanted to see that movie.<br>\r\n\"We need to go.\" Mick then said as he put on his shoes and grabbed his keys.<br>\r\n\"You're not wearing my shoes?\" Chrissie almost pouted as she waved her pumps in front of Mick.<br>\r\n\"Not right now, maybe later.\" Mick said almost instinctively, which caused Chrissie to smile as she eventually put them on.<br>\r\n\"It should be warm the rest of the day, no need for a jacket I think.\" Mick said as he considered taking one.<br>\r\n\"If it gets too cold I'm blaming you then.\" Chrissie winked as she adjusted her skirt and the couple left to go to the cinema.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a very busy day, it was very hot and it seemed like most people preferred hanging out outside around town instead of inside the cinema, which Mick didn't mind, it meant most of the seats should be empty giving them more space and sure enough, that is is exactly what ended up happening. As they got comfortable, Mick adjusted in his seat several times adjusting Chrissie's panties between his legs, but eventually found the perfect spot. He then quickly put his arm around his girlfriend and the movie started not long after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie ended up being decent, but not all that great, at least to Chrissie. She ended getting a bit bored during some of the long scenes and thought maybe Mick and her could liven things up a bit for her.<br>\r\nShe poked Mick and leaned in close to him and whispered \"This is starting to bore me, no one will see us here, can we please swap some more clothes?\" in his ear.<br>\r\nMick was about to immediately decline, but he realized Chrissie was getting a bit annoyed and she was still his girlfriend whom he loves, so maybe pissing her off more isn't such a good idea.<br>\r\n\"....\" Mick replied as he gave her a kiss.</span></div></div>",

The skirt hugged his legs as he pulled them up and he had to shift a bit in his seat in order to squeeze his butt into them, but once he had them pulled up, he liked them.<br>\r\nHe crossed his legs and assumed the position Chrissie was sitting in before as he looked down at his now bare legs sticking out from the skirt.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Mick entered the stall, he laid down Chrissie's clothes on the bench and looked over the outfit. He saw Chrissie's white denim skirt, the baby blue v-neck, her white pumps witch had a three inch heel and hell even her white string and bra.<br>\r\nThey weren't allowed to wear their wet swimwear outside of the pool, or otherwise he would have considered keeping them on instead, unfortunately, he couldn't afford to be kicked out like that as it would force him to take Chrissie's clothes with him anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Mick took off his swimming trunks and dried himself off with Chrissie's towel. It took him a moment to swallow his pride as he grabbed the string off the bench and slid them on. They were really tight and definitely not mad for a guy to wear, but nonetheless he slid them on as best he could before turning to the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slid the skirt over his legs he felt the tightness with every inch he pulled him up, eventually reaching his hips and waist and made him realize just how slender Chrissie was. It was lucky (or maybe unlucky) for Mick that he was very slender as well, so he could pull up the skirt all the way and closed him up. Mick felt VERY uncomfortable however as almost his entire legs were exposed with a very uncomfortable bulge present in Chrissie's skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Mick managed to swallow his pride one more time, he grabbed the bra and reluctantly tried to put it on.<br>\r\nIt took him quite a while before he managed to properly put it on. Regardless of this however, it fit well on him as Chrissie had a bigger chest as Trish with her slender frame and small breasts.<br>\r\nHe considered leaving it off but realized it would be more awkward if someone saw him hold it and decided to take the risk on no one seeing it while he was wearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to cover the bra as best as he could as he slid on the baby blue v-neck but it was seen because of the v-neck. The v-neck wasn't uncomfortable, but still pretty awkward because the bra was seen., though it didn't make Mick feel as uncomfortable as the string and skirt did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, Mick needed to put on the white pumps. Mick had small feet for a guy and (un)lucky for him they were as small as Chrissie's were. He put the pumps on his feet but struggle to stand on them because of the three inch heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his feet struggle on Chrissie's pumps, his legs being bare and exposed under her skirt and her bra being shown under Chrissie's baby blue v-neck, Mick felt exposed and uncomfortable, but he couldn't stay in the stall for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally gathering his courage, Mick stepped out of the stall and saw Chrissie and Trish waiting for him. Chrissie looked pretty happy. She was now wearing Mick's black jeans and gray t-shirt, as well as presumably his boxers. Her feet fit perfectly into his sneakers and she had his jacket on her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish on the other hand, had her own clothes on and was a little awkward at Chrissie's and Mick's clothes swap. Which made Mick suspect Chrissie did it on purpose. <br>\r\n\"You look soooo cuuuute.\" Chrissie kept laughing as Mick who is turning red but start asking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know this was going to happen? When I found out I had your clothes I couldn't find you anywhere.\" Mick said annoyed.<br>\r\n\"I didn't realize until I was in the changing rooms, I looked for you too but the place is a maze.\" Chrissie said as she could hardly contain her giggles.<br>\r\n\"We should get back into a stall and swap back.\" Mick said with an even more annoyed tone.<br>\r\n\"......\" Chrissie responded.</span></div></div>",

Chrissie has to wear them if we switch back. I could take the most unfashionable clothes I can find... but... that wouldn't be Chrissie, me...\" Mick stops. Did he really called himself Chrissie?<br>\r\nHe finds the drawer with the underwear and was shocked. Everything that was stylish were strings. As he was Chrissie now, for Chrissie and Trish he take a black string and put it on. It was hard to find a comfortable position for his penis and in the end he tucks him back which gives him a kind of smooth front. Next was a marching bra he put on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he open the wardrobe again he saw himself in a mirror... he looks silly but on the other hand it arouses him... he starts to picture himself in different outfits Chrissie has worn as he saw her, or he was wearing as Chrissie saw him?<br>\r\nMick once again ask himself if he thought he was Chrissie.<br>\r\nIn the wardrobe were some skirts, dresses, shorts, leggings but he couldn't find some skimpy jeans to wear. He thought about to take a dress but as he take one he saw how short it was... not again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he takes one of the jeans shorts. They wouldn't show his underwear if he spread his legs and they cover a little more of his legs. Also he had seen them on Chrissie... he love the look he looks in them if he combine them with some dark tights... and once again he was confused. \"Why am I thinking I'm Chrissie? Am I starting to enjoy it... too much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he comes back to himself, he sees the tights in one of his hands and in the other the shorts. Before he gets more confusing thoughts, he simply take the choice of tights and shorts and put them on. They were tight but less revealing than the skirt.<br>\r\nOnce again he saw himself in the mirror and his lower half looks like that of a female. A female called Chrissie.<br>\r\nHe take some poses to see everything and soon he was looking for the right top or shirt to finish his look... his look?<br>\r\nHe found a black top with spaghetti straps that shows his shoulders and his belly... but he liked it. <br>\r\nIf someone would see him now from the back, that someone would probably say that's Chrissie with short hair.<br>\r\nAnd Mick wasn't finished... he simply gets to aroused at the possibility to wear these clothes, even if he didn't know why. He open another wardrobe and saw all kinds of shoes but he already knew what he likes to wear.<br>\r\nA pair of black boots with 2 inch heels. They fit perfect with this outfit he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he wants to leave the room it hits him why he takes this outfit in the end. That was the outfit he likes the most on her and at the moment it was his outfit and so he was Chrissie very near. He wants to be near to Chrissie... he has an crush on Chrissie but couldn't tell her... but now as Chrissie he could tell himself that he wants to be a couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he leaves the room and go to Trish and Chrissie but couldn't believe what he saw.</span></div></div>",

The skirt was constricting his legs so much it was making it difficult to walk, the pumps weren't helping with it any either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick opened up the door as Chrissie stood there with the biggest grin imaginable, she was enjoying herself a lot.<br>\r\n\"Make yourself feel at home.\" Mick then said as he pulled on his skirt.<br>\r\n\"I always do.\" Chrissie said as she gave Mick a soft rub underneath the skirt as she passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick was about to follow her further until Trish pulled him aside.<br>\r\n\"I have a suggestion.\" Trish quietly said as she pulled Mick close to her.<br>\r\n\"What kind of suggestion? I'm having a hard time dealing with this right now, it better be good.\" Mick reluctantly said as he surrendered to Trish.<br>\r\n\"I can see you're having some issues with Chrissie's clothes, but if you're willing, I would like to swap with you instead.\" Trish grinned as she loosened her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick looked Trish up and down, her shorts seemed to be a bit more comfortable than the skirt, a bit less restrictive, but still tight. The rest of the outfit he didn't particularly mind either.<br>\r\n\"Sure, it'll be a nice change.\" Mick nodded as Trish dragged him outside Chrissie's room and into the bathroom. Chrissie was just confused as she saw this happen in front of her, but her imagination thought they were going to do something very different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going to change in here? Together?\" Mick asked worried as Trish locked the door.<br>\r\n\"Right here, together.\" She nodded as she started to pull off her tight shorts.<br>\r\n\"If you insist.\" Mick smiled as he (finally) slid off the tight skirt and instantly felt some relief on his legs.<br>\r\nBoth of them continued to strip, taking off their shirts, shoes, everything until they were in their underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look cute in a bra.\" Trish giggled as she stared at the bulge visible in the thong Mick was wearing.<br>\r\n\"You're not looking at it however.\" Mick then blushed as he covered himself a bit more.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, let's get on with changing underwear too.\" Trish then smiled as she took off her panties and unhooked her bra.<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, what is it that we swap? Just clothes, or do you want Chrissie's life too?\" Mick asked curiously.<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Trish finally admitted.</span></div></div>",

He started by sliding on Trish's black panties, which immediately were much more comfortable and soft compared to Chrissie's thong, though still not quite as comfortable as his own underwear would be. He then quickly, after some fidgeting, managed to put on Trish's bra, which tightly gripped his chest, they were a bit tighter than Chrissie's was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick grabbed Trish's tiny jean shorts off the floor and smiled at he put them on. He felt the tight black shorts softly on his legs as he pulled them up, but in the end, they actually felt tighter than the skirt, due to Trish being a bit smaller. Mick just managed to close the zipper and button and quickly straightened them out as he attempted to pull them down a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick finished putting on Trish's clothes by pulling on her red tank top, again, tightly hugging his chest, but it felt really soft and quite nice. He then put on the sweater as it tightly but comfortably fell over his shoulders. Then finally, he put on Trish's sneakers, which were a bit too tight for him, but he managed to just barely squeeze his feet into them, but they did hurt a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish on the other hand, had finished getting dressed as well. She was now wearing Chrissie's white skirt, which fitted her curves surprisingly well, her legs looking much better in them compared to Mick's male ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also wearing Chrissie's baby blue v-neck and her pumps, which both were a little loose on her, but still fitted really well as she walked around a little in her new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So \"Trish\" what do you think?\" Trish said as she struck a pose, causing the tight skirt she was wearing to show off her shaved legs.<br>\r\n\"\"Well, \"Chrissie\", you look amazing. What about me.\" Mick grinned back as he mimicked the pose Trish was making.<br>\r\n\"You look really cute.\" Trish giggled as she inspected Mick wearing her clothes.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Mick asked getting a bit nervous.<br>\r\n\"Are they too tight.\" Trish smirked as she smacked his ass.<br>\r\n\"Hey, no, a bit, but much better than that skirt.\" Mick blushed back as Trish admired herself in the bathroom mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newly swapped pair finished up and walked out of the bathroom, only to find Chrissie, or \"Mick\" sitting on the couch with a bag of chips setting up a film for them to watch.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was early evening when Mick entered the laundry room in the basement of his apartment building carrying an overfilled laundry basket. It was the Friday of the last week before a holiday break many students had already gone home, so the laundry room was empty. Picking out a washing machine, Mick began to load up his laundry. He had <i>a lot</i> of it. Like his usual lazy self, he had been putting off doing his laundry until he could no longer wait. The t-shirt, jeans, and boxers he was currently wearing were the only clothes he had that weren't dirty. Fortunately, there was just enough room in the machine for everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments after Mick put his change in and started up the machine, a group of three girls entered the laundry room. These three girls were friends that roomed together in one of the other apartments in the building. Mick had got to know them a bit over the course of the semester, so they waved at him as they entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mick,\" Brooklyn greeted him, setting her laundry basket on a nearby washer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Mick replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooklyn was a pretty 20 year old blonde way out of Mick's league, or so he thought. She was quite down to earth and very friendly with everyone in addition to having good looks. A radiant smile could almost always be found on her pretty face, which was framed by her long, straight blonde hair that reached halfway down her back. Today she was wearing a low-cut white top that showed off her nice C-cup breasts and a short denim skirt that showed off her gorgeous legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two girls were named Maddy and Sarah, both 19 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddy was a cool, energetic tomboy Mick also found quite attractive. She wasn't extremely boyish looking, but she wasn't incredibly feminine either. Not one to wear skirts or dresses ever, Maddy was wearing a loose gray tank top with the logo of some band on it, and a pair of super tight black skinny jeans. She also had a plaid flannel shirt wrapped around her waist. In terms of looks, Maddy was less curvy than Brooklyn, but she was still a looker. She had a great butt and perky B-cup breasts too. As usual, her shoulder-length dark brown hair was pulled back into a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Sarah, who was more of a cute nerdy type. She was somewhere between Brooklyn and Maddy on the femininity spectrum. She had black hair cut in a feminine bob style and she wore designer glasses. She had the most slender build of the three girls and she had B-cup breasts like Maddy. Sarah currently wore a short-sleeved light blue top with a somewhat low neckline, and a pair of short denim shorts over a pair of black leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince they were all indoors, Mick noticed the girls weren't wearing anything on their feet other than their socks, much like he was himself. Without shoes to skew things, Mick noticed all three of them were about the same height, right around 5'7\", give or take. Maddy was just slightly taller than the other two and Mick was only just slightly taller than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls loaded up their laundry, they chatted amongst themselves. They talked about boys, school, and their plans for the break. Mick didn't really pay attention, instead focusing on his phone while he waited for his laundry. He did notice that despite having drastically different personalities, Brooklyn, Maddy, and Sarah seemed to be quite close friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you, Mick?\" Maddy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what?\" Mick responded, suddenly hearing his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're talking about our plans for the break,\" Sarah said. \"You have anything going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, not really,\" Mick said. \"I'm actually staying here for the break. My folks live on the other side of the country.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool,\" Brooklyn said. \"There's plenty to do around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Mick said before turning his attention back to his laundry. It was time to change over to the dryer. He emptied out his washing machine, dumping the items that couldn't go in the dryer into his empty laundry basket and then loading the rest into the dryer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was done, he sort of tuned back into the girls' conversation. They were chatting about clothes now. Brooklyn complimented Maddy on how cool her clothes were, Sarah expressed envy of Brooklyn's fashion sense, and Maddy mentioned she was thinking of changing her style up, among other points of discussion. Mick didn't know much about clothes beyond what he found comfortable to wear and what he found attractive on girls, so he tuned out again. That is until the girls dragged him into their conversation again, asking him his opinion on their outfits and other such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did his best to engage with them, finding it nice to have some people to talk to during the boring process of doing laundry. However, he soon had to step out before the dryer finished, having been struck with the sudden need to use the bathroom. The spicy food he'd had for lunch earlier had caught up with him, it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you girls mind watching my laundry for a few?\" Mick asked the girls. \"I've gotta run to the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem,\" Maddy said. \"We're gonna be here for a little while anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Mick said before rushing to the bathroom. He was in such a hurry that he didn't notice Brooklyn, Maddy, and Sarah quietly whispering and giggling to each other as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick barely made it in time. He just managed to pull his pants down and sit on the toilet before his bowels began to vacate. What followed was several minutes of discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick must have been in the bathroom longer than he thought because when he returned to the laundry room the girls were all gone ... as was his laundry, wet clothes from the washer, dried clothes from the dryer, basket, and all! The only thing left behind was a laundry basket containing the clean laundry of one of the girls and a note that simply said \"enjoy :)\" and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a closer look, Mick was able to determine that the clothes that had been left behind were ...</span></div></div>",

Then I can go in and put on yours.\" He suggested.<br>\r\n\"Or, we could just turn our backs to each other and trade clothes like that.\" Maddie said giggling.<br>\r\n\"That's also an option.\" Mick said throwing aside the towel and taking up position turning his back to Maddy.<br>\r\n\"Your underwear better be clean btw.\" Maddy giggled as she took position as well.<br>\r\n\"Just as clean as yours I assume.\" Mick said with a smirk.<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" Maddy giggled as she started to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take too long for either of them to undress. Mick quickly pulled off his shirt and passed it to his back. Maddy quickly took it from him but was still undressing that part herself. She took off her gray tank top and unwrapped the flannel shirt from her waist, but lastly, also took off her black bra and passed a bundle of all three to Mick while pulling on his shirt.Mick took the bra, shirt and top from Maddy and tried to put on the bra, but after a few tries he managed to get it around his chest and pulled on the tank top but left the flannel shirt unwrapped for now to make sure it didn't get in the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Maddy was wiggling out of her very tight black skinny jeans but managed to do so without too much difficulty at all. She then slipped off her panties and handed both of them to Mick. Mick took them from her hand and quickly pulled down his jeans and underwear and gave them to Maddy. His stomach dropped as he tried to slip into her panties, which was stressing his privates a little bit, but then he tried to squeeze into Maddy's or well, his new jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddy meanwhile had already managed to slip into Mick's boxers and jeans and was quite happy with the feeling.<br>\r\n\"You done?\" Maddy asked curiously.<br>\r\n\"One second, just slipping into your jeans.\" Mick said pulling on the incredibly tight skinny jeans.<br>\r\n\"Do they fit okay?\" Maddy asked worried.<br>\r\n\"They're really tight, but I'm managing to get them on.\" Mick said back pulling them over his butt and closing the zipper with a few good tugs.<br>\r\n\"Don't rip them if they don't fit okay, we don't have to trade.\" Maddy said still worried.<br>\r\n\"I actually quite like them, they fit better than I thought actually.\" Mick said with some cheer in his voice.<br>\r\n\"So you're dressed?\" Maddy said with a wide smile.<br>\r\n\"Now I am.\" Mick said wrapping the flannel shirt around his waist and both of them turned around to face each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look really good actually.\" Mick said slightly blushing seeing Maddy in his clothes.<br>\r\n\"Never thought I would say it but I love how my clothes look on you, they fit you really well.\" Maddy said inspecting how her outfit fits on Mick.<br>\r\n\"Are you happy now that we're wearing each other's clothes?\" Mick smiled.<br>\r\n\"Very.\" Maddy smiled back.<br>\r\n\"Let me know whenever you want to swap back okay?\" Mick said.<br>\r\n\"And what if I never do?\" Maddy grinned.<br>\r\n\"We'll never swap back.\" Mick said as serious as he could muster.<br>\r\n\"We'll see.\" Maddy laughed.<br>\r\n\"Would you mind helping me clean up \"my\" laundry?\" Mick asked.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Maddy smiled as she helped Mick place her clothes in his closet and both of them got used to their swapped state as they did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning up the laundry, Maddy suggested....</span></div></div>",

Mick carefully looked through the neatly folded items of clothing and found some gray skinny jeans and a black t-shirt of some game laying on top, at first, he didn't pay too much attention to it and thought they were just playing some prank on him by hiding something in the basket to scare him or whatever so he went back to his room without paying closer attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was back in his room however, he set the laundry basket down next to his empty closet and started to put the items of clothing into them, or at least, he was going to. The first items didn't draw any attention to him, they were gray skinny jeans, which he had himself as well as a black shirt that looked familiar to him. But then, he started to realize exactly what had happened, getting deeper into the basket revealed some tiny jean shorts, leggings, tank tops, bra's panties and all kind of clothes that definitely didn't belong to him.<br>\r\nInspecting the clothes a bit further, more specifically the jeans that failed to raise suspicion, and sure enough, they definitely were Sarah's. They were a size smaller than his own and were of an even tighter fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collection of clothes he was so generously traded by Sarah, included quite a bit of variety. Sarah was a girl that liked dressing girly in skirts and blouses, but also enjoyed a more modest look with skinny jeans or sweatpants, they downside was that all of them were smaller than his own and some of them quite revealing. He liked seeing them on Sarah from time to time, but seeing some of them here, wasn't exactly having the same effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I not notice this?\" Mick asks himself as he empties the basket filled with Sarah's clothing.<br>\r\n\"This is definitely not everything, Sarah has more clothes than this.\" Mick easily concluded as he laid the clothes on his bed.<br>\r\n\"But more importantly, where are my clothes?\" Mick mumbled to himself as he got ready to walk out of his room to get some answers.<br>\r\nHowever, when he opened his door, he was greeted by...</span></div></div>",

Mick could not react fast enough as the bucket tipped over, showering him with gross, dirty water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on!\" Mick exclaimed. He looked down to see his clothes were now soaked and dirty, not to mention the rest of him. \"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, he looked left and then right. There was no one in the hallway.

Brooklyn?\" No response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick let out a heavy sigh, then returned to him room after making sure the trap was disconnected from his door. He then stripped down and cast his dirty clothes aside. First he needed a nice relaxing shower, then he would get answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the water in the shower was up to temperature, he got in and set about washing himself, especially his hair. Aside from his clothes, that had gotten the most dirty. Once he was clean, he spent a few extra minutes in the shower relaxing before getting out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drying off, it was time to get dressed. That's when it hit Mick ... literally all his clothes had been in the laundry and now they were gone.

He grabbed the towel he used to dry himself and rushed out of the shower and towards the door and opened it up slightly.<br>\r\n\"What the hell did you girls think you were doing?\" Was all Mick could say as he saw Sarah's face, but he only opened the door very slightly, so he couldn't make out much more than her face.<br>\r\n\"I'll explain later, I've come to give you the rest of my clothes, jackets and shoes and take anything you have remaining, but first, it looks like my trap worked!\" Sarah giggled as she grabbed something from behind her.<br>\r\n\"I knew these weren't all of your clothes and that trap was clever, but, *sigh* let me get dressed first.\" Mick reluctantly complained.<br>\r\n\"Take these, you should recognize them.\" Sarah winked as she passed over a nearly folded outfit. Mick nodded as he took the outfit and closed the door to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was right, he did recognize the outfit, it was the one Sarah was wearing before. \"But if she's giving me these? Is she wearing some of mine?\" Mick questioned himself as he reluctantly grabbed the clothes, which consisted of a pink panties and bra combo, some black leggings, tiny blue denim shorts and a short-sleeved light blue top with a somewhat low neckline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick started by pulling on the panties, which due to Sarah's smaller figure, were a bit difficult to pull up, they stretched a little and had to until the eventually (poorly) covered his privates. The panties snugly hugged his hips as he got ready to grab the next item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued by grabbing the tight black leggings and pulled them up on over his legs. The leggings felt quite good actually, they were a bit stretchy and it helped a lot as he covered his legs with the black material. Mick softly rubbed the black fabric as he smiled to himself.<br>\r\n\"Wait, I am not starting to enjoy this am I?\" Mick whispered to himself as he shook the thoughts and moved on to the denim shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling on the shorts was a bit more difficult. They were not as stretchy and definitely tiny, but this didn't make pulling them on much easier. Mick struggled for a bit to fully get the shorts up all the way, but this wasn't the main issue. It took some attempts to finally get the blue denim shorts to be zipped up, Sarah's clothes were making him very excited and this didn't help as it made the shorts ever tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick finally managed to close up the shorts and he grabbed the bra, which he managed to put on without too much struggling, at least compared to the shorts, and finished up by putting on the light blue top which started to tightly hug his upper body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick took a second to check himself out in the mirror before letting Sarah in, the outfit Sarah was wearing earlier and thus he was wearing now, looked really cute. He didn't mind the tightness, in fact he kind of liked it, though he was thankful this outfit wasn't extremely girly, but still feminine enough to be vastly different to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter admiring himself in the mirror for a short moment, he walked over to the door to let Sarah in, but he immediately noticed something was off, after taking a closer look, he realized Sarah was...</span></div></div>",

At first he pulled down the jean shorts whenever he could, but after about three times he stopped doing it figuring it wasn't worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around in them since Sarah handed him her clothes, they started to feel kind of comfortable. The shorts eventually assumed a comfortable position hugging his hips and ass, the top was comfortable, be it a bit tight, but that was how it was supposed to fit anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few small things he couldn't get used to easily, the first of which were the pink panties, they were a bit small for him. The panties were soft however as they rubbed against his hips and his package as he was walking, it aroused him a little, they were Sarah's panties after all, even more erotic was that these were the panties she was wearing herself earlier today, so they still felt warm when he put them on previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second item that was difficult to get used to was the bra, he didn't exactly needed it and it was quite tight on him, but he kept it on regardless. This did however allow him to understand the complaints of a bra strap being a bit uncomfortable. Just like the panties they were soft however and have the slight illusion of him having Sarah's breasts as the cups stayed intact, but it wasn't something he was concerned with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing he currently had issues with were the leggings, mostly due to his leg hair not agreeing with it. The fabric was soft and comfortable, but his leg hair caused them to itch or even hurt at some points. But he preferred the leggings instead of his bare legs, they would look terrible with Sarah's shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick finished up cleaning up his room in about 20 minutes, he liked his home to be clean, so he usually didn't let any mess he could make last longer than a few days.

He knew he would feel much more comfortable if he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick entered the bathroom and got out the razor he used to shave his face. He set it down on the counter next to the sink, then stripped off Sarah's shorts, leggings and panties. He then got into the shower to shave so he could wash his hair down the drain when he was done. Mick had never shaved his legs before, but he didn't find it too difficult. He nicked himself with the razor a couple of times by accident, but all in all he did a pretty good job of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done, Mick stepped out of the shower, then turned the water on, washing his leg hair down the drain. After shutting off the water, rinsing off his razor, then putting it away, Mick ran his hands over his smooth legs. It felt very weird, but kind of good too. Next, it was time to get dressed. The panties went on first, followed by the leggings. The tight, stretchy garment felt so much better running over his legs now that they had been shaved. There were no hairs to catch on, no itchiness, and no pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was a good idea,\" Mick said to himself as he adjusted the leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the leggings were on comfortably, Mick pulled Sarah's shorts back on. Once again, he had a slight bit of difficulty getting them on, but he managed to get them on comfortably eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for shoes,\" Mick muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed to his closet and checked out the collection of shoes Sarah had left him. There were far more shoes than he'd ever owned at one time. Looking closer, Mick found that Sarah's were not that much smaller than his own. His own feet weren't particularly large and were in fact below average for a guy of his size. Even so, Sarah's shoes were still a bit smaller than what would be recommended for feet of his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some deliberation, Mick selected a pair of blueish-gray slip-on ballet flats. Given that they could slip right on, he thought they would be easier to squeeze his feet into. The fact that they didn't require socks helped with that too. Mick's theory proved to be correct. The shoes went on pretty easily and weren't even that uncomfortable even though they were a bit small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was fully dressed, Mick took one last look in the mirror, then decided ...</span></div></div>",

He started to kind of enjoy Sarah's clothes, more than he thought he would when he first saw them. As Mick grabbed his phone, he adjusted his shorts and put the phone in his front pocket, which was much smaller than he was used to and honestly didn't keep his phone secured all that well, but he wasn't used to putting it in his back pocket like most girls were and didn't think to do that instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his was to the girls' apartment, Mick adjusted to walking in Sarah's flats, they were very different from what he was used to, his own shoes were a lot less soft and more solid, but he didn't mind Sarah's that much. The hallway was quiet apart from some giggles coming from the girls he was about to go see, giving him some comfort no one else would see him. He liked Sarah's clothes, but he still didn't want too many people to see him like this after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally arriving at the apartment, Mick knocked on the door and was quickly met with an excited Sarah who let him in. The girls' apartment was more spacious than his own, but this one also support more people after all. It was quite clean and the table had already been set with four plates as Brooklyn and Maddy were almost done cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you've arrived! You look great btw.\" Maddy smiled as she looked back at their guest.<br>\r\n\"I can't say I disagree with that, good to have you here Mick.\" Brooklyn smiled as Mick nodded.<br>\r\n\"Thank you for having me over.\" Mick smiled back as Brooklyn took a little break from cooking to greet him.<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about it, we'll have a fun night together and you have to try my cooking, I'm quite proud of it.\" Brooklyn said as she inspected Mick's attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brooklyn inspected Mick in Sarah's clothes, Mick did the same for Brooklyn and Maddy.<br>\r\nStarting with Brooklyn, Mick quickly realized she was wearing Maddy's clothes just like Sarah told him. She had her slightly more feminine curves squeezed into Maddy's really tight black skinny jeans, which looked really hot on her. She was also wearing Maddy's loose gray t-shirt and had her plaid flannel shirt wrapped around her waist. While it wasn't extremely feminine, Mick really liked this look on Brooklyn she could definitely pull it off well. The only thing Mick did notice this time, was that the girls also seem to have swapped bra's, which caused Brooklyn's breasts to be squeezed into a slightly tighter bra than she was used to, but again, Mick just thought this made her look hotter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddy on the other hand, was wearing his own clothes. She was the only one not wearing the clothes that person wasn't wearing at the start of today, due to Mick's clothes having become dirty due to their trap. Instead she was wearing some dark blue men's skinny jeans, which fell a lot looser on her than her own skinny jeans, she was wearing one of Mick's favorite black t-shirts and he could tell she wasn't wearing a bra, making her breasts a bit visible through the fabric of the shirt. She was also wearing Mick's comfortable boxers and sneakers, which she seemed to really enjoy wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls look great too.\" Mick said after inspected them and was immediately met with a unanimous \"Thank you!\" as the girls giggled.<br>\r\n\"I love how Sarah's clothes look on you.\" Brooklyn teased Mick as she pulled on the shorts Mick was wearing.<br>\r\n\"Maddy's clothes don't look half bad on you either.\" Mick winked as Brooklyn retreated back to finishing up dinner.<br>\r\n\"Dinner is ready!\" Maddy yelled not long after as the four friends sat down for a quiet meal together. (Oh who am I kidding, the girls starting talking and giggling the second they sat down.)</span></div></div>",

He actually joked back she could keep them as they laughed and winked at each other to make sure they were joking, but they could both tell they were only half joking, though kept it to themselves for now.<br>\r\nMaddy ended up complaining a little bit about the lack of variety in Mick's wardrobe, but quickly dismissed it as she passed over her turn to Brooklyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooklyn was quick to mention she liked Maddy's clothes immediately, but was a bit skeptical about her look at first. But once she slid on her super tight skinny jeans and tank top she immediately fell in love with them. Brooklyn even admitted she shared a music interest with not only Maddy, but also Mick as she went on about the band Maddy's tank top was depicting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was last to talk about her experience with Brooklyn's clothes so far and was probably the most excited out of everyone. She showed off her cute legs underneath Brooklyn's denim skirt and talked about how comfortable, but stylish it was. Brooklyn giggled as she complimented on how good it looked on her as she offered to help her style her anytime she wants, to which she happily nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah finished her story, dinner was about coming to an end and Brooklyn shoved a bit closer toward Mick as the other girls were too engrossed in conversation to really notice.<br>\r\n\"You still look way cute in Sarah's clothes.\" Brooklyn giggled as Mick just blushed at the notion of being called cute by someone as hot as Brooklyn.<br>\r\n\"Maddy's clothes look really cute on you too.\" Mick managed to get out as Brooklyn smiled at his discomfort.<br>\r\n\"Do you want to help me start cleaning up the table?\" She then asked to break the discomfort and Mick smiled back and easily complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick and Brooklyn started cleaning the table as Maddy and Sarah were still gushing about the clothes swaps and Brooklyn was more or less preoccupied cleaning the table and checking out Mick as he was walking back and forth.<br>\r\n\"The food was amazing, could you, if you want to of course, maybe teach me a little as well sometime?\" Mick asked Brooklyn as she was collecting the last few plates.<br>\r\n\"Sure, we can have our own private lesson.\" She smiled back as the group took place on the large couch in front of the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how long are we going to stay like this for?\" Mick then finally asked as has sat in between Maddy and Brooklyn on the couch.<br>\r\nSarah sat down next to Maddy to the side and the girls looked at each other for a moment and started giggling.<br>\r\n\"Well, you see, after experiencing each other's outfits and especially after seeing you dressed in Sarah's, we were planning to stay swapped......\" Brooklyn explained as the other girls were giggling.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't quite sure how he felt about wearing Sarah's clothes for that long. On one hand it was weird to wear girls' clothes, but on the other hand he kind of enjoyed it. The one issue he had was a fear of how others would see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like anyone else is around to see you, if that's what you're worried about,\" Maddy said, playfully nudging Mick with her elbow. She did raise a good point.

Mick certainly didn't expect an attractive girl like her to hug him, but he wasn't complaining. If staying like this during break meant more hugs from Brooklyn then it was totally worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we doing now?\" Maddy asked. \"How about we find a movie to watch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me,\" Sarah said. \"I'll make some popcorn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll find something good,\" Maddy said. \"Don't worry Mick, we won't pick a chick flick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls jumped up from the couch, Sarah leaving to throw some popcorn in the microwave, and Maddy firing up Netflix. That just left Mick and Brooklyn on the couch. Mick glanced over at her to see her smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Sarah returned with the popcorn and then they all decided on what to watch from the selections Maddy had made. Ultimately, they decided on a fun comedy movie. As the movie started up, Mick felt Brooklyn put her arm around him. He once again had no complaints.

It didn't take long however for Mick to feel Brooklyn's arm tighten her grip around him and saw her smiling at him whenever he glanced over.<br>\r\nDeciding it was time to return the favor, Mick put his own arm around Brooklyn's waist and quickly felt her pull him closer, very much to his liking. They assumed a cuddling position with Brooklyn laying against Mick while resting her head on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't all however as Mick felt her hand slip into the back of his jean shorts and softly squeeze his ass inside the panties, which he couldn't help but get turned on by. Mick followed up again by moving his hands to rest on Brooklyn's hips, though not inside of the extremely tight skinny jeans as there wasn't enough room for his hand anyway. Brooklyn didn't seem to mind this however as the pair continued to cuddle as the Movie reached it's final act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah glanced over at the pair of cuddling friends and poked Maddy to make sure she saw as well. Mick didn't catch much of this out of the corner of his eye, but he saw something along the lines of the girls giggling and winking at Brooklyn. Looking at Brooklyn however, Mick noticed a slight blush on her cheeks as he looked at her as she grabbed his and guided it into one of the front pockets of the skinny jeans, quickly following with Mick putting it inside as Brooklyn shifts even closer, almost sitting on his lap at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother half an hour passes as Mick focuses back on watching the end of the movie. Sarah and Maddy get up from the couch and stretch and yawn as they watch the clock. Mick was about to excuse himself and return to his room, but Sarah gestures for him to check on his side, where he found Brooklyn peacefully sleeping at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can use this if you want.\" Maddy whispered as she laid a blanket next to him and winked as she and Sarah headed to their rooms to go to sleep as well. This made Mick's decision a lot more difficult, on the one hand he wouldn't mind a comfortable bed, but he also didn't mind sleeping while cuddling with Brooklyn, though the couch could be a tad uncomfortable.</span></div></div>",

Despite the size difference both seemed relatively comfy in the others shoes <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReg you and Raphael can go ahead and swap shirts as I\u2019m sure you can squeeze into it\u201d said mick knowing that he had to make them swap something as to not be suspicious <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLastly Brit I\u2019ll take your glasses\u201d said mick as Britney handed them over <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that that hands over let\u2019s continue, I bet my jeans\u201d declared Britney after she had a few shots<br>\r\n\"I bet my shirt.\" Mick said.<br>\r\n\"I bet my shirt as well.\" Caitlyn said.<br>\r\n\"I bet my underwear!\" Laura said.<br>\r\n\"I bet my shoes.\" Raphael said.<br>\r\n\"I bet my pants.\" Reg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It will be the last thing I have.\" Mick remarked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah you're right.\" Britney said, noticing the game was ending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, let's finish this strongly!\" Laura said. \"Oh Raph, we're swapping underwear and while we're at it, shoes as well! Reg, you can swap pants with Mick, Mick you can swap shirts with me and Caitie can swap shirts with Raph and her pants with Brit!\" Laura appointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese swaps reluctantly took place as Laura was quick to strip out of her underwear, heeled boots and shirt, giving her sexy underwear and boots to her boyfriend and got his comfortable boxers and shoes in return, while throwing her yellow crop top to Mick and getting his shirt in return.<br>\r\nMick quickly pulled on the crop top, though it was very tight and took off the yoga pants in exchange for Reg's pants. Caitlyn then swapped her top for Raphael's shirt, which previously belonged to reg and swapped Charlotte's jeans for Britney's, which previously belonged to Mick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final results end up being the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick had partially male clothes, which ended up being Reg's pants and boxers, which were just a little bit too wide, but everything else was borrowed from girls. He was wearing Caitlyn's tight push up bra underneath Laura's yellow crop top, which were both tight and resulted in a good bit of his belly being shown. He was also still sporting Charlotte's heels with Laura's socks inside them and lastly also now sported Charlotte's glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney had a decent mix of male and female in the end. She still had female pants in the form of Charlotte's skinny jeans as well as Charlotte's bra. But she was also wearing Raphael's shirt and jacket along with Reg's shoes with Mick's socks inside. She did however still have her own panties. Apart from raphael's shirt and jacket, everything seemed to be close to her own size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlyn seemed to be quite satisfied having lost most of her uncomfortable stuff. She still have female underwear, specifically Charlotte's which was very similar to her own. She was also wearing Britney's comfortable sneakers now, but she did have her own socks still. Alongside this however, she did mange to get Mick's comfortable jeans which fit her decently well as well as Reg's shirt, which she really enjoyed stealing from him as it loosely fell around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was also quite pleased and mostly hit her boyfriend with swaps. She was wearing his comfortable pants as well as his boxers and shoes comfortably touching her skin. She did however now own Britney's tights and Mick's shirt, though she didn't mind either of them that much. She also wasn't in possession of any of her own stuff anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReg wasn't very happy however, he didn't have a bra and had his own sicks, but nothing else. He was wearing Charlotte's top, but other than that, had his girlfriend's yoga pants, thong and heels that were just several sizes too small for him and made him extremely uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaphael wasn't happy either, just like Reg, he only had his own socks still, but he did however now have Laura's bra, as well as her thong. He was also squeezed into both her tiny jean shorts and her heeled boots, which were again, a few sized too small and were extremely tight. He did however have Caitlyn's pink tank top to go with his girlfriend's outfit.</span></div></div>",

I mean, my dress, walking like this with you, it's nice.\" Mick said blushing.<br>\r\n\"You do look really good in that dress.\" Bel\u00e9n winked as Mick shyly looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, they arrived at one of the parks nearby, which was completely empty at this hour and quickly spotted a bench nearby.<br>\r\n\"Mind if we take a seat for a little bit?\" Mick asked.<br>\r\n\"Sure, we've been walking for a little bit now.\" Bel\u00e9n nodded and they proceeded to sit down.<br>\r\nMick pulled a little bit on the dress, but let out a small smile as they sat down.<br>\r\n\"You really are starting to enjoy this aren't you, Bel\u00e9n?\" Bel\u00e9n asked nudging towards Mick.<br>\r\n\"It took some getting used to, but yeah, at least a little bit. Mick.\" Mick nudged back. \"It isn't the warmest I've ever been though.\" Mick then joked.<br>\r\n\"Luckily for you, I can give you some of that.\" Bel\u00e9n giggled as she forced him into a cuddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile cuddling, Mick and Bel\u00e9n got to know each other a bit more. Mick talked about his studies and some of the funny stories about his last job and school days, while Bel\u00e9n shared her own experiences.<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour, they got back up and started walking again, though Mick was seemingly walking a lot more comfortably, even trying to slightly shake his hips like a girl as he walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to ask you something.\" Bel\u00e9n said as they were walking back in the general direction of the party.<br>\r\n\"What is it Mick?\" Mick asked back.<br>\r\n\"...\" Bel\u00e9n asked as she let out a grin.</span></div></div>",

The headwear looked to be attached to the rest of the catsuit on the backside, meaning you'd just have to pull it over your head and similarly, the gloves were a part of the suit as well, just smoothly transitional from the suit. The only part that wasn't part of the overall suit were the boots, which had to be put on separately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick on the other hand wasn't wearing anything too interesting. He was wearing some black slim fitting jeans, a gray t-shirt and some sneakers, certainly a bit more comfortable than her catsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, we can use this divider, just hang your clothes over top of it and we can change that way.\" Celina said.<br>\r\n\"Sure, but why is there even a changing room we can use here.\" Mick asked.<br>\r\n\"Apparently, all contestants for the cosplay contest are given changing rooms, but I didn't know so I didn't bring any normal clothes.\" Celina explained.<br>\r\n\"Ah I see, well let's get changed then.\" Mick said just wanting to get it over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick was fairly quick to take off his clothes, reluctantly hanging his clothes over the divider piece by piece. Not long after, the catsuit appeared over top of it as well and the boots were pushed over on the side, which triggered Mick to do the same with his sneakers. Though, when a pair of panties appeared on the divider, Mick had to take a deep breath as he hadn't accounted for it yet, but without saying a word about it, he took off his boxers and laid them over, accepting the trade to include it.<br>\r\n\"Only panties?\" Mick did ask as he didn't see a bra accompanying it.<br>\r\n\"Not wearing a bra with this costume.\" Celine giggled as she starting taking Mick's pieces off the divider and got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelina enjoyed getting dressed, she slid on the comfortable boxers and jeans, reveling in their comfort as she pulled Mick's shirt over her head and stepped into the sneakers, very quickly getting dressed, but patiently waits until Mick is dressed before coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick on the other hand, took a bit more time. He managed to slid on the panties okay, though they weren't very comfortable, they fit. But he did notice the suit was at least a size too small for him, though luckily(?) for him, the leather was a bit stretchy, so even though it was smaller, he could fit in it technically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick stepped into the catsuit as he lay it on the ground, grabbed it and squeezed his legs into the black leather catsuit, which luckily adjusted to his shape a little, but not without some uncomfortable rubbing. He soon realized it was going to hurt on his privates and tried to put them into as comfortable and as hidden of a position, which was somewhat successful, though a slight bulge was still visible, though it was fairly well hidden now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing on, Mick slid his arms into the sleeves and gloves and actually kind of liked the feeling it gave him as he slid his arms into the warm and soft leather sleeves. As his fingers started to fit into the gloves and the catsuit started to be pulled up over his shoulders, it pulled on his privates a bit more, making sure that whatever he did, that wouldn't be able to move anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick then fully closed the zipper and grabbed the boots, stepping into them and they were luckily for him, just about his size. The boots were relatively comfortable because of this and he managed to tighten them really easily. Though it did take a few steps for him to get used to the heel that was attached to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, Mick pulled on the headwear over top of his head and started to step out from the side of the divider.<br>\r\n\"OMG, you look so good.\" Celia said excited as she gave Mick a hug.<br>\r\n\"You think so? You look really cute yourself.\" Mick said blushing.<br>\r\n\"You totally rock that suit, if you had tits you would make a pretty cute girl.\" She giggled.<br>\r\n\"Not sure if that's a compliment.\" Mick said still blushing.<br>\r\n\"It just means you won't get that many strange looks due to you not being extremely out of place.\" She winked as she grabbed his hand and dragged him outside again.</span></div></div>",

The man quickly focused on Lisa so he had a little bit of room to move, he wasn't out of sight, but not in his field of focus either.<br>\r\nHe unbuttoned his jeans and made a slight adjustment to pull them over his butt and to his knees. From his knees he rubbed his legs to pull them down to his ankles, kicked off his shoes and used his feet to take off the jeans for the last little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then drew the focus of the conversation by talking about his experiences and what he could offer Lisa's company. She took this opportunity to do the same, only just being able to pull her jeans down her butt before the focus was drawn back. She finished kicking off her jeans as well and game mick a slight tap against his ankle of her foot and she kicked her jeans towards Mick while he did the same with his towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa managed to grab Mick's jeans with her feet and managed to slip her feet inside of them, but to properly get them over her legs, she needed to wait for Mick to grab the attention again so she could quickly give them a pull to get them over her legs. Mick tried his best and ended up being successful as Lisa quickly pulled them on further with only one hand slipping down quickly and got them over her butt without the man noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Mick's turn to pull on Lisa's jeans and this went a little less smoothly as they were very tight and needed more than one good pull to get on. Lisa was great at getting the attention and Mick made the excuse to drop his pen to buy his enough time to zip up Lisa's jeans and hoped he wouldn't look down to get them. But since he was sitting on the other side of the table, he paid it no mind and Mick finally pulled on Lisa's jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa noticed and immediately began spinning the conversation towards the end where she will accept. Mick met her challenge and she successfully forced him to trade pants with her, which was something she really liked. She loved wearing Mick's jeans and grinned as she finished off the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was happening, Mick felt the soft fabric of Lisa's jeans on his legs. They were tight but didn't look too bad and were quite comfortable actually. He did have to do his best not to get a boner though as it would very much be visible in the very tight jeans and hoped Lisa would end this soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was a pleasure to have this talk with you and we are looking forward to working together.\" The man said as he grabbed his papers. \"Mick, could you please walk out this lovely lady on your way out, you can take the rest of the day off in light of this amazing news.\" He said in high spirits as he closed the door.<br>\r\n\"Well that went well.\" Lisa smirked.<br>\r\n\"The meeting or the swap?\" Mick asked.<br>\r\n\"Both, you did good.\" She smirked.<br>\r\n\"Let's get out of here.\" Mick then said as he lead her outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to come back to my place?\" She asked as she got in her car.<br>\r\n\"You want to swap more don't you?\" Mick smirked.<br>\r\n\"Probably\"?\" She grinned.<br>\r\n\"....\" Mick replied.</span></div></div>",

If you say you're okay with this, we will pair you up under the conditions you will not be taking any of your own possessions with you.\" The man confirmed. <br>\r\n\"Can I see her first?\" Mick asked. The man nodded and gave him a picture. \"So, I'd be wearing her clothes, sleep in her room, go to her school, etc.\" Mick thought to himself. \"Let's do it.

She was also wearing a white blouse and a small jacket as well as some ankle boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Mick, I've been looking forward to meeting ya.\" She said with a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n\"And you must be... uhhm, the girl I partnered up with, sorry I never caught your name.\" Mick said a bit embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"No worries, the name is Callie.\" She said laughing.<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you Callie, where are you from if you don't mind me asking.\" Mick said, realizing it was a damn stupid question.<br>\r\n\"Well, you would find out at the end of the day anyway, but I'm from Texas.\" She said giggling.<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" Mick asked raising an eyebrow but with a smile.<br>\r\n\"You look exactly like I pictured and I think it's kind of funny how you didn't really bother to find out where I'm from to agree to be my partner.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"As soon as I saw your picture I knew it would be fine, it was all kind of last minute.\" Mick said apologizing.<br>\r\n\"It wasn't meant as an insult, I admire your bravery.\" She said as she walked up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we head back to my place and we can get to know each other?\" Mick suggestion.<br>\r\n\"If I didn't know about our situation, I would think you were trying to get into these shorts.\" Callie joked.<br>\r\n\"Well, technically, I am sort of.\" Mick said thinking about their inevitable swap.<br>\r\n\"Fair point, I'm sure they'll look great on you.\" Callie giggled as she and Mick made their way to Mick's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick and Callie spent most of their day getting to know each other. Callie talked about how her father can be strict at times but is really just a softball. She talked about how the loves the countryside and taking care of and playing with various animals, but she does express interest in seeing a different part of life.<br>\r\nMick shares that feeling talking about playing games and such, catting online and his daily routine. He mentions his family lives across the country but he does go back to them every so often and she might even get to chance to go in his place during the program. Callie talks about her family a bit more and says her mother is a very kind woman and would always help her if she asked politely and she has a bigger brother that loves to tease her at times, but she usually wins in any argument that leaves with him being embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie and Mick were having a great time talking about their lives and Mick suggested they should exchange numbers so they could stay in touch. Callie thought it was a good idea and they did exactly that. It was about time they headed back to the school anyway so both of them started making their way over there together. On the way there, they went ahead and swapped phones and login codes for them, so they had each other's contacts which could come in handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they arrived at the school, they were guided to a classroom which was fully blinded so they had their privacy. They both headed inside.<br>\r\n\"So I guess this is it huh, ya ready for this?\" Callie asked.<br>\r\n\"As ready as I'll ever be.\" Mick chuckled as she started to unzip his pants.<br>\r\n\"I think us trading places could be very interesting, I am kind of surprised ya agreed to be my partner though.\" Callie said as she undid her belt and pulled down her shorts.<br>\r\n\"How so?\" Mick asked back.<br>\r\n\"Because I didn't expect a guy to be comfortable switching clothes with me.\" Callie giggled.<br>\r\n\"I though it'd be interesting to swap with someone different, a different gender is just another layer to that difference.\" Mick said turning to take off his underwear.<br>\r\n\"Seeing you in my clothes is very interesting.\" Callie giggled as she gave her panties to Mick avoiding any peeking at private areas.<br>\r\n\"Seeing you in my place is going to be interesting too.\" Mick laughed back as he slid on the panties.<br>\r\n\"I do know this, I am going to really enjoy wearing your clothes.\" Callie giggled as she pulled on Mick's jeans.<br>\r\n\"You know, yours are actually, at least so far, pretty comfortable too.\" Mick said squeezing himself into her shorts. They were a bit snug but actually very comfortable on his butt and hips.<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear, this is my favorite outfit.\" Callie smiled as she throw her blouse and jacket towards Mick.<br>\r\n\"I'll be sure to keep that in mind.\" Mick said as he thew his shirt in return.<br>\r\n\"Oh, my bra is inside the blouse.\" Callie said as Mick looked through it.<br>\r\n\"Found it.\" He said pulling it on, somewhat successfully and then proceeded to put on the blouse and jacket, which were also a tad snug but actually kind of comfortable.<br>\r\nBoth of them finished off by putting on each other's shoes and looked over at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like really cute in my clothes.\" They both said at the same time.<br>\r\n\"Did you just call me cute?\" Mick asked with a cocky tone. <br>\r\n\"Ya.\" Callie replied.<br>\r\n\"You are really cute too, I think I made the right choice swapping with you.\" Mick smiled.<br>\r\n\"You fit my clothes almost too perfectly, maybe it was meant to be after all.\" Callie grinned as she moved in closer and then into a hug.<br>\r\n\"We'll stay in contact, you can message me for anything.\" Mick said smiling.<br>\r\n\"But first, something I can't do to ya once ya leave.\" Callie said planting her lips on Mick's.<br>\r\nBoth of them shared a kiss before exchanging keys and the last few items and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you are ready, Mick, time to meet your new home.\" The head teacher said and Mick gently nodded.</span></div></div>",

Next he pulled the tights over his legs, but due to his leg hair, it started to irritate his legs just a little bit. The skirt was tight as well and not exactly comfortable either, but Mick had already come this far so he decided to move on with it and pulled on the blouse, finishing off the outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl in the meantime had gotten dressed in his clothing and inspected herself.<br>\r\n\"You know, this may be a good break for me.\" The girl said, finding herself comfortable.<br>\r\n\"This is going to be touch for me.\" Mick sighed as he looked at himself.<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry you look cute.\" Isabella said as she left the room.

A lot of bands he really liked were performing there and the general feel of it was unlike anything he had experienced before. As he was standing in the crowd watching a performance from a somewhat lesser known band, but they were absolutely killing it. As they finished off their closing song, Mick made his way over to the bar to grab a drink and noticed a girl hanging out to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Britney. She had straight black hair falling to her shoulders and was very attractive. As he received his drink, the barman asked him of he could pass her the drink she ordered. Mick nodded and grabbed both drinks and made his way to her, it wasn't far, but just out of reach for the barman and due to the loud music, it was a bit difficult to call out to her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick got to her without too much issue and passed her the drink.<br>\r\n\"The barman asked me to give this to you.\" Mick smiled as he gave it to her.<br>\r\n\"Oh right thanks! I completely forgot I ordered it, I got completely lost in the music.\" Britney replied as she took a sip.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're absolutely killing it tonight.\" Mick agreed.<br>\r\n\"I've seen them a few times before and they're always really good.\" Britney replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mick took a spot leaning to wall next to her, he noticed her outfit. She was wearing a low cut black tank top with the band's logo in it, showing some of her midriff. She was also wearing a short leather skirt with a studded belt and black fishnets. On her feet were some black heeled boots and she had a few armbands on her wrists as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick himself was wearing some black comfortable jeans, a plain black shirt and some boots, which honestly weren't too noteworthy, but it was comfortable so he didn't really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney and Mick started talking a little during the end of the concert and got to know some of the smaller things about each other, like name, some of their likes and dislikes etc. Although it didn't take too long before the performance was over.<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea what's up next?.\" Mick asked as Britney checked the schedule.<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's calmed down a little bit, no big names for about 1 and a half hours.\" Britney said.<br>\r\n\"Would you like to get a bit to eat?\" Mick suggested.<br>\r\n\"You've known me for what, 15 minutes and you are already asking me to dinner?\" Britney teased.<br>\r\n\"That sounds about right.\" Mick nodded confidently.<br>\r\n\"Your treat?\" Britney smirked.<br>\r\n\"Let's just share.\" Mick suggested and Britney nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of them grabbed a bite to eat at one of the local vendors and were starting to really enjoy each other's company. They talked a bit about their studies, about their ambitions, favorite foods, all kinds of conversations. It didn't take long however for the sun to start setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It did cool down a lot.\" Britney said, sounding slightly irritated.<br>\r\n\"With what you're wearing, I can only imagine.\" Mick replied.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I bet you're a lot warmer right now.\" Britney said pulling down her skirt a little bit.<br>\r\n\"...\" Mick replied.</span></div></div>",

Mick was about to grab her top but the waved her finger and unhooked her bra, passing that to him first.<br>\r\n\"I saw that coming, I assume panties will be included too?\" Mick asked. Britney nodded as she helped him put on the bra and then grabbed his t-shirt from him and pulled it over her head. Mick, after adjusting the bra, grabbed the tank top and suddenly his midriff was very exposed, which was very weird to deal with. The top was quite tight, but it was close enough in size to fit decently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now the fun part.\" Britney grinned softly as she undid her studded belt and shoes, pulled down her skirt and fishnets and happily handed them all over to Mick. Mick quietly removed his shoes, jeans and boxers and passed them along.<br>\r\n\"You're enjoying this.\" Britney giggled.<br>\r\n\"Says who?\" Mick said trying to hide it.<br>\r\n\"Your stiff cock.\" Britney said licking her lips.<br>\r\n\"Okay, maybe a little.\" Mick replied blushing as he grabbed the panties and stepped into them. They were a bit tight on the before mentioned cock and hips but was not as uncomfortable as he expected. He then proceeded to pull on the fishnets which were very much less than ideal due to his leg hair, but they were ultimately not too uncomfortable, just a bit itchy, but he strangely liked the remaining feelings from it touching his legs. Britney in the meantime had slid on his comfortable boxers and really enjoyed they fit a lot. She grinned madly as she grabbed Mick's jeans and pulled them on. They were not quite as tight as she was used to, but she liked the fit, it wasn't too loose but very comfortable. Mick then proceeded to pull on the skirt, which was, interesting. The skirt was quite short and tight but he managed to pull them on, closing up the studded belt and moving everything into place as the cold breeze didn't fade from his legs and still managed to blow underneath the skirt to his family jewels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both finished off with each other's shoes, which was probably the most uncomfortable part for Mick due to Britney's feet being a bit smaller, but he actually liked the boots themselves, even though they were a tad tight. Britney did alright with Mick's, though she had to tie them slightly tighter than he needed to and lastly, gave her bracelets to Mick which he then put on as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look really cute in my outfit.\" Britney blushed as she looked over Mick.<br>\r\n\"At least it's not as uncomfortable as I expected, but I get the complaints about the breeze now.\" Mick said blushing.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my life.\" Britney grinned as she gave Mick a kiss on the lips. \"You earned that stud.\" She winked.<br>\r\n\"I am 100% positive going out there will kill me out of embarrassment.\" Mick said pulling on the skirt.<br>\r\n\"Most will be too drunk to care.\" Britney giggled as she opened the door and dragged Mick out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right for the most part, most people didn't seem to care, got a few looks from people but they managed to mostly blend in as they headed to another crowd and nobody seemed to have any more interest in them once they entered the crowd completely again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Mick and Britney vibe to the music, they both are getting used to each other's clothes a bit more. Britney didn't need much time for this however, as wearing boy's clothes, while not something she had done before, wasn't entirely strange to her. She liked it and she liked this boy too, trading outfits with him definitely helped with her opinion on him however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick on the other hand needed a little bit of time to get used to it. Britney skirt and fishnets were unlike anything he had ever worn before and were quite tight. His new boots took some getting used to walking on, almost tripping him over several times. A few gusts of wind occasionally blew past him and due to his exposed skin he understood Britney's feelings of cold now. He did like the feeling of Britney's sweaty clothes however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick and Britney spend some time talking over the course of the next few songs and seemed to really start to hit of off quite nicely. As the night progressed they progressively got more comfortable, eventually Mick got used to wearing a skirt and Britney was happy she wasn't freezing anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the evening started to reach it's end, most people were departing and Mick and Britney started to make their way to the exit as well.<br>\r\n\"I hope we can meet again sometime soon, this was fun.\" Mick said.<br>\r\n\"Even though you're wearing my clothes?\" Britney teased.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was different at least.\" Mick blushed.<br>\r\n\"It doesn't have to end right now, if you want, you can come over to my place, my bed is big enough for both of us.\" Britney suggested as she planted her lips on Mick's.<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a lot of fun.\" Mick nodded and accepted her invitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe festival took place over the course of a few days so Mick had some spare stuff with him like clean underwear. He didn't have to worry about packing a tent or anything luckily and neither did Britney, bit for Britney that was mostly because she lived quite near while Mick would have needed to travel a few good hours at least, which would be more hassle than he was comfortable with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think my roommates will be asleep by now, so let's try and not be too loud.\" Britney said as they approached her place.<br>\r\n\"Sounds fine.\" Mick nodded as they made their way inside. The pair of them went into Britney's room, dropped their stuff and undressed each other.<br>\r\n\"It's weird taking my skirt off of someone else, I was just liking you wearing them too.\" Britney said with a bit of a pout.<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't you rather see me naked?\" Mick teased her back.<br>\r\n\"The only thing that's better.\" Britney grinned back as they threw their clothes to the side and cuddled up inside Britney's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take long for their cuddle to become them touching each other in very sensitive places, eventually resulting in Mick's erect cock sliding inside of Britney's snatch. Both of them were admittedly a little drunk, had a lot of fun and were very much into each other. Their solution against any moaning was also very simple, making out as much as possible while they made love so their mouth's weren't free to do so as Mick eventually climaxed. Both lay their exhausted in bed, Britney rested her head against Mick's chest as they both drifted into sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

As he searched for his clothes he realized they weren't there, but he did see Britney's outfit laying off to the side.<br>\r\n\"Looks like she's wearing mine again, may as well wear hers.\" Mick thought to himself, not minding the chance to slip into her clothes and saw she had already laid a clean pair of panties and bra ready for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need a bra, so I think I will skip out on that one.\" Mick thought to himself, but he did grab the black panties and slid them on. They were similar to the ones he wore yesterday, just clean and while they were just as tight, he didn't mind too much. He once gain pulled on the fishnets and stepped into the leather skirt and fastened the studded belt around it. He pulled the tight top over his head and headed outside of the bedroom to see what all the commotion was about. As Mick stepped out he saw Britney wearing his clothes and her two female roommates. They were arguing about something he couldn't really follow, so it probably wasn't related to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl who was looking to be the one singled out in this argument against the other two was called Nikki. Nikki was a rebellious girl with a chaotic personality who's into punk music. She has little patience for authority figures and \"normal\" people and she enjoys taking them down a peg when she can. She generally only associates with people she thinks are cool enough. Nikki has a very punky fashion sense and was currently wearing a black tank top with some band logo in it he didn't recognize and was also wearing some dark colored ripped jeans, a denim sleeveless jacket and some black combat boots. She has a decent figure but doesn't care much about showing it off. She has straight brown hair but she's always dying it different colors and trying different hairstyles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other roommate was called Kim, a fun-loving, laid back girl who's into rock music. She generally doesn't care what people think and just wants to do her own thing and live her life. She can be a bit of a flake sometimes, but will be there for her friends when she's needed. She's cute with a slender build and she has wavy shoulder length blonde hair. She was currently wearing some tight light blue denim shorts and a tight white t-shirt. She was also wearing some comfortable sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was yelling at Britney calling her a dumb bitch while Kim was mostly trying to keep herself out of the line of fire, while still siding with Britney. As they noticed Mick entered the room, Nikki ignored him completely, but he noticed Kim was checking him out. Mick tried to ignore their argument but Nikki quickly saw an opportunity in him being there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mick was it right?\" Nikki suddenly asks him directly with a not so friendly tone.<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Mick responded being caught off guard.<br>\r\n\"Since you and Britney seem to enjoy each other so much, want to trade rooms?\" Nikki suggests, calming down slightly.<br>\r\n\"Trade rooms?\" Mick asked being intrigued.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you can spend time with these idiots and I can enjoy some time in peace.\" Nikki explains.<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't mind, but I am not sure if the girls are okay with it?\" Mick said looking at Kim and Britney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim and Britney grin at each other for a moment and wink at Mick. \"So, what about your stuff?\"<br>\r\n\"I kind of don't want to have to drag all my stuff over.\" Nikki said annoyed at just the thought of it.<br>\r\n\"I'll use yours, you use mine, it's fine.\" Mick said, not bothering to make a big deal out of it.<br>\r\n\"I was hoping for that, but then I do want to take your clothes with me too.\" Nikki said with a smug grin.<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" Britney said annoyed, because she knew she was referring to the ones she was wearing.<br>\r\n\"Just let her take them, it will be worth it to get her out of here.\" Kim said and Mick nodded.<br>\r\n\"Fine, let me grab a towel.\" Britney said as she grabbed a towel, quickly went into her room and stripped naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a moment later, Britney walked out of her room with a towel wrapped around her and Mick's clothes folded in her hands.<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\" Britney said annoyed as Nikki snatched the bundle out of her hands and disappeared into her room.<br>\r\nIt did not take long for Nikki to come back out. She had gotten dressed in Mick's clothes and she was kind of happy with it. She found Mick's boxers to be a tad loose, but very comfortable. The same could be said about his jeans and shirt and even his shoes. It wasn't exactly her style but she didn't mind them, especially not if it meant she could have some peace alone. She walked up to Britney, pushed the outfit she was wearing earlier into Britney's hands and grabbed Mick's stuff from Britney's room. Mick and Nikki traded keys etc. and Nikki got ready to leave.<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your new roommates.\" Nikki said to Mick feeling incredibly happy with herself and left with Mick's stuff towards his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Nikki had left the building...</span></div></div>",

Kim was now wearing Nikki's black tank top and dark colored ripped jeans, her sleeveless jacket, combat boots and even her underwear. It looked surprisingly cute on her, even though it was a bit different from what she was wearing earlier. Kim gave her roommates a spin showing off her new attire before passing the bundle of her clothes to Britney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A deal is a deal.\" Kim smiled.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Kim, time to see how I look in yours.\" Britney smiled as she entered her room and shut the door.<br>\r\n\"So, Mick, how did you and Britney meet anyway?\" Kim asked as she took a seat next to him.<br>\r\n\"We met at the festival. The barman asked me to bring her her drink and we kept talking.\" Mick explained.<br>\r\n\"And how exactly did you end up in her clothes? Too much to drink?\" Kim asked with a sly grin.<br>\r\n\"No not exactly. She complained it was getting cold, I joked about letting her borrow my clothes so she wouldn't be but she took it as an actual offer.\" Mick laughed.<br>\r\n\"And you still accepted?\" Kim laughed back.<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, it doesn't hurt to be adventurous.\" Mick explained.<br>\r\n\"Oh I see, Britney is lucky to have met you then.\" Kim giggled.<br>\r\n\"I think I am the lucky one.\" Mick smiled back as he heard the door to Britney's room open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fast.\" Kim said as she saw Britney walk out wearing her outfit. Britney was wearing Kim's tight white t-shirt and it fit her chest quite nicely, even though the fit was slightly different. Kim's blue shorts showed off a lot of her nice legs and her hips were nicely accentuated by it. She now had her sneakers on her feet as well and while she looked different from her usual style as well, it suited her nicely.<br>\r\n\"I told you you'd look cute.\" Mick smiled as Britney took a seat once more.<br>\r\n\"He is right you know.\" Kim chipped in, causing Britney to blush at the compliments.<br>\r\n\"Glad you think so.\" She replied with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we make some lunch?\" Kim suggested.<br>\r\n\"Need any help?\" Mick asked as she got up.<br>\r\n\"Nah it's fine.\" Kim replied.<br>\r\n\"Want it anyway?\" Mick asked as she walked off to the fridge.<br>\r\n\"Since you asked so nicely.\" Kim said as she motioned for him to come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim and Mick spent the next ten minutes preparing some lunch for the three of them. Nothing too fancy but enough to enjoy a nice meal together. They quickly started to dig in as they served the plates on the large table and continued to chat about various things. They all seemed to get along quite nicely, everyone sharing plenty of interests but having some healthy differences of opinion as well. They each finished their food, cleaned the plates and took place next to each other on the couch relaxing a bit after the discussion they had with Nikki earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later...</span></div></div>",

Then we can have threesomes maybe every two days?\" Kim suggested.<br>\r\n\"That sounds like it would be a good idea. But wouldn't it be easier to just go on dates with all three of us?\" Mick asked a little skeptical.<br>\r\n\"Ya, but this is more fun.\" Kim giggled.<br>\r\n\"Yeah fine.\" Mick smiled accepting the offer. Britney nodded as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that's settled, tonight we have some fun with all three of us and then we will rotate places.\" Kim replied with a smile.<br>\r\n\"That may take a little practice at first.\" Mick blushes.<br>\r\n\"It'll be fine, just remember you have double the stuff to play with.\" Kim grinned.<br>\r\n\"Until then, you're still all mine.\" Britney grinned as she kissed Mick on the cheek.<br>\r\n\"Just save some for tonight lovebirds.\" Kim teased.<br>\r\n\"When will we do that tonight actually?\" Mick asked.<br>\r\n\"Before dinner?\" Kim suggested.<br>\r\n\"That sounds good.\" Britney agreed and Mick nodded as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we using the room of who's clothes we're wearing?\" Kim asks.<br>\r\n\"I think that would be good ya.\" Britney replied.<br>\r\n\"Alright, time to check out Nikki's room.\" Kim grinned.<br>\r\n\"I'll take yours until tonight then.\" Britney replied.<br>\r\n\"Sure, it's all yours.\" Kim said as she disappeared in Nikki's room.<br>\r\n\"Want to play some games?\" Britney asked as she looked at Mick.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Mick asked as they went into Kim's room and started to play some games together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mick and Britney were playing some games they shared a few kisses and other intimate moments. At one point Britney slipped her hand underneath the leather skirt and cupped Mick's balls to distract him. Mick did the same by slipping his hands inside the denim shorts and sliding his finger inside her slit. This continued on for about an hour before they decided to actually get serious and challenge each other, resulting in some shouting at each other, followed by a violent kiss and then they continued on, rinse and repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours later, as they were finishing off their last match Mick looked over at the clock.<br>\r\n\"I think it is going to be time to meet up with Kim soon.\" Mick said a bit nervously.<br>\r\n\"Nervous?\" Britney asked.<br>\r\n\"A little.\" Mick replied.<br>\r\n\"Just remember to share the love a little and never focus on only one of us, you'll be fine babe.\" Britney said giving hem an encouraging kiss.<br>\r\n\"I never thought I'd be here yesterday that's for sure.\" Mick replied.<br>\r\n\"But you are and both me and Kim are very happy you are.\" Britney smiled.<br>\r\n\"Let's go get her then.\" Mick said they got up and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim was already waiting for them laying on the couch.<br>\r\n\"There you are.\" Kim said excited.<br>\r\n\"Sorry we got a bit carried away playing games.\" Mick explained.<br>\r\n\"No worries you are both precisely on time.\" Kim grinned.<br>\r\n\"So, where are we doing this?\" Mick asked nervously.<br>\r\n\"My room should be fine.\" Britney suggested.<br>\r\n\"You mean MY room?\" Mick teased back.<br>\r\n\"Will be mine soon.\" Kim added as they headed into what was originally Britney's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the room, Kim quickly took off her boots, unzipped her ripped jeans and took off her top and threw them to the side. She then took off her underwear, threw it on top of the pile and lay on top of the bed completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney also got undressed taking off the sneakers and tight denim shorts. Took off the tight t-shirt and her underwear, threw all of it on a separate pile and joined Kim on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick lastly also got undressed, undoing the belt and pulling off the boots and leather skirt. He also took off the fishnets, top, underwear, everything. Stripped down naked, threw it in yet another separate pile and got on top of the naked girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick was a bit nervous but Kim quickly helped with that as she planted her lips on top of his. She darted her tongue in his mouth and guided him into an amazing kiss. While making out with Kim, Mick slid his rock hard cock into Britney's snatch. As Mick was thrusting his cock inside of her snatch, Kim broke off the kiss and made out with Britney while Mick used one of his hands to slid a pair of fingers into Kim's pussy. Mick moved his hands across Kim's thigh and transferred his cock from Britney's snatch to Kim's. Britney then moved into position near Mick as he slid his tongue across the rim of Britney's pussy. Kim moved closer to him to share a kiss and then proceeded to pleasure Britney's moist cunt with her tongue instead which Caused Mick to move and make out with Britney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio continued to share the love between them, everyone always making sure all of them were being pleasured at all times. Mick ended up climaxing inside of Kim's mouth as she was sucking him off at the time. Each of them laid on bed exhausted for a few minutes before finally breaking the silence.<br>\r\n\"That felt amazing.\" Mick said in pure ecstasy.<br>\r\n\"I regret nothing.\" Kim giggled.<br>\r\n\"Both of you touched me in so many different ways, that was a sensory overload.\" Britney said gathering her thoughts.<br>\r\n\"A three-way relationship may be the best idea you have ever had Kim.\" Mick said.<br>\r\n\"I have good ideas.\" Kim said back feeling proud of herself.<br>\r\n\"But this one was a really good one.\" Britney chimed in.<br>\r\n\"You guys are making me blush.\" Kim replied.<br>\r\n\"Only now?\" Mick joked back.<br>\r\n\"Nah, but still, you do.\" Kim said back as she sat down straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who's clothes am I getting?\" Mick asked as he got up as well.<br>\r\n\"Mine, I get Brit's, Brit gets Nikki's.\" Kim explained.<br>\r\n\"Works for me.\" Britney said as she grabbed the pile of Nikki's clothes and got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney stepped into Nikki's black panties and bra combo. Nikki was fairly close to her size so it wasn't really any issue. She slid on the dark colored ripped jeans which fit snugly on her legs and hips and pulled on her black tank top and put on the sleeveless denim jacket which tightly wrapped around her torso. Lastly she put on the combat boots which were a tad too small for her but she made it work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim grabbed Britney's panties, but since Mick didn't put on the bra this morning, she didn't have that one here either, it was somewhere discarded on the floor but she didn't care to look for it as she pulled the panties on her hips, which fit looser than her own clothes but they fit fine. She pulled on the fishnets covering her legs nicely and proceeded to pull up the leather skirt and wrapped the belt around her hips. Finishing up, she pulled on the tank top, exposing her midriff and pulled on Britney's boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick in the meantime got dressed in Kim's clothes, which were a little smaller than Britney's so it wasn't the easiest thing ever. The pink panties and bra were not too bad, a tad snug on his hips and very tight on his chest, but he could deal with it. With the light blue denim shorts however, he was lucky his cock was still flacid due to the threesome, or he woul've had a lot of issues here. Pulling up the shorts wasn't that bad, fairly tight but he liked that, however his waist was a tad tight to button them up but after making sure he got it as much space as possible, he managed to close the button and zipper, but his cock was imprisoned in the super tight denim shorts now. Kim's shirt was again very tight but not uncomfortable at all, same with the shorts. Mick started to prefer the feel of the girl's clothes and he liked the tightness it gave him. The sneakers were too small for him to properly wear so he skipped on those for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look really cute.\" Kim said to Mick.<br>\r\n\"They are really tight.\" Mick said straightening out the outfit.<br>\r\n\"You fit.\" Kim replied back with a grin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As her voice echoed through the garage, Sarah was thoroughly enjoying herself during band practice today. She sang her heart out because it was a very special day, it was the one year anniversary for her and her boyfriend, exactly one year ago they first kissed and decided to give it a try together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah was looking at her boyfriend playing the guitar next to her, practice was coming to an end.<br>\r\n\"You did really well today Sarah.\" Jake said.<br>\r\nJake was their drummer and a smart guy, he had an average build and stood at about 6''0'. He had short black hair and was definitely the most responsible of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she did well, she always does.\" Jessica said.<br>\r\nJessica was their bassist, she was a confident girl standing at about 5''8' and had short brown hair. She was a bit tomboyish and usually dressed like it, but Sarah never really understood the charm of it and dismissed her style choices quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so do we mind you.\" Rob eventually said chipping in.<br>\r\nRob was Sarah's boyfriend, he's always been a fairly athletic guy at 6'2'', which is why Sarah was attracted to him in the first place. He's not one for stepping out of his comfort zone however, but due to Sarah's personality he is often forced to do so, much to his discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, anyway I have to go, mom will kill me if I'm late.\" Jake said as he packed up his stuff.<br>\r\n\"Same here.\" Jessica said as she did the same.<br>\r\n\"Mind if I stay for dinner?\" Rob asked his girlfriend, hoping to spend some time alone together.<br>\r\n\"My parents aren't home today, so yeah sure.\" Sarah said as she gave her boyfriend a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessica and Jake left, Rob and Sarah quickly went inside discussing on what to eat, but couldn't easily reach a decision.<br>\r\n\"How about this, I kind of need a shower anyway, if you wouldn't mind me asking, can I use the shower while I think on it a little longer?\" Rob suggested.<br>\r\n\"Sure babe.\" Sarah said as she looked over her boyfriend and she couldn't take her eyes off him.<br>\r\nHe was wearing a pair of ripped jeans and a tight fitting t-shirt showing off his strong arms. His rather large feet were also covered in some worn out sneakers as he moved in to give his girl another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was currently wearing some leather pants tightly hugging her feminine hips, she had on a nice white crop top showing off a lot of her thin waist as well as a leather jacket draped over her. Her feminine feet were dressed in some brown ankle high boots. This was an outfit Rob always liked on her, made her look really sexy, especially when singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back.\" Rob winked as he made his way over to the shower.<br>\r\n\"You can leave your clothes in my room if you want\" Sarah said as Rob nodded.<br>\r\nAt first Sarah decided to just wait for Rob while texting with Jessica and at first it seemed to be enjoyable enough, Jessica was fun to talk to.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Jessica had to go eat and couldn't respond immediately anymore and out of boredom, Sarah decided to check out her profile pictures, just so she could compare herself to her as she often does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter criticizing some of them inside her head, she started to pay attention to her clothes in these pictures. Like expected she dressed like a tomboy in all of them, but it couldn't be that much better could it? A girl should dress to look good, if she didn't how else would she get noticed?<br>\r\nSarah kept thinking these thoughts until she eventually went upstairs to her room and saw Rob's clothes laying on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it won't hurt just to see...\" She nervously thought as she looked at the clothes of her boyfriend on her bed,<br>\r\nIt took some thought, but eventually Sarah took off her.... and put on Rob's.</span></div></div>",

She unbuttoned and unzipped her leather jeans and pulled them off, laying them on her bed. She wiggled her butt out of the black thong panties she was wearing and quickly hid them with Rob's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah then grabbed her boyfriend's boxers and slid them over her shapely ass. They were quite wide on her, but really comfortable as she reveled in the feeling. After admiring her new underwear, she quickly grabbed her leather pants and squeezed herself into them once more. Due to the larger underwear she was wearing, the pants weren't as smooth as they were supposed to be, but because they were a little stretchy they still fit just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was about to walk off, happy with her new underwear, but she decided she'd have to leave Rob with her full underwear instead of just the thong. She skillfully managed to unhook the bra underneath her crop top and managed to slip it from under it. Sarah hid the bra alongside the thong and decided this was enough for now. She decided to grab a drink while waiting for Rob to come out of the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some relaxing minutes of cleaning himself, Rob came out of the shower feeling very calm, but this was about to end as he started to search for his underwear. He searched through the pile of his clothes, but only found a black thong and matching bra, much to his horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah! Did you take my underwear?\" Rob yelled downstairs, not getting an answer. She heard him, but was too busy giggling.<br>\r\n\"Dang it Sarah.\" Rob said to himself as he grabbed the tiny thong belonging to his girlfriend and stepped into them, feeling tighter and tighter the more he pulled them up. They barely covered his privates at all so it wasn't exactly a good fit, but regardless, he dealt with it and pulled up his ripped jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob was putting on his shirt as he saw the bra being uncovered in the pile. He looked down at his chest, but he didn't see any reason to put it on so he simply finished putting on his shirt, grabbed the bra and went downstairs to confront Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you forgot something.\" Rob said annoyed as Sarah grinned at him madly.<br>\r\n\"You were supposed to put that on, let me help you.\" Sarah said as she tried to forcibly put it on her boyfriend, but she was much weaker, so it didn't really work.<br>\r\n\"I'm already wearing your damn thong, there is no way I'm wearing your bra too.\" Rob said sternly.<br>\r\n\"Oh poo, you're no fun.\" Sarah pouted.<br>\r\nRob looked over his girlfriend, he though she was the cutest thing ever, especially when she was mad.<br>\r\n\"If it will get you to stop being mad, fine, help me put this thing on.\" Rob said reluctantly handing Sarah the bra.<br>\r\n\"Pay attention, I'll only show you once, you can take it off well enough, so you should be able to do this.\" Sarah grinned as she helped Rob put on the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is uncomfortable.\" Rob said as he felt his privates rub against his girlfriend's soft panties.<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you are talking about.\" Sarah giggled as she shook her ass.<br>\r\n\"Your ass doesn't look as good like that.\" Rob said, as if a bit disappointed.<br>\r\n\"Well, your boxers don't look that good with my pants.\" Sarah admitted.<br>\r\n\"Then how about you give them back?\" Rob said a bit annoyed.<br>\r\n\"We can also swap pants.\" Sarah said giggling.<br>\r\n\"No way, they won't even fit.\" Rob said taken aback.<br>\r\n\"They stretch a little.\" Sarah said eagerly.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a little, but not enough.\" Rob complained as Sarah just eyed up his pants.<br>\r\n\"Aren't you curious how they feel? I know I am about yours, don't worry, I want to look good so I won't keep them long.\" Sarah said trying to convince her boyfriend.</span></div></div>",

Sarah had no difficulty putting on Rob's jeans, but they were big on her. Thanks to his belt, Sarah manged to tighten it enough so they wouldn't fall off, but her slender legs were completely hidden by the larger pipes of Rob's jeans. She giggled as she looked over herself and her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob on the other hand, wasn't having much fun with this, Sarah's leather pants were extremely tight on him and he had a lot of difficulty putting them on. His muscular legs took some effort as they were being squeezed into the leather pants, but eventually Sarah started to help him put them on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of struggling, Rob was now dressed in Sarah's tight leather pants, which were way too short for him. The pants only covered from just below his butt to his ankles, as he couldn't pull them up any further. The zipper was still open and his thong panties and even his privates were clearly visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you they don't fit.\" Rob said with a condescending tone.<br>\r\n\"I knew that, but I still wanted to see you wear them.\" Sarah said with a grin.<br>\r\n\"Happy now? I want my pants back.\" Rob complained as his legs were being squeezed to death.</span></div></div>",

She made sure to have everything ready, money, ID, keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called her friend Jessica, explaining everything and asked her if she wanted to go to the karaoke bar. She said she wanted to drink and sing away her sorrows, which Jessica understood and accepted in order to help out her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they arrived at the karaoke bar, the pair of girls ordered some cocktails and started thinking of some songs to sing. Sarah had a killer voice and wanted to let everyone know that, but she had a tough time figuring out a song to amaze everyone with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they both had a few (too many) drinks, Sarah realized the perfect song to sing, she quickly requested it and once it was her turn to sing, she shined. Even when she was getting drunk, Sarah could sing and basically memorized all the guys in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter singing her heart out, Sarah took a bow and giggled awkwardly as she wasn't used to standing on stage solo. She quickly returned to her friend at the bar, only to see she wasn't alone anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her was sitting an average looking guy and quite short for his age. He was skinny but still had some muscle, had dark blond hair and prefers to spend his days playing games and listening to music. He's a college student and was quite smart, but lazy, easily agitated and often made sarcastic comments. He had no girlfriend or sisters and he has moved to a student apartment across country from his parents. His name was Mick (from the other character options.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sarah, you were great!\" Jessica said as she high-fived her friend.<br>\r\n\"Yeah you were great, you have a great voice.\" Mick said with a genuine smile.<br>\r\n\"Thanks you guys.\" Sarah said blushing as she looked over at Mick.<br>\r\n\"I don't think we have met before have we?\" She asked him.<br>\r\n\"No we haven't, I'm Mick, nice to meet you.\" She said back.<br>\r\n\"I don't believe I have ever seen you here.\" Sarah continued questioning him.<br>\r\n\"First time, but it was amazing to see you there, now I don't think I would dare to go myself.\" Mick chuckled as Sarah giggled at the compliment.<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back.\" Jessica said as she winked at Sarah.<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah sure.\" She replied as Jessica left Sarah and Mick alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when are you going to sing? Sarah teased as Mick just shrug his shoulders.<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, everyone is drunk anyway.\" Sarah giggled as Mick smiled back.</span></div></div>",

If you don't mind me asking.\" Mick asked carefully.<br>\r\n\"He didn't want to swap pants with me.\" Sarah said smug as she wiggled her butt, showing off the leather pants.<br>\r\n\"That is just stupid, I would swap pants for you any day.\" Mick grinned confidently, not thinking about what he was saying.<br>\r\nSarah just grinned back as she started to unbutton and unzip her leather pants, slowly peeling them off.<br>\r\n\"Come and get them.\" Sarah giggled as she waved her pants in front of her.</span></div></div>",

He quickly undid the belt, unbuttoned his jeans and took them off without much difficulty. Just like Sarah, he held them up as he stared into her eyes. He could see how much she wanted this, so his decision to swap pants with her was an easy one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mick walked towards Sarah to take her pants, she giggled as she shook her head.<br>\r\n\"Not done yet.\" She winked as she pointed to her thong and then Mick's boxers.<br>\r\nMick just nodded as he motioned Sarah to get under their table, the cloth would cover them enough to not be flashing everyone here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath the table, Sarah quickly, but uncomfortably, took off her black lace thong as she held them along with her tight leather pants. Mick took off his boxers as well, without too much difficulty and quickly held them out for Sarah to take. It didn't last long as Sarah immediately grabbed them and shoved her thong into Mick's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah had no difficulty putting on Mick's boxers, which fit her more comfortably than Rob's did, as Mick was much closer to her size as well. Mick then pulled the thong over his legs and started to pull them up, but this didn't go without effort. The thong was tight and barely covered his privates, but he did manage to squeeze into them sort of properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah reached over to grab Mick's jeans as she caught a glimpse of his package poorly covered by her thong. She giggled continuously as she started to pull on Mick's jeans, were were a surprisingly good fit. She still needed the belt in order to wear them properly on her waist, but then again, so did Mick so it wasn't all that surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick on the other hand, had a little bit of difficulty squeezing into Sarah's leather pants, they were incredibly tight, but he did manage to pull them up almost fully in the awkward position he was in while under the table, but eventually Mick gave up on trying to do it like this and got out from under it, with Sarah quickly following his lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick continued to struggled a little bit as he pulled Sarah's pants up for the final bit and thanks to her help, he managed to squeeze his entire legs and ass into them. He zipped and buttoned the pants up and started feeling the smooth, sweaty, warm leather of Sarah's pants. His waist felt like it was being squeezed the most, but due to his already thin waist, compared to most other guys, it wasn't that bad for him, he even kind of like the tightness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter helping Mick with her pants, Sarah admired herself wearing his, they fit rather well and weren't as tight, she kind of enjoyed the feeling, though mostly because she was drunk. Sarah moved around a bit in her new jeans and decided to keep them on for now, or at least try to convince Mick to let her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Mick would not need much convincing. The tight leather pants were still warm and a bit sweaty due to Sarah, but Mick wasn't really disgusted by this, quite the opposite in fact, he loved wearing Sarah's warm, sweaty leather pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ex boyfriend lost his chance of a lifetime, your pants are amazing!\" Mick said to Sarah as he got used to walking with the much tighter pants. <br>\r\n\"He was an idiot, I'm glad I broke up with him, at least I found someone who's willing to do the things I want as well.\" Sarah said as she hugged Mick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the other people there were now whistling at the pair, their pants and underwear swap had attracted a lot of attention, but due them both being drunk, neither of them really minded it and continued to hug for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was really enjoying the swap, she was now wearing some guy's jeans she just met and he was wearing hers. Getting drunk allowed her to quickly forget about Rob, but she didn't expect to be throwing herself at another guy like this. She was about to tell Mick she felt a bit wrong about it all, but then she looked at him and the only thing going through her head was; \"He looks so sexy in my pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the alcohol was influencing both Sarah and Mick's actions...</span></div></div>",

She smiled madly as she guided Mick's arms and chest into her black lace bra and expertly put it on him. Before Mick really realized what was going on, he was already wearing Sarah's bra as the whistling continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mick was realizing he was now wearing Sarah's bra and felt up the fabric, Sarah took his t-shirt from his hand and pushed her own crop top in it's place. She then went ahead and was already pulling on Mick's black tee, which loosely covered her feminine chest as her breasts were now freely moving around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Mick was done admiring the bra, he looked at the small crop top Sarah pushed into his hands and pulled it over his head. The crop top was very tight and really short, it only reached Mick's midriff showing off his rather small, but hairy waist. Feeling a bit self-conscience about it, he pulled on the crop top and tried to pull up the leather pants a bit further, but to no avail as they were both simply too tight to cover any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, he eventually gave up on trying to cover himself more and grabbed the tight leather jacket Sarah laid down on the table and put it on. Mick's arms were squeezed into the small sleeves of the jacket, but like the pants, they felt warm and sweaty, which was starting to turn him on as the left the jacket open for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mick turned to look at Sarah, she was putting on his leather jacket as well, which was a lot looser than Sarah's was. she seemed to be enjoying herself as she had now almost completely swapped with Mick, the only thing missing was their shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she realized this, she grinned at Mick as she took off her ankle boots and socks and quickly set them in front of Mick. Mick nodded as he took off his shoes and socks as well, passed them to Sarah and she immediately put them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah felt Mick's shoes were a tad large, but not as oversized as she expected, he had kind of small feet, but this was in her advantage for now as she comfortably walked around in Mick's worn sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick however was not feeling as happy with this swap as he had some difficulty walking in Sarah's brown ankle high boots. They were slightly too small for him and hurt a bit to wear, but he complied and kept them on for as long as Sarah wanted, the pain wasn't very apparent to him due to the alcohol either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so cute dressed like me.\" Sarah then said to Mick as she put her arm around him.<br>\r\n\"I feel so exposed.\" Mick admitted as he pulled on the crop top.<br>\r\n\"You look sexy, my clothes suit you.\" She winked back as felt up his tightly squeezed ass inside her former pants.<br>\r\n\"Stop that or I'll rip out of these pants.\" Mick blushed as he was getting extremely turned on by Sarah, both because of her drunk behavior and their clothes swap.<br>\r\nSarah just giggled at the comment and started taking some selfies with him in their clothes swapped state.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The clothes swapped pair had attracted a lot of attention, but not in a bad way. A lot of people were whistling at them, but almost no one was disturbed or anything. In fact, due to Sarah and Mick having the courage to do so, some other people started to swap clothes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table next to Mick and Sarah were the first to start doing this. The table consisted of a couple who were very obviously in love, they had been swapping spit all night and were about to do something more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy was wearing some black jeans, a white-shirt and a blue hoodie. He was also wearing some blue sneakers and looked to be about 5'8''. He had short brown hair and was wearing glasses as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis girlfriend however was quite short, but she was quite cute, though a bit nerdy. She had long black hair and looked to be of Asian origin standing at about 5'2''. Her outfit consisted of a pleated skirt with a white shirt and beige cardigan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, both seemed to be a bit awkward about it, but after a moment, they started to exchange clothes, just like Sarah and Mick did. The girl took off her skirt and even panties and quickly pushed them into her boyfriend's hands. Her boyfriend, struggled a bit with his jeans and boxers, but quickly gave them to her once he managed to get the pant legs over his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl proceeded to pull on her boyfriend's boxers and jeans, but both were quite wide for her, so she had to keep pulling them up until she managed to tighter the belt. The boyfriend on the other hand found his girlfriend's panties and skirt VERY restrictive. The skirt, one pulled up, only barely covered his butt causing his new panties to be seen by pretty much everyone. The panties felt very moist, turning him on, making everything only tighter and tighter as he proceeded to remove his hoodie and shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girlfriend followed his lead and took off her shirt and cardigan, but like Sarah, also took off her bra. She attempted to put the bra on her boyfriend, but his chest was just a bit to big to properly close it, so she did the best she could to make it stay, which resulted in it awkwardly hanging there. She then helped her boyfriend put on her tight shirt and cardigan, which only covered part of his arms due to them being too small and his waist was very visible because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy then quickly put on his girlfriend's tiny sneakers, but his entire heel was hanging out as they were simply too small, while the girl found her boyfriend's clothes way too big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl finished off by putting on the shirt and hoodie, which comfortably fit around her, but were kind of sticky due to his sweat, which grossed her out slightly. She lightened up a lot when seeing her boyfriend dressed in her way too tiny outfit, she giggled took some pictures and kissed him on the lips as the looked at the others swapping clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the other side of the bar, two very attractive looking young woman were trying to convince a pair of decently good looking men to swap clothes and due to their charm, they succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman were wearing matching dresses, however one of them was wearing a red version and the other was wearing a blue version. The dresses were quite long and reached to the bottom of their legs, but were only draped over one shoulder, so they showed some of their upper bodies. They were both wearing a strapless bra containing their C-cup breasts and tights with some high black stiletto's. Both woman were around the same height at 5'6''. The woman in the blue dress had long jet black hair while the woman in the red dress had curly blond hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the guys were dressed in some tidy black slacks and a a white buttoned shirt with a black tie, they looked to be in fairly good shape. Their nice dress shoes were black and polished and both their black hair was styled to look messy. The guys were bothers and thus looked very similar, but a small height difference with one of them standing at 5'10'' and the other at 6'0''.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond woman decided to swap with the shorter man, while the black haired woman decided to swap with the taller brother and quickly removed their fancy dress and laid it in front of them. They also laid down their stiletto's (which would be way too tight for them) and showed off their black strapless bra and thong to the guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys quickly followed by taking off their slacks and boxers, but they felt really awkward doing this as these gorgeous woman were staring at them. As soon as they have the boxers to their swap partner, the girls took off their thongs and covered themselves up with the guy's boxers. The guys then received the black tight thongs and slid them on, very poorly hiding their erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls grinned and giggled as they kissed the men before helping them take off their white buttoned shirts, the guys left themselves at their mercy while the girls comfortably put on the white buttoned shirts to cover themselves before taking off their strapless bra's underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey instructed the men in putting on their bra's and then fixed up their own outfits by tightening their belts and putting on the men's dress shoes, which were a tad large on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys then took the beautiful fancy dresses the girls left for them and attempted to put them on. The girls, once done getting dressed, decided to help the guys put on their dresses, tights and stiletto's and eventually succeeded in doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men were now dressed in the woman their red and blue fancy dresses reaching to about their calves. They had their stiletto's dangling on their feet as their package was being squeezed by their thongs and their chests constricted with their bra's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman now looked pretty comfortably dressed in the men's slacks and shirts and kind of looked like business woman now. Their feet dressed in dress shoes and their C-cup breasts rubbing against their shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls grinned as they dangled the guy's wallets in front of them as they had left them in their slacks. The men attempted to take them back, but the woman ran out of the bar, leaving the brothers in their fancy dresses, shocked at what just happened. They stumbled in the heels, but eventually just ran after the woman barefoot, causing some wear and tear on the tights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and Mick laughed at the swaps happening in the bar as they hugged each other. Mick, still dressed in Sarah's sweaty and warm outfit, kissed her on the lips as they started to dance a little together.</span></div></div>",

His warmth all around her due to the kiss and their clothes swap was turning her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick had similar feelings as he gladly accepted Sarah's hot kiss and he had previously accepted her warm sweaty outfit, leaving him in her very tight pants with a large bulge forming as Sarah rubbed her body against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick then felt a rush as Sarah started to stroke the bulge though her old leather pants, followed by another passionate kiss as Sarah felt Mick's hands touch her bare skin underneath her shirt. Due to lack of a bra, Sarah quickly felt Mick's hands fondling her sensitive breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two can play at that game.\" She whispered as she unbuttoned and unzipped the tight leather pants she gave Mick and slipped her hand down, fondling the snake and it's eggs, causing Mick to get turned on even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of fondling, Sarah decides to unbutton Mick's jeans on her legs and opened them up a little in the front as she lowered the boxers below her tight ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick quickly followed her lead and lowered the front of the leather pants and the panties as well, causing him to \"unleash the beast\". Sarah purred as she gripped Mick tightly and moved in closer, allowing \"the beast\" to enter her \"cave\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah hugged Mick tightly as \"the beast\" was being thrust back and forth into her \"cave\" filling her with waves of pleasure. Mick seemed to be enjoying himself as well and they kept making out with each other to avoid any loud moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah then felt a warm liquid enter her body as Mick retreated \"the beast\".

Her head hurt so much as she got up and instantly recognized the couch she was laying on, it was Jessica's. But apart from this, she noticed one more thing that was off, she wasn't wearing her own clothes.<br>\r\n\"What the fu..\" She started as Jessica walked into the room.<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, you're up.\" Jessica said, obviously being more energetic than she was.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what happened, where are my clothes?\" Sarah asked almost panicking as she tried to get up, only hurting her head more.<br>\r\n\"Take it easy. You and this guy were really drunk, you seemed to really like him and you swapped clothes with him in front of everybody, I even saw you drag him to the bathroom.\" Jessica giggled but her friend was clearly not as amused as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me you have his name, I need to talk to him, does he have my clothes?\" Sarah asked, still panicking.<br>\r\n\"He does and let me tell you, your clothes look really good on him, maybe you should let him keep them.\" Jessica laughed, but a a bit more concerned for her friend this time around.<br>\r\n\"This isn't any time for jokes Jess, wait, pictures!\" Sarah then said as she took out her phone, which luckily still was her own and looked over the pictures she took that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese pictures told a very clear story of what happened, she filmed herself swapping clothing with this guy at the bar and she had to admit, Jess was not wrong, he looked pretty cute. She also saw some more pictures and clips of them singing and silly selfies while having their clothes swapped. She saw some pictures and clips of the other people in the bar swapping clothes as well, it was chaotic. But lastly, she saw a very graphic clip, apparently, in her drunken state, she had filmed herself while she was in the bathroom having sex with this guy and her heart dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG! I had sex with him, I kissed him, I swapped clothes with him... I I I..\" Sarah continued and started to slightly calm down, but then quickly started to frantically look through her phone again, listening to the clips she got his name. \"Mick\". She then looked through her contact and sure enough found his number. She saved it under \"<img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Mick <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How drunk was I?\" Sarah then sits there as she looks over the clothes she had apparently received from Mick in exchange for her own. They were comfortable she had to admit, really comfortable.<br>\r\n\"Do you think I should go find him? Or keep his clothes?\" Sarah asked Jessica to which she simply replied: \"Why not both?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding it wasn't a great idea to stay here any longer, Sarah thanked her friend and headed out. \"Can I really go home like this, what will my parents think? Maybe I should buy some new clothes? I could try and find that guy too, maybe swap back or something.\" Sarah wondered as she looked through her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I think drinking so much was a good idea!\" Sarah yells at herself as she eventually decides to....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah decides to get some new clothes before heading home, she didn't want her parents to see her in these guy clothes after all. Jessica lived not too far from the clothing stores in town, they're at walking distance luckily so she didn't have to take the bus dressed like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was walking down the street, it didn't seem to be that busy yet, it was quite early, most people usually sleep off their hangover or enjoy their weekend at this time, something Sarah usually did as well. While checking out some stores on the side, she was slowly getting used to wearing Mick's clothes, at least a little. However, this didn't change the fact that she didn't want to keep them, they still were a guy's outfit, which shouldn't be worn by a girl like her, at least that is what she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit of a walk to her favorite store, but she briefly checked out some of the other stores on her way there, she stepped inside some of them, but didn't really see anything she liked yet. Sarah wanted to get out of Mick's clothes, but did want to wear something she at least thought was decent. She could have borrowed some clothes from Jessica if she really wanted to, but they didn't interest her either and it would feel a bit wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking, she finally arrived at her favorite clothing store and she was about the step inside, but then she noticed a pair of girls sitting on a bench next to her. Usually this wouldn't interest her, but something she said peeked her interest regardless.<br>\r\n\"Don't you like your new clothes?\" The girl on the right asked.<br>\r\n\"I do, but I prefer something that's a bit more, I don't know, Boyish?\" The girl on the left asked as she looked over her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of girls looked to be around Sarah's age. The girl to the left seemed to not be too happy with her outfit, she was carrying a bag, but there weren't any clothes in them, at least not yet. The girl had also started shopping for a new outfit or several, but she hadn't found anything she liked yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah was checking her out, she noticed a few things. She was about the same height and even size as her, had long hazel brown hair and the outfit she was wearing now, was something Sarah actually could enjoy. She was wearing some tight dark blue denim shorts, showing off her shaved legs, she had a white top complimenting it, showing off a slight bit of her chest, she had some nerdy looking glasses on her face, but they did look cute on her and lastly, her feet were covered in some pink sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl on the right was a bit of a different story, she was a bit taller, but dressed a bit more modest, which seemed to be her style. She was dressed in some light blue skinny jeans, some ankle high brown boots and was wearing a gray sweater. She had long black hair flowing down on her back and looked to be supporting her friend, at least in her own way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you look so cute, the boys agreed as well didn't they?\" The girl on the right asked.<br>\r\n\"They did and I agree, but it's just not my style I think.\" The girl then answered.<br>\r\n\"Well, you're staying over for the weekend, so you can either buy some new clothes, or borrow some of mine.\" The girl on the right then smiled.<br>\r\n\"I'd feel bad borrowing something of yours, I should have packed more clothes but I rushed it.\" The girl on the left then said meekly as she looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah had heard this entire exchange of words and actually considered talking to the girls, maybe she could strike a deal with one of them, swap some clothes to help them and herself out? It wasn't a bad idea, but then again, these were not her clothes, so buying some new ones might just be safer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah paused before entering the store, but ultimately decided to....</span></div></div>",

I like your outfit.\" Celine said not quite realizing she was actually wearing and actual boy's clothes.<br>\r\n\"Well I was thinking more of something like maybe exactly these.\" Sarah suggested as she pointed at her outfit.<br>\r\n\"You want to sell me your clothes?\" Celine then asked sounding kind of excited.<br>\r\n\"Well, I haven't really found anything I liked either, but I really love your outfit, so I was thinking, maybe we could swap instead?\" Sarah suggested feeling a bit awkward.<br>\r\n\"Sorry but I'm not sure about borrowing clothes from someone, I don't like depending on someone like that.\" Celine said a bit nervously.<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't be borrowing, it would be a trade, I was thinking we could keep them, so they'd be yours completely.\" Sarah clarified and saw a smile reappear on Celine's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeline didn't say a word as she got up from the bench. She started walking over towards Sarah and started circling around her, inspecting her outfit.<br>\r\n\"I'd love to trade outfits with you, but are you sure about this?\" Celine asked as she finished her observations.<br>\r\nI'm sure, I'd love to trade with you too.\" Sarah smiled at the girl.<br>\r\n\"Okay, but first I want to compare bodies if you don't mind, just to make sure they'd fit properly.\" Celine then said blushing to which Sarah nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls then stood next to each other comparing almost every part of their body. Celine was slightly shorter than Sarah, but the difference was almost small enough to ignore completely. Apart from this, both of them had beautiful slender legs, though Sarah had a slightly bigger butt and hips. Celine's waist however was a bit more slender than Sarah's, but Sarah's chest was slightly bigger as well. Lastly. both of them had nice slender arms as well as a cute face to finish them off.<br>\r\n\"My clothes might be a bit tight on you, but we should fit just fine.\" Celine said smiling as she looked over at Jill, who was just keeping herself out of this one.<br>\r\n\"That's just the way I like them.\" Sarah giggled as the pair head inside the store and into the changing rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made sure to have two rooms next to each other so they can pass their clothes along, but before they enter Sarah had one more thing she wanted to ask.<br>\r\n\"Actually, one thing I forget to mention is that I am currently wearing boxers, like those of a boy and I'm also not wearing a bra. Would you be willing to swap underwear too? I miss wearing a bra and panties and these boxers would be comfortable for you.\" Sarah suggested, once again embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"Just because I like you.\" Celine winked as they entered their stalls and started stripping down completely naked.<br>\r\nSarah was quick to pull off Mick's clothes, they weren't as tight as Celine's so she didn't have to struggle so much with it, unlike Celine who took slightly longer to take them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm ready to swap.\" Celine said softly from the other stall. Sarah walked up to the side and passed Mick's clothes over to Celine, including the boxers she was wearing. It didn't take long for Celine to pass over her clothes to Sarah either as she almost threw them into the stall and Sarah laid out the clothes the bench in side her stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst up, Sarah grabbed Celine's pink cotton panties and pulled them on. The panties had to stretch slightly to accommodate for Sarah's slightly more full butt, but they fit comfortable as the fabric hugged her tightly. Sarah then grabbed the pink matching bra and tried to put it on comfortably. Sarah's breasts had to be squeezed a little to fit into Celine's bra, but luckily for Sarah, they fit without causing any pain, but her breasts were left without much breathing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah then picked up Celine's tiny denim shorts. She inspected them for a little bit before finally squeezing into them. Sarah's butt stretched the back of the dark blue denim shorts slightly to accommodate, but they fit perfectly because of it. The shorts were fastened with a belt for Celine and while Sarah nor Celine really needed it, she fastened it as tightly as she could and admired the shorts she was now wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost being finished, Sarah pulled on Celine's tight white top, which was incredibly cute to her. The top tightly hugged her chest and exposed a little bit of her midriff, but not much. Her perky breasts were visibly being constricted underneath which made her look extra sexy. Sarah adjusted the straps of her top and bra and made them align as best as possible for her own comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, Sarah picked up Celine's sneakers and squeezed her feet into them. They were much tighter than Mick's shoes were, but Sarah liked them. The pink sneakers fit comfortable, if slightly loose and definitely completed the look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the other stall, Celine had been getting dressed in Mick's clothes, previously worn by Sarah. She started by pulling on the comfortable boxers, which loosely fell around her legs and comfortable hugged her hips, which Celine enjoyed. Celine felt the lack of a bra on her chest, but didn't pay too much attention to it and continued getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued by pulling on Mick's blue jeans, which didn't cling to her waist and legs like her shorts were doing just a moment ago, instead they fell a bit looser on her legs, but they were also not very baggy at all, which she liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Celine admired her new boy's jeans, she pulled on Mick's black t-shirt which covered most of her feminine figure, almost completing her boyish look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, she put on Mick's worn sneakers, which were slightly big on her as well, but fit her like they should and she enjoyed them, which is all that really mattered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and Celine stepped out of the changing rooms and inspected each other.<br>\r\n\"You look soooo cute in my outfit!\" Celine said as she inspected her.<br>\r\n\"Thanks! I love them, you look great too.\" Sarah said with a wink as Celine nodded happily.<br>\r\n\"I have to return to Jill, thank you again and I made sure to include my number in in of your pockets, give me a call if you ever want to hang out.\" Celine smiled as she ran out of the store, happy with their trade.<br>\r\nSarah felt the back pocket of Celine's shorts and sure enough, there was a paper with a phone number.<br>\r\nSarah admired herself in Celine's sexy outfit for few minutes before finally deciding to....</span></div></div>",

We can see about swapping back too.\" Mick suggested.<br>\r\n\"Sure, text me the details.\" Sarah said surprised he was being so kind.<br>\r\n\"I will, see you in a bit.\" Mick said as he hung up.<br>\r\n\"Crap, I don't have his clothes anymore, I hope he won't freak out.\" Sarah thought to herself as she received a text from Mick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick didn't live too far away, so Sarah made her way over without much issue and knocked on the door to his room and was quickly met with a familiar face.<br>\r\n\"Hey, nice to see you again, you look cute.\" Mick said taking notice to her outfit.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, you do too!\" Sarah then giggled. Mick was still wearing the outfit Sarah swapped with him, he hadn't bothered to change out of it yet and kind of enjoyed wearing it.<br>\r\n\"Last night was fun.\" Mick then said as he motioned over his outfit.<br>\r\n\"I have to admit it was funny.\" Sarah smiled nervously.<br>\r\n\"Do you have my clothes with you?\" Mick then asked curiously.<br>\r\n\"Uhhm, no sorry.\" Sarah said anxiously as she nervously looked over herself.<br>\r\n\"Well if you don't mind, I would like to know I get mine back if I am going to give you back these.\" Mick laughed as Sarah nodded.<br>\r\n\"Listen, I.....\" Sarah then started speaking but she stopped just shy of saying anything more.<br>\r\n\"You what?\" Mick then asked back curiously.<br>\r\n\".....\" Sarah then finished saying as she felt guilty about not having Mick's clothes anymore.</span></div></div>",

Was he cute?\" Jill asked.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't really remember specifically how he looked, but I do remember him being cute.\" Sarah giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's take a changing room in here.\" Jill suggested as they walked by another clothing store.<br>\r\n\"Sure, let's do it.\" Sarah said glad to finally be changing out of Mick's clothes.<br>\r\nCeline waited outside as the other girls entered and each entered a changing booth, quickly stripping out of the clothes they were wearing and passing them over to each other. Each of the girls were grinning as they saw each other's pieces appear in their booths and got ready to dress into their new attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout questioning whether they even talked about swapping it, Sarah took off the boxers she was wearing and slid them into the other booth, Jill grinning as she saw them appear and quickly returned her own panties and bra in it's place.<br>\r\nSarah wasted no time and taking the panties and bra and put them on. The pink panties fit her quite comfortably, even though Jill was a bit taller, she was also a bit slimmer, causing them to hug her hips in all their warmth. The bra however, was a bit looser than her own were, due to her breasts being a little bit smaller than Jill's, though not enough to make them uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Jill was pulling on Mick's boxers, which had been worn by both him and Sarah over the course of the past 24 hours, though she didn't mind that, she enjoyed the feeling on her hips as she pulled them into place. She then took Mick's jeans and slid them on, her slender legs fitting fairly loosely within them as she tightened them up, enjoying the fit as an interesting change from her own jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, those jeans were now being put on by Sarah, slowly being pulled up her legs. The jeans were a bit shorter and tighter than what she was used to but she managed to squeeze herself into Jill's skinny jeans all the same, even though they only reached a bit above her ankles. While her legs and hips slowly started to accommodate to the tight fit, Sarah pulled on the warm gray sweater as it snugly got pulled into place reaching to just about her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill on the other hand was content with Mick's shirt as the pulled it on instead, comfortably falling on her chest, though without a bra, her breasts were loosely rubbing against the fabric as she moved around, though for now, she didn't mind that too much as she finished by putting on Mick's socks, sneakers and jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was also finishing off on the other side as she pulled on Jill's socks and ankle boots. Sarah walked around a bit getting used to her new outfit and then walked out to meet up with Jill and Celine. She and Jill arrived at the same time however and both had a big smile as they looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look good in my clothes.\" Jill complimented as she nodded in approval. \"They actually seem to fit you quite well.\"<br>\r\n\"They're really comfortable, I hope you don't mind taking those off my hands?\" Sarah asked, feeling a bit guilty.<br>\r\n\"Not at all, glad to help out a girl in need.\" Jill smiled back.<br>\r\n\"Both of you look really cute.\" Celine smiled as she saw the two girls walking side by side having swapped outfits.<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I talked to you two, maybe we could become friends, I'm getting a good vibe from you two.\" Sarah said giggling a bit.<br>\r\n\"Of course, maybe we can swap some more clothes in the future.\" Jill winked.<br>\r\n\"Maybe next time we hang out.\" Sarah nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll want to join in on that then.\" Celine said feeling a bit left out.<br>\r\n\"I though you didn't want to swap with me.\" Jill said teasing her.<br>\r\n\"That was when I though you would just let me borrow not swap and it seems fun to swap with someone.\" Celine retaliated.<br>\r\n\"Sure fine, so what do we do now?\" Jill smiled.<br>\r\n\".......\" Celine suggested.</span></div></div>",

There was a pair of black soft leggings, a pink tank top and a black sports jacket, which were not unlike she would want to wear during gym classes, but due to the school's restrictions, she had to wear the provided attire, which she disliked. Luckily for Craig, she kept her sports bra and panties as she couldn't have swapped her underwear for his while he was still wearing them, at least not stealthily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig reluctantly took off his school attire and stripped down to his underwear, quickly packing his knee length shorts and his shirt with the school logo into the bag. As much as he didn't necessarily have to wear Francine's clothes and could wear his teacher's attire, he was curious. He grabbed Francine's leggings and slid them on, tightly clinging to his still kind of sweaty body, making them feel very uncomfortable. The leggings stretched to fit him, but were still tight on his legs and crotch, unlike what he was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he grabbed Francine's pink tank top and pulled it over his head, as it tightly clung to his still sweaty chest as he pulled on her black jacket as well. The outfit he was wearing was light on him and were still made for exercise, so as much as it felt uncomfortable to Craig, he had to admit it could be worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, he still had his own sneakers, probably because they were way too big for Francine, so she probably wanted to keep her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed, Craig quickly got to his car, avoiding being spotted by anyone. As soon as he got into the car, he felt a note inside his jacket. It was from Francine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey Craig, sorry for swapping my clothes with yours, I had to meet with my family after work and couldn't show up wearing sports clothes again or they would kill me. I hope you understand and I hope you're not mad, I'll come over tonight to switch back with you I promise!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's the reason for it.\" Craig mumbled to himself as he fidgeted in Francine's clothes before finally heading home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig finally arrived home without being seen by too many people, hugged his dog, while she seemed to be a bit confused because of his scent, and grabbed a drink for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night....</span></div></div>",

He started to get irritated at her not showing up and it was getting kind of late. Not thinking too much about it, Craig simply shrug it off, peeled the leggings off his legs, took off Francine's tank top and jacket and simply went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, Craig got up and immediately checked his phone to see if Francine called or texted, but alas, she didn't. After checking their schedule, he saw Francine was also working today, actually, there was something else about this day. Craig spent some time trying to figure it out until it hit him. He and Francine would be teaching two classes together today due to the lack of extra time. There was some kind of event they had to attend so they pushed two gymnastics classes into one. Craig was happy he was at least going to be able to confront her today, he grabbed all of his stuff and quickly made his way over to his car and drove to the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he arrived there, he, like usual, went towards the teacher's changing rooms first where he and Francine usually got changed first thing in the morning and discussed their plans for the upcoming classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sorry about yesterday, I completely forgot, it was late and I should have let you know something.\" He suddenly heard a female voice apologize to him, and obviously, it was Francine.<br>\r\n\"You should have, but it's fine, we're here now.\" Craig said as he comforted her.<br>\r\n\"You're still wearing my clothes?\" Francine then giggled as she saw Craig dressed in her leggings, pink tank and black jacket.<br>\r\n\"And you are still wearing mine.\" Craig then smiled back as he saw Francine dressed in his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine was dressed in Craig's relatively baggy jeans, his white t-shirt and his jacket, all of which were a little big on her. Regardless of this, she seemed to really enjoy wearing them, they actually looked kind of cute on her in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get changed and prepare for our classes.\" Craig said as Francine nodded.<br>\r\n\"Yes we should, but I do have a question for you?\" Francine then smiled softly<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Craig asked curiously.<br>\r\n\"......\"</span></div></div>",

She then proceeded to get changed into his sports attire, which she really enjoyed. She quickly pulled on the knee length blue shorts and while a bit wide, she found them really comfortable. Craig however hadn't washed them after yesterday's class, so they still smelled of his sweat, but Francine didn't seem to mind as she quickly grabbed his shirt with the school log on it and pulled it on with ease. Craig's clothes were a bit loose on her, but she loved wearing them, she had been asking the school to improve her attire for a long time and now she got kind of got that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig on the other hand, was not quite feeling so happy, he quickly stripped out of Francine's leggings and threw them near the bag he received from her, not feeling happy about what he was about to do. He then quickly took off Francine's jacket and tank top and laid them down with the leggings. As Craig opened the bag, he immediately noticed the tiny pink sweat shorts Francine had to wear during class, which made him realize why she wanted to swap, they were way too short. Reluctantly, he grabbed the pink shorts and pulled them over his legs and just like he didn't wash his clothes, Francine didn't either and the shorts were still quite sweaty, which Craig felt softly against his hips. His underwear was a little bit shriveled up and pushed into the shorts in order to hide them fully, but this didn't annoy him too much. Lastly, he grabbed Francine's teachers tank top with the logo of the school as well on it and pulled it on, though it was a little too small for him, showing most of his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decided to keep their own sneakers as they wouldn't fit otherwise and would hinder the classes too much. So both of them put these on and met back up in their shared office.<br>\r\n\"Oh my you look so weird.\" Francine laughed as Craig entered pulling on the shorts, attempting to magically make them extend further.<br>\r\n\"I now understand why you wanted to swap.\" Craig admits a bit annoyed as he sat down and pulled out his water bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you got any ideas for the students? We have a large class today.\" Craig asked as Francine sat down as well.<br>\r\n\"We have an equal amount of boys and girls don't we?\" Francine asked.<br>\r\n\"We do, it doesn't happen that often.\" Craig clarified as Francine got an idea.<br>\r\n\"How about we....\" She suggested</span></div></div>",

That includes underwear doesn't it?\" Craig complained.<br>\r\n\"Do you agree to these conditions?\" Francine asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's not like you'll win anyway.\" Craig said confidently as they got ready for their group of students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig and Francine decided to meet the group before they entered the changing rooms. The gym was located in a separate building and had an entrance hall for them to meet beforehand, which they decided to made use of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as their teachers entered the hall, the group of students were split between laughter, between awkward stares and of course those who'd rather not have any response at all.<br>\r\n\"You both look great!\" One girl yelled while a boy yelled \"Did you pick up the wrong clothes yesterday night.\" to which Craig just gave a very disapproving glare.<br>\r\n\"None of the sort.\" Francine responded as she quieted down the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine took a deep breath and prepared for a speech: <br>\r\n\"As your teachers, we feel it's important for us to all understand each other, we have done boys vs girls, mixed teams or completely random pairings, but both boys and girls are still very different from each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe should all respect each other and get to know each other, I see a lot of you boys either staring at, complimenting, or making fun of the other girl's legs due to their shorts, but on the other hand, I also see you girls making fun of the boys whenever they get exhausted or overheated. We felt like switching clothes would allow us to understand that a little bit better about each other. So as your teachers, we wanted to give an example and we switched clothes, but that won't help you much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would like to ask you, to consider switching clothes with each other as well, to understand each other better. You'll be allowed to choose your swapping partner yourself as well. We would both really appreciate it if all of you showed your compassion for each other and switched clothes, but only if you want to of course, don't feel forced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine finished her speech and the kids seemed inspired by it, she knew these kids and if they wanted to switch, at least if the majority wanted to, the others would join in.<br>\r\n\"We'll give you a few minutes extra time so you can make discuss together of you'd like, we'll be waiting inside.\" She finally stated as she grinned at Craig, who was just standing there both amazed and scared, it was a good speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think that worked?\" Craig asks Francine as they are waiting on the kids to finish getting changed.<br>\r\n\"Of course it did, that was an awesome speech!\" Francine bragged as Craig rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the kids were done changing, Craig and Francine looked at them all entering and noticed....</span></div></div>",

Doing a quick survey of the room, Craig noticed not all of them had swapped clothes and poked Francine.<br>\r\n\"Some of them didn't want to, but I didn't want to force them, so I paired the ones that did want to swap together and allowed the others to keep their own.\" Francine admitted. Craig was impressed at this, but thinking at his bet, he didn't really want to lose, but he was considering a middle ground, she did do an impressive job after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of you have decided to swap clothes, very impressive and unexpected.\" Craig starts rallying the class. \"About 90% of you swapped clothes with each other, that is a lot, really proud of all of you.\" Craig continued, but he saw some of the kids that didn't swap step back a little.<br>\r\n\"But that is not to say the ones that didn't are weird or cowardly, it also takes courage to stand by yourself and don't give into pressure, some would argue it takes even more courage instead.\" Francine than added, backing him up.<br>\r\n\"We have set up a very interesting class today.\" Craig continued as he winked at Francine, he was just pulling this one out of his ass after all and didn't know how anyone would react.<br>\r\n\"I am actually very glad some of you kept your own clothes, because as some of you may have noticed, in the past we have divided the boys and girls before for various means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine was starting to catch on now. \"When we had big classes like these previously, we always separated the girls to do dancing and acrobatics, while the boys were getting taught basic self defense and did exercises like push-ups.\" This was true, they did this to be able to manage them better.<br>\r\n\"Now, we flip those roles, all the boys wearing the girl's gym clothes, will be treated as girls today and will do dancing and acrobatics, while the girls wearing the boy's gym clothes will be doing self defense and push-ups. The ones still in their own clothes, will be assisting up with teaching it.\" Craig finished causing a very mixed reaction from the group.<br>\r\n\"To mix things up further, I will be teaching the \"boys\" and Craig will be teaching the \"girls\"\" Francine added last as everyone started to talk about what they just heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice going.\" Francine giggled to Craig as the kids were talking.<br>\r\n\"You too.\" Craig added as he went to round up everyone to their respective exercises.<br>\r\nThe class went okay, with some minor hiccups here and there like Craig messing up a dance or two or Francine failing to show some proper self defense techniques. What started as a nervous group of boys, ended up laughing and having fun with the failed attempts at dancing and some face plants during acrobatics.<br>\r\nThe girls were a bit scared at first but ended up really liking the self defense potions, though most of them hated the tough push-ups and complained a bit, but in the end it was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their long and strange gymnastics class, which Craig purposefully ended a bit short of time so he could talk a bit more, everyone was enjoying themselves. The kids all met up with their swapping partner, if applicable and stood in line, most of the girls were giggling and some of the boys were trying to act tough around them, to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I ended a bit short, because I wanted to talk a little bit, first of all, I am very proud of all of you and it looks like you really enjoyed it too!\" Craig said excited being met with smiled in front of him.<br>\r\n\"There is one more thing I want to tell you, about Francine and I, and no we are not dating in case you're reaching to conclusions.\" Craig continued as some of the girls laughed at his comment while Francine was just awkwardly blushing, having no idea what he was going to say.<br>\r\n\"Francine and I, we made a bet.\" Craig then said, causing Francine to immediately stop and realize exactly what bet he meant.<br>\r\n\"Francine claimed, she could get every single one of you to swap clothes, just like she did with me beforehand.\" This caused some of the kids that didn't swap to look at her a bit guilty.<br>\r\n\"I told her she couldn't, but don't worry, this bet isn't the reason we decided to do this, it was just something on the side I thought was worth mentioning.\" Craig then continued calming some of the kids down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were the stakes?\" One of the kids asked, causing Craig to grin.<br>\r\n\"Well, if I won, Francine would have to swap back gym clothes with me immediately and make me lunch.\" Craig said grinning while a lot of kids started to look at Francine, thinking it wasn't too bad.<br>\r\n\"But, so many of you did actually swap, that I think I will meet Francine halfway, I get her lunch, but we don't swap back our gym clothes immediately.\" Craig then announced, causing Francine to lighten up slightly.<br>\r\n\"But as well as this, I will meet her win halfway as well. If she would have won, I would have had to swap my normal clothes with her for an entire week, but I will accept this for two days due to so many of you actually doing this.\" Craig finally declared standing there embarrassed as the entire group started laughing and applauding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine smiled immensely as she walked up to Craig while the group started to calm down slightly.<br>\r\nAs Francine and Craig were about to end the class, the group was conversing a bit together and yelled \"STOP!........\"</span></div></div>",

Only a very small amount of them, but some of them decided to include underwear as well, which shocked not only Craig and Francine, but also some of the kids as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids then quickly paired up with their partners and passed their clothes to each other. Most of the girls were giggling as they gave the boys their clothes, varying from skirts to shorts to skinny jeans with several girly tops or sweaters being passed around along with them. The girls got the boys jeans or shorts in return with usually a plain t-shirt, which made it seem like a very one sided deal to some of the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will meet you in the entrance hall after you get done changing, now off you go.\" Craig concluded the class as most of the boys took the girly clothes with them into the changing room and most of the girls took their clothes.

The kids all paired up again with their partner to check out the swaps and it immediately caused a lot of girls to giggle madly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the girls were now dressed in one of the boys' clothes. The majority was now dressed in some baggy jeans and a somewhat loose t-shirt, which the girls seemed to enjoy. Some of them were wearing some long shorts instead of jeans, but weren't any less happy with them. Some of the girlier girls had some trouble adjusting, but most of them didn't swap anyway so it wasn't that big of a deal for them, they just awkwardly stared at the ones that did. The swapped girls were now also wearing the boys' sneakers and such, which were a bit too big for most of them, but they could walk on them without too much issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys however, were mostly a little less amused, but much more amusing to see. Like the girls, the vast majority was wearing skinny jeans now, ranging from various colors. For the boys however, most seemed to be a bit too tight for their liking, but since they all paired up with someone relatively close in size, they mostly all fit. Aside from these, there were also boys that ended up with a skirt or leggings, with the boys wearing skirts being the main focus of all the jokes. Some of the boys really tried to own it however, saying they knew they looked great and some of the girls seemed to agree the sight of a boy in their skirt was great indeed. The boys were also now wearing the girls' tops, some of them being a bit revealing, but most of them didn't seem to mind much as they were more focused on their new legwear. Lastly, these boys were also now wearing the girls' sneaker, boots and other footwear, but they were slightly too small for most of them, but they could barely walk on them, even if it looked ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some laughs and even pictures, the kids settled down and all thanked Craig and Francine before heading off to class.<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised they did that, I hope they don't get into trouble in their other classes.\" Craig chuckled.<br>\r\n\"Most of them are swapped, so I doubt it would be that big of a deal, besides, it seemed like most of the boys were already getting used to their new outfits.\" Francine giggled.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I wonder what their parents will think though, we better not get any backlash from this.\" Craig said worried.<br>\r\n\"The thing you should be worried about it wearing my clothes for two days, but there is one detail you left out when you told the class.\" Francine teased.<br>\r\n\"What detail?\" Craig said confused not sure what she meant.<br>\r\n\"The bet was to swap ALL our clothes, so we have some things to trade after work.\" She winked as she started to think of a plan.<br>\r\n\"Oh right, so that means everything in our wardrobes as well doesn't it?\" Craig said remembering now.<br>\r\n\"It does, but moving them can be such a pain, so I have a separate suggestion if you want it.\" Francine started. \"We could just swap apartments instead! Then we don't have to move all our clothes.\" She then suggested with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig thought about it, it wasn't as bad of an idea as he may initially think, but would he really swap apartments with her like that? What else would that include that he wouldn't want?<br>\r\n\"......\" Craig replied as they walked back into the teachers' changing room.</span></div></div>",

Craig did the same and started to put on Francine's sneakers, which were quite tight as her feet were a bit smaller. Craig managed to get his feet in completely however and after walking for a few minutes, he was started to walk into them.<br>\r\nFrancine had to tie the laces of Craig's shoes slightly tighter, but she managed to walk around in them well enough because of that as well, joining Craig in an attempt to get used to them, which they both did rather quickly.<br>\r\n\"If I had known they would fit this well, I would have forced you to swap earlier.\" Francine giggled.<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure, they're still not my size.\" Craig complained as he sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make sure we have everything we need.\" Francine suggested, Craig nodded and they started to gather their stuff.<br>\r\nCraig and Francine traded their casual sneakers now as well and put them in the bag with their other swapped clothes.<br>\r\n\"Oh wait, we need to trade underwear!\" Francine then said as Craig's eyes went wide.<br>\r\n\"Why? No!\" Craig said as Francine giggled.<br>\r\n\"I said ALL clothes and you'll have to wear mine anyway if you're in my apartment.\" Francine argued, to which Craig couldn't deny she was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that their casual shoes were also in their bags along with the other clothes they swapped yesterday, it was time for them to get back dressed in these casual clothes. Craig quickly took off the tiny pink gym shorts he was wearing as well as the tank top and put them inside Francine's bag along with his new small gym sneakers. He then reluctantly pulled off his boxers and passed them over to Francine around the corner, which were swiftly taken and replaced by some very soft fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig took the black panties he was given by Francine just now and pulled them on. They were really restrictive to him and the boner he was getting because of them didn't exactly help. Next, he managed to somewhat put on the black sports bra as well, but it took him a few tries to figure it out. But once he finally managed to get it on, he still had to get dressed so Craig pulled on Francine's leggings, pink top and black jacket and to finish it off, he put on her pink sneakers as well. Once fully dressed Craig noticed something, he was starting to get used to wearing these clothes, apart from the bra of course, but they were kind of sweaty now so they felt a little dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine did the same and got dressed in Craig's jeans and shirt once again, this time with the addition of his white sneakers and boxers as well. She kind of liked wearing Craig's boxers she had to admit, as well as his other clothes for that matter. Francine comfortable spun around in her new male outfit and neatly laid Craig's male gym teacher clothing inside of Craig's bag, which was now hers at least temporarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them got out of their changing rooms and met up again, Francine once again chuckling at the sight of Craig in her outfit, decided to shift her attention to her own outfit to avoid laughing too much,<br>\r\n\"It'll be nice to try on some of your other clothes.\" Francine said as she adjusted the jeans she was now wearing.<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I agree.\" Craig blushed as he fidgeted in the tight leggings and panties now constructing his pretty erect cock.<br>\r\n\"I can see that you're enjoying it however.\" Francine giggled while Craig blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, you're going to need these.\" Francine said as she held out her keys in front of her.<br>\r\n\"All of them?\" Craig asked confused.<br>\r\n\"If you are going to have my apartment, you might as well have my bike and car too.\" Francine smiled.<br>\r\n\"Fine, we can swap cars too while we're at it, you want my ID too?\" Craig joked as Francine rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n\"It just makes sense okay?\" Francine said annoyed.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, was just joking.\" Craig then clarified as he took out his own keys and handed them to Francine.<br>\r\n\"Pleasure doing business with you.\" Francine then laughed as Craig nodded with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair then waved each other goodbye and got into each other's car. Craig kind of liked Francine's car, it had very comfortable seats and quickly got used to driving it. He had to use some navigation in order to find Francine's apartment however, he had never been there before, but he got there without too much issue, parked the car and unlocked the door.<br>\r\nFrancine's apartment was very clean, Francine liked it that way and Craig appreciated it. He quickly kicked off his new tighter sneakers and started to explore the house a little, starting with....</span></div></div>",

He also squeezed his feet out of the tight pink sneakers and started searching for Francine's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine's bedroom was easily found, her apartment wasn't that big, but it was tidy for the most part, but especially her bedroom. Francine had a large bed which was neatly made up. Craig touched the soft red sheets and sat down on the bed while looking around the room. It wasn't a huge apartment, nor was it extremely girly, but you could tell a woman lived here, this included the bedroom. <br>\r\nThe bedroom consisted of a large soft bed, a nightstand with some books on them, some curtains and even some wall decoration to liven up the room. Lastly, there was of course a large wardrobe to the side of her bed and when Craig spotted this, he got up and opened up the wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wardrobe was full of clothes and were mostly a mix of feminine clothes like dresses or skirts, some tiny jean shorts and revealing tops, but there were also some sweatpants and jeans as well. There was also a mirror on one of the wardrobe doors, in which Craig saw himself, wearing Francine's underwear.<br>\r\n\"How did I get in this situation?\" Craig smiled at himself nervously as he adjusted his underwear.<br>\r\nLooking back at the wardrobe, Craig spotted a black bra laying on top, as if it was already picked out to be worn by Francine before.<br>\r\n\"She might have planned to switch out her sports bra for a normal one at home.\" Craig thought to himself as he unhooked the bra he had on now and replaced it with the bra he just spotted. Due to him having a little practice now, Craig managed to put on the bra a bit quicker than before, which he couldn't tell was a good sign or not as he looked into the mirror to make sure the bra was in the right position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly dismissing the skirts, dresses and tiny shorts for now, Craig turned to the first stack of pants he could see and grabbed whatever was on top. Craig picked up a pair of light blue skinny jeans and pulled them on, which was a bit more difficult than he though. Francine was not completely the same size as him and her skinny jeans were really tight, but after some struggling, Craig managed to pull on the skinny jeans and closed the zipper.<br>\r\nThe then did the same with a stack of tops and quickly decided on a light blue tank top and pulled it on, which fit snugly on his torso as Craig took another look in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are actually not that bad.\" Craig said as he struck a brief pose before he embarrassed even himself. Craig walked around in Francine's skinny jeans and quickly started to enjoy them more and more.<br>\r\n\"These might even be better than my own jeans.\" Craig jokingly said to himself, but while meant it as a joke, he actually couldn't help but feel it might be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving changed clothes, Craig cleaned up the dirty laundry he had left behind and collected all the other pieces Francine had left and started to do her laundry for her.<br>\r\n\"If only this place would accept pets, I would trade apartments with Francine permanently.\" Craig joked as he smiled at the skinny jeans on his legs and adjusted them slightly to not squeeze his front side.<br>\r\nCraig started to relax in his new apartment and after grabbing a quick bite to eat....</span></div></div>",

He was going to teach some classes that were required to keep in good physical condition, although this did not apply for all studies on the premises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was told he could assist on a few classes at first, which he did teach alongside another instructor, but only a few weeks later he was told he would get to teach some classes on his own and at the end, depending on the results, which would be both from a small physical exam and from the students' responses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis last class of this period had just come to an end and all students were told to fill in some forms on their experience and were told the physical exam would be done by a different teacher later that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone left the gym, Craig was approached by one of the girls in the class. It still was a bit of a change of pace for him, he was used to teaching high school kids, so now teaching and helping college kids was a different, but welcome step up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl who approached him was called Veronica, she was only a little shorter than him and quite athletic. She was a beautiful girl with long smooth legs, flowing chestnut colored hair and had a cheerful, although a bit cheeky of a personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to bother you, but I had a question on the physical exam today.\" Veronica said.<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure how much I could help you there, but try me.\" Craig replied with a warm smile.<br>\r\n\"It's not got anything to do with the specifics, but I was wondering if you could sign this for me?\" Veronica said handing him a form and a pen.<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I can sign anything for you yet, what's it about?\" Craig said glancing over it.<br>\r\n\"I have a family matter I need to attend later today, at the time of the exam. I discussed it with the commission and they said it was fine, but because the exam would have to be rescheduled for me and that may have impact on your results, I need your signature.\" She explained.<br>\r\n\"Okay sure, I can believe that.\" Craig said as he pressed the pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Craig pressed the pen to put his signature, the pen shot out ink all over him, staining his sports attire. He did have his regular clothes with him as well luckily, but since they were some jeans and a t-shirt, it wouldn't be the best for use during class.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I'm so sorry!\" Veronica said as she saw the events happen before her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, it's not your fault.\" Craig said reassuring.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah of course, there are laundry machines we can use for these kind of incidents, I'll just throw these in there, put on my regular clothes and sign it for you in my office, I'll make sure the commission gets it before the exams.\" Craig smiled and Veronica nodded thanking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig did what he said he would do, he took off the stained clothes and threw it in the laundry machine on the premises. He took his bag with him, containing his other stuff and as soon as he managed to turn on the machine, opened his bag to get changed.<br>\r\nWhat Craig didn't however, it while Veronica was telling the truth about having to leave, she and her friends also took this as a good opportunity to prank him. The pen was tampered with and was rigged to burst out the ink, but while he was distracted talking to Veronica, her friends managed to get to his bag unnoticed until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Craig opened his bag, he noticed the little prank they pulled.

She gave them a wink as she took off her shorts and top and showed off her bikini as she glanced over at the boys and motioned them to come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a question for you boys, would one of you do me the favor of putting sunscreen on me?\" She said as she held out a bottle.<br>\r\n\"Dibs!\" One of the boys yelled as he grabbed the bottle and started rubbing sunscreen on the beautiful woman that called them over.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to want to take a dive soon, but I'd feel worried leaving my stuff here in the open, would you boys mind watching it?\" She asked seductively as the boys all nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later she did indeed end up going into the water for a nice relaxing dive, which lasted for about an hour as she swam around, sometimes entertained some nearby boys and overall just had a good time.

The other boys spotted her and the boy that was about to get dressed gets ready to drop the shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a moment there, what are you doing?\" Lisa asked as she looked directly at the boy.<br>\r\n\"I uh was, uhh, sorry, I'll take them off immediately.\" He started stuttering.<br>\r\n\"No, no, there's no need for that, where are your clothes?\" She asked the boy as he pointed towards his swimming trunks and t-shirt a little bit to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean with 'there's no need for that'?\" The boy asked as he was still frozen in place.<br>\r\nPut them on, you already started doing so.

She put his sandals on her feet and looked back at the boy with her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was getting dressed, he had managed to pull on the tight white denim shorts and had a massive bulge in the front of it. He had fairly decent looking legs, for a guy at least and were in full display in the new shorts. He then grabbed the red tank top and managed to let is tightly hug his chest as the boys were cheering them on. his longish blond hair covered the back of the tank top, covering most of his back and lastly, he managed to squeeze his feet into her small sandals and walked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about this, I didn't mean to force this on you.\" He said softly.<br>\r\n\"It's okay, your clothes are comfortable, at least enough for me to not dislike you for forcing them on me.\"<br>\r\n\"I offered to...\" He started but she interrupted him and said....</span></div></div>",

She slid them down slightly as she did the same with her own new underwear and gently lowered herself. Charlie was overcome by pleasure as Lisa lowered herself on top of him and then there followed about half an hour of making out, sweaty bodies rubbing against each other and a lot of moaning from Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce both had used up most of their energy, they laid next to each other for a bit.<br>\r\n\"That was amazing, I needed that.\" Lisa said as she went to sit upright.<br>\r\n\"It was and it hasn't even been dinner time.\" Charlie laughed as he got up from the bed.<br>\r\nLisa went and got up as well and shared another embrace with Charlie before speaking up again.<br>\r\n\"Do you by any chance have any plans tonight?\" She said as Charlie shook his head.<br>\r\n\"Not really, was about to excuse myself to go home for dinner however.\" He said breaking off the embrace.<br>\r\n\"Why don't you stay over for dinner? I at least owe you that for just now.\" Lisa blushed as Charlie smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were about to get dressed again, Charlie walked up to his own clothes, but Lisa slapped his hand away.<br>\r\n\"We can swap back our clothes after dinner, I'll let you enjoy my shorts just a bit longer.\" She smiled as Charlie's face was filled with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie once again got dressed in the tight white denim shorts, this time without a clear bulge however. The red tank top still snugly hugged his chest as he adjusted the dirty underwear he was now wearing underneath the outfit.<br>\r\nLisa got dressed in the clean shorts Charlie brought with him (so he wouldn't have had to wear his wet swimming trunks) and his shirt and felt rather comfortable as she went into the kitchen to make dinner for both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring dinner....</span></div></div>",

You look like a fairly feminine woman.\" John retorted.<br>\r\n\"I would wear them, but this is about you not respecting my property and it would maybe teach you a lesson.\" Lisa explained.<br>\r\n\"Sure but all I have is this shirt and my swimming trunks.\" John complained.<br>\r\n\"Which are now mine, we really need to get into the sea and I should give you back YOUR bikini and you should give me back MY trunks and shirt.\" Lisa grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, let's just do this.\" John said looking at his friends, which were a mix of enjoyment at his situation and others that were too scared to say anything as well.<br>\r\nJohn also felt a bit strange as well, it felt wrong, but wearing hot girl clothes with a mix of Lisa and Tammy, it turned him on a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa and John quickly got into the water and luckily for Lisa, John's shirt was a dark green, which meant that even wet, would not be easily seen through, retaining some of her modesty.<br>\r\nSpeaking of shirt, that was the first thing John took off and gave it to Lisa, whom happily took it and put it on.<br>\r\nLisa then took off her bikini top underneath her shirt and handed it to John with a grin.<br>\r\nJohn struggled for a little bit and with Lisa's help, he learned how to put on his new bikini top.<br>\r\nLastly, Lisa took off her bikini bottoms under water and let it float in front of John as he took off his trunks and reluctantly handed them over.<br>\r\nLisa then slid the trunks over her hips and grinned as John squeezed himself into the tiny bikini bottoms and finally tucking away his privates, ready to get back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair arrived back at their spot, they were met with laughter from John's friends aimed at him, but he managed to get his pride a little.<br>\r\n\"Let's dry up and pay a visit to your friend.\" Lisa suggested.<br>\r\n\"Why do I have to come? John complained, but then quickly realized it would make sense for him to help clean up this mess and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn dried up in not too much time as it was pretty hot and grabbed his new outfit that Lisa laid on his bag. He pulled the tiny crop top over his shoulders, really tightly fitting on his chest.<br>\r\nLastly, he stepped into the tiny skirt and pulled it on, it took a bit to squeeze himself into it and close the zipper, but he managed to eventually as the skirt reached to about halfway up his upper leg, exposing him a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n\"....\" John responded.</span></div></div>",

She goes by Sab to her family and close friends. She and her brother have similar builds and features and are near identical except for their gender. They were harder to tell apart when they were younger, but it's easier now because Sab's feminine (though not overly curvy) figure compared to Sam's more masculine, but still quite slender, frame. Sab has straight, shoulder-length dark hair and generally wears tight jeans and tight t-shirts, but she does dress more femininely from time to time. Sab is more outgoing and popular than her brother, but she's not the most popular either. She and Sam still have a bit in common, especially their taste and music, and get along super well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon (5'7\" 42 years old): Sam and Sabrina's mom. She's been a single mother since her husband, Sam and Sab's dad, died several years ago, but she's recently put herself back out into the dating world. She has a great relationship with her kids and does her best to help them succeed. Sharon currently works as a nurse at a nearby hospital. In terms of looks, Sharon is quite attractive and is still in great shape and still has a good figure. Much like Sab, she's not overly curvy, but she's got a bit more of a figure than her daughter. She has long, straight dark hair with a few strands of gray, which she dyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, how does our clothes swapping story start?</span></div></div>",

He had gone and crawled out of bed, taken a shower, and gotten all ready for school on this particular Wednesday morning only to remember that his high school was doing this new delayed start thing on Wednesdays. He didn't need to be at school for another hour, so here he was wishing he could've got a little more sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he leaned back, his head hanging off the back of the couch, Sam noticed his twin sister Sabrina coming down the stairs. \"What are you doing up already?\" she asked when she saw her brother. \"Did you forget we didn't have to get up early again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" Sam grumbled. \"But what about you? Why are <i>you</i> up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got this dumb History test today I need to study for,\" Sabrina explained as she plopped herself down on the couch next to Sam. She didn't sound particularly thrilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam couldn't blame her. He knew his sister wasn't great at History and struggled with it in school. He felt the same way about Math. The two siblings were both smart, but had their own strengths and weaknesses. They may have looked quite similar, but their brains were rather different. As children, they had almost been indistinguishable from each other except for the fact that Sam was a boy and Sabrina was a girl. They were easier to tell apart now that they were older. The two had similar builds and features and they were the same height, but Sabrina's feminine (though not extremely curvy) figure compared to Sam's frame as well as their diverging personalities and styles made it much easier to tell who was who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like your shirt, bro,\" Sabrina commented as she fished her History textbook out of her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked down at what he was wearing, specifically a pair of dark-colored jeans and a t-shirt of a rock band both he and his sister liked. He was thankful that while he and Sabrina's interests had developed down different paths as they'd grown up that they still had plenty in common, such as their taste in music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yours is cool too,\" Sam said, noticing his sister was wearing a girls' cut t-shirt of another band they both liked. It was more form-fitting, tight across her stomach and her modest B-cup breasts, making the outline of her bra underneath semi-visible. The rest of her outfit consisted of a pair of very tight purple skinny jeans and a pair of white tennis shoes. Her dark hair, which was just short of shoulder-length like her brother's though more well taken car of, was pulled back into a ponytail off to one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Sabrina said, smiling before turning back to her studying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings soon fell silent. Their mother was away with some friends for a few days, so there wasn't much noise in the house. The silence didn't last too long though. Sabrina soon looked up at her brother with a cheeky smirk on her face. Sam knew it meant she'd had one of her ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I was thinking,\" Sabrina said. \"How about ...\"</span></div></div>",

Sam proceeded to do the same as he took off his own t-shirt and dark jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam held out his hand to catch Sabrina's tight purple skinny jeans as he noticed her taking off her bra.<br>\r\n\"Oh fck sis, you should have told me you were taking off your bra. And speaking of which, do we really need to swap our underwear too?\" Sam almost yelled as Sabrina giggled.<br>\r\n\"Oh come on bro we've seen each other naked and yes this is totally necessary.\" She said firmly as she threw her bra and panties over to her brother.<br>\r\nSam had a terrifying look on his face as his sister's bra and panties laid before him as he looked down at his boxers.<br>\r\n\"Are you going to give me those anytime today? If not I'll pull them off for you.\" Sabrina said as her naked body walked over to him.<br>\r\n\"Give me a moment.\" Sam said as he still was petrified at the thought. Long enough for Sabrina to arrive and pull it down for him like she promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SIS!\" Sam yelled embarrassed as Sabrina grinned as she stepped into the boxers she quickly nabbed.<br>\r\n\"Too slow bro. These are really comfortable by the way, might keep them even after today!\" Sabrina teased as she walked back to get dressed in the rest of her brother's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled on her brother's dark jeans, which fitted a bit looser than her own jeans, but she liked them. The same could be said for the shirt, which she easily put on as well as she reveled in their fit and look on her, surprisingly covering pretty much all her feminine curves. She finished by putting on her brother's socks and sneakers which fit her feet just fine and immediately went to look for the closest mirror to check herself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Sam had been getting dressed, stepping into his sister's panties and reluctantly pulling them up, but since he really wanted to cover himself he relented. They fit snugly against his crotch and hips and were more pleasant than he expected, they were quite soft, albeit a bit small. He struggled shortly with the bra but managed to get it on without too much issue and turned to step into the purple skinny jeans. It took some very strong tugs and pulls for him to finally squeeze into them and zip them up. They felt extremely tight in his crotch area while his legs weren't too uncomfortable. He managed to adjust his penis to fit comfortably and pretty much made sure it wasn't noticeable on the outside and finished by putting on his sister's snug t-shirt and sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sabrina came back, she brought a small mirror with her and smiled as she showed her brother his reflection, which made him shudder at the thought of pretending to be his sister for the day.<br>\r\n\"You look cute.\" Sabrina said as she grinned madly.<br>\r\n\"I don't, I can't believe we're doing this.\" Sam said embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"I can! Oh wait, here.\" Sabrina said as she undid her ponytail and redid it the same way for Sam, making his hairstyle match her own while she made her hair look fairly close to Sam's.<br>\r\n\"Woopie.\" Sam said annoyed as he grabbed his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point!\" Sabrina suddenly said as she yanked Sam's phone from his hand while it was still unlocked and went into it's settings.<br>\r\n\"Give me my phone Sab.\" Sam demanded as Sabrina nodded eagerly, but instead of giving the phone she took back, she gave him her own phone instead, which unlocked.<br>\r\n\"That's your phone now, you should change the settings so our fingerprints and passwords are changed.\" Sabrina said as she grabbed Alex's bag from the floor and put it on.<br>\r\n\"I guess I am you for today, that includes your phone.\" Sam said as he changed the settings and grabbed Sab's bag and left for school together.</span></div></div>",

Sabrina usually wouldn't let up when she had an idea. She could be particularly stubborn about things she considered to be fun, interesting or just different to the norm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose we could do that. I do like that band, but you know that your shirt won't fit quite the same way it does for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you mean because of these?\" She said pointing to her breasts. Sam nodded at his twin as he turned slightly to better look at her. Sabrina smiled and waved her hand at her brother. \"Don't worry about it. We're nearly the same size. I'm sure you can make it work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly wink of her eye was enough to set both twins laughing at each other. Sam nodded at his sister as he stood up and pulled his deep green band t-shirt over his head. Sabrina snatched it off him as she began to lift hers up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi! Give a girl a little privacy bro!\" She said with a grin that told him she was teasing. He simply gave his sister a half salute and turned away so she could swap he shirt for his. After a moment he felt a bundle of cloth pushed into his side. Grabbing the bundle, he unfolded the white shirt to discover a white lace bra was also present. Looking up at his sister, he could see the outline of her unsupported breasts through his shirt that she was now wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow he asked her \"And what exactly am I supposed to do with this?\" indicating the additional garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You put it on silly. That way my shirt will fit you better.\" Sabrina giggled before taking the bra off his hands. \"I'll help you out this time. Hold out your arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked at his sister, his eyebrow still raise, before thinking to hell with it, sighing and raising his arms as instructed. Sabrina wasted no time in sliding the straps up her brothers arms and over his shoulders. Nudging his should to get him to turn, she clipped the bra together before adjusting the straps and fit of her bra around her brothers chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go bro. One properly fitted brassiere. Fashionable and functional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not exactly sure you can really call it functional as I'm not exactly filling it out the way you do\" Sam replied as he slid on his sisters shirt. The form-fitting aspect of the shirt was evident as it was fairly snug across his shoulders, abdomen and chest. This in turn, made him very aware of the bra he was wearing. He had to admit that the lace edging of the cups was nice. Possibly a little too nice as he felt himself shift in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that I have to agree with you. Even with the bra helping, I definitely fill it out better than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam laughed at his sister. \"Well, I'm glad I can help brighten your day. If your history test gets you down, just think about your lowly brother, taking one for the twin team by wearing your bra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina gave her brother a big hug and nodded into his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. bro. That image will certainly get me through the day.\" She sat back down and opened up her textbook. Sam sat down at the table and began to study himself. It would be easier to get it done now, rather than leaving it until later.The pair studied in silence for about half an hour, before Sabrina looked up at her brother again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Say bro, you're looking really cute in my shirt, how about taking it a bit further?\" Sabrina grinned as she looked at her brother, who just looked up from his textbook with a very disinterested face.<br>\r\n\"No thanks sis, I don't really want to wear a dress.\" Sam said back, trying to dismiss it as he focused back on his book, but as he thought previously, this didn't exactly work.<br>\r\n\"Not a dress you idiot.\" Sabrina grinned as she pointed towards her jeans.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure those will even fit?\" Sam asked as he closed his book and turned to face his sister.<br>\r\n\"Only one way to find out.\" Sabrina winked as she started to unbutton and unzip her jeans and peeled them off. Sam decided to follow her lead as he knew arguing with her wasn't going to get anywhere and he didn't want to upset his sister, she was always nice to him after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam took off his shoes first and kicked them off to the side of the room and proceeded to take off his dark-colored jeans. Learning his lesson from last time, he looked away from his sister as he grabbed his jeans and held it out for Sabrina to take. This didn't take long as his jeans were taken from him fairly quickly, but received nothing in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis, what gives?\" Sam asked as she started to feel uncomfortable without pants.<br>\r\n\"I'm still missing something bro.\" She giggled as she made sure to have her back touch with Sam's.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Sam asked confused as he felt his sister's back pressing against him.<br>\r\n\"This way we won't see each other, especially when you take that off.\" Sabrina giggled even more loudly as she pulled on her brother's boxer shorts and snapped them back.<br>\r\n\"Hey, no way, that's going too far sis.\" Sam complained at first.<br>\r\n\"Come on bro, pretty please!\" Sabrina then practically begged. This made Sam cave in, he knew he couldn't ask her to let up and aside from that, she had his pants with her right now anyway and could easily lock arms with him to hold him still, she had done that in the past before when she didn't get her way and that time he was wearing pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fine, but you tell no one, ever!\" Sam finally submitted as he grabbed the band of his boxers and pulled them down over his legs. He held them behind him for his sister to take and was quickly taken, but this time, a bundle of soft cloth was pushed back into his hands. As he went to inspect it further, he noticed Sabrina did give him her panties and jeans, so he proceeded to put them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting with the panties, Sam slid them over his legs and thighs and actually enjoyed their soft texture. What he didn't enjoy however was their size and how poorly they covered him. It didn't help that the panties were slightly damp, but decided to not say anything to not upset his sister any more, but it still felt very strange to him to wear his sister's damp panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then proceeded to pull up the very tight purple skinny jeans, or at least attempt to as he only managed to pull them up to his ass. Sam then got out of the chair and bent over to pull the lower part of the jeans over his feet at least.<br>\r\n\"Looking good brother!\" Sabrina laughed behind him as his new panties were still visible on his butt as the jeans weren't pulled up far enough.<br>\r\n\"I told you they wouldn't fit, your jeans are too tight!\" Sam said as he finished pulling the lower parts over his feet.<br>\r\n\"Let me help you.\" Sabrina grinned as she grabbed the belt loops on her brother's hips and started pulling them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit of a struggle pulling them up, Sam was finally wearing Sabrina's very tight purple skinny jeans as he zipped and buttoned them up feeling an intense tightness on his entire lower body.<br>\r\n\"How do you walk with these?\" Sam said as he tried to walk around, getting used to the tight jeans.<br>\r\n\"A thank you for helping you would have been nice.\" Sabrina said with a sassy tone.<br>\r\n\"Sorry sis, it's just a bit overwhelming, wearing your shirt, skinny jeans and even underwear, it's a bit strange.\" Sam said as he walked over to his sister to give her a hug.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I understand, but don't you love it?\" Sabrina said as she gladly accepted the hug and tightly gripped her brother.<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't say I love it, but it's interesting.\" Sam said not wanting to give them impression he liked swapping clothes with her, but not upsetting her too much either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, we wasted a lot of time preparing for school, we need to get ready!\" Sabrina said excitedly as she packed her books.<br>\r\n\"Wait, hold on, what about this?\" Sam said as he pointed at his outfit.<br>\r\n\".....\" Sabrina yelled back as she finished packing her books.</span></div></div>",

When they were little, the twins were basically identical apart from their gender, but their differences were much more obvious now, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, bro,\" Sabrina laughed. \"Have you seen yourself?\" She then proceeded too drag her twin brother in front of the mirror hanging in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam knew he wasn't exactly the pinnacle of masculinity with his slender build and soft features, but he was surprised by what he saw in the mirror. With Sabrina's clothes on, he looked surprisingly like her. Maybe they were more identical than he realized. Looking back at his sister, he saw that she did look a lot like him while wearing his clothes. The lines blurred even further when Sabrina pulled out her hair tie then used it to put Sam's hair into a ponytail just like hers had been in. She then proceeded to miss up her hair to make herself look more like her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay so maybe we <i>can </i>pull this off,\" Sam admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright that settles it,\" Sabrina said. \"We'll pretend to be each other today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second,\" Sam said, coming to realization. \"This was your plan all along, wasn't it? So you could get out of taking the History test?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Maybe</i>,\" Sabrina said with a devious smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Sam said. \"I'll take your test for you, <i>but you owe me</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, bro,\" Sabrina said, patting Sam on the back. \"The next time you have a difficult Math test we can switch places and I'll take it for you to return the favor. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal,\" Sam said and then the two shook on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's get going or we'll miss the bus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the twins grabbed each other's backpacks and headed out the door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What did you say? I couldn't Hear you. I'll see you at school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina rushed down the hall, her book-bag slung over her shoulder and quickly shoved her feet into a pair of her shoes, before rushing out of the house. Sam stood there a little shell shocked before shaking himself out of it and packing his own books. As he got his things ready for school, he couldn't help but be very aware of the fact that he was wearing his sister's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple skinny jeans were tight and squeezed him from all sides. The panties were snug and they clung to his hips and butt as he moved, making him feel the lace edging. The matching bra he wore, in spite his sister's statement of it being properly fitted, was a constant feeling around his chest. Even if it and the band shirt weren't as uncomfortable as the jeans, he couldn't help but be a little annoyed at the two protrusions under the shirt. The fact that they were less noticeable on his chest than his sister's was small consolation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling on a random pair of his socks, then a pair of his sneakers, he walked out of the house, down to the bus stop, where his sister was waiting, breathing deeply to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that you didn't have to rush off quite like that.\" His sister stuck her tongue out at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but at least this way the world can see how fashionable you're looking today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever retort Sam could have come up with was lost with the sound of the bus pulling up at the stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get on the bus Sab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was both uncomfortable and enlightening for Sam. He could never truly forget that he was wearing his sister's clothing. He came close during his math class, but that was ruined when he went to the bathroom afterwords and was greeted by white lace when he opened the fly on the purple jeans. Despite the fact that he felt like he was on display for the world to see, he noticed that virtually no-one paid any attention to what he was wearing. People on the bus were too busy either staring out the windows, or checking their phones. Other kids at school were in their own teenaged hormone filled world and didn't really pay any attention to anything. Even his group of friends didn't bat an eyelid at his attire, although Jordan (his best friends girlfriend) did pull him aside and ask for an explanation. After she had stopped laughing at him, Sam noticed that she would cast speculative glances at Josh, her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina's day was similarly enlightening for her. She loved the loose fit of her brother's clothes and was glad that they shared a similar taste in music. She was a little uncomfortable without any support for her breasts, but she would shrug it off and figure it a small price to pay. She was especially glad when she came to sit her dreaded history test. Sabrina kept herself from getting annoyed by playing a game with herself. Every time she came to a question that frustrated her, she would run a hand along the loose jeans and feel the edge of her brother's boxer shorts. She would then sit up slightly straighter and think about what Sam would do. Her mind would helpfully supply some sarcastic comment in her brother's voice, which would make her smile and sometimes stifle a laugh, lifting her mood. By the end of the day, she had come to think that this game she played with her brother was too much fun to just give up and she couldn't wait to get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins afternoon was spent doing homework and teasing each other a little while they spoke about their days. The pair were relaxing in front of the tv, watching some inane show, just enjoying each other's company until Sabrina turned to her brother with a thoughtful expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sam,...\"</span></div></div>",

He managed to peel off the purple skinny jeans after jumping and wiggling for a while and eventually managed to pull them off. He them proceeded to take off the shirt, which went a lot easier and his socks. He threw all of these clothes into the laundry basket and then found himself standing in his sister's panties and bra combo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better keep these on and throw them in the wash tomorrow morning I guess.\" Sam reasoned with himself as he left the bathroom and got ready for bed. As he walked past Sabrina's room however he noticed she had already laid out her pink pajamas on her bed, she was home earlier than him after all.<br>\r\n\"Hey sis, your pajamas on your bed, are those for me tonight?\" Sam yelled downstairs to Sabrina as she yelled back \"Yep, I already grabbed yours too, you just have to take mine instead.\"<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" Sam yelled back as he entered his sister's room and noticed a pair of pink pajama shorts and a tank top laid out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least it won't be as tight.\" Sam sighed to himself as he closed the door to get changed and pulled the tank top over his head. It fit him quite nicely, at least as nicely as it could without breasts and loosely hung around his body, not being as tight to allow more breathing room. He then proceeded to step into the pink shorts and pulled them up. The shorts were surprisingly comfortable, after all they were a lot softer, but he didn't expect them to actually feel nice. Sam was still very uncomfortable with the exposed legs and simply the thought of them being his sister's, but pushed away the thought as he straightened out the tank top and shorts and went over to his own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam opened the door to his room, ....</span></div></div>",

Josh will be there too!\" Jordan asked grinning.<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, you convinced him to swap with you too?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Jordan nodded with a smile.<br>\r\n\"Okay sure, what time?\" Sam asked, a bit intrigued by the idea.<br>\r\n\"I made sure we have pizza for all of us so before dinner. I would say after school everyone has a bit of time to get clean clothes for afterwards etc. and we will all meet at my house.\" She explained.<br>\r\n\"So, uhhm Nina, when do you want us to swap?\" Sam asked blushing as he asked her.<br>\r\n\"I think we should swap....\" Nina responded, blushing as well.</span></div></div>",

She's had a crush on Sam for a while now and thought of wearing his clothes was making her giddy to her core. She started with his boxers and felt the still warm underwear comfortable fall on her hips. Sam's jeans fit quite fine as well as she pulled them on as well as his red shirt, which was slightly sweaty after Sam's long day, but she didn't seem to mind much. Lastly she put on Sam's socks and shoes and smiled as she walked back outside to wait for Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had started getting dressed in the meantime, but he wasn't quite done yet. He started by putting on Nina's small panties and bra, which seemed to fit decently okay, even though it was a lot tighter than he would have liked. He did however like the softness and the though of them being Nina's definitely helped him deal with it. Deciding to follow this up with the more comfortable stuff, he pulled on her white tank first and then the pink sweater over top, which seemed to fit quite well and was very comfortable too. Though comfort was not the word he would use first to describe the feeling of the tiny denim skirt as he pulled that on next and finished getting dressed by putting on the boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne done, both met each other outside of the changing rooms and blushed madly as they looked at each other.<br>\r\n\"You look really cute.\" Sam said as she shyly looked away and kept his legs as close together as possible.<br>\r\n\"You too.\" Nina giggled as she took his hand and walked out of the school area with him.<br>\r\nSam stumbled a bit on Nina's shoes, they were a bit too tight for him and he wasn't used to walk on any kind of heel. But with some help from Nina he just about managed. Though the uncomfortable gusts blowing underneath and inside of the skirt were nothing she could really help him with as both were too embarrassed to talk much to each other as they quickly each grabbed a bag of spare clothes from their homes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, they arrived at Jordan's house and rung the bell, to be greeted by....</span></div></div>",

Her petite feet sort of fit into Josh's sneakers and she was wearing his dark green t-shirt, which actually looked quite okay on her. He even noticed Josh's boxers were peeking just above the waistband of the jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you were successful.\" Sam said as she smiled.<br>\r\n\"Yup, looks like you two did as well!\" Jordan said with a wide smile as she saw Sam and Nina wearing each other's clothing.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm still getting used to them though.\" Sam said pulling on the tiny skirt.<br>\r\n\"You have really good legs Sam, Nina's skirt looks amazing on you.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I guess?\" Sam said not knowing if that was a compliment or not.<br>\r\n\"I agree, you look really cute.\" Nina said as she blushed.<br>\r\n\"It is kind of comfortable too, in a way.\" Sam said to himself, blushing as well as Jordan lead them inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've swapped clothes with a girl too huh?\" Sam heard a familiar voice say.<br>\r\nSam looked back to see it was Josh and as expected, he was wearing Jordan's outfit.<br>\r\nJosh was wearing Jordan's denim shorts, which looked like he just barely managed to zip closed, it barely fit him and his hairy legs were poking out underneath. It looked odd for sure. He was also wearing her tight black t-shirt which exposed a bit of his belly, but not much due to the length being okay, but the fit was a bit tighter than he would usually wear for sure. His feet were squeezed into Jordan's boots and just like with Jordan, just above the shorts, he saw a small bit of the panties he was now wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, I swapped with Nina.\" Sam said as he sat down next to him.<br>\r\n\"Oh she's cute. You a couple now?\" He asked back<br>\r\n\"No but I couldn't refuse swapping with her.\" Sam replied.<br>\r\n\"Then ask her tonight, come on, you're wearing her clothes, if that isn't an indication she likes you back, I don't know anymore either.\" Josh said back.<br>\r\n\"You may have a point there.\" Sam said as he looked back at the girls.</span></div></div>",

He was so constraint in Kelly clothes but the hardest part was already done and it will only for some hours before he gets back to his home. Sam gets the shoes and they fit perfectly, he thought for an instant that he could have the same size of shoes than Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just at this moment Kelly came back to the room, \"Woah my clothes look good on you! But there is something missing\" as she said that she pulled of her crunchy of her blond hair and put it in Sam hair to make the same ponytail that she had before removing it.\"Hey! Don't touch my hair\" screamed Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well too late Kelly.

Like \" my fav animal is cat and kitten, my fav food is spaghetti etc\u2026 etc\u2026\". You hope it will be ok and she won't blame you for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you did her math and science it was the easy part but long to lay out. And too finish with this you open exercise and french lessons book to learn the vocabulary to translate the sentence. You succeed and even learn some basic french then you feel the pocket of your jacket vibrated. You pulled out of the jacket an old iPhone with a broken screen.

This day was so fun as Kelly you though maybe Sam will want to trade sometime if I ask him nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear your house you spotted Kelly in a pink sweater and a cute skirt, she came to you and said \"Hey Sam ! How was your day has me ? I hope Charlotte was nice with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her a bit dumbfounded and decide to play the part, \"No it was alright but I miss my clothes, let's go see the others and trade back please\" you said trying you best to imitate the real Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she take you to her house and everyone was waiting, Jordan and Josh already changed back and Nina was waiting with a towel around her. Kelly lead you to the bathroom and Sam clothes were in with is phone and students card, you changed in them and give Kelly her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking a bit with 'your' friends about today you left Kelly house, you checked your pocket to see if anything could lead you to Sam house and found a small paper with an address and some password written on it with a girly writing.<br>\r\nYou checked a password on your phone and lucky you it worked, now you are leading to Sam house with Google map and your new outfit, I just borrow Sam life for some time you though, I'll even send him a message to swap back later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam point of view<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter music class you spend some time to help the teacher with photocopies and cleaning the classroom. Finally you leave and joined Charlotte house, you entered using Charlotte key and called for someone but nobody was here. It's strange you though she finished before me and she is not her maybe she had some Kelly's obligation that you didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou messaged Kelly phone, \"Hey girl ! Where are you ? Why aren't you to my house ?\". Some instant later you got a message \"Hey I'm on my way girl ! I didn't know we had something tonight, did something happen ? :)\", You looked confused at the message and get surprised by Kelly behind you giving you a wedgie. \"Hey girl sup\" she said while you were suffering from her surprise, \"Hey Kelly ! Where is Charlotte ?\" You asked, she looked at you confused and said \"What are you saying Charlotte ? And why you said that I have to be her ? We didn't planned anything, or did you with Sam ? I was trading back with him 30 minutes ago and he didn't said anything about going to your house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a message on Charlotte phone, it was your phone number, \"Hey Sam or should I say Charlotte, I'm sorry but Kelly and your friends thought I was you so I take your place, I'm actually at your home. Your sister is more sharp and found me out but said it was ok she will cover you but your mother didn't saw the difference, maybe because she didn't saw you on a long time with her job. Anyway I'm on the bus with your sister for your grandparents house right now x) they want 'us' to spend a week with them, your mom already tell the school about next week it seems we are stuck like this for sometime <br>\r\nMake you pretty for pictures day next week, you can tell Kelly about this if you want,<br>\r\nTake care of my grade and school present and I'll be a perfect grandson for your grandparents<br>\r\nKiss kiss have a nice weekend and week new Charlotte :3\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turned to Kelly and explained the situation, she didn't believe you until you show her the bulge in your panty. She poofed and laughed really hard saying she was so sorry to have thought Charlotte was you, anyway after that she said she will help you to be Charlotte until she return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Could you do me a favour and babysit my little angel for the weekend while I attend a work seminar, I'll pay you the same as always plus a bonus because it's weekend? Hello, did you hear me?\"Said the voice over the phone. With your best Charlotte imitation, you said that it was ok, and you will go to her house right now. You reluctantly accepted to not damage Charlotte reputation while you are her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said you goodbye to Kelly who is going back for her home, she tells you that you are an awesome guy to do that for Charlotte and wished you good luck for your babysitting with Cindy. She also tells you that Cindy is a very spoiled brat that always tantrum to get what she wants, so you should do your best with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you went to Charlotte bedroom and get necessary for spending the weekend babysitting. You got clothes, Charlotte's nightgown, her phone charger and her backpack with her homework. When you were ready, you went to Stephanie and Cindy house and you get inside. \"Hey Cindy can you come your mother asked me to babysit you this weekend? You asked inside the house, \"I DON'T WANT A BABYSITTER! ESPECIALLY YOU CHARLOTTE!\"She answered yelling and coming out of her room. She was a small girl, maybe 6 or 7 years, with a pink hello kitty dress and two messy twintails held by pink hello kitty crunchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! You are not Charlotte, and mama wouldn't asked someone I don't know to babysit me. Who are you?\"Cindy asked, you explained that you were playing a pretend game with Charlotte and exchanged place for the week. You tell her it would be really nice if she could keep this secret, but she said no and wanted to play to pretend too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said you should babysit her, so it would be hard to play pretend without her mommy finding out. She said her mom wouldn't know and tell you that she will tell to her mother that you are not Charlotte if you don't play pretend with her. You sighed and agreed with her but to the condition that you would change back before her mother get back, she accepted too and tells you that she wants to be Charlotte and you would be Cindy the little girl that she has to babysit this weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaded you to her room and said that you should undress totally and gave you a towel with a hello kitty design. She seems to be really interested into hello kitty, in her room many clothes with hello kitty design and hello kitty toys were on the floor, she also had hello kitty sheet on her bed. You finished to undress and waited in the corridor while Cindy changed her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 20 minutes she came out, the clothes didn't fit at all, they were so loose on here it was a bit ridiculous. You helped her to adapt to the clothes with a belt for the pants and some clothespins that were in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks you Cindy for helping me, Charlotte your babysitter. You can go to your room and change now, also wear your special panty your mom wouldn't want you to pee yourself.\" Cindy said confident in her new outfit while laughing at you. You get in the room and found the outfit she has worn. It would be too small for you, but the dress could cover the top of your knees. The outfit was composed of white tight, a hello kitty dress and a pull-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started with the pull-ups, and it fit you good, not too small not to big, maybe it's because Cindy is a little chubby. Like you though the dress didn't cover much of your legs, it displayed a bit the pull-ups too, the top of the dress also stretched a bit on your body, like the tights you put at the end of your dress up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get in the kitchen where you found Cindy playing with Charlotte phone. She busted of laughs seeing you in her outfit and also said it's missing something while taking off her twintails and tending you her crunchies. You put your curly hair in girly twintails and asked \"So what are we doing now, babysitter ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In there you saw an enormous flat TV on the wall with a lot of dolls, doll house and others toys on a hello kitty pink carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy sat on the sofa and ordered you to sit on the carpet and play like a good little girl. You tried to sat and hide the pull-ups, but the dress was too short and it displayed it, Cindy laughed and said \"Let's it showing up, little girl always shows their panty and if you have an accident I'll saw it. Also new babysitting rules, if you want to go potty you have to ask me and do a potty dance.\" You blushed at the humiliation and decided to obey for now. It would be worst if you didn't obey and she told her mom about Charlotte and your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just sat uncomfortably with your pull-ups on the hello kitty carpet and started to play with the dolls. After some time Cindy turned on the TV and put a kiddy channel with cartoons on it. You were bored to play with the dolls and started to watch the cartoon. The shows were very girly and not really smart, but interesting enough to occupy you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one moment you saw an add and the time displayed on the TV, it was the time for dinner! You look around and didn't saw Cindy in the living room. You headed in the kitchen and find her preparing some food in the microwave. \"Hey babysitter what are you preparing?\" You asked dumbfounded because it was you that should have prepared food and not a little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww Cindy! You were so cute watching you cartoon I didn't wanted to bother you. Also, you make a better little girl than me, that sad that we couldn't trick people to think we are each other. Anyway, the dinner will be ready soon.\" She said, before setting up the table with kiddy plate, plastic fork and spoon, and a hello kitty sippy cup. She takes ketchup spaghetti from the microwave and put them in your plate before getting noodles from a Chinese restaurant out of the microwave as well. \"They are the left over of yesterday. I don't really like ketchup spaghetti they make me look so immature, also do the little Cindy need to go potty before dinner?\" Cindy said, you nodded and started to go to the bathroom before the little girl grabbed you by the hand.\" No no ! You should follow the rules!\" yelled Cindy, you just asked her nicely \"Can I goes potty pretty please\" and started a potty dance. She laughed at you while you were playing the perfect little princess, \"Of course little Cindy. I proud of you for wanting to be potty trained now, you can go potty and came back to eat after\" she told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to the bathroom and did your little business before putting back the pull-ups and going to the kitchen. Cindy already started to eat her noodles and you take place at the table to eat the ketchup spaghetti. They were not really good and a little hard to eat with the plastic fork and spoon, while you were eating you messed a bit with them and the ketchup soiled your clothes and face. \"Aww silly little girl you don't know yet how to eat properly it seems. We will change your clothes after you finish to eat Cindy\" said your young babysitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jenna managed to score the winning points and was celebrated as a heroin among the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo celebrate their victory, the woman and men's basketball teams banded together to throw a big party in some old house they usually used for these purposes. Many people had brought some of their friends, some of them were managing drinks, others games and all the rest just got drunk while partying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was at this party as well, though she came alone initially and banded with her teammates. She was currently wearing some black denim shorts with a cute pink tank top that showed off a bit of her cleavage. She had her sexy, strong legs fully visible in the tight shorts with her feet covered in some comfortable running shoes she usually wore out for a jog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party got off to a strong start, plenty of beer for the guys and plenty of wine for the girls, though some guys drank wine and some of the girls beer as well. Jenna was just talking with her friends while some guys occasionally tried to hit on her, which she quickly dismissed as most of them were just meatheads that couldn't tell her from her friends in their current state anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually however, some games started to be played, at first drinking games, but then dares started to become a part of it. Some of the girls had prepared some cards with several dares on them and the game was pretty simple. A player picks up a dare and decides to either do it, or take a shot of liquor as a punishment, which resulted in some hilarious situations. There were guys oinking like pigs and girls licking armpits and each time someone took a card and either did the dare, or drank a shot, they passed the turn, eventually giving Jenna a turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Jenna, your turn girl.\" One of the girls in charge of the game yelled at her. She was a petite Asian girl with short black hair, she was on the debate team but came along with her boyfriend.<br>\r\n\"Sure, fine.\" Jenna said as she picked up a card as her face went pale as she read the card.<br>\r\n\"What does it say!\" The girl asked back as everyone watched in anticipation.<br>\r\n\"Swap clothes with a person of the opposite gender.\" Jenna said as she showed the card.<br>\r\n\"Pick someone!\" The girl yelled excitedly as some of the boys around either looked away as if not to want to be picked, which surprisingly, some of the boys that hit on her were more than welcoming it.<br>\r\n\"Uhhhm.\" Jenna said as she looked around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of people staring at her, Jenna had made her decision.</span></div></div>",

She'd noticed him earlier, watching the game unfold but not participating himself. He looked about 5'8\" and was very skinny for a guy, though it wasn't readily apparent due to his baggy t-shirt with a video game logo on it and baggy jeans. He also had messy blonde hair and didn't have much in the way of body hair (and the body hair he did have was barely visible due to its light blonde color). The reason she decided to pick him was because unlike most of the guys at the party, mostly jocks, she was taller than him and he was skinnier than her. This meant he wouldn't ruin her clothes by stretching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You,\" Jenna said, pointing the boy out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" he managed to get out, looking back at her with an expression of total surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you,\" Jenna said before standing up. Several of the girls nearby giggled as she approached the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O- okay,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name anyway?\" Jenna inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Alex,\" the boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Alex, are you going to switch clothes with me or what?\" Jenna asked.</span></div></div>",

Let's go.\" Jenna grabbed Alex by the arm and dragged him toward the bathroom before he could change his mind. Some of the girls giggled as the pair walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, why did you pick me?\" Alex asked once they were in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want any of those jocks stretching out my clothes,\" Jenna explained. \"But you're skinny enough that I shouldn't have that problem. I have to say, you're not the kind of guy I expected to see at a party like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, my friend Jeff dragged me here. His girlfriend is on the team,\" Alex explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeff ... Jeff ...\" Jenna muttered to herself as she tried to recall. \"Oh, Megan's boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex nodded. \"They ended up ditching me here too,\" he said, letting out a nervous laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll keep you company so I don't lose track of my clothes,\" Jenna teased. \"After we swap you should come join the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Alex agreed. \"I guess we'd better swap then? So your friends don't think you're chickening out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point,\" Jenna laughed. \"I like your shirt, by the way. Halo's pretty fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex looked down at his black t-shirt which featured a design Master Chief's helmet from Halo. \"I didn't think a girl like you would like games,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I get that a lot,\" Jenna said. \"But I have three older brothers. I grew up playing games with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's cool,\" Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, let's do this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding facing away from each other, the two removed their clothes and handed them off to each other. Jenna made sure Alex didn't steal any glances at her naked body, but he was well behaved unlike how she expected the meathead jocks at the party to have been in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Jenna slid on Alex's boxers and jeans, then put on his shirt, his socks, and his sneakers. Alex, meanwhile, had managed to get on Jenna's panties and denim shorts, but he struggled with her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never been with a girl, have you?\" Jenna laughed as she assisted him with the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no,\" Alex said, sounding somewhat dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm sure you'll find someone for you,\" Jenna assured him as he pulled her pink tank top over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel ridiculous,\" Alex said once he'd put on Jenna's shoes, which seemed to fit him just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My clothes look good on you,\" Jenna giggled. \"Now, come on, let's get back to the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair made their way back to the game where they were greeted with laughs, though some of the guys seemed disappointed that Jenna was now wearing less revealing clothing. Thankfully for Alex, most everyone was too drunk to give him too much crap for wearing Jenna's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce things settled down, Jenna took her spot on the couch and Alex sat down next to her, meaning it was now his turn. His dare ended up not being too horrible, only to take a shot of hot sauce. Jenna was impressed that Alex took it like a champ, downing the hot sauce like it was nothing, much to the disappointment of the jocks who would've liked to see a guy like him barf it up.</span></div></div>",

Jenna just rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna looked to her right. The guy sitting beside her in that direction, one of the guys on the men's basketball team, was totally drunk and he looked like a dumbass with his girlfriend's panties on his head as per his most recent dare. He made a gross kissy face back at Jenna as she looked him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gross</i>, Jenna thought, making a disgusted face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna looked to her right. Alex was sitting on that side. He seemed a bit more relaxed now after impressing on his dare. He really wasn't bad looking, if a bit out of place at the party. At worst, the inside of his mouth would taste like the hot sauce he had to chug for his dare. He was also still wearing her clothes. They really did look good on him, especially the way the tight denim shorts clung to his hips and showed off his skinny legs, which looked good on display, his light blonde hair making it look like he had smooth legs. Something about the thought of making out with a boy wearing  her clothes while wearing his clothes was kind of appearing to her for some reason. Maybe that was the alcohol talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it over, Jenna glanced at the shots lined up on the table. She <i>could </i>always take a shot.

It was a bit unexpected, but she started to really enjoy their kiss. She could taste the hot sauce on his lips but it only made the kiss feel that much more hot (literally). Jenna's heart was pounding, she hadn't felt like this anytime other than when she was running and reaching the peak of her run and feeling such a rush, it was the same with this boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenna looked at Alex, she noticed a bulge inside the tight shorts, she couldn't help but feel excited at it. It was like they'd already shared a part of them, as if wearing his clothes had somehow made her feel more comfortable, his jeans, shirt and even his boxers felt so warm against her during the kiss, it swept her up in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute had already passed but they didn't really pay much attention, their kiss continued as both of them seemed to be very much fine with it. The kiss ended up being twice as long as the dare required and everyone just looked at them shocked. Some of the girls were laughing and some of the jocks looked to be extremely jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sure was something.\" Alex said as he recomposed himself, adjusted the straps of the pink tank top and bra and adjusted his erect member inside the tight black denim shorts.<br>\r\n\"Looks like you enjoyed yourself.\" Jenna winked as adjusted the jeans and t-shirt she was wearing due to her swap with Alex.<br>\r\n\"I need to go to the bathroom real quick.\" Alex then said as he excused himself from the table.</span></div></div>",

Some people were impossible, and that was why Terry hated working the register. At least it was close to closing time and he would be home within the hour. \"Only thirty minutes to go,\" he mumbled to himself as he glanced at his watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sound too excited,\" a familiar female voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry glanced over to see Sidney, the co-worker who had the pleasure of closing with him tonight, leaning on the edge of the counter. Sidney was a 22 year old girl who started working at the store around the same time as Terry and she was just about the only one of his co-workers he could stand. Thought not the curviest girl, Sidney was super cute in that girl next store sort of way. She had shoulder length blonde hair, pulled back into a ponytail as usual, piercing blue eyes, an infectious smile, and at 5'9\" she was actually on the tall side for a girl. Terry would be lying to himself if he said he didn't have a bit of a crush on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like Ms. bossy is around to hear me,\" Terry said, referring to the store's manager, Sheila. At this hour Terry and Sidney were the only employees left in the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" Sidney said with a laugh. \"So, any plans tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry shrugged. \"Not really. I was just gonna go home and play video games or something. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither,\" Sidney said. \"I can't be bothered to go out tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that feeling,\" Terry replied. \"All the same, I can't wait to get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Sidney said. \"Let's hope no other customers show up and we can close on time for once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hope so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, that ended up being the case. After switching the sign from open to closed, Terry followed Sidney to the staff locker room to change into his regular clothes. For some stupid reason, store uniforms weren't allowed to leave the store, so employees had to change before and after work and keep their uniforms in their lockers.

As you can see, I laid out my casual clothes on the bench here, I want you to pick any piece you'd like.\" Sidney started to explain as she finally grabbed Terry's attention.<br>\r\n\"Like to what?\" Terry asked, feeling like he knew the answer already but asked anyway.<br>\r\n\"To wear silly, I've always wondered what it would be like to wear a guy's clothes and I thought you would be perfect.\" Sidney said excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I be perfect? Do I look that girly?\" Terry said jokingly trying to pry for answers.<br>\r\n\"Because you're fun to be around and I've gotten to know you quite well.\" Sidney slyly smirked.<br>\r\n\"What is that supposed to mean?\" Terry replied back as he walked over to her.<br>\r\n\"It means I have a special surprise for you, something I know you'll like a lot, but you have to play this game with me.\" Sidney explained further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else I should know about this game?\" Terry asked back.<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you more in time, for now all you need to do is pick up a piece of my outfit and I'll take the same piece from yours afterwards.\"Sidney finished explaining as she motioned over to the laid out clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, Terry looked at his own clothes he had laid down on the next bench over. He liked his outfit, even if it was a bit plain. They consisted of a dark red t-shirt, a worn sports jacket, some acid washed denim jeans and some worn white sneakers he had been wearing for a while. It was comfortable, which was his style, he didn't feel like he had to go along with the latest trends, not like he could afford to anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Terry looked over and inspected the clothes Sidney laid down, they consisted of a darker gray low cut t-shirt, small leather jacket, very tight looking dark blue high waisted denim skinny jeans and a pair of black ankle boots with a small heel. Sidney wasn't the most girly girl he had ever met, but she did like to dress fairly girly from time to time, luckily for Terry, she wasn't wearing a skirt today, but he still had to carefully consider his options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry walked over to the bench where she laid down her clothes and grabbed.....</span></div></div>",

He stepped into them and pulled them up, then secured them in place with his belt. Next, he picked up the shirt again and pulled it on. It was quite a bit tighter than his own shirt and it clung tight to his body. It would have looked good clinging to Sidney's figure, but Terry felt ridiculous wearing it. The low-cut neckline even showed off a bit of his flat male chest. It would look much better on a girl with cleavage to show off. It also was a bit shorter than a male t-shirt. As he leaned down to grab his shoes, Terry could feel it exposing a bit of his lower back, and if he were to lean back, he had a feeling it would expose his navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he put on his shoes, Terry glanced over at Sidney. She had since put on her tight jeans and they actually paired pretty well with his dark red t-shirt, which hung a bit loose on her. She looked really cute like that, especially once she put her small leather jacket on over it. As Sidney sat down to put her boots on, Terry stood up and put on his worn sports jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lookin' good,\" Sidney teased. \"Sure you want to cover up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not be seen like this,\" Terry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then,\" Sidney replied before sticking her tongue out at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, what happens next in this game of yours?\" Terry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we go home, silly,\" Sidney giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this? When will we swap back? Tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Sidney teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you follow the rules of the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I follow the rules if you haven't told me what they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to wear each other's shirts for a full day before we can trade again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, gotta run.

At least there was one upside to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry took a moment to grab a drink as he heard his phone receive a few text messages, checking them, they were from Sidney.<br>\r\n\"Hey dude, thought I'd send you these messages with the rest of the rules for our little game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what's up, whenever we swap a piece of clothing, we have to wear that the next day, no exceptions, but you knew that already. The thing is.... we can't swap them back, but you can wear your other clothes after that full day! But you won't get away playing it safe every day, because each day we will swap 1 additional piece, meaning we go from 1 to 2 to 3 etc. until we swap entire outfits every 2 days, due to us having to wear them a full day. Game ends when we have swapped everything, if one person runs out of clothes first, the other person will give that person all remaining clothes of their own they have and have to keep them for a little while before we can swap back out clothes, so you can have them back eventually!

Once they were done with that, the time finally came for their next swap. Aside from a clean pair of boxers and Sidney's shirt, the outfit Terry had worn today was more or less the same as the day before. Sidney's was pretty similar too.

For Sidney, this was mostly due to her being focused on something else. She walked over to Terry's clothes he laid down and looked over her options.<br>\r\n\"Don't drag this out, I know you want my underwear.\" Terry sighed he got ready to cover himself.<br>\r\n\"Your underwear is safe this time, I actually have something else in mind.\" Sidney grinned as she grabbed Terry's jeans and laid them with her own clothes, followed by grabbing her own skinny jeans and placing them with the rest of Terry's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, could be worse honestly.\" Terry said swallowing his pride and walked over to the bundle of clothes still left.<br>\r\n\"It won't be that bad, you'll look great in them.\" Sidney teased as she quickly pulled on Terry's shirt, which she still possessed followed by pulling on his comfortable acid washed denim jeans. Sidney looked to be really happy with this trade, she felt the pockets and moved around a bit, slowly falling away in thought as she mindlessly put on her shoes and jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry on the other hand, wasn't as excited to try his newly acquired jeans, so he started with the shirt he was already used to and still faintly smelled Sidney's scent, which helped him a bit. However after this it really was time to pull on the jeans, which took a bit of struggling, even though she was slightly taller, her legs overall were a bit more slender apart from her hips which were just about on par with his. Sidney eventually snapped out of thought and helped Terry get into her skinny jeans, which once she did, went smoothly. Terry didn't stop to admire his new outfit until he had put on his shoes and jacket as well, but once he did, the realization struck him. He was wearing Sidney's tight skinny jeans, but he kinda liked it. The shirt he shrugged off before because it was just a shirt, but the fit of the jeans were so different, but he enjoyed the tight feeling of the denim against his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have really nice legs Terry, my jeans look so hot on you.\" Sidney said as she did a circle around him.<br>\r\n\"You look good in mine too.\" Terry said slightly blushing, embarrassed, but uncomfortably comfortable.<br>\r\n\"Are you enjoying them?\" Sidney then asked, met by a pause from Terry. \"That's a yes then?\" Sidney then grinned as she stood in front of him, inspecting him closer.<br>\r\n\"What no! I mean, maybe a little, I don't know.\" Terry said panicking.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, they're just jeans.\" Sidney giggled.<br>\r\n\"Not just jeans, your jeans, girl's jeans.\" Terry said back nervously.<br>\r\n\"And they fit you, look good and are yours now anyway.\" Sidney giggled further as Terry just looked away uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, there was something else I wanted to talk to you about, you said you were starting to feel a real need to move out?\" Sidney changed the subject.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if my mom catches me like this, slowly trading every piece of clothing with you, I don't know how in the world to explain it and I can't really do anything of my own, it really sucks.\" Terry explained as he already shuddered at the thought of him mom asking him why in the world he was wearing woman's skinny jeans.<br>\r\n\"I may have a solution, if you want it.\" Sidney continued.<br>\r\n\"Any ideas are welcome.\" Terry replied a bit hopeful.<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking......\" Sidney then suggested.</span></div></div>",

It was however already a mess after a few days and really needed to clean up his laundry and such soon but he put it off for now since he still had some clean clothes on, existing out of some denim jeans and a t-shirt which was one of the few that didn't have stains on it right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to order a pizza today, he wasn't really in a mood to cook, the fridge was starting to look a bit empty as well and since it was raining immensely outside, he didn't really feel like going through it to get to the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, his doorbell rang. He opened up to see a girl standing there with a single pizza box. She was the delivery girl obviously and was wearing some black skinny jeans and a red t-shirt with a small jacket.

In the meantime, if you want a slice of pizza feel free.\" Terry smiled as he quickly grabbed a piece of paper.<br>\r\n\"Since you're so kind. I do have one question however, I don't really have a way to easily bring my clothes with me, would you mind if I left them here for now and I can pick them up later?\" Michelle asked.<br>\r\n\"I kind of already assumed that, because I thought since I have nothing else to wear, we'd trade clothes for now.\" Terry says a bit nervous while blushing.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too, just wanted to confirm.\" Michelle smiles back.<br>\r\n\"I'll quickly get undressed so you can get out of those as soon as possible.\" Terry says as he enters the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for him to take off his shoes, socks, jeans and shirt. He didn't want to waste any time after all. As he did however, he looked down at his underwear and an idea hit him. He initially took the piece of paper to write his phone number, which he still did, but now he also wrote a second not which he laid on top of his boxers, leaving him completely naked.<br>\r\nThe note said: \"If you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed a towel and left the bathroom. Michelle just finished eating a slice of her pizza and smiled as she quickly ran into the bathroom to get changed. Terry said down and ate some pizza before it turned cold as well. Terry was hungry so he comped down on his pizza quickly. Michelle ate a few slices but not too much and it was enough for him to satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he chomped down on one of the last slices, Michelle walked out of the bathroom. She was now completely dressed in Craig's clothes and they fit her decently well. Terry was a pretty skinny guy so his clothes weren't too ill fitting on her.<br>\r\n\"I left mine in there for you.\" Michelle smiled as she grabbed her things.<br>\r\n\"If you got time after whatever it is that you need to do now, give me a call.\" Terry smiled.<br>\r\n\"Sure, I got your number.\" She smiled as she closed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry finished his last slice as he went into the bathroom to get changed. He checked the notes he left first, which she added to.<br>\r\nBelow his own phone number, Michelle wrote hers and on the note that he left on top of his underwear he saw she added: \"Disgusting, but I like it!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry smiled as he looked over the pile of clothes Michelle left him. He could see her black skinny jeans, red t-shirt and even her jacket as well as her black simple underwear. He saw her sneakers and socks in the corner as well.<br>\r\nTerry was still a bit unsure about it all but he started by grabbing the black panties and slid them on. They stretched enough to fit comfortably, if he was a girl, but they did put a bit of stress on his balls and his butt. Then he put on the bra and after fiddling for a little bit, he manged to put them on. They were a bit of a tight fit around his chest, but it kind of worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, he grabbed Michelle's skinny jeans and stepped into them. They were definitely a size too small. It took a few tugs but he managed to squeeze his male legs inside and button up the jeans, even though he wasn't entirely comfortable, it was kind of kinky to him and that only made it tighter, but he kind of liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry then slipped on her t-shirt and left her jacket to the side for new, since he didn't feel like he should wear it inside but her shirt fit almost perfectly, which was nice. Her socks were fine but her shoes were once again a size or two too small. He could kind of force his feet in without damaging himself or the shoes too much but it wasn't entirely comfortable so he left those off for now as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothes were still a bit damp but he thought they'd dry as he wore them so he ignored it for now, not worried about getting a cold and finished his pizza.</span></div></div>",

She'd been saving up paychecks at her boring office job for months in order to embark on her latest adventure: a week long vacation on Flamingo Island, an exclusive tropical island resort. This was no typical resort however. Everyone staying for the week would be doing so in the role of someone else. Yes, each guest staying for the week was to be paired up with another guest at random and they would swap lives for the duration of their stay. What did that entail? They would be treated as each other, wear each other's clothes, experience activities their partners typically enjoyed, and more. It was going to be an interesting week for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out into the sun, Evelyn paused to push her designer sunglasses down over her vibrant green eyes. She then adjusted her bra strap out underneath her red tank top, straightened out her mid-thigh length white skirt, then brushed her beautiful auburn hair back out of her face before continuing on her way. Pulling her suitcase along with her, Evelyn soon arrived at resort's hotel, where she was greeted by a cheerful young woman behind the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Flamingo Island Resort,\" the woman said, a warm smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" Evelyn replied cheerfully. \"I'm here to check in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Let's get you taken care of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Evelyn was waiting in a room to meet her partner. Before heading to the rooms they booked, the guests at Flamingo Island were brought to private rooms to meet their partners so they could swap clothes, suitcases, IDs, and everything else they were trading for the week as well as learn a bit about each other in order to better get settled into each other's lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Evelyn got to meet her partner.

The boy nodded as he slowly walked towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was awkwardly walking over to sit next to her as Evelyn checked out her partner. He was a bit awkward looking in terms of reactions, but he didn't look too bad.

He was also wearing a white t-shirt with some brand's logo on it which Evelyn didn't recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was also kind of on the skinny side, but not as much as she expected to pair with his awkwardness. His legs showed a bit of muscle, though not that much as they were still skinny and hairy, making any muscle he did have only minimally visible. <br>\r\nHis arms looked a bit more well trained as their muscle was a bit more apparent, though covered by arm hair. <br>\r\nLastly, he had quite a soft face, it was completely devoid of facial hair and had bright blue eyes staring at her as he finally reached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uhhm, we seem to have been paired up together.\" The boy said awkwardly as he was slightly shaking as he sat down next to Evelyn.<br>\r\n\"Are you nervous?\" Evelyn asked as she sat closer to him.<br>\r\n\"No, of course not.\" The boy replied trying to sound proud, but failing hilariously.<br>\r\n\"Well, I am, I wasn't expecting to be swapping with a boy, but we do seem to be the same height, and possibly close to the same size, so I understand why they would pair us up.\" Evelyn started as the boy looked at her while slightly calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are nervous?\" He asked softly.<br>\r\n\"Yes of course I am, it's a big change, but I'm also excited.\" Evelyn admitted.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" The boy asked curiously.<br>\r\n\"I'll be living your life being treated as you, this is going to be scary, but amazing.\" She said smiling, causing the boy to start to warm up to her a little. \"Oh how rude, I never introduced myself properly. I am Evelyn and I'm a 30 year old grown woman.\" She finally said as she extended her hand.<br>\r\n\"I'm Kevin, 18 years old.\" He said as he shook Evelyn's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn spotted Kevin checking her out as well, but in this particular case, she didn't feel like it was a bad thing. She paid close attention to his reactions and could tell he was feeling very nervous about swapping with her. She wasn't wearing very masculine clothes and there was a considerable age difference, so she could understand his nervousness. Come to think of it, most of the clothes she packed were booty shorts, dresses, skirts, etc. She brought girly clothes that showed off a lot of her body due to the climate, she wasn't expecting a boy to wear them after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to start with?\" Kevin then asked as he looked over at Evelyn.<br>\r\n\".....\" Evelyn said </span></div></div>",

She became a mother at the age of 20 and the father of her children is no longer in the picture. She's generally a cool mom, but is strict when she needs to be. Sometimes her kids can be a lot to deal with and can try her patience, but she does care for them and has their best interests at heart. She's still quite good looking with wavy blonde hair and a decent figure and she tries to keep up with the latest fashions when she can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa (5'6\" 40 years old): A couples and family counselor who uses unorthodox methods. One of her favorite methods is to have her patients wear each other's clothes to better understand each other and sometimes has them trade lives. Another method she sometimes uses is hypnotism to alter how her patients behave. Sometimes she will even use both methods together to get patients to swap clothes and/or lives if they are unwilling to try. She's a somewhat stylish woman with dark brown hair and designer glasses and maintains a professional appearance at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris (5'7\" 19 years old): A somewhat nerdy college guy who enjoys video games, tabletop roleplaying games, and other nerdy pursuits. He's a bit shy and has some trouble bonding with people as a result, but he's looking to break out of his shell and make new friends who share his interests. He's a bit on the skinny side and lacks any athletic ability, but he's still decently attractive. He has short light brown hair and sharp blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney (5'7'' 21 years old): A girl who's into heavy metal music and believes in living in the moment. She likes to party and have a good time and has little patience for people she views as boring. As a result, she can be dismissive of most people outside of her friend groups. That said, she's a good friend and is very dependable. She's also quite attractive, has a great figure, and she has straight dark hair just past her shoulders. In terms of style, Britney generally wears tight-fitting pants and tops that show off her figure. She frequently wears tight jeans and leather pants and leather jackets, and from time to time skirts and other things that are a bit more feminine. She also has an affinity for boots and has many pairs in varying styles. She also plays the guitar.</span></div></div>",

She's quick to lash out when she doesn't get her way and the first to make a scene if she thinks she'll get an advantage out of it. She loves to hang out with her friends and dress to look hot, which mostly involves anything revealing enough to show skin, even though her mother doesn't always agree. She has wavy blonde hair like her mother, cut to shoulder length, and a great figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarissa (5'7\" 17 years old): Unlike her older sister, she hates to be around people in general and like to keep to herself. She can be kind of moody at times and is currently going through a goth phase. She shares some interests with her brother Quinton and actually gets along with him just fine, unless she's in a bad mood, in which case he can piss her off as much as anyone. She has long, straight black hair, wears heavy black eye makeup and dark colored clothes. She has a decent figure, but not as good as Vanessa's, not that she cares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinton (5'5\" 15 years old): The only boy in the family, and much like Clarissa he can moody at times and likes to keep to himself. He's into gaming and music and tries to avoid coming out his room when there's company as he hates being among lots of people. He has short black hair that gets wavy if it grows too long. He prefers a comfortable clothing style, but nothing with bright colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie (5'3\" 14 years old) The youngest member of the family. She's a girly girl like Vanessa, though not as extreme. She loves bright colors, especially pink, and usually wears shorts, skirts, or skinny jeans and girly tops. She likes pretty much everything and, much to Clarissa and Quinton's annoyance, wants to hang out all the time. She gets annoyed when she doesn't get what she wants. She has long, straight blonde hair and her figure is still developing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, how does our clothes swapping story start?</span></div></div>",

With four teenage children that often didn't get along, such calm in the house was hard to come by, especially in the summer when they weren't attending school every day. Jennifer always tried to make the most of these moments when she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was what she was doing now, at least it was ... the sudden sound of shouting in another part of the house interrupted her reading. Jennifer sighed and put down her book. This was the fifth time this week her kids had gotten into an argument and she was, quite frankly, not in the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst her oldest daughters Vanessa and Clarissa got into a petty argument. Then her son Quinton had called Vanessa a bitch after a disagreement and Vanessa, of course, made a scene. Just yesterday her youngest daughter Julie had got into separate arguments with Clarissa and Quinton. And now this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer couldn't quite tell who was arguing from where she was in the house. She could make out the voices of Quinton and at least one of the girls, but she didn't know for sure which. Whatever the case, Jennifer had had enough this week. It was time to take drastic measures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you kids get along?!\" Jennifer demanded as she stormed into the room where the argument was happening, not bother to determine who was arguing with who. \"If you can't learn to put yourselves in each other's shoes and come to an understanding, I'll have to make you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mom, she--\" Quinton started to say before Jennifer cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna hear it!\" Jennifer shouted. \"Enough is enough! You're not getting off easy this time! I've got a special punishment in store for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's kids looked back at her nervously. They hadn't seen their mother this mad before and were afraid of what punishment she might have in mind. Jennifer just shook her head. It was time for ___ to spend a little time in each other's shoes ... <i>literally</i>.</span></div></div>",

That means... underwear too doesn't it?\" Quinton said as he looked at his sister with fear in his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, yes. But let's get one thing clear, you better not ruin my outfit or I'll make you pay even more than mom could.\" Vanessa threatened as she safeguarded her clothes.<br>\r\n\"I promise to treat them as if they were my own.\" Quinton said back.<br>\r\n\"No, don't do that, treat them as priceless pieces of art you were graciously allowed to wear.\" Vanessa said, still annoyed.<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, I promise.\" Quinton said as he looked over his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa's outfit wasn't very surprising, she was wearing a cute yellow skirt which wasn't extremely short, but still reached above her knees as well as a light green tube top, showing off a lot of skin. She was wearing her new black ankle boots and some of her white socks, which were the only thing that wasn't too sexy looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa in turn also looked over her brother.<br>\r\nQuinton was currently dressed like he usually would be, he was wearing some slim fitting dark gray jeans with his favorite red shirt of his favorite game. He was also wearing some gray boxers, white socks and black sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do this then I guess.\" Vanessa sighed as she slowly wiggled out of her skirt and laid it down on the cabinet next to her. Quinton quickly nodded and started taking off his jeans and shirt and laid them down next to Vanessa's skirt, which were also quickly followed by her tube top, socks, ankle boots and finally her sexy thong and push-up bra.<br>\r\nQuinton took off the rest of his clothes as well, laying down his socks, sneakers and boxers as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me until I get dressed.\" Vanessa said as she forced her brother to wait and look into a corner.<br>\r\n\"Fine fine.\" Quinton obeyed not wanting to piss her off.<br>\r\nVanessa then reluctantly got started and pulled on Quinton's gray boxers, fitting comfortably, but were definitely not her style. She then proceeded to pull on his jeans, which were on the snug side due to her being a bit taller and more mature, but again, weren't really her style. The shirt she kind of liked on the one hand as he pulled it on, she liked the fit, but hated the design as she took a deep sigh, annoyed at her situation. She finished off by putting on Quinton's socks and sneakers and tapped him on his back to signal she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntent to avoid pissing her off, Quinton simply nodded as he walked over to the pile of clothes left behind. He started by pulling on the thong, which was really uncomfortable to wear as he felt his privates be constricted beyond anything he had felt before. Luckily, when it came to the bra, Vanessa decided to help him out as she secured the bra on his chest.<br>\r\nQuinton then grabbed the skirt which felt way too short for him, filling him with all kinds of uncomfortable feelings as he managed to pull them up over his hips. Then he put on the light green tube top, which felt really weird for him to pull on as Vanessa decided to help him out a little with that one as well. Lastly, he pulled on the white socks and Vanessa's black boots as he wobbled a bit while practicing to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newly swapped siblings then reluctantly walked out of the bathroom where their mom was waiting for them and nodded approvingly as they came out.<br>\r\n\"Good, now for the details of your punishment.\" She started \"....\"</span></div></div>",

He looked over his room and instantly got annoyed that all of his stuff in here was going to be unavailable to him for a little while. He wrapped the towel around him and left his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing the hallway, he ran into Clarissa, who seemed to be very upset.<br>\r\n\"Hey sis, you okay?\" Quinton asked.<br>\r\n\"No, why the hell would I be?\" She growled back.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't enjoy this any more than you do, but it was only a petty argument, can we bury that and just try and get through this together? We'll both need the support I think.\" Quinton said trying to cheer her up.<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right, sucks that that shit caused us to have to trade clothes and even our rooms.\" Clarissa seemingly appreciative of her brother's willingness to put their argument behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it could be worse, Imagine if one of us had to swap with Julie or Vanessa.\" Quinton said.<br>\r\n\"Fuck me that would be hell, don't let mom hear you say that.\" She said back.<br>\r\n\"We have a lot in common so I don't think it would be that bad for us.\" Quinton said.<br>\r\n\"Maybe not. After you get dressed, want to play some games together. To keep our minds off it?\" Clarissa proposed.<br>\r\n\"You read my mind.\" Quinton sighed out of relief.<br>\r\n\"Have fun getting dressed in my outfit.\" Clarissa teased.<br>\r\n\"Same to you.\" Quinton said back as they entered each other's rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is at least a bright spot.\" Quinton thought to himself as he thought about the conversation he just had.<br>\r\nThis positivity was quickly dragged down a bit however as he saw his sister's clothes on her chair, which he would have to put on now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot putting it off too much longer, Quinton took the black panties and bra and slid them on. They were actually quite soft and comfortable, it help that Clarissa was only a tiny bit taller than him so her clothes weren't too far off from his own size, the small difference they did have mostly just compensated for their difference in build. As soon as he was wearing his new underwear, Quinton grabbed the leggings and stepped into them, feeling their soft fabric being stretched over his legs as he put them on. Afterwards he picked up the black skirt and stepped into them, tightening them up with the studded belt, which was surprisingly comfortable and uncomfortable at the same time but not extremely unpleasant. Lastly, he pulled Clarissa's shirt over his head and stepped into her combat boots and looked at himself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't quite his style completely but as ridiculous as he looked, it wasn't that bad for him. Considering this was also likely one of the most feminine outfits his sister had, Quinton managed to shrug off the aspect of being forced to wear hers and all of a sudden it was a giant relief that at least he wasn't going to be in pain constantly while wearing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinton then made his way to his old room where his sister was already setting up his console so they could play fully dressed in his clothes.<br>\r\n\"Hey, they fit okay?\" She asked as he saw him enter.<br>\r\n\"Not what I expected you to say but yeah actually, they're not bad.\" Quinton said a bit surprised.<br>\r\n\"We can start making fun of each other but you're right, we need to support each other now.\" She explained.<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it. Do mine fit you okay?\" Quinton asked back.<br>\r\n\"They're comfortable.\" She smiled as they both sat down and fired up a game, enjoying their time together again, forgetting about the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were having fun, they suddenly hear....</span></div></div>",

He inspected them a bit more closely and found some clothes he wasn't looking forward to wearing. \"Her\" outfit for today started with pink panties and a small bra, which, just like before, only barely fit. A pink t-shirt with the text \"pretty girl\" laid on top and made Quinton a bit annoyed, but regardless of it's tightness and feminine text, it was actually comfortable. Lastly, he saw a black pleated skirt and tights taunting him, though he took a deep breath and pulled on the tights, mostly concealing his hairy legs, though they were a bit itchy because of it.

Lastly she pulled on the pink t-shirt and managed to pull it down to just about reach her belly button, but she kind of looked cute in her daughter's clothes all in all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinton on the other hand pulled on his mom's black bra and panties and comfortably put them on, after having some practice putting on Julie's before, though these were a lot more comfortable for him comparatively. He then proceeded to pull on her light blue skinny jeans, which even though being skinny and of a size smaller, were rather comfortable on his hips, but were still very tight on his waist and legs. Lastly, he pulled on his mom's blouse, feeling the soft fabric touch his skin as he straightened them and his new jeans out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We actually fit these quite well.\" Jennifer said as she nodded approvingly at their swap.<br>\r\n\"I guess we do.\" Quinton said nodding back.<br>\r\n\"Well, Mom, I think it's time Quinton and I went to school, I'll go get him.\" Jennifer then said smiling as she rushed over to Quinton's room to grab \"Quinton\".<br>\r\n\"Bye mom, see you after school!\" They both yelled as they grabbed their bags and rushed out of the door, leaving Quinton, in his mom's clothes, behind to live her life.</span></div></div>",

It read:<br>\r\n- Clean the house.<br>\r\n- Do the laundry.<br>\r\n- Do groceries.<br>\r\n- Prepare dinner.<br>\r\nThese were things she almost always did, but as Quinton had no experience cleaning the house, only knew how to cook basic things that his mom taught him and didn't know at all how to do laundry, the reality set in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to start with cleaning the house and searched for the vacuum cleaner and the mop, which he found fairly quickly. Vacuuming wasn't very difficult, though he wasn't as perfectionist as him mom. The same could be said for mopping the floor.<br>\r\nFinally also realizing he needed to do some more cleaning by hand in the kitchen and make the beds in everyone's rooms, he got more and more respect for his mom as he did all of her daily tasks, being much more time intensive than he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile making everyone's beds however he decided to also do the laundry and after reading the instructions managed to get the general idea of what to do.<br>\r\nAs he was doing the laundry, all of the hard work he had been doing all day managed to actually tire him out. He was however very grateful his mom's clothes were at least decently comfortable for him, or this would have been a nightmare, but instead, he started to get used to wearing his mom's clothes and definitely preferred them over those of his little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got the first batch of laundry into the washer, he sat down in the couch, both happy to be done with what he has done so far, but he was also only halfway done with his new motherly duties.<br>\r\nAfter taking a small well desired break....</span></div></div>",

She looked kind of scared by all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinton was currently dressed like he usually would be, he was wearing some slim fitting dark gray jeans with his favorite red shirt of his favorite game.

You can't do that!\" The kids all shouted in unison.<br>\r\n\"I can, you'll need to learn to respect each other, each of you follow me to the bathroom, anyone that doesn't take this punishment gets kicked out like I said before.\" Jennifer demanded as she guided everyone upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four of her kids whispered to each other, scared of what was about to happen but ultimately mutually decided to just take it at least for now, they'd never seen their mom so angry.<br>\r\n\"Quinton, I want you to go into the bathroom and take off all your clothes, grab a towel to cover yourself and come back out. Just to be clear, this includes your underwear.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\nQuinton quietly nodded and did as she asked, he went inside, stripped down, grabbed a towel and took his clothes out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer checked the pile of clothing and nodded in approval, noticing the outfit was complete. She gave a look at Vanessa and she instantly knew what she meant to say. Vanessa walked up to her mom and held out her hands. Her mom passed her the pile of clothes Quinton was wearing and she went inside of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking damn it.\" Vanessa cursed at herself as she started to strip out of her clothes. She didn't enjoy what was happening at all, but she'd never seen her mom like that, not ever before. She neatly stacked her clothes and laid them to the side as she turned her attention to the other pile of clothes, her new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started by pulling up her younger brother's boxers, which were snug due to their small size difference, but they felt rather comfortable. Deciding not to spend too much time on all of this, she quickly turned to grab Quinton's dark gray jeans and pulled them over her feminine hips, which didn't help much with the fit, but it was still fine as she also put on his favorite red shirt. Lastly she put on the socks and sneakers which surprisingly fit perfectly and quickly grabbed her pile of clothes and went back outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa gave her clothes to her mom who once again smiled and passed them over to the next in line, which was Clarissa. She just gave a dirty look as she grabbed the clothes and went inside as well.<br>\r\n\"Now I have to dress up like that slut, fuck this.\" Clarissa mumbled to herself as she pulled her clothes off and made a rather messy pile in the corner just throwing them there as she undressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClary then started by pulling on her sister's light blue panties and bra, the cup was a bit wide on her but other than that, she was the same size as her sister for the most part, however the thought of wearing her underwear was making her shudder. With much reluctance, she finally reached for yellow skirt and pulled them up as they fell to just above her ankles. She made the skirt swish a bit before squeezing herself into the green tube top, showing off a lot of her body, something she really disliked. After putting on the socks and boots, which felt different from her own combat boots, but surprisingly not in a bad way, she grabbed her messy pile of clothing and walked back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer siblings had to try their hardest not to laugh at the sight of her in Vanessa's clothing, she looked a lot more ridiculous than Vanessa in Quinton's after all. After another inspection of the pile, Julie quickly walked up to her mom and took the pile of clothing and went inside. She actually let out a smile as she undressed and threw her clothes all over the place and turned her attention to the pile of clothing she took with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie started by putting on the black panties and bra and jumped around as closed up the bra. Grabbing the ripped black skinny jeans, she easily slid them on as she adjusted them slightly to fit her frame slightly better. Putting on the fishnet shirt shirt proved slightly more difficult as she wasn't used to it, but ended up sliding into it just fine. The black tank top went on a bit easier luckily. Julie checked herself out a bit but was very disappointed as it had no bright or pink colors and put on the black socks and combat boots with an annoyed expression on her face. Once done, she ran around to gather all pieces of her clothing and ran out to give them to her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last check by mom and a massive grin appeared on her face.<br>\r\n\"Only one more to go, Quinton.\" She said as Quinton obediently took his little sister's clothes and walked back inside the bathroom, dropping the towel and taking a deep breath as he starting dressing up in Julie's outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly getting started, Quinton pulled on the pink panties and small bra as he squeezed them around his body. He felt extremely uncomfortable wearing his little sister's underwear, but he pushed through as he grabbed the small pink shorts and stepped into them. The shorts were tight, as they were supposed to and were shorter than Vanessa's skirt even, which was saying something, but eventually, he closed them up and adjusted them to fit a little better. Turning his attention to to the white tank top, he easily pulled it over his head as he felt the comfortable fabric against his chest, but the straps were digging into his shoulders as well as the bra straps. Finishing up he put on the ankle high white socks and just barely squeezed his feet into her small white and pink sneakers and mustered up all his courage to walk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at his sisters and everyone looked ridiculous in each other's outfits.<br>\r\n\"I'm going downstairs now, remember you swapped rooms too. I don't want to hear you fight or no dinner got that?\" Their mom said as the siblings nodded and looked at each other as if asking what to do.</span></div></div>",

He was a young man of age 20 by the name of Alex dealing with some depression issues.  After talking with him for a bit, Melissa had determined that he would be a perfect candidate for her special treatment plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the previous few therapy sessions, Melissa had worked out with Alex the main issues that had led to his depression as well as some that were exacerbating it. A stressful college schedule and struggles to make friendships and romantic relationships had been the main causes, but Alex had picked up a few bad habits that certainly weren't helping. So far, Alex was having trouble breaking out of his funk he was in\u2026 Which was why Melissa was about to propose a different approach to treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know what might help you,\" Melissa said. \"You need an extra little push to help you kick those bad habits and I think hypnosis could help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hypnosis?\" Alex asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, hypnosis,\" Melissa replied. \"I can put you in a hypnotic trance where I can plant suggestions that will give you a subtle aversion to doing the things you're trying to stop doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can work? I thought that was just stuff made up for movies and TV.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, it doesn't work quite like they make you believe in pop culture, but it does help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was of the entire truth, of course. Melissa had figured out a way to hypnotize people just like in pop culture. She was going to help Alex to kick his bad habits with hypnosis, but she had a little extra something in mind. She felt that his relationship issues stem from not understanding women well enough, and she had a little plant to help him with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try it,\" Alex said.\"At this point, I'm ready to try anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Melissa said. \"Let's begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Melissa had her patient in a hypnotic state, and she planted the suggestions that would remove his bad habits. Now it was time for the extra suggestion. Alex, of course, wouldn't remember anything that happened in this state he was in, so he would be unaware of the extra suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile on her face, Melissa planted the suggestion in Alex's mind to\u2026 </span></div></div>",

You will want this so badly in fact that you have to ask her no matter what happens. Now as soon as I snap my fingers, you will wake up and these suggestions will all take effect.\" Melissa planted the suggestions and snapped her fingers afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" Melissa asked her patient as he opened his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Good actually, my mind feels a lot clearer, you're a miracle worker!\" Alex said excited as he tried to work out all the changes to his mind.<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear, I made sure your habits of procrastination and indecisiveness are subdued, but it will still be up to you to keep it that way.\" Melissa explained.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Alex asked curiously.<br>\r\n\"I can only take them away with my hypnosis, or at least help them be subdued, but I can't guarantee you'll never get it back unless you keep working hard yourself.\" She smiled warmly.<br>\r\n\"Well, regardless, you helped me now and I'm sure I'll be able to keep them away with your help, we still have some sessions left don't we?\" Alex replied as he looked at his therapist.<br>\r\n\"We do, don't worry, there are still more issued to work out, but this is a good place to start I think.\" Melissa said as she observed to see if her last suggestion worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, Alex started to look at Melissa in a very different way as he was looking her over. She was dressed professionally in a black skirt suit made up of a nice black skirt and blazer with a white blouse underneath as well as a pair of stylish black pumps on her feet. The designer glasses on her face made her look even more professional as he started feeling something unfamiliar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at himself, he was wearing his comfortable gray slacks and worn sneakers with a black sweatshirt he usually wore at home whenever he was feeling down, but he wasn't anymore. The more he looked at Melissa, the more he started to crave something he wasn't used to, but thought it might be because his mind was much more clear now that he was suddenly thinking this way. As he admired Melissa's skirt suit, he realized, he had the massive urge to swap clothes with her, it wasn't like he was into wearing girl clothes, but for some reason, swapping clothes with her seemed like the most amazing thing to do and he couldn't resist any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa, I have a rather strange question for you.\" Alex started asking.<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Melissa asked, acting curious knowing full well what he was going to ask.<br>\r\n\"I know it's a bit weird, especially since I am a patient, but I really, really want to swap clothes with you, is there any chance you can do that with me?\" Alex asked, being happy he managed to ask without any issues, he'd never have been able to do that before the hypnosis.<br>\r\n\"That is a strange suggestion.\" Melissa said back as she put up a thinking face.<br>\r\n\"I know, it's just, I don't know, I want to really badly and I suspect it may be why I was feeling so depressed.\" Alex admitted.<br>\r\n\"It won't be the only reason, but it might be one of them I agree.

Her socks and pumps had already appeared on there as well as Alex's slacks, sweatshirt, socks, sneakers and of course like mentioned before, his underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was about the grab his boxers back but Melissa grabbed a little more quickly and they disappeared on her side of the barrier. This made Alex smile, because he assumed it meant Melissa was agreeing to his suggestion, this turned out to be a pretty good guess as seconds after, Melissa put her black panties and bra out for him to grab and he immediately did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa was the first to get dressed quickly in Alex's clothes. She easily put on his boxers right before she gave him her own underwear and didn't take long to get fully dressed. She started by grabbing Alex's slacks and very easily pulled them up. While she didn't differ much in build with Alex due to him being fairly skinny, they did differ a bit in height, though not too much, but enough for the slacks to fall a little lower than normal, causing Melissa to roll them up a little bit at the bottom. She then grabbed his sweatshirt and pulled it over her head, which fit pretty comfortably actually, it was still warm from him wearing it and it hugged her loosely as the bottom reached a little bit lower once again. She finished putting on the socks and worn sneakers and inspected her new outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Melissa was getting dressed, Alex was getting dressed as well, however, he was a bit slower than her. Melissa had finished getting dressed and was admiring her new outfit by the time Alex had finally figured out how to properly put on her bra, something he will get plenty of practice with in the future, even if he doesn't realize it yet. Once dressed in the tight panties and bra combo, he grabbed the black skirt and stepped into them. The skirt was tight, but it fit him well, the only catch being they reached a little above his knees while for Melissa they just about reached them, but this didn't make him dislike them, he actually was enjoying this. He quickly went on to grab the blouse and fit it comfortably on his torso, though very slightly stretched out to accommodate for his male torso. Finally almost done, he squeezed himself into the blazer and closed the button and straightened it out. Lastly, he finished by putting on the stylish black pumps and wobbled a bit as he got used to walking on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down again for a little while we finish up our session okay?\" Melissa suggested with a warm smile as she restored the room to it's previous state.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Alex said as he sat down with his new outfit.<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" Melissa asked as she sat down as well, seeing Alex cross his legs to make sure she can't look up the skirt.</span></div></div>",

She would have been lying if she said that her methods didn't turn her on a bit. Though Alex believed this had all been his own idea, Melissa was no stranger to such occurrences. This wasn't the first time she'd swapped clothes with a patient and it likely wouldn't be the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's staff didn't notice anything odd either. That was because she'd hypnotized them into not finding it odd that her patients swapped clothes at her therapy sessions. They wouldn't find it strange that she was now wearing Alex's clothes either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday had been a great success.

He started by looking at her sweater and all he could think about was how warm and comfortable it would feel, eying down the jeans made him imagine how the tight jeans would feel against his legs, moving further down he also wondered how the shoes would fit and how they would compare to his and lastly, even though he couldn't see it, he wondered what kind of underwear she was wearing, but wanted to wear them more than he wanted to see her in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the desire to swap with Mei became stronger and stronger, he couldn't take it anymore and walked up to her.<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're Mei right?\" Alex said awkwardly.<br>\r\n\"Hey, uhhm, yeah that's me.\" Mei said awkwardly blushing as Alex startled her.<br>\r\n\"There is something I want to ask you, but it is a bit weird.\" Alex said stumbling on his words.<br>\r\n\"What is it? People seem to think I am weird too.\" Mei responded, trying to decide if she should tell him of her feelings or not.<br>\r\n\"I uhhm, kind of couldn't look away when I spotted you and uhhm, I kind of have this urge to want to uhhm, swap clothes.\" Alex said really softly, avoiding anyone else hearing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah weird is right.\" Mei said as she shut down her laptop.<br>\r\n\"Sorry I shouldn't have asked.\" Alex said embarrassed as he wanted to walk away.<br>\r\n\"But I did say I was also weird.\" Mei said grabbing his arm.<br>\r\n\"Does that mean?\" Alex asked.<br>\r\n\"We'll do it, but only on one condition.\" Mei declared.<br>\r\n\"Anything.\" Alex said.<br>\r\n\"You become my boyfriend.\" Mei demanded.<br>\r\n\"As long as we're swapping clothes, I'll do it for sure.\" Alex agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei squealed with glee and dragged Alex upstairs, towards her room and got ready to swap clothes with her new boyfriend.<br>\r\nShe went into her bathroom and shut the door, though not long after, she came back out with just a towel wrapped around her.<br>\r\n\"Your new clothes are ready for you, babe.\" Mei said as she planted a kiss on Alex's lips.<br>\r\n\"Alex didn't waste much time getting in however, seeing the pile of Mei's clothes on the sink waiting for him.<br>\r\nHe locked the door and quickly stripped out of his own clothes, getting ready to try on Mei's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, he grabbed Mei's blue panties from the pile and pulled them on, quickly followed by the matching bra, which he was getting better at putting on.<br>\r\nOnce his new underwear was secured, tightly, but comfortably, he moved on to grab Mei's jeans. The jeans were really tight, but after slowly pulling them on and struggling slightly with the zipper and button, he managed to put on Mei's jeans and he really enjoyed them, even though they were basically crushing his privates. Shifting focus to the sweater, Alex pulled the comfortable warm sweater over top his head and neatly covered the bra and even the top of the jeans, also covering his bulge.<br>\r\nLastly, Alex grabbed Mei's runners and slipped them on, which were a size too small at least, but managed to squeeze his feet into them, though not extremely comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex admired his new outfit, really enjoying the feeling of the extremely tight jeans and soft sweater against his body.<br>\r\nMei was waiting outside and blushed as she saw her boyfriend walk out out.<br>\r\n\"You look really cute in my clothes.\" Mei blushed.<br>\r\n\"Glad you think so, I love them, mine are waiting for you too in there.\" Alex smiled as he returned another kiss on Mei's lips and saw her enter the room, getting ready to change into his clothes.</span></div></div>",

Whitney, 29, and her husband Casey, 28, had recently come to Melissa for marriage counseling and today was their first session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well our marriage has been rather strained lately,\" Whitney explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an understatement,\" Casey said, eliciting an annoyed glance from his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Whitney continued. \"We're both still committed to working things out ... we just need a bit of help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa smiled. \"Well you've come to the right woman. Now, how about you tell me a bit about yourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany minutes later, Melissa had a clear picture of her new clients. Both Whitney and Casey were college educated with so far successful business careers. However, those careers meant they didn't have much time for each other. Melissa suspected that's was the source of tension in their relationship, but there wasn't a simple fix for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa looked over at Whitney. She was a relatively attractive blonde currently wearing a stylish floral-print blouse, a pair of skinny-fit jeans that complimented her decent figure, and a pair of black boots with a 2-inch heel. Casey wasn't bad looking either. Looking him over, Melissa determined he was a decently handsome dark-haired man. His outfit consisted of a red button-down shirt, a pair of comfy black jeans, and a pair of work boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems to me that you two simply need to find more common ground with each other, discover more mutual interests, and make the most of your time together,\" Melissa finally addressed her clients. \"With your busy careers you aren't spending enough time together. You both want to do that, but you also want to explore your own interests as well. The problem is neither of you is putting enough effort into understanding the other's interests. That's where I come in. I think I have just the treatment plan in mind.\"</span></div></div>",

Whitney pulled on his boxers in the meantime and helped him put on the bra afterwards, which he obviously needed help with. Next, while Whitney pulled on Casey's comfortable black jeans, he squeezed himself into his wife's skinny jeans, which gave him a small amount of issue. It took a few good tugs to pull them up far enough and some flexibility to button them up and close the zipper as his harder member was getting in the way a bit. Moving on, Casey dressed himself in Whitney's flora-print blouse, while she dressed in his red button-down shirt. Their shirt sizes were fairly similar so they fit quite comfortably. They finished up with each other's boots, which were slightly different in two ways. For one, Whitney's boots fit quite snugly on Casey's feet while his were slightly more loose on her. Lastly, Whitley's boots had a 2 inch heel, so Casey now had to deal with learning to walk with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look cute.\" Whitney laughed as she looked as her husband.<br>\r\n\"They're tight, mine look cute on you too though.\" Casey admitted as he adjusted the bulge inside the skinny jeans.<br>\r\n\"I might have to suggest we keep these permanently.\" Whitley giggled as she walked around in her new outfit.<br>\r\n\"I hope not!\" Casey said with some fear in his voice.<br>\r\n\"It was only a joke, maybe.\" Whitney winked as she put her hand on Casey's waist.<br>\r\n\"This is an unusual, but really exciting experience at the very least.\" Casey admitted as he kissed his wife on the lips.<br>\r\n\"We should have swapped clothes much sooner, this is amazing.\" Whitney laughed.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you're happy not having to deal with these tight jeans.\" Casey said as she pulled on them.<br>\r\n\"Oh if you're already annoyed at that, I can't wait to see you wearing my suit.\" Whitney grinned as Casey's face went black as he though about his wife's skirt suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, Melissa walked back into the room and motioned for the couple to sit down.<br>\r\n\"Everything go well?\" She asked as the couple nodded.<br>\r\n\"I'm enjoying this so far.\" Whitney smiled as Casey nodded softly.<br>\r\n\"You okay Casey?\" Melissa asked him.<br>\r\n\"Just takes a bit of getting used to is all.\" He said as his wife comforted him by grabbing his hand.<br>\r\n\"Sharing an experience like this will do you good, but this is only the start, next you will need to get used to each other's lives, or your new lives I should say.\"</span></div></div>",

You beat me to it!\" Lucy said looking at her younger sister with shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy couldn't believe what she was seeing. There in her silk floral print chemise stood her 12 year old sister. Complete with light make up and an authorized stance. Wendy placed one of her delicate hands on her hip. \"Hahaha well what do you think?\" She asked as she modeled her new look. \"I feel very pretty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you certainly look grown up. It's just barely too big, and you have some development still up on top.\" Lucy looked her little sister over as both were really amazed how the other looked. \"Not bad Wendy but lets see....\" Lucy lifted up the light silk chemise to confirm. \".... oh good! You have on my panties as well!\" She laughed as she smiled at her sister. They didn't match the chemise too well, but they were a silky sexy pair. The bright blue clashed with the white and pink flowers on the gown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you wearing mine?\" Wendy asked her sister as she made her way to the couch. When Wendy sat down however she still sat like a 12 year old. Her new bright blue panties flashed in front of her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am silly, but grown women don't don't flash their panties, even if they are wearing their sisters.\" Lucy said as she joined her on the couch. She mimicked Wendy's childish position but since she was in 12 year old girl pajama pants nothing was showing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy instructed Wendy how to sit more lady like. \"Wow this is fun.\" Wendy asked she got in her new position. \"Can we spend the night this way?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n......</span></div></div>",

As she sat back down she remembered to gracefully sit and tuck her legs together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh do I have to?\" Lucy whined with a smile on her face. She then hung her head and went back to folding her little sisters clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy happily took the TV remote and combed through the channels. She felt compelled to watch her favorite Disney shows of princesses and fairy tales. Before she found one however, she happened to glance down at both what she wore and how she sat. \"I'm dressed too old for stuff like that.\" She mumbled softly. After some debate she settled on watching an adult reality show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy had finished folding her sisters clothes and put them away. As she came down the stairs she recognized the words from one of her favorite shows. \"That is rather adult for you Wendy. Do you even know what's happening?\" She questioned once finally setting eyes on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little sneak, did you set out your school uniform for tomorrow?\" Wendy asked with some some authority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy arched up her eyebrow and questioned, \"MY school uniform? Well I would have but it is wrinkled and IM too young to work a hot iron.\" Feeling that she won the argument she sat down in her new childish position. \"If you are going to dress as me, I guess you better act as me!\" Lucy teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Wendy said answering the challenge. She gracefully got up and headed back to her room. When she came back down she had her school uniform in hand. Lucy was amazed as she expertly began ironing like a pro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that answers that.\" Lucy said satisfied she had won. She then stood up and returned to the couch with a tiny bag full of her nail polish. Once all the colors were laid out and the tools were organized she started to lightly hum.

Will you be ok by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy laughed at the joke. Just because she was in her little sisters panties, didn't mean she needed to be looked after like her. \"I'll be fine, just don't take so long.\" Lucy told her younger sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in her sister's room Wendy jumped with joy. The youg girl rushed to her sisters closet and looked at all of her big girl clothes. She had a typical woman's wardrobe. There were several coctail dresses and a few ball gowns that were used as bridesmaid's dresses. Wendy noticed a whole section of jeans and other tight clothes. There were shorts, and skirts. A few bathing suits hung from hooks. In the back there was a dresser which held Lucy's intimate clothing and lingerie. All of her clothes looked like fun, but Wendy wanted to be an adult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is perfect!\" Wendy said pulling out a nice skirt suit. It was a charcoal gray pencil skirt with a matching blazer. She also found a simple light blue blouse and silk camisole on the hanger next to it. After placing her sisters adult clothes on the bed, Wendy quickly removed her sister's nightie and sliky panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into her sisters intimate drawers, she pulled out a pair of tan pantyhose and full back black and white floral panties. Just like before, they were still too big for her but not by much. Loose, but not hanging off, but she needed to grow more into the matching bra she now wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter completing the outfit laided out on the bed, Wendy then moved to the jewelry box on the dresser. \"Wow so sparkly\" She said as she picked up a necklace. All she needed were her sisters heels downstairs and she'd be complete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy couldn't wait to show her sister her new look. She pulled up her new pantyhose as the were starting to slide. Just before she walked down stairs, she heard a knock on the front door....</span></div></div>",

Lucy felt a bit embarrassed by acting so immature but that didn\u2019t out way how happy it made her to see Wendy smile at her.

Lauren wonders if his muddy boots are more comfortable than her heels....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica 5'8 (Short blond haired 42) A very attractive mother of two, Veronica is bored with her current role. She's stuck as one of the older women at a friend's wedding. She wears a light blue and white floral print dress with nude nylons and heels. Her curiosity increases and her inhibitions decrease as she drinks her wine. Perhaps with too much to drink she spots Freddie, a young man of 25 with no date. She envys his suit, as it looks far more comfortable than what she's dressed in. Maybe if she turns her charm on she can see what's under it, or even better, WEAR whats under it...</span></div></div>",

The sun shined brightly on her motherly face as she walked to her closet. Her silky nightgown flowed as she moved through her closet and pulled out a nice dress. It was a purple satin form fitted dress that stopped right at the knee. Decorated with white delicate flowers, it hugged Veronica's curves nicely. Still, as a 42 you old woman, she brought out her tummy tuck nude pantyhose and beige panties that were silky with lace trim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally most women would be excited or at least happy to wear something so feminine but not Veronica. She was dressing for the 4th wedding of the month. It was honestly starting to annoy her. Having never found her true love, she felt awkward at these events. They were fun to a point but she always found herself alone in the end. This being the 4th recent wedding, she was tired of it. Not to mention all the work that went into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing her dress was one thing, but then came the support hose, the bra, the panties. Did they need to be sexy? Did they need to be practical? What about the shoes, and the jewelry and all her accessories. Granted she loved them all, but today she was simply over it. \"I gotta shake things up somehow.\" She said as she pulled on her bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed she did a quick survey or her hotel room and headed for the lobby. Luckily this wedding did not require much more than her presence. She played significant roles in the 3 earlier weddings so today she was just happy to be a spectator. \"11:00?! It took me 4 hours to get ready for this dam thing. Men only need an hour max!\" Veronica was overdone at this point and her frustration grew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really in a talking mood she found her way to the outside garden where most of the guests were arriving. There were all the women her age making cheap meaningless conversations over the same boring nonsense. Whose earnings were better. Whose dress was more expensive, blah blah blah. Literally any conversation would be better to have than that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her point of desperation she noticed....</span></div></div>",

Tim has a habit of going to a club getting hammered and leaving with whatever girl would sleep with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe usually Liked to try and leave clubs as quickly as possible due to his appearance as Tim has quite a unique problem of people mistaking him for a girl. This was because of his Slender figure and height of 5\u20195. It didn\u2019t help that he also had quite a feminine face. This usually led him into quite a few awkward situations, with the worst one being when a big strong guy mistakes him for his girlfriend and french kissed him, and punched him in the face when he realised he was a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim then looked around the room he was in and realised that he had went to girl he slept with\u2019s house, it wasn\u2019t the first time this had happened but he couldn\u2019t see the girl he slept with anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Brittney and she wasn\u2019t the usual type of girl that he would go for. She was the same height as him and had blonde hair and an hourglass figure. She wore a tight pink dress and was bossy, sassy and air headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tim got up he realised he was completely naked he also got a good look at the room he was in. It was all pink and filled to the brim with cosmetic products wardrobes and a vanity table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet for all the stuff in her room, Tim could not find the one thing he needed...his clothes, he searched all over the room praying he had some luck, even searching her trash can to see if she put them in there like his ex girlfriend did but it was all in vein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was starting to panic now, he couldn\u2019t find his phone his wallet or his keys. Not only that but at this rate he was going to be late for an important job interview at a salon, Tim hated girly stuff like that but he needed the money and new how to put on makeup thanks to his Ex teaching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim then saw the note that Brittney had left in the vanity mirror ripping it off and beginning to read it to gain some understanding of what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Hi Tim, or Jim or whatever you\u2019re name was, I\u2019m so glad you let me talk you into letting me pick out an outfit for you to wear to the interview at the Salon, trust me you\u2019re going to look super pretty and stylish and they\u2019ll hire you just because of how pretty you\u2019ll look. Who knows maybe they\u2019ll even let you be one if they\u2019re models. But in case you don\u2019t want to wear something pretty and pink I\u2019ve got your ugly ratty clothes with me, I\u2019ll probably be at the shopping mall if you want them back for some reason. Anyway I\u2019ll see you later Cutie and I hope your job thingy goes well - Love Brittney p.s. if you come for you\u2019re old clothes and you\u2019re other stuff you\u2019ll only get them if you wear the pretty outfit I picked out for you\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat stupid Bitch\u201d Murmured Tim as he realised what had happened. While drunk he must of told her about how him and his ex swapped clothes and how he had a big interview at a Salon, and Britney must have talked  his drunk ass  into letting  her choose what he wears too it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim slapped himself in the face for being so stupid he knew that once this was over he probably want going to drink for a while. He then went to see what clothes Brittney left for him and prayed they were at least subtle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim\u2019s jaw dropped when he saw what Brittney had chosen for him to wear for the interview. And it was not subtle. Brittney had left a tight white women\u2019s business shirt for him, a Bright pink blazer and tight Mini skirt combo, bright Pink stilettos, a full set of pink lingerie, a Purse filed with cosmetics and A bright blond wig that was styled to make him look more Sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim wanted to scream he realised that he was going to have to go out looking like a Business Bimbo. It was the most humiliating thing possible for him. But he had no choice but to wear all of it if he wanted his stuff back from Brittney.including that stupid Blonde wig.  But then he thought about what other clothes Brittney had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she had something more causal laying about that wouldn\u2019t be too embarrassing to wear like a pink t shirt and jean shorts. But that Would also mean he\u2019d lose his phone, his wallet, and his house keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim spent a minute trying to work out what to do and decided to.....</span></div></div>",

Lindsey was very fast with taking off her dress and heels and unhooked her bra, then dropped her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim then moved over to his secretary's pile of clothes and stepping into the black panties. They had a small red lace on the edges and were very tight on his crotch.

He then put the white lingerie of Stacy, a green T-shirt and a bleu jean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter packing everything he drove to the appartement of Stacy Brooks. She was waiting for him, at the door of the building, she was in a floral summer dress, with a small pink and white purse and the same pair of white heels that last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00ab Hey mister Smith ! Come here ! come here ! \u00bb she said to Tim grabbing his arms and guiding him to the elevator. \u00ab Did you find my building easily ? Are you ok with doing it again so soon ? \u00bb asked Stacy, \u00ab Well I didn\u2019t have any plan for the weekend so it\u2019s alright and also I have to get back my boxer from you so I\u2019m here \u00bb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy nodded at Tim's answer and asked if he was ok exchanging in the elevator. Firstly Tim said no but Stacy insisted and they started removing their clothes. Tim noticed that Miss Brook was still wearing his boxer and she giggled seeing that Tim was wearing her fine lacy lingerie. Stacy quickly grabbed the green T-shirt and the jean and put them on, then she turned to Tim and passed him the floral dress over his head. She got a ribbon hair band from her purse and did a quick pixie hairstyle to Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator stopped and got some other passengers, they were two sisters, a little one maybe 11 or 12 and an older one looking like she was 21. First they didn\u2019t pay any attention to Tim and Stacy. Tim was blushing hard and looking at the floor, he hopped that they wouldn't notice anything even if he was still in sport shoes and not in heels, while he was thinking of the situation Stacy was just giggling a lot looking at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger sister looked at Tim and asked,\u00ab You look very good miss, I love your dress but why aren\u2019t you in heels like the mister here? \u00bb pointing at Stacy. Stacy looked at you while laughing and answered \u00ab Well you see we exchanged shoes because she had pain walking with them.'' The little girl looked at them both and giggled a bit before her sister said \u00ab Let\u2019s go Wendy it\u2019s our stop \u00bb and she cheerfully answered \u00ab Alright Lucy ! \u00bb before both of them got off the elevator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust after that they just arrived at Stacy appartement, a really big appartement at the top of the building. Miss Brook asked for Tim shoes and like this their swap was complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00ab Well let\u2019s play now, you will be Stacy Brook and I\u2019ll be Tim Smith, understood ? \u00bb said Stacy with authority, Tim just blushed and nodded without saying anything <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had nobody to really confide in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drove around town, simply looking at various buildings and people watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever he still didn't really feel satisfied. And to be honest: he also was feeling a bit horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Tim had this thing. A sort of fetish. He liked to switch clothes with people. Especially people of the opposite sex. He used to do it with his girlfriend but now... Well... Now he needed someone new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps someone old?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drove to a place he knew. A sort of empty lot. And there he saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a prostitute. And honestly before meeting his girlfriend, he and Shannon had done this before. Swapped clothes. Though they did a bit more as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim pulled up beside her and rolled her window down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey Shan.\" He muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at him. There was a part of her that THOUGHT she recognized him but... Then again maybe not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know each other, stud?\" She purred<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I've actually been here with you before. A couple years ago. We uh.... Traded clothes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes lit up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! I forgot about you! Well, what strikes your fancy today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim paused, a bit of a snag in his throat. It was always hard to discuss fetishes. Especially to strangers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you be willing to... Do it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon smirked, then walked around to the other side of the car and got in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was unsure of himself at first. But he slowly began to unbutton his suit jacket and pull off his tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon, meanwhile, removed her corset, revealing her black lace bra underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim sat the jacket and tie in his lap as he started unbuttoning his undershirt. Revealing his chest with the few Tufts of hair on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon, meanwhile, went to work on her bra. Quickly and easily unclasping the back and letting her c-cup breasts fall free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim then moved on to his pants. Unbuckling his belt and sliding them down to his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon followed suit, sliding her skirt down to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim moved on to his shoes and socks. Unlacing them, then pulling both shoe and sock off in one clean motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon would take a bit longer. She took off her heels. But removing the black stockings on her legs was a bit harder than mere socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the two were in nothing but underwear. Tim in boxers, Shannon in lingerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two simultaneously slid them off as both sat naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey piled their clothes up and traded them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon began by sliding the boxers on. Whereas Tim put the lingerie panties and bra on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't fit. The boxers were very big on Shannon, and the lingerie was squeezing Tim pretty tightly. Even so, this is what he wanted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon then threw on the suit pants and belt, while Tim slid the leather skirt up to his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon started buttoning up the undershirt, while Tim took his time getting the stockings on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then put on the suit jacket and tie; nearly done. And Tim put on the corset: barely able to breathe with it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the two threw on each other's shoes and the swap was complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... We gonna... You know\" Shannon purred<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Come on. Back seat...\" Tim said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stepped out, the doors of the car locked. Shannon slid over to the driver's side seat and cracked the window slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remembered you.... I seem to recall you building quite the bill with me then not paying\" she hissed \"Let's call this my payment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon sped off in his car, with his clothes. Leaving Tim alone in a parking lot, wearing a female prostitutes clothes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would he do?!</span></div></div>",

Shannon paid for the whiskey with one card and realized that until the owner of their cards blocked them she could withdraw and spend as much money as she wanted. already standing by her  car Shannon,  leaned back on the hood and sipped whiskey. even after thinking about it for a while she didn't understand why she was so aggressive and impulsive with was  Tim, she wanted to get back at him and think she went a little too far. but at the same time this exchange of clothes pushed her to a new idea to exchange roles with him. \" and who knows, I think I'll make become a  new Tim \" she said getting back in the car.

Before she had to work in the embarrassing \u201cadult\u201d costume store, she was once an office worker with a bright future. Her boss thought she would become the youngest company executive easily, and it helped that everyone in the office supported her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the one person she always appreciated support from the most was her ex boyfriend and ex coworker Tim. He had lovely blonde hair, and a great body. And she knew that Tim loved her. And who would blame him, when she is a smoking hot red head with a perfect hourglass figure with the clothes to show it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at that moment she loved Tim too, he was her \u2018little pretty boy\u2019 and the thing she loved about him especially was how kinky he was. Courtney loved the fact that Tim was into role playing and his nice body made it fun to dress him up in some of her clothes and act like her or dress up for him. But unfortunately for Courtney all that kinky fun they were having was about to become bitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night a security caught Tim and her messing around in the bosses office, and what Tim did to Courtney she will never forgive him for. He lied about the situation and made Courtney out to be some mad sex crazy maniac who forced her to wear women\u2019s panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Courtney lost everything she worked hard for with the company, and now Tim got to become the youngest Executive in the company\u2019s history, while she sold slutty maid costumes to perverts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I\u2019ll get that smug bastard one day\u2019 was the one thought that went through Courtney\u2019s head working there as the worst part of the whole thing was that she still talked to Tim regularly, as Tim now had a lot of money and time to spend with other women and just loved to make them role play in slutty maid costumes and slutty secretary ensembles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even though she stared daggers at him for the first few months when he would visit, eventually she learned to let it go and be nice to him, while she planned her perfect revenge while Tim grew more egotistical and naive of the troubles that were coming his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd fortunately for Courtney and unfortunately for Tim, that day is today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tim entered Courtney\u2019s work early in the morning returning one of the many outfits he rented from the costume store last night, Courtney couldn\u2019t help but notice something was bothering him and felt slightly happy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Pretty boy what\u2019s the problem you\u2019re usually so excited when you come into this store?\u201d Pondered Courtney hoping to get an idea for her revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim however just sighed. \u201cOh it\u2019s nothing Courtney it\u2019s just Roleplaying\u2019s just not exciting me anymore and my jobs been harder than ever. Oh sometimes I wish you became executive and I just did something else with my life\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney just stared at Tim in disbelief, of course he couldn\u2019t handle the responsibility of being executive she could see that easily. However Tim\u2019s pitiful excuse for not being quite as perverted gave Courtney a brilliant idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney then grinned deviously as she decided to flirt with Tim a little to trick him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Pretty boy I\u2019m so sorry for you, I imagine being an executive is hard for even geniuses like you\u201d. Cooed Courtney making Tim aroused and feel smart as Courtney played to his ego how a master pianist would play Mozart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney continued with the flirty act saying \u201cyou know my pretty boy i remember when I worked at that big fancy office with you and how we used to swap clothes and act like the other, you always looked so pretty in my clothes\u201d. Slightly mocked Courtney as Tim blushed. \u201cSay I have an idea! What if we swapped clothes and jobs for a day. I dress like you and handle some of that fought executive stuff for you and you dress like me and sit around helping ladies dress in sexy costumes\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney couldn\u2019t help but hold in her laughter, as she knew that Tim was probably sold on the idea with just that idea alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim thought hard about he decision, he wouldn\u2019t mind a break from the office and a opportunity to dress women in sexy costumes, but he didn\u2019t know how he felt about wearing Courtney\u2019s revealing outfit. In the end Tim decided on what to do and said......</span></div></div>",

Her moment for revenge had finally arrived. \u201cAwe yes let\u2019s do this pretty boy! Now come with me it\u2019s time for you\u2019re makeover\u201d. Delightfully shouted Courtney as she grabbed Tim\u2019s hand and dragged him into the storage room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was a bit suprised by this and more so when she forced him to sit and began to attach things to his hair. But Courtney just smiled at this and said \u201coh Pretty boy close your eyes while I make you look gorgeous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was a bit unsure of what she was doing but did it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim had to then sit patiently for an hour as she felt Courtney pull, tug and cut at his hair even spraying something on it and covering it in something else. Courtney then said \u201call done\u201d and just when Tim was about to open his eyes again she instantly kept them shut saying \u201cah ah ah pretty boy you have to wait till I\u2019m finished for the surprise\u201d. Giggling as she said which made Tim nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney then began putting stuff on his face and his nails and then the most comfortable and uncomfortable thing of all his chest and ass. Tim gasped when she grabbed them and stuck things to them but decided to remain patient as he remembered how bossy and annoyed Courtney would get if you messed with her plans, \u2018good thing I never messed with anything she cared about\u2019 he dimwittedly thought to himself never realising he stepped into Courtney\u2019s revenge plot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually after an Hour Courtney said \u201copen your eyes pretty boy and be amazed by the pretty girl in front of you\u201d. When Tim looked at himself he gasped in a ironically effeminate way that made Courtney laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim looked like Courtney now. His hair was luscious and red now rather than short and blonde and his face was covered in make up and e had long pink fake finger nails now. and what was worse that his pecs had now been replaced by stick on Breasts that he didn\u2019t understand and and a fake ass that was stuck on as well giving him an hour glass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm these come off right?\u201d Asked Tim nervously to which Courtney laughed and responded \u201coh of course but only I know how to take them off\u201d making Tim a bit suspicious now about Courtney\u2019s motives for the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides why would you wanna go back Pretty girl you look so sexy as me\u201d. Said Courtney playfully making Tim blush in embarrassment, as Courtney felt like a cat that had caught a mouse and was beginning to play with it\u2019s prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow pretty girl let\u2019s change clothes. You give me you\u2019re smart suit and put on my fashionable ensemble that\u2019ll make you the sexiest women alive\u201d.  Said Courtney taking sheer pleasure from putting her plan into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Tim could only blush in embarrassment as he took of his clothes, feeling worse when he saw Courtney give it a quick glance and snicker. But it wasn\u2019t all bad for him at least as Tom did take some pleasure in getting to see his sex naked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney then handed Tim her clothes and sent him into one of the employee changing rooms. Tim got changed as quickly as he could and was blushing at how provocative the stuff he was wearing was. Tim was wearing a Black thong and extra small black bra which barely covered his new boobs, after that struggle he put on Courtney\u2019s tight red latex mini dress which made him wanna gag at the sight of himself, he couldn\u2019t handle looking so feminine and attractive. Finally Tim put on the red pumped heels of Courtney\u2019s and wore her clip on silver earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-ok Courtney that\u2019s me done\u201d. Said Tim sheepishly, Tim could hear Courtney giggle slightly at this and say \u201cOk pretty girl come on out\u201d. Which made him wince as he wobbled out in Courtney\u2019s heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney struck a smug smirk of devilish delight at the sight of Tim, and had to admit to herself as much as she hated him, did he look good in her clothes. \u201cWow pretty girl you\u2019re even sexier than I\u2019d thought you\u2019d be in my clothes you\u2019re almost as sexy as I usually am\u201d making Tim blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim also couldn\u2019t believe the metamorphosis that she undertook.<br>\r\nCourtney now had no breasts, no makeup, and shirt lined hair while wearing his favourite suit\u201d. She looked just like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney smiled and went for the door saying \u201cwell pretty girl it\u2019s time I go, I\u2019m glad you came out as pretty as me and remember to work hard, I had an extra busy shift tonight\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was left shocked at this, she never mentioned she was working extra hard today, making him annoyed as he said \u201cbut wait what will you be doing as me, and what the hell are rules of working here!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney infernally was dying of laughter at his pathetic ramblings. It was just like back at the office when he had no idea what to do. Courtney then explained everything she wanted the idiot to know before she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to you\u2019re work pretty girl, just to work harder for you and to relive my glory days before I lost them to y- some idiot\u201d said Courtney making Tim feel guilty and Courtney feel stupid for almost letting her true feelings slip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney then explained the rules as she headed for the door. \u201cThe rules are simple, always be kind, act sexy and serve the customer with a smile, and do whatever they want. Now goodbye pretty girl\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney then got to the door leaving Tim flabbergasted as he wondered what was gonna happen to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney then unleashed a sinister smile as she opened the door, turning to look at Tim saying \u201coh by the way I almost forgot you have to blow every customer a kiss as they leave\u201d. Tom then realised the mistake he almost made and blew Courtney a kiss in a sexy way making her wink at him as she left Saying \u201cgood girl\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Courtney walked away she laughed thinking how Tim was stupid enough to believe that he had to blow kisses at the customer and do what they want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made her way to the office she used to work at, she pulled out her phone and texted someone telling them to meet her at the costume shop. She smiled thinking about them going to the shop and tormenting Tim without even realising it. Courtney texted.....</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m sorry Courtney I appreciate the gesture but it would feel to weird wearing your clothes again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney stared daggers at Tim for a second before she composed herself and smiled gently at Tim. \u201cOh ok then pretty boy suit yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim then let out a sigh of relief as he remembered how determined Courtney would be when she wanted something, it made him feel glad that his lie had helped his \u201cfriend\u201d become a better person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tim was leaving though Courtney had quickly concocted a plan and was putting it into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Pretty boy wait before you go would you like a quick glass of water\u201d. Asked Courtney as she used her puppy dog eyes to tug at Tim\u2019s heartstrings, even If she knew that he didn\u2019t have a heart. And luckily for her Tim took the bait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim nodded his head and took the water drinking it all as quickly as possible, however before Tim could even thank Courtney for the water he was feeling woozy and unconscious with the last thing he heard being Courtney\u2019s sultry cackle as she mocked him saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight Pretty boy enjoy you\u2019re makeover\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tim hit the floor unconscious and unaware of what was going to happen to him, Courtney wasted no time putting her revenge scheme into action as she lifted Tim into the storage room and began the metamorphosis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she did was stripped Tim of his sharp business suit and boxers, with Courtney being unable to help but snicker when she saw his \u2018little buddy\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she cut her hair and dyed it the shade of blonde Tim had while also removing her makeup to look more masculine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then taped her breasts to her chest and put on the sharp  suit and struck a pose, with a smile of confidence \u2018damn I look good in a suit\u2019 Courtney thought to herself as she turned her attention to the man who ruined her business career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018But not as good as you\u2019re gonna look as me pretty boy\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney couldn\u2019t help but take gratification from Tims transformation as she dyed his hair her shade of red and put extensions in it while gussying it up to make it look as stylish and pretty as her real hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she done up his makeup gave him a quick manicure leaving him with beautiful long bright pink fingernails. She then used some of the props from the costume store to give Tim an hourglass figure and some stick on fake breasts that only she knew how to remove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she began to dress Tim up in her clothes, starting with her nice set of skimpy red lingerie, with the sight of Tim in her panties making her nostalgic of the times he wasn\u2019t a scumbag. She then dressed him up in her black tight mini skirt and white top open crop blouse that shows off her midriff. Finally she made Tim wear her black high heeled stilettos and pierced his ears with her gold hoop earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her handiwork was finished she grinned in devilish delight. She looked just like Tim, and Tim looked gorgeous as her look alike. She couldn\u2019t help but snicker as Tim looked like her wannabe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney then left the office but not before saying \u201cenjoy you\u2019re day looking as sexy as me pretty boy, and enjoy learning about why I hate you\u201d. As she slammed the door and left the sexy costume shop she had been trapped in for 2 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later Tim finally woke up in a daze confused by what happened. \u2018Ah where am I?\u2019 Was the first thought to cross his mind as he tried to stand up but failed confused by why he found it so difficult to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as his senses came back to him, Tim could only scream in embarrassment and shock when he saw what happened to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Courtney was working hard in Tims office when she suddenly got the phone call she\u2019d been waiting for hours for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney has a twisted grin on her face when she answered the phone, pretending to not know what\u2019s going on as she said \u201cHello? Tim\u2019s office how can I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim didn\u2019t waste any time as he responded in anger shock and embarrassment \u201cWHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?!?\u201d Making Courtney laugh in delight at Tim\u2019s panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy I just made you take the break you needed Pretty boy or should I say pretty girly?\u201d Laughing as she said it making Tim blush as he got more furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney then contoured what she was saying \u201cby the way pretty girly shame on you for not telling me you where off today. Because of your incompetence I had to ask for the day to work and now I\u2019ve got overtime\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim then lost it as his fragile ego couldn\u2019t take no more \u201cget over here and change me back to normal I don\u2019t wanna look like you\u2019re wannabe!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever all that anger was shot down once again by Courtney\u2019s could laugh as she retorted immediately. \u201cSorry pretty girly but I can\u2019t come over and undue my masterful makeover of you just yet, not at least till I finish around 10pm. Besides I think you look so sexy like me it reminds me of the good old days when we\u2019d swap clothes in the office.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim groaned in pain at this point realising he was gonna be stuck like this for the whole day. Plus he knew his bosses wouldn\u2019t be happy if Courtney posing as him skipped overtime the CEO was already looking for a reason to fire him due to his incompetence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but what am I supposed to do all day Courtney?\u201d Asked A desperate Tom making Courtney wanna cackle in delight however she knew better and kept her composure as she told him his itinerary for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell pretty girly you\u2019ll just have to do my job at the sexy costume shop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim sighed in frustration as he realised the nightmare he was stuck in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine I guess I can do this, what are the rules Courtney?\u201d Questioned an uneasy Tim knowing that he would probably be unhappy with the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee there simple pretty girly all you have to do is always smile, always act sexy, and always do whatever the customer wants, oh and remember to blow them a kiss on the way out it\u2019s company policy\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim couldn\u2019t be more embarrassed even if he tried \u201coh ok then we\u2019ll ill get to work here then I guess. You better change me back once this is all over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney simply chuckled at this to unnerve Tim. \u201cOff course pretty girly bye bye and remember to smile\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Courtney hanged up the phone she pressed one button on her computer and all of Tim\u2019s overtime work was done. She couldn\u2019t believe Tim struggles with such easy work. It\u2019d probably take him two weeks to do what she could in 5 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney then decided to start her plan for real as she called a few of her friends who owed her favours as she planned to send them in to humiliate Tim further but who does she decide to send in first. Amy her catty bimbo friend who loves slutty costumes and would love to help Tim into one, or Maria a dominatrix who eat men like Tim for breakfast <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Said Tim in a surprisingly decent impression of Courtney wanting to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy just snickered at this though as she found Tims predicament hilarious. Tim then asked Amy what she was in for. And Amy gave Tim a smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Courtie I was wanting to buy a new slutty costume for my boyfriend\u201d. Explained Amy as she looked through all of the costumes. And as much as Tim hated this situation and being stuck with this bingo he couldn\u2019t deny he was excited to see her wearing whatever slutty costume she chose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that perverted excitement was about to vanish completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy handed Tim a costume leaving him confused as Amy impatiently waited for Tim to put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh Courtie what are you waiting for go and test the costume for me already!\u201d Demanded Amy leaving Tim in embarrassment and shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t be serious, she wanted him to dress up in the skirt costume for her just so she could see how it looks. However before she could talk back to her, the voice of Courtney entered her head and reminded her of the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Always do what the customer wants\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim then sighed and grabbed the costume from the bimbos hand and went into the changing room, while Amy snickered to herself as She knew one thing that Tim didn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Always do what the customer wants\u2019 wasn\u2019t an actual rule and Courtney only told the egotistical idiot that to make him submit to her every whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim opened up the costume bag and wanted to gag when he saw that Amy wanted to him dressed as........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Heck he even remembered Courtney agreeing to dress as his slutty maid once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tim knew that he didn\u2019t have a choice but to do Courtney\u2019s job, at least until Courtney came back and undid her makeover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim swallowed his pride as he stripped out of Courtney\u2019s clothes and began to dress in the costume, he wanted to die as he realised the costume was one size to small and would show of his new bust and Ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while Tim was dressing up in the slutty maid Costume, Amy was texting Courtney telling her about how she was able to force Tim to dress in a slurry maid costume, making Courtney burst into a laughing fit, with Courtney texting Amy about how she wish she could see him in it, giving Amy a brilliant idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Tim was finally able to fit into the maid costume and blushed at the sight before him in the changing mirror. No longer did Tim see the reflection of a smart businessman who could get what he wanted, but an attractive red head in the sluttiest maid costume imaginable, it was humiliating and what was worse, his own reflection was Turning him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim then took a deep breath as he left the changing area and walked towards Amy, and when Amy saw Tim she gleefully squealed in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh My God! Courtney you look so hawt as a slutty maid!\u201d Complimented Amy knowing how much it would get under Tim\u2019s skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd under his skin it got as Tim could only put on a fake smile when talking to Amy pretending like he was Courtney. \u201cOh thanks Amy I know I look so sexy in it I think the last time I wore something like this was when I was seeing Tim\u201d saying it in a way like Courtney was missing him, making Amy snicker as she knew Courtney\u2019s true feelings towards Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then decided to take advantage of Tim\u2019s predicament to make fun of him to \u201cCourtney\u201d. \u201cHa that loser who  had the small penis that you made dress up like you. Wow I can\u2019t believe you dressed like this for him you slut\u201d. Mocked Amy as Tim could only grit his Teeth and Blush in embarrassment at Amy\u2019s mockery of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim then decided to try and get Amy out of the store as quickly as possible. \u201cSo are you gonna buy this outfit?\u201d Rushed Tim hoping the Bimbo would get the message and this torture would be over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Amy had one more trick up her sleeve before she would leave this brilliant predicament alone. \u201cHmm I\u2019m not sure yet? Say I know what I\u2019ll do you strike a few sexy poses for me like you usually do and I\u2019ll take some pictures and decide if I want the outfit or not got it?\u201d Explained Amy with a smug grin on her face knowing Tim and his massive ego would be humiliated by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim wanted to die when he heard the suggestion, he wanted to tell the dumb bimbo bitch to leave him alone, but he then remembered Courtneys exact instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Always do what the customer wants\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim then swallowed what microscopic bit of his pride was left and said \u201cSure thing Amy I\u2019ll show you how much of a slutty maid I am!\u201d Ending it with a ditzy  giggle and hating himself for scooping so low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny laughed out loud at this making Tim feel worse as he began to pose like the whores he forced to role play with him would, hating himself as he stuck his fake breasts out and blowed kisses to Amy who was snickering away with a mischievous grin on her face as she commanded Tim to pose for her saying \u201c that\u2019s it show me how slutty of a maid you are\u201d and \u201cgo on girl show of that hot body of yours\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after an hour, Amy felt satisfied enough with torturing Tim and said \u201cOk Courtney you sold me this outfits all yours I don\u2019t want it\u201d making Tim scream internally  while he smiled playfully on the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Amy if that\u2019s how you feel I\u2019ll see you later then\u201d. Politely said Tim as he considered if he could play someone to kill Amy once this was all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk bye Courts oh and isn\u2019t sorry I\u2019ll send these photos right to Tim I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll love them.\u201d Mocked Amy as she left the store Giggling while Tom felt humiliated and used, he wondered if this was how a lot of the women he let with felt but chose not to dwell on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim went to the break room to relax, and true to her word, Amy did send Tim all of her photos he snapped and Tim felt violated as he saw how sexy and slutty he looked dressed in the maid costume, and felt worse by how aroused he was by the sight of him in it. Tim decided he would change out of the outfit after he has a coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Amy smiled as she also sent Courtney dressed as Tim the photos smiling as she thought how she told Tim what he was doing right to his face without Realising what she meant. And when Courtney saw the photos she grinned sinisterly, it made her glad she sent Amy in as she was happy and aroused by the results. She couldn\u2019t believe how good Tim looked modelling the slutty maid costume it gave her some ideas of what to do to him in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she decided to focus on her plans to torment him now as she debated who to send in next. She could send in Karen her masterful their friend to steal Her clothes back, because if she knew that scumbag tin he would have taken his break by now. Or maybe she could send in her current boy toy Glen a buff Italian fire men who had been wanting to have fun with Courtney for a while, only she felt Tom would have more fun than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney decided to send..... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And suddenly Karen didn\u2019t wanna steal from her, she wanted to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after hanging out a lot the two quickly became heat friends with Courtney starting to get more happy and quick on her feet, with Karen being surprised how she couldn\u2019t even steal anything from Courtney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren then heard a snap and grinned. \u2018Got it she thought to herself as she entered the store\u2019 while sneaking through she saw the break room where she saw a busty women who looked just like Courtney in a slutty maid costume drinking coffee.

She had long flowing blonde locks and was sitting in her massive puffy silver blue ball gown which stuck out immensely making it look like she was being consumed by her dress, but to the princess that did not matter as their was only one thing that was on her mind. And that was to escape her lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hated being a royal and hated being a princess even more, she was never allowed to anything by herself, she had to attend boring meetings and act interested in other royal affairs and worse act romantically interested in other princes.

Replied Natasha using the old saying fairy tail saying to ease the Princess just like she did in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess smiled in comfort at Natasha\u2019s reply but was set In just calling it a night and accepting her fate. She glanced at one strange girl, she clearly had no taste in clothes as she was wearing a dark green shirt with light blue jeans and white sneakers. But she looked like she fit every single measurement, and the best part was the girls face she looked identical to the princess it was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept the strange girl wasn\u2019t even a girl at all but in fact Brad who was about to have his princess thought realised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNatasha look look!

They could wait for the strange girl to go to wherever she\u2019s staying and kidnap her, but what kinds of princess would that make her. She decided that it would be better to just send her trust worthy hand maid Natasha out to bring Brada to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNatasha bring the strange girl to my private quarters so I may speak with her.\u201d Commanded the princess as Natasha nodded her head and quickly paced herself towards Brada.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Brad was busy taking pictures of the beautiful dinner hall that the royal family of sinder eat In and was amazed by how beautiful designed the room was. He couldn\u2019t wait to see his mom and dad again so he could show them all of the amazing pictures he had taken, and he couldn\u2019t wait to rub it in his sisters face when she realised how he had a way cooler and more interesting vacation than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever while Brad was busy daydreaming, he hadn\u2019t noticed the gorgeous hand maid walk towards him and jumped when she patted his shoulder to get his attention releasing a embarrassingly effeminate gasp which made him blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me sorry to disturb you but are you Brada?\u201d Asked Natasha in a gentle tone which calmed Brad down a little after the surprise appearance of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what calmed Brad down more was how beautiful and stunning the hand maid was, she looked like a model out of a magazine and Brad was back to feeling a bit nervous, thinking that she probably didn\u2019t speak great English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh yeah I-I\u2019m Brada\u201d blurted out Brad who sweater under his breath once he realised the mistake he made. However Brad couldn\u2019t care once he saw the beautiful smile that Natasha showed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s wonderful Brada please come with me the princess has requested an audience with you\u201d. Explained Natasha as she grabbed Brads hand and forced him to follow her through royal hallway after Royal hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Brad couldn\u2019t be more excited. He couldn\u2019t believe his luck,<br>\r\nHe was gonna meet the princess, what an honour. An honour that Beth could never beat when it came to her telling whatever boring things she did on vacation, he couldn\u2019t help but smile and snap a few photos of the hallways just to show how amazing he palace was to everybody when he got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad also really enjoyed talking to Natasha through the hallway, she clearly knew the history of the place very well and was happy that she was getting to introduce someone so interested in the culture of Sinder to the queen, while Natasha could only think how lucky they were to get someone so familiar with the culture of Sindsr to be the princesses replacement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Natasha and Brad reached  the princesses private quarters and when entering the room Brad was amazed by What he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princesses quarters could fit his house into it three times over. And the walls were a beautiful cyan blue with a gorgeous art nouveau wallpaper while the floors were made from a beautiful oak wood and buffed to perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the princess was sitting patiently by her 17th century style vanity table with a smile on her face when seeing Brad or to her Brada.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was excited to meet the princess however all that excitement disappeared quickly when she revealed her motives for summoning him in a grateful speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy my strange girl you\u2019re even more beautiful that\u2019s i thought you\u2019d be Brada. You\u2019re probably wondering why I summoned you, well I shall keep the answer from you no longer. I am 18 the same age as you I\u2019m guessing and I am fed up with this life of royalty, I hate wearing poofy dresses and only acting in ways that the singer culture renders suitable. I wish to break free for a year or a month and experience the real world for myself, will you Brada my twin from another lifetime help me be free?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was left speechless, perplexed and utterly embarrassed by what she had said and let out an awkward laugh as he prepared himself to shatter the princesses dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm princess, w-while I\u2019m grateful for you\u2019re offer i can\u2019t take it because.....because....because I am a man\u201d. Awkwardly uttered out Brad<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess laughed at this finding the joke hilarious while her hand maid had a look of sadness on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s funny Brada, I\u2019m glad you have such a sense of humour about this\u201d. Said the princess trying to lie to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad then sighed in sadness as he realised what he had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy names brad princess, and here is my passport and drivers license I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s true\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the princess read all of the legal documents thoroughly tears began to well up in her eyes as she burst into tears while the hand maid burst into action to comfort her princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh this is just so unfair why oh why god do you play me for a fool in such a way! All I wanted was to be free from the culture and royalty of Sinder for one day and instead you play me for a fool and trap me in my cage like a songbird\u201d. Cried out the Princess feeling doomed to her life of royalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad felt like a monster right now. While the princess was waiting for her Princess Charming to come and save her from this castle Brad was nothing but a devil in disguise. Until Natasha cane up with a mischievous idea as she decided to use her looks to get Brad to hell then out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know Brada or Brad you still look just as cute and pretty as the princess even if you are a boy. Are you sure there\u2019s no chance you could help us out at all. I promise it\u2019d be worth your while, you\u2019d get to learn all about the culture of Sinder and experience all the joys of royalty that the princess had grown tired off. Oh can\u2019t you just pretend to be our gorgeous princess for a little while?\u201d Pleaded Natasha in a sultry tone hoping that it would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad took a second to consider his options, if he agreed he could get to know the gorgeous maid better and experience the culture of sinder at its finest, but at the same time he\u2019d have to be dressed in a big poofy dress and act like a girl while also having to do god knows what else. While if he said no he could dress and act like himself and have a nice normal vacation while sacrificing getting to know the maid better and experiencing the luxury of royalties first hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad took a second to think as he looked at the desperate princess and the gorgeous maid and decided to say......</span></div></div>",

Thank you so much! I\u2019ll make his up to you someday I promise! Now let\u2019s get you outta those ratty boy clothes and into my beautiful dress\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Brad could even say anything Natasha had already pulled down his jeans and boxers making him shriek and cover up which made the princess giggle a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I can certainly see how much of a man you are now, I think we\u2019re gonna need. Some tape\u201d explained Natasha as Brad blushed while also feeling happy that his privates were big enough to warrant tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after a few minutes of Brad using a lot of tape. The maid and her princess got to work on making their Cinderella the belle of the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was left dizzy by how quickly and efficiently the two were working together, as in a few seconds the maid had already forced Brad into a tight corset which made him feel like he was in space with no oxygen, while The princess had fling of all of her clothes and had already dressed herself in Brads clothes to which she was....less than satisfied with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few deep breaths Brad was in a course which made his already feminine body look petite enough to be the princesses<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha smirked at Brad who was feeling uncomfortable in the corset and she snickered. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Brada that\u2019s as tight as the corset will get, but now we need to do something about his short blonde mess you call you\u2019re hair.\u201d Explained Natasha in a joking way with Brad hoping that Brada wouldn\u2019t be a nickname that sticks with the maid he slowly was gaining a crush for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The princess then jumped in proclaiming \u201cnot to worry my sweet maid and my adorable double I had a wig pre made for just such a occasion\u201d. As she worried in case the girl who took her place had short hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess then pulled out the blonde wig which was identical to her own hair. It was long blonde hair that flowed gracefully. She then plonked it straight into Brads head and the maid combed it too accurate perfection like she was a machine in a factory. When Brad saw his new hairstyle for a while he blushed finding it embarrassing by how much he actually do look like the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess meanwhile found it amazing saying \u201cdon\u2019t worry Brad you\u2019re just as pretty as a princess as me\u201d. Making Natasha laugh as she could tell that the princess didn\u2019t know how he was really feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess then shaved her hair and ruffled it to make it as messy as Brads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princes then joined Natasha in using cosmetics to make Brad look more feminine as they made him wear the princesses Pink hearted bra and stuffed it to make it look as big as hers, they then used blush mascara eyeliner and a lot of lip gloss to make Brad look like he had stepped straight out of the princesses Mirror, they finally pierced his ears with the pink heart earrings of the princess and gave him a manicure painting his fingernails bright pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess smiled and said \u201cwow you look great\u201d to make her double feel more comfortable, while Natasha playfully chimed in saying \u201cyeah I thought you were a cute guy but you\u2019re a adorable little princess\u201d making Brad blush more while hoping that she wasn\u2019t into this sort of thing if they went out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid and the princess  then grinned mischievously as the princess said \u201cand now it\u2019s time for my double to enjoy a royal dress\u201d and in a minute flat Brad went from sitting down calmly to being pulled and tugged by the girls as they dressed him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess slid her small panties onto Brad which made him blush as he felt his right they were and saw the pink hearts it was covered in, mking him hope the princesses under garments weren\u2019t all so childish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the maid was forcing Him into the princesses beautiful sparkling blue ball gown, making her smile as she thought about how much he looked like Cinderella in it and how much she wished she\u2019d one day be cinderella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they forced him to wear a pair of high heels with Diamonds in them to make them sparkle and white opera gloves, with the final touch being the princesses very own tiara now resting on Brads head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Brad got a look at himself he was shocked, he no longer looked like a boy on holiday, but the gorgeous princess of Sinder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid saw his shock and snickered at it. \u201cOh Brad I think you\u2019re the prettiest boy playing princess I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. Making him snap back to reality and blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess meanwhile now looked just like Brad and had taken his phone, wallet and passport. This was it. She was finally free for a while to explore and she didn\u2019t know if she could do it she felt a tear well up in her eye as she realised that she would be leaving Natasha alone but took solace in the fact that she clearly left her in good company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha saw the princesses fear and hugged her saying \u201cdon\u2019t worry my princess go out outside and have yourself the adventure of a life time me and Brada can handle things\u201d. As both the maid and princess hugged crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they stopped hugging and The princess turned around to look at Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much for doing this for me I promise you one day I will repay the massive debt I owe you\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking Brad smile, however that smile left quickly as he remembered to tell the princess something. \u201cOh wait Princess before you go I must ask that you don\u2019t talk to my sister on vacation if she finds out I\u2019m here she\u2019ll blackmail me into being her maid or something like that\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Natasha giving him a look and Brad instantly realising his mistake and saying \u201coh I mean no offence\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both snickered at it though and the princess promised to not talk to Beth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha then escorted the princess dressed like Brad with all of his belongings into the tourist area and told Brad that his first duty as princess was on a note on the vanity table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked at the note and saw the first thing he\u2019ll be doing is....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brad looked at the note and saw the first thing he would be doing would be princess training with Natasha. This made Brad excited while also extremely nervous. He was excited at the chance for some alone time with Natasha as she was beautiful and nice and Brad knew that he had feelings for the hand maid. But that also made him extremely nervous as he knew that if he messed up then Natasha would hate his guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Natasha was watching the princess disappear into the crowd of tourists feeling miserable. She felt she was watching her little sister go out into the outside world all alone, hoping that she would be ok. But Natasha knew that this is what her princess wanted and she would have to respect her wishes, and ensure that Brada, the cute boy playing princess would need to learn how to walk talk, pose and smile like a princess from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t looking forward to it as she knew how tedious it was to teach the princess how to do all of it and knew that teaching a boy to do it would surely be worse, she sighed as she thought to herself how great it would be if someone could just look after her like a princess, and treat her like the princess she was always destined to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha then walked back into the princesses private quarters to find Brad slouching in a chair while waiting. She sighed and pulled him to his feet as she began to speak to brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Brada as you read I\u2019m going to be teaching you all about the skills a pretty princess like you should have before you can go to royal events and since I taught the princess all about being a princess, it is only fair that i should teach her replacement, even if they are a boy\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded his head understanding that a lot was expected of him if he had to be the princess of sinder now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha smiled at Brads determination to do good, at least he would be trying his best she thought. \u201cGood Brada now the first thing I\u2019ll teach you today is how to walk in heels, I know that to a boy especially one as unkempt as you this will be a struggle but I\u2019m sure with you\u2019re determination you\u2019ll get the hang of it easily.\u201d Explained Natasha with confidence, however all of that confidence would go out the window when Brad started walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was already a natural in walking in high heels which shocked Natasha immensely. She\u2019s didn\u2019t understand how could such a messy boy be walking so naturally, no he wasn\u2019t walking he was strutting with natural confidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked over to see Natasha gobsmacked by the sight of Brad strutting and smiled. However Natasha saw this and Grinned back slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy my you\u2019re such a natural in Heels Brada, I guess this isn\u2019t you\u2019re first time crossdressing is it?\u201d Making Brad blush in embarrassment and look miserable as he stopped walking .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha immediately noticed the look on Brads face and felt bad realising she hurt his feelings \u201coh Brada I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t mean anything by it honestly I\u2019m amazed you\u2019re so good in heels\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad then smiled back slightly at Natasha and explained why her joke made him feel sad \u201csorry it\u2019s just that well my sister used to bully me and blackmail with bad test scores and stealing money from my dad  into dressing up as her twin sister. I learned all about how to walk in heels and pose like her but I hated it, she was a huge bully to me and forced me to do things I hated like go on nights out with her and her friends where they\u2019d try to hook me up with guys, I felt like her toy doll more than her brother and I hated it so much.\u201d explained Brad as he held back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha felt earful and hugged brad and apologised Profusely. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Brad, I can only imagine how awful that made you feel and I understand why you want the princess to not talk to her while she\u2019s out as you. But I must say even though I\u2019ve only known you for a few hours you seem lovely and if it cheers you up I think you\u2019re terrific you\u2019re so talented and I\u2019m glad the princess chose you to be her temporary replacement. I can tell you\u2019ll make an amazing princess as you\u2019ve already surpassed my expectations\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad blushes at this feeling so happy his crush gave him such a lovely compliment, even if it was for being a amazing princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha realised what she said and laughed with Brad for a minute, with both of them being glad that they met the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha then decided it was time to continue with Brads princess training. \u201cWell Brada I\u2019m glad you can walk in heels but let\u2019s move on to the next part of princess training which I expect you can handle gracefully\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha then explained that Brad had to learn how to...</span></div></div>",
