            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt stirred in his bed and sat up. The events of the past week were still fresh in his mind. Those two shady guys had rushed him as he walked home from his friend's and knocked him out. His memories were foggy after that, but he remembered vaguely being in some kind of laboratory and in a cell of some kind. The next vivid memory he had was waking up with a pain in his shoulder and feeling like his entire body was burning. He could barely comprehend where he was, but he remembered a tall, broad, bald man looking on with mixed annoyance and delight as Matt tore apart the lab, looking for an exit. When he finally did he dashed for it and made it outside where he jumped and started flying. He still had no idea how he did it, but he knew it had happened because after a couple hours he saw the towers of Metropolis and crashed right into his own front lawn where his parents rushed to him and hugged and kissed him, talking about how happy they were he was home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was two days ago. Matt's mind felt much clearer now and his body felt odd, but in a good way. The pain in his shoulder was gone and instead of feeling sick or ill, he felt strong. Incredibly strong. He shrugged it off and went through his morning routine, showering, dressing and getting breakfast. Due to having only recently returned home his parents were still keeping him home from school to help all of them recover. So when he was done with breakfast he was left with a 'what now'. Maybe some weightlifting. He'd been starting to workout on his brother's weights, hoping to gain some mass. When he sat down at the benchpress the barbell almost flew through the ceiling when he pushed it up. \"Since when do I have that much strength?\" he wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe added more weight and this time lifted more carefully, only to find the barbell felt more like it was made of cardboard. Finally he put all the weight his brother had and still it barely felt like he was lifting any weight at all. \"So I have superpowers now? Since when?\" Matt murmured \"I wonder if I have any others, and where they came from.\"</span></div></div>",

Somehow, he vaguely remembered flying home, although that seemed like a fading memory which seemed increasingly harder to pull up. Could he really fly? For some reason, he could no longer remember what he did between leaving school, the day before, and waking up this morning. All he knew was, there was this odd feeling in his shoulder, which disappeared after a few moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Matt stared at the ceiling, he began to hear sounds. At first, it was the ticking sound of the clock in the living room. Then he began to hear faint conversations. He recognized the voices of the people, who lived in the houses next door, and across the street, and he began to wonder why he was able to hear their voices so clearly, even though he was in his bedroom with the door closed? He heard the sound from the TV, he heard the girl next door talking on the phone, and he heard Morgan, the boy next door, telling his mom that he was going outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is weird\u2026\u201d Matt whispered to himself. \u201cI can hear their voices\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt turned his head and glanced at the wall. Then, something else happened, that was really, really weird. The white wall seemed to become transparent to Matt\u2019s eyes, and Matt could now see the front yard of his house. He could see the street, the driveway, and he could see Morgan, who was riding his bike outside, on the street in front of his house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d Matt said, as he lifted up his head, and blinked. The wall had reappeared for a moment, and the vision he had was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute\u2026. That was weird!\u201d Matt mumbled, as he sat up on his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at the wall once again, and concentrated. Once again, the wall became transparent, and Matt was able to see everything that was going on outside, just as if the wall wasn\u2019t even there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is\u2026 so\u2026 cool\u2026 \u201cHe chuckled to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt blinked and the wall reappeared again. However, Matt was still able to hear voices coming from the neighbors\u2019 homes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoggone! I can see through walls! I can hear sounds from far away! This is awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stood up and walked towards the window, which was on the other end of his bedroom\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a brief moment, Matt remembered doing something that no other human being on earth could do: fly! It was a fading memory, of flying high above the ground, and feeling the cold air blowing in his face, while he was soaring through the air. Was it real? Did it really happen? Or, was it just a dream? Then again, he wasn\u2019t dreaming when he started to pick up voices from far away and he wasn\u2019t dreaming when he could see through the walls of his bedroom, either. He had super powers! But, was flying one of them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt turned around and faced his bedroom. Then, he stepped on his messy bed, which he needed to make up before his mother walked in. While standing on the edge of his bed, he raised both arms before him, and prepared to leap from his bed to the ground. This time, however, he just concentrated on flying; on rising up above the mattress and to remain in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it really happened! Matt\u2019s feet began to float off the mattress. Yes, he did it! The boy was hovering in mid-air, like a balloon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! This is freaky!\u201d he said to himself, as he looked down and saw his feet dangling above his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, he concentrated on moving forward. And, yes, that worked to. He floated forward, and ended up levitating in the center of his bedroom, about three feet above the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! I can do this! I can fly!\u201d he cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he just extended his arms in front of his head and willed his body to level out until he was hovering entirely in a horizontal position. He slowly circled around his room three times, making sure he didn\u2019t knock anything over. He knew that would make his mother very angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome! I can fly! I can fly!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he allowed his legs to drop down so they faced the ground, before descending to the floor. His feet touched down on the carpet, and he made a nice, soft landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me fix up my room, quickly, so I can go meet Morgan outside! I\u2019m going flying!\u201d he said to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he placed all his dirty clothes in the hamper, he made his bed, and he picked up his school books from the floor and on the desk and put away his notebook. He placed everything in his backpack and got everything cleaned up\u2026 All in just three seconds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! That was fast!\u201d he said, when he realized he had gotten the room cleaned up at an incredible speed. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to like this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt then checked the time on his watch before he got some clean clothes out of his dresser, he brushed his teeth, he took a shower, he dried off, got dressed, put on his socks and tennis shoes, and came back into his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFive seconds! I took a shower and got dressed in five seconds?\u201d he gasped, as he stared at his digital watch. \u201cNormally, that would take me twenty minutes! Whoa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing a t-shirt, a pair of khaki shorts, white socks and white tennis shoes, the super-powered boy then walked over to the window and opened it all the way. With his arms extended before him, he leaped through the window, taking off flying through the sky like a bird!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhheeeeeee!!!!\u201d he cheered, as he soared over the rooftops of the houses on his street. \u201cThis is awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flying boy circled his street from above, as he spotted his best friend, who was riding a bike on the street below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to say hi to Morgan!\u201d Matt chuckled, as he flew closer to his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked up and couldn\u2019t believe his eyes\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt lands in Morgan's front yard a little too hard, hurting his feet. He limps over to the porch and sits down. Matt takes off his shoes and rubs his socked feet before Morgan rides up on his bike. Morgan is wearing a t-shirt with a light wind-breaker jacket over it and khaki shorts with brown flops on his semi-tan, hairless bare feet. Morgan's toes are pedicured however they are very slender and longer than normal 15 year old boys his age. <br>\r\nMorgan says \"Hey Matt, what's wrong with your feet?\". He kicks off his flops and sits next to Matt on the porch steps. Matt replies \"Well, its a long story Morgan. You see I didn't just walk here from my house, I kinda flew\".<br>\r\nMorgan replies \"You mean you ran over fast?\". Matt shakes his head saying \"No, I flew. I discovered it just this morning as I jumped off my bed and flew across the room\". Morgan is flabbergasted. Matt continues \"I've only flown a couple times and landed kinda hard in your yard hurting my feet\". He rubs his socked soles before peeling his socks off and checking out his bare soles. \"Ahhh...I hate wearing shoes and socks during the summer, but my mom doesn't want my bare feet to sunburn\". He checks the sole of each foot and his bare toes. Matt has very golden tan bare feet with slender, pedicured toes. He wiggles them as he stretches his feet in front of him.<br>\r\nMorgan says \"You've got great looking feet Matt. Mine look like big foot!\" Matt laughs and says \"Your feet look fine. Wanna take a trip around the city?\". \"You mean...\" Morgan says, but Matt interrupts saying \"I'd actually be doing the flying, holding onto you\". <br>\r\nMorgan begins to put on his flops. Matt exclaims \"Just go barefoot. I'll try it barefoot too. I need to practice landing more softly anyways. Okay, let's go. Actually, just hang onto my bare ankles as I fly us around the block first for a practice run. You know my feet are ticklish, so no tickling my toes or soles. I might drop you!\". Morgan takes hold of Matt's ankles and the two boys zoom up into the air with ease.<br>\r\n\"How you doing back there Morgan?\" Matt asks as he turns his head around. \"Doing fine Matt. I can even hang on with just one hand...see\" Morgan replies. \"Be careful. You can't fly!\" Matt replies. Morgan enjoys the aerial views of their city. He loosens his grip  around Matt's left ankle and slips his hand down to Matt's big toe. <br>\r\nAs they fly over a park lake, a flock of birds intersects them, causing Matt to quickly fly upwards. Morgan looses his grip on Matt's big toe and plummets toward the lake fast. Morgan yells out \"Matt, help me!\" Matt quickly swings around and catches Morgan just as his feet hits the water. \"That was close, but the water felt good on my bare feet\" Morgan says. Matt laughs. <br>\r\nHe lands softly on the shore of the lake in soft sand. Matt says \"Let's try flying over to New York. We'll can be there in two minutes. I want to see how fast I can fly anyways\". Morgan replies \"But we're both barefoot. Can we go back and get your shoes and my flops?\". Matt looks down at his bare feet and Morgan's bare feet and says \"Good point! Can't fly or walk around New York in bare feet!\". They fly quickly fly back and put their shoes and flops on their feet before taking off for New York.</span></div></div>",

Matt nods and descends. They land by a corn field near where Connor is walking. \"Hey Connor, wait up\" says Morgan.<br>\r\nMorgan and Matt jog up to where Connor is walking. Connor is a year younger than Morgan with steady-built, sandy brown hair and tan complexion like Matt. He is wearing a blue polo shirt, tan khaki pants with dark topsiders on his feet with no socks. Connor turns around saying \"Where'd you two come from?\". Matt laughs and Morgan says \"From up there...\" pointing to the sky. <br>\r\n\"Seriously? I was just on my way to the bus station for a job interview in Centre City\" Connor replies. Morgan says \"Can we give you a lift? This is my friend Matt and he, well he...uh, well he can fly!\". Connor and Matt shake hands. Connor replies \"Yeah, right! And I can run sixty miles an hour barefoot\".<br>\r\nMatt takes hold of Connor's hand and Morgan's hand and slowly takes off into the blue sky. Connor closes his eyes at first, but then peeks out from behind his hand. \"You weren't kidding!\" Connor exclaims. He holds on tight to Matt's arm and subsequently looses his right shoe in the process revealing Connor's tan bare foot. The shoe falls too fast and out of sight from anyone to retrieve it.<br>\r\n\"Hey Matt, Morgan, I can't go to the interview with only one shoe. Can you try and find it?\" Connor exclaims.<br>\r\nMatt replies \"Sorry, it's gone. Tell you what, when we drop you off, I'll let you borrow my shoes okay?\". Connor looks back at Matt's sporty shoes and agrees. <br>\r\nMorgan pipes in \"Maybe afterwards, you can come with us to NYC for the afternoon?\". Connor has a puzzled look on his face.<br>\r\nMatt says \"Okay, where in Centre City is your interview at? Connor replies \"Aviation and Third Street is the closest intersection\".<br>\r\nHe descends and all three boys land in a small, nearby park corner. \"We'll stay here and wait for you\" Matt says to Connor, then says \"here, take my shoes...and my socks. Better be dressed properly you know\". Matt kicks off his shoes and peels off his socks and after stretching his toes, hands them over to Connor. Connor takes off his one topsider and wiggles his tan, pedicured bare toes before putting on Matt's socks. \"At least your socks aren't white!\" Connor says while putting them on. He puts on the shoes and trots off to his interview while Morgan and Matt sit on the park bench. \"Ahhh, my bare feet love the sun\" says Matt.<br>\r\nMorgan asks \"So tell me the whole story about your new powers, we have some time\". Matt begins to explain the whole background of him obtaining these special powers.</span></div></div>",

My arms and legs and even my bare feet feel better when the sunlight is touching them\". <br>\r\nJust then, they both hear some cursing coming from a distance. They see Connor coming towards them with a pissed off look on his face. \"Those bastards already hired someone else! The manager didn't even have the decency to call me. What a waste of time!\".<br>\r\nMatt replies \"Let's fly to NYC and have a fun afternoon to get your mind off it\". Morgan smiles at Connor who tries to grin, but is still pissed off. Connor begins to to kick off Matt's shoes, then peels off Matt's socks and hands them back to Matt. \"Thanks for the loan, but those shoes are too small for me. (rubs his bare toes) I noticed that store over there is selling cheap flops. Can you wait for me?\".<br>\r\nConnor runs in his bare feet to the store while Matt looks at his damp borrowed socks and shoes. \"Your friend has sweaty feet\" Matt exclaims to Morgan. <br>\r\nMorgan replies \"Yeah, I know. He loves wearing those topsiders without socks which makes his feet sweat even more and without socks they smell too!\". Morgan tosses Connor's one shoe in a nearby garbage can. Connor comes back a moment later wearing some cheap blue flops on his tan bare feet. \"These will suffice until we get back\" Connor says. \"Well, you better take them off and tuck them under your shirt, so they don't come off your feet in flight\" Matt replies, then says \"Besides, it feels nice flying barefoot and the air going between your toes\".<br>\r\nAll three boys tuck their footwear in their shirts, then Matt tells them to hold on to his two bare ankles as he lifts off into the sky. \"Connor, no tickling my bare feet or toes...understand!\". Connor grins.<br>\r\nMorgan says to Connor \"He has ticklish feet and we don't want him to drop us...right?\". Connor has a serious look on his face and nods. \"The air does feel good on my bare feet and toes\". Matt grins and flies forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout five or so minutes later, they arrive at the top of the Freedom Tower overlooking Manhattan. They look around at all the buildings, people, cars and noise coming from below. Matt puts on his shoes and socks while Morgan and Connor put their flops on their bare feet. They find an unlocked door leading down to the observatory visitor floor, then take a quick ride down to the bottom.<br>\r\nThe rest of the afternoon, the boys explore most of Manhattan by walking, taking the subway and an occasional lift by Matt. As they near Times Square, Morgan sees a Foot Massage sign in a nearby store front. \"Oh, I could really use one of those right now and it's only $10 bucks for 20 minutes. That's $5 a foot! Can we stop and rest?\". Matt replies \"Sure, my feet are sore and tired too\".<br>\r\nAll three boys enter the Foot Massage shop. Each of them is assisted by  older Asian ladies as they are instructed to sit down in large padded chairs while their footwear is removed. The boys' bare feet are placed in hot warm, scented water and washed thoroughly and dried. The next 20 minutes are bliss for each boy as their soles, toes and tops of each bare foot are kneaded, pressed, pulled and massaged. \"Oh that feels good\" Matt says wincing. \"Ahh...my toes love it!\" Connor exclaims. \"Get more of my toes please\" Morgan says to his masseuse. Matt's masseuse says (in broken English) \"You like body massage, only $10 more?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt nods his head and is escorted to a back curtained-off room. Connor's masseuse and Morgan's masseuse ask them the same question. Connor nods, but Morgan declines. Meanwhile, Matt is stripped down naked and instructed to lay face down on the warm, clothed table. Connor is taken to his sectioned off room and stripped naked as well. Morgan waits for them in the lobby after finishing his foot massage.<br>\r\nMatt is asked to turn over and a small cloth is placed over his penis, however Connor is left stark naked to which he gets embarrassed as he can't hide his semi-erect penis. As his body is massaged more, his penis becomes erect. Connor tries to hold back, but ends up splaying his toes and erupting. His masseuse smiles and cleans him up. Matt has the same reaction to his massage, but is able to control his erection. A moment or two later, the two boys are dressed by their masseuses and escorted out to the waiting room. After paying, they leave to get something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She slipped off my flops from my bare feet, then my shirt, shorts and boxers and motioned me to lay down on my stomach\". <br>\r\nMatt chimes in \"Mine pulled my shoes and socks off and caressed my bare feet before undressing the rest of me\". Connor looks down at Matt's shoes and says \"...then warm oil was kneaded and massaged into my back, legs, feet, arms and even my buttocks. She kept trying to grab my balls. When I turned over, I thought my penis would at least be covered, but it wasn't. It was already half erect from my thighs and bare feet being massaged. She poured more oil all over my front and worked it in giving me a full erection. I looked up at her as she smiled and pressed on my abs touching my penis\". <br>\r\nMatt chimes in again \"At least I was covered with a cloth. It didn't stay on long since my erection made it fall off\". Morgan gives him a weird look.<br>\r\nConnor continues saying \"She saw that I was about to erupt, so she moved down to my bare feet and massaged my toes. That was the breaking point. I splayed my toes and a huge gusher came out onto my chest. I collapsed, but she continued even took each big toe into her mouth and sucked on them\". Matt looks down at Connor's bare feet.<br>\r\nMatt replies \"You got a happy ending bro! I was able to control my erection and didn't erupt, but came close. She smiled at my penis and even touched it\". <br>\r\nMorgan exclaims \"She touched your penis? Wow...\".<br>\r\nMatt continues \"I moved her hand away and asked her to finish massaging my feet. She frowned and gave my toes a good massage. I didn't know what to expect from my body from the powers I've inherited. After a hot towel, she helped me dress and even put on my shoes and socks on my feet\". <br>\r\nConnor chimes in \"Mine did to and even said in broken English...You have good feet...good toes...you come back soon. She helped me dress and after putting on my flops, kissed my big toes\". Connor looks down at his bare toes and wiggles them.<br>\r\nMorgan sulks saying \"Now I wish I would have taken them up on the offer of a cheap massage\". <br>\r\nMatt replies \"There will be other changes Morgan. We need to get back before it gets dark. Let's pay the bill and get ready to take off\". They all finish, pay their bills and walk over to a nearby alley. Morgan and Connor take off their flops while Matt takes off his shoes and socks. They secure their footwear and Matt tells them to hold on again to his bare ankles.

He knocks on the door and Matt's younger brother Damian answers the door. Damian is already for bed and dressed in his pajama shirt and shorts and barefoot. His bare feet are lightly tan, hairless with no blemishes with pedicured, slender toes. <br>\r\nMorgan says \"Hey Damian, you going to bed already? It's only nine o'clock\". Damian wiggles his bare toes and says \"I got grounded from staying out past curfew. No TV, no iPhone, no video games, no shoes or socks, no friends over for two weeks!\". <br>\r\nMorgan asks \"Wow, all that for staying out past your curfew? What do you mean no shoes or socks?\". Morgan walks in the house after taking his shoes off at the door.<br>\r\nDamian replies \"I would have received a harder sentence, but my parents went lenient on me this time. I not allowed outside in bare feet, so my mom took all my socks and two pair of shoes away and locked them up. I have to stay barefoot and only stay inside\". <br>\r\nMorgan says \"Can't you wear flops?\". Damian replies \"My dad took them too\". <br>\r\nJust then Matt comes to the front room and says \"Hey Morgan, Damian stop pestering him with your punishments. Come on Morgan, lets go up to my room to watch TV!\". Morgan smiles and follows Matt upstairs as Damian stands there barefoot and mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Morgan lays down on Matt's bed as Matt sits in a beanbag at the foot of the bed. Morgan's socked feet hang over the end of the bed near Matt. Matt says \"Hey, what kind of movie do you want to watch and when did you last change your socks?\". Matt moves Morgan's socked feet away. Morgan moves them back saying \"Just a while ago and their just old not dirty and stinky. My mom is washing my clothes and this is the only pair I had\". Matt lightly tickles Morgan's socked soles making them twitch. Morgan yells \"Stop it Matt!\". They both continue to watch the DVD on TV, but Matt slowly tugs off Morgan's socks revealing his big tan feet and tickles them with his fingers. Morgan's bare soles and toes are tortured by Matt's fingers. Matt holds onto Morgan's feet to keep them from fleeing. \"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,haaaaaaaaahaaaaaaaaaaaaa\" screams Morgan as he tries to pull his bare feet away. He splays his toes and laughs uncontrollably. Matt's brother Damian comes running in to see what all the noise is about. Morgan sees Damian and says \"Oh Damian, help me and get your brother to stop tickling my bare feet. I can't stand it anymore\". <br>\r\nInstead of helping Morgan, Damian joins in on the fun, tickling Morgan's right bare foot as his brother takes the left bare foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">After so many failures with cloning Superman, from the deformed and stupid Bizarros, to the good intentioned Superboy Kon-El, Lex Luthor has decided to once again attempt to create his own copy of the Man of Steel. This time however he's decided on something different. Obviously a direct clone was impossible as they merely degenerated into a Bizarro, and Kon-El was a clone who was probably influenced by Superman's DNA instead of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Lex Luthor murmured to himself in the darkness of his base's private chambers. Despite having lost LexCorp and been forced into hiding, he still kept his taste for corporate-style surroundings and as such had fashioned his private chambers on the ones he'd had at LexCorp and his manor. So now he sat at his desk, staring out across the ocean as his brilliant mind worked its magic. \"What if I took a child, young and vulnerable, and infused him with kryptonian DNA. Then I could wipe his mind and turn him into the perfect weapon to bring order to the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's what he did. He had two of his agents kidnap an eleven-year old boy from a park and brought to his lab unconscious. Not wanting to pass up the oppurtunity Lex used his connections in Intergang to obtain genetic material from several other aliens and spliced them together. With that done he injected the serum he'd created and it started to work. Unfortunately he'd forgotten to reapply the anesthetic he was using for the boy and he awoke, his memories still intact. In a fit of terror and anger he trashed the lab and fled the island to return home to Metropolis...<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay so the main character is Matt Andrews, an eleven-year old boy from Metropolis kidnapped by Lex Luthor and turned into a mutant containing a large range of alien DNA. He has long, shaggy dirty blond hair, blue eyes and has a slim and athletic build. You can decide if the addition of alien DNA has caused any muscle growth in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere Kryptonians were given their powers by genetic manipulation in their past, solar energy has nothing to do with it. They also possess a very very basic disguise ability allowing them to slightly alter their appearence if they wish to hide their identity. In addition the Kryptonian's powers are toned down considerably from what Superman has had in the comics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers he starts with:<br>\r\n-Super Strength (strong enough to lift buildings and bridges with relative ease)<br>\r\n-Super Speed (can move at mach 1 speeds)<br>\r\n-Super Durability (sometimes called 'invulnerability', Matt constantly generates a skin-tight forcefield that blocks most small projectiles like bullets and even can stand up to machine gun fire for a short time)<br>\r\n-Super Stamina (able to act at maximum capability for at least twelve hours without tiring)<br>\r\n-Flight (though technically more like levitation, he can control his direction and so is considered flight)<br>\r\n-Basic Disguise Ability (can make slight alterations to his appearence to hide his identity)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n-Don't be afraid to get a little violent, but don't overdo it. Blood is okay, guts aren't.<br>\r\n-Alot if up to the authors, I'm not going to be too much of a nazi<br>\r\n-No killing the main character off right off the bat, that's anti-climatic and, as far as I'm concerned, spam<br>\r\n-Third-person perspective please<br>\r\n-Don't get too wild with the extent of his powers, there needs to still be some challenge for him<br>\r\n-Some basic grammar please, this is WRITING.com, so you know, proper period and capital placement, spaces after periods. Just grade 1 stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all I can think of. 5000 GPS for additions.</td>",
