I literally can't even think of a less exciting way to spend my Saturday night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on. I know for a fact that you love board games. You're the most competitive one out of the entire group,\" offered Jane. \"Remember playing Uno back in eighth grade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. You know we all got pretty heated back then,\" Claire said defensively. \"Besides, if there's a competitive one in the group, it's definitely Allison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria chuckled. \"True. Allison is a stone cold bitch when it comes to games. She once punched a kid for cheating at four square way back in second grade. I bet she once killed a man in Reno just to watch him die,\" she said gigging at her own joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Allison's turn to get defensive. \"Like I would ever do anything like that.\" All three of her friends stopped in their tracks and just gave her a look as if to say <i>please</i>. \"Okay fine, that sounds exactly like something I would do. In my defense, though, it was Paul Hammond and we all know that little asshole deserves anything coming his way.\" They all laughed in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch was the rapport between Jane Wilkins, Claire Roberts, Allison Stann, and Maria Longoria. All four had been such close friends ever since middle school and continued that relationship throughout high school. Though they all develop certain passions and interests, they never drifted apart some over friend groups had over the years. As much as they looked forward to graduating in the summer months and starting college in the fall, there was a sense of dread between them. They would never hang out and be together the same way ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was they had made a concerted effort to spend as much time together as they possible could between now and the time the fall semester began. Even the most mundane activities were planned as group outings. Though spending an evening playing board games didn't sound like the most exciting proposition, none of them would trade that time with her friends for anything in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was the athlete of the group. She was a star volleyball player as well as a top runner on the track. While she wouldn't be considered the prettiest of the group, she was nonetheless very cute. Jane's face was certainly very pretty and her sleek black hair accentuated it wonderfully. Her body was the thing that turned heads as she walked. Not very buxom with her B cups, she turned heads with legs and ass. Her sleek, toned, athletic thighs and her heart-shaped behind were a sight to behold any time she showed up in yoga pants or leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhereas Jane succeeded on the field, Claire excelled in the classroom. She was easily the smartest of the group, though not to diminish any of the other girls' academic successes. Claire just happened to be one of the smartest people in the whole school. She was bookish, though she was hesitant and slightly embarrassed to call herself a geek or a nerd. She was quite a head turner herself. Her cute pale,face was framed with gorgeous auburn hair. She was the most buxom one of the group as she was a very early bloomer and as such had cute, pert D cup breasts that seemed to defy the laws of gravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery group of friends has its leader, its alpha so to speak. Though no girl in the group would have admitted it openly, it was a well known secret that Allison was by far the most popular one of the group. She was the one that all plans and events revolved around. When she wasn't around her normal friends she could be spotted among the most popular kids in school. Allison was the considered the hottest one out of the group. She possessed a face that could only be described as gorgeous with perfect blonde hair. Her figure was a perfect hourglass. Her C cup breasts gave spectators something to ogle from the front and her nice, round ass gave them something to stare at from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was the every girl of the group. Outside of the bunch there was no specific clique that she identified with. One day she could be hanging out the jocks, one day the popular crowd, and the next day the nerds. Her tan complexion gave her a beautiful exotic look. Like Jane she carried her weight in her backside, though much more so. She was slim from the waist up with a modest bust but from the waist below she was a sight to behold. She had an ass was considered locally famous and yet was as firm and luscious as one could only wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving inside Jane's house, no one could imagine what the future would behold, what changes were to come. They could have played a classic card game or watched a movie or any of that sort. Yet they decided that tonight would be game night and tonight the fateful game would be... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I've never seen it,\" Allison asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane looked quizzically at the box. \"I have no idea,\" she said as she inspected the weathered and beaten exterior. \"<b>Battle of the Bulge:</b> The Game of Expanding Horizons. Why don't I remember this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire came up behind her and fetched the box from Jane. \"Well that doesn't matter. We've played Uno like a thousand times and I swear to God if something yells Yahtzee one more time I'm going to cut a bitch,\" she said in a tone that would suggest she was half joking and half serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire opened the box and enthusiastically set up the game board. \"Looks like we've got a pair of dice and a couple of  metal figurines for everyone. Now where are the instructions?\" Looking around for a long list of information about the game she was puzzled to find just a lone piece of paper with just one instruction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gather each player and roll to determine order.\" She looked on both sides of the page to make sure she wasn't missing anything and was disappointed to find no other information. \"That's it? That's all we're supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison chimed in inspecting the simple game board. \"I mean it looks a CandyLand knock off. Whoever gets to the end first wins. Easy enough.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed it just was simple board with 30 to 40 multicolored tiles marking the path from Start to Finish. Every 4 spaces or so, there was tile marked with gold star that seemed to signify something important. Along with the pair of dice come a blank deck of playing cards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the girls gathered their figurine and took turns rolling the dice for turns. Jane rolled a 6, Claire a 7, Allison a 4, and Maria a 10. Maria had look of victory upon her face. \"Looks like the first of many accomplishments to come.\" Little did she notice her figurine slowly morph itself to emulate the figure of herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You suck.\" Maria appreciated the sportsmanship from her closest friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her first turn, Maria confidently began to shake the dice in her hands. \"Come on, momma needs a new pair of shoes.\" She threw the dice down on the board to reveal a 5 and a 2. \"Seven.\" Just as she reached for the figure, little Maria moved along the board by itself. Spooked, she was hesitant to move on. \"Umm, did anybody else see that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane gave a shrug of her shoulders. \"Probably some sort of magnet or something. I'd forget about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot entirely convinced but ready to move on, she was about to hand the dice to Claire when sudden a strange feeling hit her. A pit formed in the bottom of her stomach that made her feel slightly nauseous. Suddenly the feeling in her stomach subsided as a tingling sensation spread throughout her body. It was a though she had hit her funny bone but multiplied by 100 throughout her whole body. As sudden as the feeling hit her, it suddenly subsided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth to Maria.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was awoken from her trance. Confused as to what just happened she shook her head to gather her thoughts. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane just stared back at her expectantly. \"I believe it's <i>my </i>turn,\" she said holding her hand out for the pair of dice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill recovering, Maria finally realized what she was about to do. \"Oh yeah. Sorry. Just kind of spaced out there for a second.\" She dropped the dice in Jane's waiting hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally,\" Jane said eagerly awaiting her turn. Maria was still curious as to what just occurred. She shifted her place in her seat trying to get in a comfortable position to process what just happened. Did her body feel a little...softer? She rubbed her hands along her thighs. Was she getting a little doughy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to assess the state of her body, Maria was interrupted by the sound of dice hitting the board as Jane rolled a...</span></div></div>",

This time it was her figurine that began to slide along the board the requisite amount spaces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the figurine hit the 11th tile, a peculiar  feeling began to hit her too. Like Maria before her, a giant pit formed in her stomach that made her feel quite nauseous. She felt as though she were going to throw up and had the slight urge to wretch right then and there. The room began to slightly shift from side to side and made her feel as though her head was spinning. Just as she felt the need to leave the room, the feeling immediately subsided and she felt instantly better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane suddenly realized that there were three other pairs of eyes that were looking at her. \"What?\" she curiously asked. \"I just felt a little sick there for a second. No big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked cautiously at her friend. \"You spaced out just like Maria just did. That doesn't strike you as more than just a little weird?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, like, no. It probably is just a coincidence. No need to break out the tin foil hats,\" Jane half joked. There was a cautious chuckle that filled the room. \"Whatever, I'm going to get myself something to drink if you bitches want anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Jane was about to get up from her seat on the floor, she realized that it took a lot more effort than she guessed it would have. It felt as though her body was...heavier. Getting to her feet, she suddenly realized just how tight her waistband of her leggings were. God, when did this happen? She was always careful to watch what she ate and she exercised like no other. She could feel her emotions rising and she needed to get out of the room.  Careful not to let friends see, she quickly shuffled out of the room. Was her ass jiggling with each step?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria, however, was not one to let that go that easily. Was it possible that Jane had gone through the same thing that Maria herself had experienced just moments before? She couldn't help but notice that her friend was obviously flustered as she left the room. Did she look a little...doughy too? Did her ass look bigger than before? The thought of her friend putting on weight made Maria even more self-conscious about her own possible gain. She covertly poked her own stomach and noted that it wasn't quite as firm as she remembered. It seemed more soft than she remembered. Shifting in her spot on the couch, did her butt feel a little larger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was the next to go and eagerly grabbed the pair of dice. \"While Jane is being weird somewhere else I'm just going to ahead with my turn.\" She cupped the dice in her hands and proceeded to roll a...</span></div></div>",

As with every week, students across the college had already begun preparing for the numerous parties, drinking games, and other kinds of debauchery the rural liberal arts college was known for. That night, though, things were going to be very different for a small group of girls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jill, Jill! Is the booze almost ready? They'll be here in like five!\" the woman named Riley yelled as she ferociously cleaned the living room. She was a fairly average looking woman, slender and not very curvy. It was only her cute face and adorable smile that kept her from being unremarkable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet down, whiney,\" Jill said as she entered the room, arms filled with bottles of vodka, Jack, and other good mixing drinks. Compared to Riley, Jill was noticeably more attractive. More meat in her breasts and butt meant that guys actually tried to steal looks at the brunette's curvy figure. Her butt, in particular, was noticeable plump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill placed the bottles on a table with a loud thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think this will be enough for Desi?\" Jill asked. \"That girls drinks like a fish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, that's not very nice...\" Riley corrected as she swept some trash into a bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen her gut, though? She's only been here for three months and her belly's already bulging out from under her shirts from all the booze she drinks. I'm not <i>trying</i> to be mean, but serious, that girl gives new meaning to the to the phrase 'freshman fifteen'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley's head snapped towards the small wooden box sitting on the table upon hearing the phrase. Freshman Fifteen was the name of the game that they had all agreed to play tonight. It was a gift from her very rotund mother, who had told her that it was sure to change her college experience, perhaps her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the buzzer rang. Panicking, Riley urged to off to answer the door as she opened the box and began to set up the pieces. It was a fairly normal looking board game; the cardboard square had all kinds of colored spaces and a few decks to draw from. With no time to read the rules, she merely put the five tokens on the start space and placed the players cards around the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're heeeeeere!\" Desi, the fat-bellied girl announced as she entered the room. \"Where's the liquor? I need to get my drunk on~\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls dug into the booze, pouring and mixing drinks as Riley herself began to take in the rules. Again, the game seemed normal. Nothing odd or especially racy. The only odd part was the player card; it seemed to have her information already filled out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley Jacobs<br>\r\nBreast Size\u00a0\u00a0{s\u00a0\u00a0}Motherliness             <br>\r\no<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">oooooooo \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0oooo<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">ooooo<br>\r\nButt Size\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maturity<br>\r\no<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">oooooooo\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0oooo<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">ooooo<br>\r\nBelly Size\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{s\u00a0\u00a0}Aggressiveness<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">ooooooooo\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0oo<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">ooooooo<br>\r\nThighs/Hips\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Submissiveness<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">ooooooooo\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0oooooo<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">ooo<br>\r\nHeight\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Slutiness<br>\r\no<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">oooooooo\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">oooooooo<br>\r\nAge\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Friendliness<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">ooooooooo\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0oooooo<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">ooo<br>\r\nGestation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ditziness<br>\r\noooooooooo\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">ooooooooo<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must've been Mom,\" she reasoned. \"Least she got most of this right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chug chug chug!\" the other girls chanted as Desi downed an entire glass in one go. Annoyed at her friends fascination with getting wasted, Riley decided it would be best to give the first roll and get the game started. After glancing through the rules, she gave the die a toss. It bounced across the table, clinking against some of the glasses before coming up one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" Riley whined, grabbing the girls attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great start, eh?\" Jill said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up,\" Riley replied as she moved her blue token onto the first square. It was also blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, from what I skimmed, that means I have to draw from the blue pile. Which, according to the rules, is an inter-group challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An inter-what?\" Desi asked between drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means I have to do a challenge that involves you all, I think. Red squares involve us going outside and doing things to strangers,orange and challenges between specific players, and green are personal challenges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she picked up the first card from the blue deck and read the topic to the group. It read...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead of going out like they normally do, they decide to play it safe and enjoy a board and card games. Little do they know is that the person that entered the game may not be the same as the person who exits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe focus of this story will be mostly female WG but feel free to add elements of TG, pregnancy, DG,AP, or personality/identity changes so long as WG is involved in some capacity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile WG is certainly the main focus of the story, don't make the girls too large. We don't want a girl becoming a full ton or the size of a planet or anything like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove all, be creative, have fun, and add a chapter!</td>",
