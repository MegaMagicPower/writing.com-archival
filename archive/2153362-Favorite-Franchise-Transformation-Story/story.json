The last thing he remembered was him and his partner, Lucario, taking a short rest in the forest.<br>\r\nThe two of them had noticed a faint light coming from behind a bush and when they investigated, they had found a strange, glowing stone. They both reached out and touched it at the same time, but that caused the stone to give off a powerful flash, which then caused them both to black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, Cameron slowly opened his eyes, only to find that everything seemed to be spinning, which caused him to close his eyes again and put a hand on his head to try and stop the spinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a second... A hand?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron snapped his eyes open, all traces of dizzyness and exhaustion gone. He slowly moved his hands in front of him, stared at them for a few seconds and then let out a scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaaaah! I have hands! I'm not supposed to have hands! Why do I have hands???\" Cameron's eyes then spotted his arms. \"Waaaaah! And what happened to my arms? Where has all my fur gone?!?\" Cameron looked down at himself, getting speechless at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of seeing the yellow fur with a spike on his chest like he was used to, Cameron was looking at a yellow t-shirt with orange stripes on the shoulders! Moving his sight further downwards, he also saw that instead of his usual blue-furred thighs and black-furred legs, there was now a fur-less pair of legs wearing blue shorts with orange stripes on the sides, white socks and a pair of orange-and-black shoes with white soles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what's going on?\" stuttered Cameron. \"H-how did I..... Hey..... These clothes look like.....\" Acting on a hunch, Cameron used his hands to touch his face, thus discovering the orange headband on his head and the white scarf around his neck, confirming his hunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaaaah!\" he screamed again. \"I-I have Lucario's body... I h-have Lucario's clothes... I AM Lucario... I'm in the body of a Pok\u00e9mon!!!\" Cameron was freaking out about being in a Pok\u00e8mon's body, until the freak-out temporarily stopped as a thought came to him.<br>\r\n\"Wait... if I'm in Lucario's body, then that must mean that Lucario...\" Cameron gasped at the realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow on the verge of full-blown panic, Cameron frantically looked around until he spotted his own body right beside him: his own furry body with the black forepaws with the spikes on the back, blue arms, yellow torso with another spike on the chest, blue shorts-like thighs and black hindpaws, blue tail, blue and black 'masked' face, pointed ears, and black dreadlock-like feelers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Cameron a moment to get over the shock of seeing his own body from an outside perspective, but he quickly composed himself.</span></div></div>",

Remember; with this option, the clothes will adjust to perfectly fit the new wearer and if he swaps with a Mobian, Like Sonic, all of Chris' clothes will fit them perfectly, while Chris himself is left naked. (Or almost naked, depending on what the Mobian in question is wearing).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe it's something a little weirder; with Chris swapping perceptions on whose clothes belongs to whom, with someone?<br>\r\nFor those that don't know, it means that Chris and whomever he swaps with (even if the other swapee is a Mobian, who usually don't need much clothing) will think that their own clothes really belongs to one another; even if those clothes won't fit them properly.<br>\r\nTo give an example: if Chris were to swap perceptions on clothes with Sonic, they both now feel uncomfortable wearing their own clothes, even though they fit them perfectly, and think that they should really be wearing each other's clothes.<br>\r\nErgo; they will both think that Sonic should be wearing what is really Chris clothes, (the red short-sleaved shirt with white sleaves, a yellow collar, a yellow regtangle on the end of each of the sleaves and one on the front of the shirt; the long-sleaved dark-blue undershirt, with a turquise stripe running down the middle of each sleave; blue jeans with a turquise stripe above each of the knees; a green belt hanging off the edge of the jeans; white socks; and a pair of stylish blue and yellow shoes with gray soles and a turquise stripe running down the middle of the toes), even though the clothes are made to be worn by humans and not Mobians and as such are a little too big for him, and that Chris should be wearing what is really Sonic's clothes, (the white gloves and red-and-white sneakers), even though they are made to be worn by Mobians and not by human boys and as such are a little too small for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope the second option is understandable enough.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a beautiful Saturday morning. Inside the Thorndyke Mansion, Chris was waking up. He'd been sleeping a little longer than usual, even by his weekend standards, because he had the whole house to himself today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis parents had decided to invite the whole house, including Sonic and his friends, to the set of his mother's newest film. Chris had politely declined; he'd been on such tours many times before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why he was alone today. Sonic and the others wouldn't be back until evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris yawned, streched and got out of bed. But before he could do anything else, a bright light and a wooshing sound came from outside and attracted his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" he said to himself and walked over to the window. He'd barely made it over there, before the light and the noise became a lot more intense. A few seconds later the light and the noise vanished, as something impacted on his lawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! What was that?\" exclaimed Chris. Still wearing his light-blue pyjamas, Chris hurried outside to see what had crashed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got there, he saw that whatever had crashed into the ground had left a small crater from the impact. Looking into the crater, he saw what appeared to be a Chaos Emerald laying there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird,\" said Chris to himself. \"What is a Chaos Emerald doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out to touch the Emerald. The moment he did, his head was filled with information about it. Appearently it wasn't one of the Chaos Emeralds, but a different kind called a Change Emerald. According to the new information in his head, this Emerald had the abillity to change/transform/alter whatever and whoever the holder of the Emerald wanted to, with no limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the flow of information stopped, Chris went over it in his head. Being of a scientific mind, he was rather sceptical about the capabillities of this Change Emerald. He figured it was best to test it out first, but he was reluctant to use himself as the guiniapig, at least not yet. Instead, he looked around the yard for a better target...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes were drawn to a tiny little bird, small enough to fit in the palm of his hand, flittering around bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, here goes nothing...' thought Chris, as he gripped the Emerald firmly and concentrated on what should happen to the bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a quick flash of light from the Emerald. When it died down, Chris saw that the little bird was now inside a birdcage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah! That actually worked!\" Chris was so surprised that he said it out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the Emerald again, Chris thought: 'So, this thing is not some kind of joke, or a trap by Eggman! It actually does change everything however I want it!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris didn't spend much time thinking about what he should do next. Grabbing the birdcage, he hurried back up to his own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird didn't mind the sudden speed; in fact, it was surprisingly calm about the whole thing. That was because Chris didn't only want the bird to be in a cage; he also wanted it to be a domesticated bird that could be kept as a pet, instead of something like a canary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came back to his room, Chris gently placed the birdcage on the table he had in there. He then walked over and stood in front of his mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now that I know that the Change Emerald is the real deal,' he thought, 'I'd like to know, if it can change me too. Nothing too big though; I just want to make sure that it can alter living things too. But, how do I best test it out? And what should I change?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chris stood and thought hard about what he should try changing on himself, his eyes fell on the reflection of his new bird. Then he got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This could be an interesting experiment to try. I think I'll do it!\" decided Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more gripping the Emerald tightly, Chris thought about the change he wanted to happen. When the Emerald flashed, Chris closed his eyes. He could feel the change taking place, causing him to be disoriented for a moment. When the weird feeling had passed, he opened his eyes again and looked at his reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he knew what he had changed and was prepared for what he would see, he was still surprised by the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still mostly himself; a 12-year old boy in a light-blue pyjamas. The only thing wrong about that reflection, was his head. Because it was no longer his head, nor was it even a human head. Instead, he now had the head of a bird, on top of his human body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't just any bird's head; it was an exact copy of the head of the bird in the cage! Furthermore, it was also the same exact size as the original, meaning that Chris' new bird-head was ridiculously undersized on his human body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris just stared at his new bird-head for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Unbelievable!' thought Chris. 'I can't believe that actually worked! This Change Emerald is amazing!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris leaned forward slightly to get a better look at his new head. The first thing he noticed, was that his neck had also shrunk to better fit in size to his new bird-head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing he noticed, was that he had to pull down the collar of his pyjamas slightly, so he could look at his reflection. Otherwise, because of the size of his new bird-head, the top of the pj's would have obscured his line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third thing he noticed, was that because of the tiny bird-head that he now had, everything seemed to be a lot bigger than usual; the mirror, his bed, the table, even his own body! When he looked to one side or the other, he could see the high collar of his pyjamas completely blocking his line of sight to his shoulders; his bird-head was THAT small!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Chris brought one of his hands up to his new head. It looked like the hand belonged to a giant, to his bird-eyes. Very carefully, he used one of his fingers to stroke his bird-head. It was a very odd sensation, feeling his new tiny feathers being simultaniously stroked by his finger, and feeling the feathers under his human hand. He also marveled at the seamless transition between feathers and skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more marveling, Chris decided to do something else. 'I can't just stand here and look at my new head all day. I'd better change back, so I can get my clothes on.' He was just about to change back to normal with the Emerald, when he had a funny thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You know, maybe I shouldn't change back just yet. I think it's actually fun to have the head of a bird. But I don't want to stay like this forever; just for a little while.' Chris thought more about it. 'I think I'll keep my bird-head until I've gotten my clothes on. That seems like a fitting amount of time.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving decided what to do, Chris made to walk over to his closet, only to stumble and fall down on his stomach right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, why did I fall down?' thought Chris, as he picked himself up, or tried to. He answered his own question, when he realized that it was more difficult for him to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course!' thought Chris. 'Because of my tiny head, my hight- and depth-perceptions are all wrong! I'll have to try and adjust to this...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and clumsily, Chris got back on his feet. His theory was correct; because he had a tiny bird-head on top of his normal-sized human body, the size difference between them, was messing both with his line of sight and his sense of balance. This was clearly appearent as he moved over to his closet to get his clothes; he had to walk very slowly and wobbley, swaying his arms around just to keep his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally made it to his closet, it took him a bit longer to find his clothes than normal, because his bird-head was so tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, so it's a bit harder than I thought', Chris admitted to himself. 'Walking around with the head of a bird, instead of my own, is definitely weird and just feels bizzare! But, I made a decision and I am sticking to it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he found his clothes, Chris made his way back to his bed, still walking awkwardly. When he got there, the first thing he did was to take off his pyjamas. It was a little thougher for him to do it, because of his bird-head and when he removed the pyjama-shirt, he also had to make sure that his new beak didn't snag on the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he put on his regular clothes, Chris couldn't resist taking another look at himself in the mirror. He thought it was even funnier than the last time; a tiny little bird-head on top of human body, only wearing a pair of tighty-whities. The whole thing looked so absurd!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that distraction out of the way, Chris proceeded to putting on his clothes, which was a bit of a challenge because of his bird-head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of his altered line of sight, Chris had to stand in front of the mirror, ib order to put on his jeans; otherwise he would have been unable to do it right. When he put on his long-sleaved T-shirt, and his short-sleaved shirt, he once more had to be careful that new beak wouldn't get stuck in the fabric. He also had to stand in front of the mirror to put on his socks and shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was quite amazed with himself. 'I actually managed to put on my clothes, while having the head of a bird!' he thought. 'But, as fun as it was, I'd better get back to normal now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the Emerald, he did just that and he was actually glad to have his own human head back on his shoulders. But one question remained: should he try using the Emerald some more on himself, or wait and let Tails have a look at it, when he comes back?</span></div></div>",

However; even though he would not like the idea of Mokuba in his body improving his (dubious) friendship with Yugi, he'd most likely still allow it; foe since he is now in Mokuba's body, he doesn't want to do anything that might shatter Mokuba's friendship with Yugi and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, how does the Kaiba brothers end up swapping bodies?</span></div></div>",

It gave him the opportunity to try to beat some of his friends in a swimming competition. Although he never won any of these contests, he  always had a great time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma was currently sitting on a bench catching his breath after the latest of these contests. Suddenly, he noticed something on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what's that?\" he said to himself. Taking a closer look, he saw that it was a Duel Monsters card!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange; what's a Duel Monsters card doing here? Maybe someone lost it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma picked up the card to get a better look at it. But as soon as he turned it around to see what kind of card it was, the card let out a bright flash, forcing Yuma to shield his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Yuma could see again, he noticed that the card had vanished!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh! Where did it go?\" said Yuma as he looked around for it. But it was gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Man, that was strange,' thought Yuma. 'I wonder what kind of card it was? Guess I'll never...' His thoughts were interrupted when he got a look at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was wearing his swim trunks as usual during swim class. However, unknown to Yuma, the strange card he had found contained a mischievous spell, causing anyone whom picked it up to believe that they were supposed to wear a different outfit than their normal one during certain actvities. Which was why Yuma had starting freaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAH!!!\" exclaimed Yuma as he attempted to cover himself up. \"W-why am I wearing my swim trunks? I'm not supposed to wear these to swim class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma took a quick look at the others. Fortunatly, there was so much noise in the area that no one had heard him scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good, no one heard me,' thought Yuma. 'I'd better go and get changed into my swimwear before anyone notices me lile this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick as a flash, Yuma slipped out of the pool area and back into the locker room. Once he opened his own locker, he began to change into what he thought he was supposed to wear for swim class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich attire does Yuma think is his swimwear?</span></div></div>",

'That's not one of my cards; I've already checked my Deck. So, how did it get here?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma picked up the mysterious card, but when he turned it around to see what kind of card it was, it let out a bright flash which forced Yuma to shield his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Yuma could see again he noticed that the card was no longer in his hand, which was odd since he hadn't let go of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Huh? Where did the card go?' thought Yuma as he looked around for it. 'How could it have vanished? Maybe...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted when he got a look at himself, or rather what he was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Yuma didn't know was that the card he had found was a magical card which had a sort of mind of it's own; a mischievous one, at that. Anyone who picked up the card would have a slight change to their minds, causing the person in question to believe that the clothes that they would normally wear at certain times was the wrong ones to wear at that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Yuma didn't know anything about this, but he was still affected by the card; which was why he started freaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What the...?!?\" he exclaimed as he gently tugged on his t-shirt. \"Why am I suddenly wearing this? Hey; it must have been that card that did this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma quickly went over to his closet and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't believe that card swapped my nightwear with another of my outfits,' he thought. 'Now I have to find my nightwear and put them on again. What an annoying card!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short moment, Yuma had found the outfit that he thought was his usual nightwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, what attire was it really?</span></div></div>",

But, does this swap happen gradually, or instantly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it happens gradually, then Yuma will slowly gain the dog's personality traits over a period of time; anywhere from a few hours to a couple of days. (For maximum awkwardness, make it a couple of days!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example; after the event which causes this to happen, Yuma could wake up the next morning and either feeling uncomfortable wearing clothes, panting like a dog, longing to drink the water in the toilet bowl, walking on all fours, ect. Whatever the trait, Yuma will notice that he now has these feelings and will start to freak out about it.<br>\r\nHowever, he will try to suppress those feelings at first, so that no one will know what's going on.<br>\r\n(For example; if Yuma gets the feeling that he should be walking on all fours, he will know that this is wrong and he will walk on two legs instead, even though it starts to feel unnatural to him.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Yuma won't be able to suppress it forever and eventually he will subconciously start to 'give in' to those feelings, even though he doesn't want to.<br>\r\n(To use the above example; during the day, Yuma starts to feel more and more like he should be walking on all fours, even though he is still human. Eventually, this feeling will become so strong that his body subconciously gets down on all fours, with Yuma unable to prevent it. Since Yuma is aware of what's going on, he starts to freak out over the fact that he is now on all fours like a dog.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it happens instantly, then Yuma will have all of the dog's traits immediately, while the dog will have all of Yuma's equivelant traits!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember!!! Since it is only a partial swap, Yuma still maintains his human mind, thoughts, speech capabillities and self-awareness; he's just unconciously acting just like a dog!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, how fast will the swap be?</span></div></div>",

Since they both want to be better friends, they go in, but when they come out they discover that the way the cave makes people better friends, is by swapping their bodies!<br>\r\nAlthough they are at first excited to be each other, things take a turn for the worse when they discover the Marines have a base on this island.<br>\r\nNormally, it wouldn't be much of a problem, but Luffy and Chopper aren't used to each other's bodies/Devil Fruit powers, which makes things problematic...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: One night, a light shines out on the deck of the Thousand Sunny, which wakes up Luffy and Chopper. When they go out to see what it is, they find a strangely shimmering black rock.<br>\r\nEntranced by it's light, Luffy and Chopper both touch the stone at the same time, but when they do, the stone flashes and they pass out.<br>\r\nWhen they wake up again, they find out that Chopper is now in Luffy's body, while Luffy is in Chopper's body!<br>\r\nAt first, they are excited to be in each other's bodies, but then Chopper points out that the black stone has dissappeared, which means that they can't swap back! (At least not right away...)<br>\r\nIn order to not worry the others, Luffy and Chopper both agree to act like each other until they can find a way to swap back, but as they discover, that's easier said than done.<br>\r\nAlthough they have slightly similar personalities, Chopper finds it difficult to imitate Luffy when interacting with the other crewmembers, while Luffy can't quite keep his excitement down when he finds out that he can now understand what animals are saying, due to being in Chopper's body.<br>\r\nThings become more difficult for them when the Marines attack. Since they are not used to each other's Devil Fruit powers, Chopper ends up continually stretching Luffy's body's limbs in the wrong directions, while Luffy almost constantly switches between Chopper's body's different forms, making him very dizzy and as much of a danger to his crewmates as to the Marines...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich storyline do you want to go with?</span></div></div>",

This wasn't too hard to do for her, being an openminded rabbit such as herself. But the first step to being a modern mammal, and by some pressuring from Nick, was to get a new cellphone. And so Judy did, taking advice from Nick on a supposedly reputable shop for electronics that was only one step removed from operating out of a van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Judy got herself a new phone with all sorts of fancy gadgets and gizmos to it. It took her most of the night to import all her old contacts and pictures, it was only in the morning when she could get a better look at the thing and what it already came with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she discovered a few apps already installed, including a game by the name of +Scale-.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what a strange name,\" Judy said as the app icon of an up and down arrow caught her eye. \"I wonder what it's about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a free moment before she had to run to work, she clicked on the icon and was greeted to what you would expect a cheesy, free puzzle game phone app would look like. It was one of those \"connect 3\" games and a timer on the top for about a minute. What was odd about the game was that all the icons she had to match looked strangely like body parts, namely paws, feet, tails, ears, butts, stomachs, snouts, and everything in between. Unfortunately, Judy wasn't the greatest with such games, she beat the level in the timer as the game congratulated her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Level One Complete! Calculating score...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was kind of fun,\" Judy said, unaware that the game was tallying which of the icons she had collected the most of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, this particular app was special. How it worked was it calculated the icons which had been matched the most and applied an effect to that particular body part on the player. If the player completed the level on time, it would cause a growth that was bigger the higher the number. If the player failed the timer, then it would cause that body part to shrink, also on a scale of how high the number of icons were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Judy, she had one with a moderate score of 21 collected icons. To which body part were they for though?</span></div></div>",

Judy supposed that it came with being on the streets most of his life and making use of everything he could get his paws on. But when she was first invited over to his apartment, her mouth dropped to the floor at the sight of just about every square inch of the place being filled with something. It was like walking through a maze every time she visited and it was no wonder he was always late when she came around to pick him up for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, like any good friend, she had had enough one day and ordered him to start cleaning the place out or they would no longer be stopping for coffee every morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got him moving on it real quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very next day, Judy found a rather spacious two bedroom apartment on the downtown side of Savannah as opposed to the small storehouse Nick had been living in. That wasn't to say everything was cleaned out, however. There were plenty of boxes labelled as junk scattered about the various rooms. Much furniture had been moved and was covered in a thick layer of dust as Judy skipped through the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" she said. \"You would have never had thought this was actually an apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Har har,\" Nick replied, coming from the other room while rubbing a washcloth on some goblets. \"I'll have you know that there are things in here that are priceless. Most of it is junk, sure. But you can find the odd treasure in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy just laughed as she hopped around. There was so much space in the apartment now that Judy was liable to get lost, and there was so much she hadn't seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned into the bedroom, Judy paused at a rather glaring object staring right at her. It was a black wood dresser in the corner of the room. It struck her as odd because Nick had already had a wardrobe which he kept in his closet. And there was a strange air about this one, almost like a whispering in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Nick?\" Judy called out. \"What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer partner trotted over with the washcloth thrown over his shoulder. He rolled his eyes as soon as he saw what she had been referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's Finnick's old wardrobe. Some hunk of junk he bought for cheap one day off a traveling circus. I've been holding onto it for him since he doesn't exactly have space in his van for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, what's in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothes and costumes, mostly. There was once a time where Finnick had the idea to use more disguises for our gimmicks. But I never got into it, much to his disappointment. Fancy a look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy couldn't help but feel a strange calling to her as she approached the wardrobe. True to Nick's words, inside were all manner of clothes, big and small. Some looking for different species entirely, even a few things for an elephant though they looked built for two people to fit inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say, Carrots?\" Nick reached in and pulled out a long dress with fake diamonds sewn into it. \"Care to play dress up before work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy grinned and picked her own outfit, deciding on...</span></div></div>",

Today had been a very busy day for the ZPD's bunny officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA raid on a crooked antiques dealer, which the First Precinct had been setting up for months, had gone down today and while the dealer and his henchmen had all been arrested, the sheer amount of adrenaline she had experienced during the raid, had left her really tired. So tired, that her partner, the fox Nick Wilde, had had to drive her home to her new apartment. (A gift from the re-instated Mayor Lionheart for saving Zootopia from Bellwether's plot.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived, Nick followed Judy inside. While Judy was still wearing her police uniform, Nick had already switched to his casual outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShooting a glance at his partner, Nick playfully said: \"What's the matter, Carrots? I thought rabbits had lots of energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please; no rabbit-jokes tonight, Nick,\" groaned Judy. \"Not like you can talk; I can see that the raid took it's toll on you, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you got me there,\" admitted Nick. \"But I really eanted to make sure you got home okay before going home myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Nick,\" said Judy. \"But I'm just tired, not injured. You didn't have to...\" She trailed off as she suddenly felt something in one of her pockets. Pulling it out, she saw that it was some kind of shiny stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'cha got there, Carrots?\" asked Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Judy. \"It must have fallen into my pocket when I bumped into that shelf during the raid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy studied the stone a bit more. 'I'm sure I've heard something about a stone before, but I can't quite remember where...' thought Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, stone or not, I'd better get back home,\" said Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" replied Judy. \"We have to figure out what kind of antique this is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we do that tomorrow,\" asked Nick. \"Besides, I thought you were tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" replied Judy, \"but it's important that we identify this stone as fast as possible, to determine whether it's stolen or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nick let out another groan, Judy began to get a little annoyed with her friend and partner. Gripping the stone hard, she thought: ' That dumb fox. If only he knew what I was thinking sometimes!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy suddenly snapped out of her thought when she noticed that the stone had begun to glow. Suddenly, there was a flash of light which covered both her and Nick, as they shielded their eyes with their hand-paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them realized that the stone was changing them mentally, but they would before the end o the day...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucky was busy as usual on the farm. He was currently practicing digging up bones trying to outdig his step-brother Tripod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he digged into the ground, Lucky unearthed a glowing bone. He grew curious seeing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, what a weird looking bone\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky noticed an inscription on the bone and read it: \"Whoever holds this bone can make any wish of their's come true.\" Lucky blinked as ideas flew into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if it really works?\" Lucky eyed the bone before deciding to show it off to the other pups. He raced back home to the farm and tried to show it off to the others, only for them to disbelieve that the bone was 'magical'. Lucky was sure that his best friends, Cadpig, Rolly and Spot would believe him, but he couldn't find them anywhere. Then he remembered that it was their turn at the vet, which was why they weren't here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding nobody else with interest in the 'Wishing Bone', as he had started calling it, Lucky wondered how to prove the bone was real, eventually deciding on making a wish himself. But what should he wish for? After a bit of thinking, he got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why do I have to wait many years before I become an adult?\" he said to himself. \"With this Wishing Bone, I can become one right now! Not permanently, of course; just for a little while. It could be fun to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky quickly found a rarely visited corner of the farm, where he could find out if the Wishing Bone was the real deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouching the Wishing Bone with a paw, Lucky proclaimed: \"I wish I could be an adult!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Wishing Bone started to glow, Lucky could feel his body changing. His paws got bigger and his legs got longer. His tail also elongated, while his chest and body puffed up with muscles to support his new body-mass. Lucky had to close his eyes, as the changes reached his head. He could feel it, as his face got bigger, while his muzzle and his ears got longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the changes stopped, Lucky opened his eyes again. The first thing he saw, was that the Wishing Bone had stopped glowing. The second thing he saw, was his much bigger paw on top of the Bone, encouraging the puppy to look at the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, he wasn't a puppy anymore. Lucky had changed into a fully grown, adult dalmatian!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awesome! The Wishing Bone really works!\" said Lucky in his new deeper voice, as he looked his adult body over. \"So, this is what it feels like to be an adult! I love it! I'm as tall as my dad and I feel really strong, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked in circles to get a better look at himself, Lucky suddely stumbled and fell down on his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I'm not fully used to my new height and longer legs yet,\" mused Lucky, as he got back up. He then looked at the Wishing Bone. \"This will prove that I was telling the truth! The Bone really is magical!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky was about to pick up the Wishing Bone with his mouth, when a thought occured to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on! If I show up as an adult, the others might not believe that it's me! I'd better turn back into a puppy before I go see anyone! Besides, my friends are probably back from the vet now, so I could show them what this Bone can do. Then again, perhaps I should tell my parents about this first; they might know where the Bone came from!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at the Wishing Bone again. As Lucky stared at it, he suddenly fully realized that this Bone could make anything happen!  Maybe he should try out it's powers a little more, before showing it to someone else...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really tempting...\" said Lucky to himself. \"Although, I think I'd rather be a puppy again before I change anything else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Lucky decide to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucky was busy as usual on the farm. He was currently practicing digging up bones trying to outdig his step-brother Tripod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he digged into the ground, Lucky unearthed a glowing bone. He grew curious seeing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, what a weird looking bone,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky noticed an inscription on the bone and read it: \"Whoever touches this bone can make any wish of their's come true.\" Lucky blinked as ideas flew into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if it really works?\" Lucky eyed the bone before deciding to show it off to the other pups. He raced back home to the farm and tried to show it off to the others, only for them to disbelieve that the bone was 'magical'. Lucky was sure that his best friends, Cadpig, Rolly and Spot would believe him, but he couldn't find them anywhere. Then he remembered that it was their turn at the vet, which was why they weren't here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding nobody else with interest in the 'Wishing Bone', as he had started calling it, Lucky wondered how to prove the bone was real, eventually deciding on making a wish himself. But what should he wish for? After a bit of thinking, he got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I've always wondered what it would be like to have only two legs, like Roger and Anita,\" said Lucky to himself. \"It must be odd walking like that, instead of on all fours, like me. I don't know what it's like; my body isn't build for that. That's probably why I always fall down whenever I try it. I don't want to be a human though, but if this Bone really is magical, then I can try walking like a human, while still being a dog!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the Wishing Bone in his mouth, Lucky hurried off to a secret lake he had found inside the forest. No one else knew where this place was, which meant that he could try out the Wishing Bone without being disturbed. When he arrived, Lucky placed the Bone on the ground, eager to see if it really was magical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouching the Wishing Bone with a paw, Lucky proclaimed: \"I wish to be able to walk on two legs like a human, while still being a dog!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Wishing Bone started to glow, Lucky could feel his body changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing to change was his hind legs. Lucky actually fell on his back, when his hind legs straightened out, becoming more like the legs of a human, instead of digitigrade. His hind-paws only changed slightly to accomodate the new configuration of his legs, but otherwise they where just normal dog-paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky felt uncomfortable as his spine changed next. It too straightened out, making Lucky's body more suited for bipedal, rather than quardrupedal, movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the uncomfortable feeling reached his front legs, Lucky had to close his eyes; it didn't hurt, per se, it was just very unpleasant. He could feel the upper part of his front legs moving a bit more to the side of his body and adjusting themselves so they became shoulders. As the feeling moved further down his front legs, Lucky could feel them becoming much more flexible than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky grunted as his front paws adjusted themselves slightly and the toes on the paws elongated with a few loud pops. Just as he thought the changes were finished, Lucky suddenly felt his collar constricting his neck a little more than usual. When nothing else happened after that, Lucky finally opened his eyes again to see how much had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he looked at was his front legs. Except... they were no longer front legs. They were now much too flexible to be that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky stared in surprise as he discovered that his front legs had turned into human-like arms! And although he still had paws at the end of his new appendages, they now resembled human hands! They still had the paw-pads, but they were hands nonetheless; with the toes having turned into actual fingers! But, unlike a human hand, Lucky's new hand-paws only had three fingers and a thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I have arms! I have hands! I have fingers!!!\" Lucky chuckled to himself as he experimentally moved his new fingers, closing them to make a fist and then opening them again. \"It feels a bit weird to have them, though... Oh, well! I guess it will pass once I get used to them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky then lifted his hind-legs to get a good look at them, too. Although... technically, they were now his only legs. He grew more excited when he saw that they now closely resembled human legs! Like with his new arms, he still had paws at the end of his limbs, but unlike his new hands, his foot-paws were still those of a dog. They had just shrunk a bit so that his heels were placed as they would be on a human foot, but otherwise they were regular dog paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have legs like a human, too! This is awesome!\" grinned Lucky, as he experimentally bended his new knees. Putting his new human-like legs on the ground again, Lucky remembered something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute... I know my body has changed, but why does my collar feel so tight?\" he wondered. Looking himself over more thoroughly, it didn't take Lucky very long to discover the cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to his changed body, Lucky found out that had also grown taller! Not by much; just an inch or two, but it was still enough to cause his collar to feel a bit tight on his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm taller, too!\" exclaimed Lucky with joy. \"Not by that much, but I am taller! That Wishing Bone is amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing out of sheer excitement, Lucky allowed his joy to subside a little, before he tried out his new body. He may have been extremely excited about his new body, but he hadn't forgotten why he had wished for it in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Lucky. \"Time to find out what it's like to stand like a human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling onto his stomach, Lucky tried to stand up like he usually would, out of habit. But, since he wasn't used to his new limbs yet, he fell down again before he even managed to lift his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Lucky mentally facepalmed. \"I have human-like limbs now. I can't move my body as I'm used to.\" Lucky sighed. \"I guess I'll have to get used to my new form before I try to stand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling a bit, Lucky managed to get into a sitting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay; so far, so good,\" said Lucky. \"Now, what should I try first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over himself again, Lucky quickly made a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'd better get used to my arms first,\" said Lucky. \"The humans always do so many things with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, since he was a dog, it wasn't easy for  Lucky to get used to having arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels so... strange,\" muttered Lucky as he slowly moved his new arms in all directions. \"They are so much more dexterious than my front legs were. I can move them almost however I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his attention to his hand-paws, Lucky continued: \"It feels even weirder having fingers.\" Lucky moved his new digits too, trying them out. \"I usually hold things in my mouth, but with these, I don't have to do that anymore. Hmmm... I wonder if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing a stick next to him, Lucky tried to pick it up with his new hand-paws. It took a few tries before he successfully managed to use his new fingers to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow; I did it!\" exclaimed Lucky. \"I can hold things with my hands!\" Sure; the act of merely holding the stick with his hand-paws was completly alien to Lucky, but that didn't matter that much to him right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the stick on the ground, Lucky then tried to get more familliar with his new legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay; having only two legs feels even weirder than having arms,\" Lucky admitted to himself as he bended and stretched his new legs several times. \"However; I don't really think that they'll be harder to use than the arms. They aren't as flexible as my new arms are...\" Lucky grinned. \"It might be easier to walk on two legs than I thought!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he had a better understanding of how his new limbs moved, Lucky was ready to try and stand up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down on his stomach once more, Lucky slowly and carefully placed his new hand-paws on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay; let's see if this works,\" said Lucky. \"One... two... three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the count of 'three', Lucky used his new arms and hand-paws to push his torso up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! It worked!\" exclaimed Lucky. \"Now for the other end...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery carefully, Lucky moved his new human-like legs underneath his torso, spreading his knees out to either side so that his foot-paws were planted flat on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more time,\" said Lucky. \"One... two... three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the count of 'three', Lucky pushed downwards with his legs, raising his rear end up. Lucky was now standing like he usually did; except...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay; so I guess I can't really walk on all fours anymore...\" said a surprised Lucky as he saw the position he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the new humanoid configuration of his body, Lucky's rear end was now elevated higher in the air than his head. This, in turn, meant that Lucky was now unable to walk like a dog anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect this to happen,\" said Lucky puzzled. \"I always thought that I would be able to walk both on two legs AND all fours, but I guess that's not an option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he was a little sad at not being able to walk like he was used to, the prospect of being able to walk like a human quickly overshadowed any negative feelings Lucky might have had about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" said Lucky. \"I'm in position now. One... two... three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn 'three', Lucky gave a hard shove down with his arms, pushing his torso upwards and into a two-legged stance... for about half a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he wasn't used to balancing on just two legs, Lucky promtly fell down again onto his butt, yelping as he accidentally sat on his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... maybe standing on two legs is harder than I thought,\" groaned Lucky.<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You could say a lot of things about Lucky, but one thing was certain: he wasn't one to give up that easily. A minor setback like falling on his tail, only encouraged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving his new human-like legs so that his foot-paws were planted flat on the ground and his knees were in front of his chest, Lucky prepared for a second try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more time...\" he said. \"One... two... three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the count of 'three', Lucky pushed downwards with his new legs, raising his body up in a bipedal stance once more. But...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" grunted Lucky as he hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Lucky fell over after only standing for half-a-second, though he fell onto his stomach this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright; so it's MUCH more difficult having two legs than I thought,\" said Lucky to himself. \"But, I'm still not giving up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next several minutes, Lucky tried many different ways to attempt to stand like a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried jumping up on two legs from where he was laying on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried rolling over like a dog and then then push himself up with his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to do a hand-stand and then flip over onto his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter at least seventeen other attempts, Lucky was getting a little irritated, but he STILL wasn't going to give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could have always used the Wishing Bone to wish to get used to his new body right away, but he didn't want that. He wanted to be able to stand on two legs without using any shortcuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh; it's really hard balancing on two legs,\" grumbled Lucky. \"I just can't keep myself steady enough to adjust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky looked around the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need something to support me...\" His eyes spotted a large tree right next to him. \"That could work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his new hand-paws, Lucky slowly pushed himself across the ground until he was right in front of the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay; so far, so good,\" said Lucky. \"Now for the hard part...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping on to the tree with his new hand-paws, Lucky used his arms to lift his torso up from the ground. He then moved his legs so that he was sitting on his knees. Finally, his grip on the tree tightened; in fact, he was practically hugging it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Lucky. \"Time to try this again... one... two... three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the count of 'three', Lucky used his arms to slowly inch his way upwards, never letting go of the tree. When he had lifted himself as much as he could on his knees, he placed his foot-paws on the ground and lifted himself further up, still maintaining his bear-hug-like grip on the tree, until he had raised himself up into a bipedal stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright; I'm up on two legs!\" exclaimed Lucky. Then he looked down at himself. \"Err... almost...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky had once seen Nanny serve something called a 'Jell-o' to Roger and Anita, before an incident caused the cows to get loose and stampede right past the house.<br>\r\nThe 'Jell-o' had been shaking like crazy, but it was still nothing compared to how much Lucky's new legs were shaking right now!<br>\r\nIt was only because he still held the tree in a bear-hug, that he hadn't fallen over yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey; how come my legs are still shaking, even though I'm standing up?\" wondered Lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for him to figure out the reason: It was because of his instincts! Since part of his wish had been to still be a dog, Lucky's canine instincts were still attuned to a quardrupedal body; which was why it was so difficult for him to get used to only two legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this won't work,\" said Lucky. \"There's no way I'll be able to stand up with legs this shaky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcentrating hard, Lucky tried to stop his legs from shaking. It took a little while, but he managed it eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright; my legs stopped shaking!\" exclaimed Lucky. \"Now to try and stand without help... one... two... three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn 'three', Lucky let go of the tree and attempted to stand on two legs without holding on to it.<br>\r\nIt didn't work that well the first time. Although Lucky had succeded in standing like a human, with the aid of the tree, his canine instincts meant that his sense of balance was still fine tuned to quardrupedal movement, not bipedal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis in turn meant that Lucky only managed to stand up for about half-a-second before falling over, although he grabbed on to the tree again to prevent himself from falling completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could have gone better,\" sighed Lucky. He then put on a determined face. \"But I still won't give up; not when I'm so close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky tried many times to get his balance on just two legs. It wasn't easy for him, but he kept on trying. Still, it wasn't until his thirty-fourth attempt that he finally succeded!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay; the thirty-fourth time is the charm...I hope...,\" said Lucky. \"One...two...three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he had done so many times before, Lucky let go of the tree. After many tries, Lucky had gradually gotten used to his new centre of gravity. Nonetheless; he was still about to fall over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" exclaimed Lucky as he felt he was about to fall again. He quickly stuck out his arms to his sides and waved them round in circles to try to regain his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result was that his torso was swaying back and forth, but he didn't fall down. Slowly, he managed to get his upper body to stop swaying as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow; that was like being in a boat during a sto...\" Lucky didn't finish, because at that moment he discovered how he was standing; On two legs, like a human!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I did it!\" exclaimed Lucky with awe. \"I'm standing up like a human! Yahoo!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of sheer joy, Lucky tried to do a jump into the air, only for him to promptly loose his balance and fall down yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay; note to self: don't try to jump before you've gotten more used to your new body,\" said Lucky to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing as he did before, Lucky repeated his movements in order to stand up again; only this time it took less time to regain his balance, because he now knew what it felt like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was back up on two legs again, Lucky took the time to thoroughly experience what it was like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels really weird,\" said Lucky, \"but also really fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky looked around the clearing. \"It's really strange to see things from this perspective. Everything seems a little smaller than when I'm on four legs; it makes everything look different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky turned his eyes towards the ground. Because his line of sight was now higher above the ground than he was used to, he briefly felt a sense of vertigo overtake him, but it quickly passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm also really high up now. I guess I'll have to get used to that, too; if my legs will allow it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue enough; Lucky still wasn't completly comfortable standing on two legs. His legs were still shaking a little, but not enough to make him loose his balance again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see I still have to get comfortable doing this,\" said Lucky, \"Otherwise, I'll fall down a lot more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor that reason, Lucky just stood there for a few minutes, slowly getting used to standing up on two legs. It didn't take that long before his legs were no longer shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! I guess I'm used to two legs now!\" proclaimed Lucky. Then he got a thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe not. Humans don't just stand on two legs; they also WALK on two legs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another look at himself, Lucky gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh,\" he said. \"Learning how to stand up like this was bad enough; but walking on two legs?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky sighed. \"This is going to be a lot more difficult than simply standing on two legs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then smirked. \"But, it wouldn't be a challenge if it was easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreparing himself for more painful falls, Lucky lifted one of his new legs. However; as soon as his foot-paw left the ground, he immediately lost his balance and started to fall.<br>\r\nFortunatly, he managed to grab a hold on the tree before he could hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah; that was close!\" said Lucky. \"Perhaps I should hold on to the tree again; at least until I can lift my legs without falling over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was just what Lucky did. Using the tree for support once more, Lucky tried lifting his legs while keeping his balance. When he felt that he had gotten the hang of it, he let go of the tree again and prepared to try again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here I go...\" muttered Lucky with a look of deep concentration on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he lifted his right leg from the ground. This time he did not fall over right away, but he could feel that he soon would unless he put his foot-paw down fast.<br>\r\nHe still wasn't comfortable enough with his new humanoid body to balance on just one leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky quickly put his foot-paw down in front of him, successfully taking a step! Although; the speed that he put his foot-paw down with caused it to become more like a stomp and less like a step.<br>\r\nThat didn't really matter much to Lucky; in fact, he was thrilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm doing it! I'm walking just like a human!\" he said. \"Well, almost. One step isn't really walking. But more steps is. So, I just have to keep doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Lucky lifted his left leg, quickly moved it in front of his right leg, and set his foot-paw down; again causing it to be more like a stomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gradually got better and better at walking, although he still had to hold his arms out for balance since his legs were still a bit wobbley.<br>\r\nHowever, it was difficult for him to get used to not moving his front limbs together with his back limbs, as he would have done in his normal body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long before Lucky had walked all the way to the other side of the clearing on just two legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning at his achievement, Lucky began to think about what to do next...</span></div></div>",

Ryder, Chase and Rocky were on their way back to The Lookout, after having handled a problem involving littering, and some playful squirrels at the picnic site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were just about out of the forest, when Chase noticed some kind of flash of light, out of the corner of his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryder!\" he called out. \"I just saw something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you see, Chase?\" Ryder called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but there was something there; I'm sure of it, ruff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then. Let's find out what it was!\" replied Ryder. He then spoke to Rocky: \"Rocky, do you mind heading back to The Lookout without us? Chase and I have to investigate something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind at all,\" was Rocky's answer. \"That way, I can get in some more practice for our Pup Pup Boogie tournament this afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we'll see you later!\" called Ryder, as he and Chase turned around, while Rocky continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Chase,\" said Ryder, \"What did you see and where did you see it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was a strange flash of light,\" replied Chase, \"and it came from that direction, ruff.\" He nodded in the said direction, which was down a side-road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" said Ryder. \"Lead the way, Chase!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chase is on the case! Ruff!\" Chase replied. He proceeded to take point as they drove down the side-road. They hadn't been driving for long, when a message came in on Ryder's Pup-Pad. It was from Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryder, where are you? Rocky just came back and said that you and Chase had been delayed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry about that, Katie,\" Ryder apologized. \"Chase saw something strange and we're just going to investigate what it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just don't take too long,\" said Katie. \"Remember, you promised that we could go to the new swimming-pool together, this afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll be there in time,\" Ryder assured her. \"It's just a quick investigation; what could go wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then I guess I'll see you later,\" said Katie and hung up the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryder, ruff! We're here!\" called Chase. He had stopped his vehicle in front of a small crater at the side of the road. Ryder parked his ATV right next to it and they both disembarked from their vehicles and walked over to see what was in the crater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, it was some kind of rock, about the size of a soccer ball. It was clear that this rock was the source of the flash from earlier; it was still glowing with a faint, white light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryder, ruff, what is that?\" asked Chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like some kind of meteorite,\" replied Ryder. \"But, I have never seen one that glowed like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't we take a closer look?\" said Chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" agreed Ryder. Both Ryder and Chase reached out to touch the meteorite and touched it at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they touched the meteorite, the glowing intensified. Somehow, Ryder and Chase were just standing there, frozen like statues, and in some kind of trance. Then, a transparent version of Chase flew out of his motionless body, and a transparent version of Ryder flew out of his motionless body. The transparent Ryder and Chase floated over their own bodies for a few seconds. Then suddenly, the transparent Ryder flew into Chase's body, and the transparent Chase flew into Ryder's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen this was over with, the meteorite stopped glowing completely, looking like a plain old meteorite now, as 'Ryder' and 'Chase' slowly came to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho will wake up first?</span></div></div>",

(Or almost naked, depending on whether the animal in question has a collar, or not).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe it's something a little weirder; with Kevin swapping perceptions on whose clothes belongs to whom, with someone?<br>\r\nFor those that don't know, it means that Kevin and whomever he swaps with (even if the other swapee is an animal) will think that their own clothes really belongs to one another; even if those clothes wont fit them properly.<br>\r\nTo give an example: if Kevin were to swap perceptions on clothes with Krypto, they both now feel uncomfortable wearing their own clothes, even though they fit them perfectly, and think that they should really be wearing each other's clothes.<br>\r\nErgo; they will both think that Krypto should be wearing what is really Kevin's clothes, (the blue t-shirt with the green stripes around the stomach, collar and the sleeves; the dark purple-ish long jeans; the black-and-white sneakers; the white underwear), even though the clothes are to be worn by humans and not Kryptonian dogs; and that Kevin should be wearing what is really Krypto's 'clothes', (the yellow dog-collar; Superdog emblem and cape is optional), even though they are to be worn by a Kryptonian dog and not by human boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope the second option is understandable enough.

When Spyro had reached out and touched it, it had given off a strange light. Unsure of what the deal was with the gemstone, they had taken it back to Warfang so that the Guardians could study it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't know much. All they knew was that the gemstone appeared to have some kind of strange magic inside of it, but how that magic would affect Spyro, the only one to touch it so far, they did not know. But they soon would...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Spyro slept, the magic of the gemstone had altered his mind slightly, to become very sensitive to being naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all intents and purposes, he had gained the modesty of a human. (Not that he knew what a human was)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why, when he saw himself naked, he let out a loud scream and hurridly used the blanket on his bed as a makshift tunic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Cynder, who were sleeping in the room next to his, had heard the scream and decided to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened the door, she saw Spyro frantically searching his room for anything else that he could use as clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spyro, what on earth are you doing?\" Cynder asked as she entered the purple dragon's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro gave a yelp and quickly tried to cover the bottom half of his body, the top half covered in a tunic, with his bed's blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out, Cyn!\" he shouted, \"I'm still getting dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder only stared in confusion at Spyro. \"But...you're a dragon,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" said Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So!?\" cried Cynder, \"Spyro, dragon's don't wear clothes. We don't need them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we should!\" declared Spyro, \"I mean, look at us, walking around butt naked. Don't we have any modesty or class? Heck, even the apes wear clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder studied her body. Yes, they were indeed technically naked, but all their privates were located inside their bodies, so it was highly unnecessary to conceal themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, some dragons did wear clothes, but they were only meant for ceremonies. But what Spyro was doing was ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Cynder decided to leave it there, for Spyro couldn't be convinced that easily. She needed help, so she decided to leave and find the Guardians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could knock some sense into him.</span></div></div>",

That's definitly going to to be an awkward experience for both of them, since there is such an age gap between them, and they will most likely react in very different ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Sora's case, he would most likely be very excited to be in Terra's body; because not only is he now MUCH taller than Riku, but he'll also be a LOT older than him, too,(at least physically, since Terra's body is five times older than Sora's age, at this point).<br>\r\nAnother reason why he might be excited, is because he can now easily defeat Riku in both their sparring maches and their races, although he might have trouble with hide-and-seek, since Terra's body is too big to fit into most of Sora's usual hiding spots.<br>\r\nAlso, Sora would likely be excited about Terra's body's strength, too, as it is strong enough to lift both his regular body (with Terra inside it) and Riku without much effort.<br>\r\nHowever; even though Sora is now in Terra's body, he is still his 4-year-old self on the inside, so he will still act like a little kid; and he'll have to get used to certain \"grown-up\" things; like his new hight, greater stamina and (later on) fighting with the Keyblade.<br>\r\nAlso; since Sora is now in Terra's adult body, Riku might try to take advantage of that, by convincing Sora-in-Terra to pretend to be 'an explorer of places', (or something like that), to perhaps persuade their parents to go out and see other places...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Terra's case, he would most likely be rather angry/frustrated about being in Sora's body; because not only is he now MUCH smaller than usual, but he's also in a body that's five times younger than he himself is.<br>\r\nAdd in the fact that Terra can't use the Keyblade while he's in Sora's body, and Terra would likely be stuck on Destiny Islands until he can swap back, which would severely hinder him in his search for Master Xehanort.<br>\r\nPlus; having a 4-year-old boy running around in his adult body would be even more frustrating for him, since every attempt Terra would make to get his body back, would likely be stopped by Sora using Terra's body's strength to easily overpower Terra in Sora's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, now that I'm done rambling; how does these two end up swapping bodies in the first place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Before coming to the Islands, Terra learns a new spell from Master Yen Sid, which is supposed to give others a look into the caster's memories, so that they could see all the adventures the caster has been on, (like a movie inside your head).<br>\r\nHowever; when he tries to use it on Riku, Terra accidentally makes the spell misfire and hit Sora instead, which causes the two of them to swap bodies!<br>\r\nThis causes serious problems for Terra, because he can't use the Keyblade while in Sora's body and Sora is more interested in playing with Riku than getting back to normal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: While Terra is in the middle of the Bequeathing with Riku, Sora accidentally interrupts the ceremony which causes a magical backlash that makes him swap bodies with Terra!<br>\r\nSora is excited about being a grown-up long before he was meant to and wants to play with Riku, so that he can actually beat him for once.<br>\r\nHowever; Terra is still in a hurry to find Master Xehanort, but he can't do that while in Sora's 4-year-old body.<br>\r\nOut of desperation, Terra reluctantly decides to teach Sora how to use the Keyblade; which might be a lot easier said than done, since Sora is still only 4 years old...</span></div></div>",

I'm getting a new phone today, so I don't want to lose my progress on the stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was getting a bit nervous. If he was unable to move like this, then he would be unable to return to normal! And as interesting as it was to be fused with a child's jacket, he didn't want to be stuck as one forever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery slowly, he tried to move his right 'arm'. To his great relief, he saw the right sleeve of his current jacket 'body' move like it was his actual arm; which it technically was right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he went on to moving his left 'arm', he began to think about how strange his current situation was; being able to move the sleeves of the jacket he was fused with as though they were his human arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis discovery led him to realize something else; even though he didn't have hands anymore, he could still feel them in a strange way. It was just like with his non-existing head; they technically weren't there, but he could still use them. And it wasn't just his head and hands that felt this way; he could still feel his legs, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, with his jacket 'body' hanging over the back of the chair, it felt like he was down on his knees, if he had had them. The odd part was that, if he had had his legs at the moment, they would have gone through the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Mike to realize something else; because he had fused himself (a living human being) with a jacket (a lifeless piece of clothing), it would be logical that the fusion left him with the necessary attributes required of both, so that he could still function in either capacity. Ergo; even though he could simply function as a plain, ordinary jacket, he was still capable of acting like a normal human being. A human being whose body was mostly both invisible and intangible, apart from the parts that had become the jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Mike had a leg to stand on (so to speak), he decided to try to 'stand up'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver watched closely as Jenny in his former body made some more gestures. She kept pointing her new paws at that 'cup-board' thing right next to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis confused the body-swapped kitten for a moment. 'I don't get it,' thought Oliver. 'What is she trying to tell me?' He looked from his old body to the 'cup-board' a few times before he understood what Jenny meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver remembered that one of the first things that Jenny did after waking up (after waking himself up; of course) was to put on a new set of those 'clothes'-thingies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver's kitten-brain was still confused by some human things. He didn't really understand why humans, or at least Jenny, would change from one set of 'clothes' to another, twice a day. He knew that Jenny always slept in the pink clothes every night, then changed to a new set in the morning. And she always took them out of the 'cup-board'-thing! He had seen her do it many times now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver figured that since he was currently inside Jenny's body, Jenny wanted him to do like she normally did; put on a fresh set of clothes.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to my first ever Interactive Story. This story is about the characters from my favorite franchises (both cartoon, anim\u00e9, movie and videogame) undergoing various changes. BTW; by favorite franchises, I mean the franchises that I would like to see go through different kinds of transformations, body swaps, and changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would appreciate it if you would add chapters to this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow; before I list the franchises, there are ten very IMPORTANT rules about this story, so READ THEM THOUROUGHLY FIRST!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Things that I absolutely WILL NOT ALLOW: Scat, Watersports, Vore (of any kind), Weight Gain, Death, Inflation, Squishing, Farting, Other Such Gross Subjects, Foot Fetishes, Extreme Horror, Unbirthing, Pregnancy, Incest, Derogatory Names, Drugs and Alcohol. Other than that, let loose with changes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. I will allow for sex now, but not too often and nothing overly descriptive, unless I give my permission to do it, so please ask first. If there are any chapters where a character's genitals grows to an enormous size, their first priority is to change back to normal; not... well, you know what!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. I will only allow mild swearwords, such as 'Darn; Drat; Oh, Bugger', ect. Any chapter containing stronger words than that, will be deleted instantly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. While I will allow for typso's... err... typo's, the chaper needs to be readable. If I can't make any sense of a chapter that's been uploaded, I WILL delete it! So; please make it understandable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Except for a few cases, always; I repeat, ALWAYS leave one option as 'Other', (or any variation thereof), so others can add more chapters! I will also delete any chapters that does not allow this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. If it is possible; please use the Metric System whenever describing sizes. Not strictly neccesary, but I would appreciate it. (I'm Europian!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. I do allow for size-changing to occur, but nothing extreme, like: \"He grew 1000000 ft. tall!\" or \"He shrank to the size of an atom!\" The maximum height that a character can grow to in this story, is 18 meters tall (about 60 ft. tall) and any character can only shrink to the size of an ant. Nothing taller, or smaller, than that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Please make a chapter and/or change 'believeable', so to speak. Like, say; if Spyro (from the Spyro the Dragon franchise) where to change into either an anthropomorphic form, or into a human, he should NOT be able to (for example) walk properly right away! Since Spyro is usually quardrupedal, it will be hard for him to get used to bipedal movement in his new body, since he is used to walking on four legs, and not two. Please describe such difficulties as detailed as possible; I think those kinds of situations are hilarious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. Whatever the type and amount of changes, please make certain that there is always a chance for everything to return back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. If anyone would like to have any franchises other than those listed below in the story, please Email me. I will inform you if I choose to include it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that that's over with, here are the franchises that will be featured in the story:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnim\u00e9 Franchises: Yu-Gi-Oh, Naruto, One Piece, Shaman King, Pok\u00e9mon, Digimon, Fairy Tail, Dragon Ball, Sonic X and Dinosaur King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMovie Franchises: Any Movies with characters from either Marvel or DC Comics, The Lion King, 101 Dalmatians, Robin Hood (Disney), Zootopia, Big Hero 6 and Star Wars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCartoon Franchises: The Lion Guard, 101 Dalmatians: The Series, My Little Pony (I'm a brony; so sue me!), How To Train Your Dragon (both TV and Netflix series), American Dragon: Jake Long, Ben 10, ThunderCats (both series), PAW Patrol, Lego: Legends of Chima and X-Men: Evolution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVideogame Franchises: Megaman, Sonic The Hedgehog, Spyro, Sly Cooper, Jak and Daxter, Ratchet and Clank, The Legend of Zelda, Pok\u00e9mon, Final Fantasy IX, Final Fantasy X, Spectrobes and Kingdom Hearts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease have fun and make some interesting stories!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImportant Edit: I'm a little bothered by the fact that many other stories somehow disregards the proper placement of characters, if you get my meaning. If any chapters here contains this flaw, (like; if chapters including characters from the original three Spyro games show up in a 'Legend of Spyro' chapter that specifically refers to LoS characters,) I WILL delete it! I'm very sorry; but I just don't want to see that kind of mistake here...</td>",
