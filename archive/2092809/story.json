            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Attention, Cadets!\" came the clear bark of an officer. Every one of the latest batch of fresh meat saluted and then stood ready. The officer in question was one Sergeant Accipiter. The white pegasus marched his way down the line of ponies. He stopped at one, his harsh eyes glaring down at the already shaking earth pony. \"You are all about to start your first day as a real guard. You might expect me to wish you congratulations, say I'm proud... but none of that bucking matters! Each and every one of you just declared your loyalty in a constant war. The battle against crime in a city where the crime rate has doubled in the past year alone!\" The pegasus sergeant started moving down the line again. \"Look to your left, then look to your right. One of those ponies is not going to come back to their bunk tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a collection of muttering and gasps at that one, the pegasus turning and swinging his eyes across the crowd. He settled on a pure white slender looking unicorn who looked very much like he was trying to avoid notice. \"You! Name and rank!\" Accipiter barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn jumped, but quickly managed to snap it into a salute. \"Cadet Lance, sir!\" he called back surprisingly smartly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccipiter grinned, looking almost predatory himself as he trotted to the space in front of him. \"Lance, huh? I'm good friends with your uncle. Good to have you onboard. Do try not to dissappoint your dear dad by ending up the night wedged into the ass crack of a fat mare,\" the officer said with a chuckle. His eyes then instantly whipped to another pony, this one a thestral mare with a rather pudgy build, especially concentrated on her rear. \"You! Name and Rank!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cadet Moon, Sir!\" the thestral mare replied with enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moon, huh? One of Luna's lot. You'll be on night patrol soon enough. Once this is over head to bed, you'll be woken by Sergeant Nox when it's time,\" he declared loudly, then he leaned in closer, making sure to whisper so quietly only the two of them would hear it. \"And don't wander around the barracks. Some of the guards here love to play with rookies and Thestrals aren't an everyday occurence.\" His piece said, he leant back, then snapped to another invidual to repeat the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Accipiter returned to the front, stopping in front of the now much more shaken and less confident crowd. \"Each of you is going to start the day off on patrol. It's up to you whether you want to go solo, but I recommend buddying up between yourselves, or with one of the more experienced guardsponies. You can pick your routes off the board, but once a route is picked that's it, can't have you all in one place. And that's all. Dismissed!\" Accipiter turned and trotted towards a nearby door, no doubt to his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the rookies milled about, their sudden source of direction gone. Fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, one of them will be the protagonist of this story, but which of the two should we choose?</span></div></div>",

The second the Sergeant finished his speech he was gone. Sure, Lance was listening, but what was he actually meant to do? Searching around he saw some of the rookies were already pairing up. That thestral mare that had caught his eye had already turned and trotted back to the bunkrooms. For the first time, Lance really actually looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in the Royal Guard's Barracks, an attachment to Canterlot Castle. It was pretty large, housing hundreds of active guards at a time, and the single biggest concentration of them in Equestria. The Rookie's had their seperate accomodation, presumably until the next batch arrived and those that remained were moved on to the real barracks. Sergeant Accipiter was the commanding officer for the cadets, and he was in his office right there. Sure, Lance could ask him about what he should be doing... but he seemed pretty terse. He did know Lance's uncle though... the gambling, black sheep of the family uncle but he was still family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this room, now the Thestral had left, there were twenty nine royal guard rookies all in their golden armour but with a multitude of fur colours. Already they were starting to seperate out, falling back into the same groups they were in during training. Lance had prefferred to train alone,and now that might be a problem. The light green earth pony that had seen shaking earlier under Accipiter's gaze sidled up to the unicorn, the somewhat chubby stallion giving Lance a weak smile. \"Hey there... I'm Camo,\" he said holding out a hoof. Lance looked at it for a moment before lifting his own and giving it a shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lance,\" the unicorn said plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamo looked at the unicorn expectantly, before Lance just gave a shrug. The earth pony sighed. \"Can we... team up?\" he asked, his blue eyes seeming to shine as he stared up at the unicorn.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lance gave the matter a little thought, but really this was his only opportunity. With the others already grouping up if he turned down Camo he might have to go it alone, and anypony was better than nopony. The stallion nodded his head. \"Sure. Let's team up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hooray!\" Camo cheered, the earth pony suddenly parting his forelegs and pulling Lance into a hug, the unicorn letting out a surprised squeal as he was squished up against the chubby green belly, the faint smell of body odour and sheen of sweat making it even less comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please get off of me...\" Lance asked shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Sorry!\" Camo replied, releasing Lance and letting the white unicorn flop back onto his rump. Camo gave a grin. \"I just got excited, heh. Figured I'd be the odd one out... and I'm pretty sure that guardspony over there has been eyeing me up...\" he added, frowning a little as he vaguely gestured with his eyes over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muscular but also big gutted earth pony stallion was leaning by a doorway, his look most certainly predatory as he glanced over the recruits. He must have been twice the size of Lance... and in every direction. The guard noticed Lance looking, and gave him a wink, before squishing a large hoof against his hanging gut. A swallow came from Lance before he looked back to Camo. \"Then it's a good job you came over, heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he give you the look too?\" Lance nodded his head and Camo frowned. \"Well, let's get out of here quick. So what was the next step?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance nodded his head over towards the large map that other pairs were crowding around. \"Time to pick our route.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Camo agreed, and a moment later the two of them were trotting over to the nice big map of Canterlot. The crowd of chattering rookies were gathered all around, crowded around it like it was some kind of celebrity. Camo craned his neck upwards, but he couldn't get a good view past a particularly large pony at the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Camo struggle and not wanting to get lumbered with the scraps had Lance push himself forwards. \"Excuse me, coming through,\" he called politely as he threaded between the crowd, and then to the front, sliding in between a pegasus mare and a pegasus stallion. The map was a complete map of Canterlot, marked out nice and clear and split into four distinct sectors, each with a good amount of routes except for the castle itself; it seemed rookies weren't used to patrol there. There were still routes going in each, and Lance managed to snatch the pen with his magic as the pegasus stallion beside him turned away, the unicorn grinning as he moved it to the board. He had to make a quick choice or risk losing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe safest from crime, but most dangerous from the public was the regal and wide paved streets of the Noble Quarter. Everypony with a name was sure to have a house there, but thanks to the newest trend of the predator body being in it was no doubt filled with nobles looking for a quick bulk up. They were also known to be demanding and eccentric... a bad combination for any passersby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowhere saw more traffic than the main Market Plaza and the district around it. More guards than any were needed to cover it, meaning that backup would always be close by if it was needed... and it likely would be. Not to mention the well known Black Market that lay beneath the plaza and sold everything and anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly was the slums, the place where ponies that weren't rich or tradesponies ended up. Crime was very strong there, courtesy of a mess of gangs and desperation ran high for a lot of the locals. The only real positive there was a maintained guard outpost and several strongrooms, so those that felt threatened had places to fall back to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up already, we've all got places to be!\" came a shout from behind Lance, and another pony nudged him in the side. Quickly he put pen to the paper, choosing his route. That done he capped the pen and slid on back through the crowd, emerging with a thump in front of Camo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green earth pony looked down at him excitedly. \"Nice going, Lance! So where are we going?\"</span></div></div>",

You quickly passed a few of the grand and stately homes, broken up only by fancy boutiques and cafes. In no time at all you were at the huge fountain that marked the entrance to this rather large area. This piece was commissioned by Blueblood, if the fact a statue of the stallion himself stood triumphantly at the top wasn't a dead giveaway. Supposedly it was to commemorate the defeat of the Changelings in their attempted invasion during the Royal Wedding, yet no accounts actually even put Blueblood in the castle at the time, yet the statue suggested he had commanded battlements in some kind of protracted siege, water firing in jets from carved marble cannons down and into the fountain itself which was full of twisted equine looking figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at him... he's such a hero,\" Camo said wistfully, staring up at the stone statue of the illustrious prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance blinked once, then twice, before clearing out his ears. \"Sorry, could you repeat that, I could have sworn you called Blueblood heroic,\" the stallion replied with a glance of disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at this statue and tell me he does not look heroic,\" Camo was quick to respond, gesturing up at the magnificent figure that Lance just realised was supposed to be crying crystalised tears that were suspended in air by magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance looked at the statue, then back to Camo, then back to the statue again. \"Do you even remember the Canterlot Invasion?\" he asked, the look of incredulity etched all over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamo's response was chiefly a shrug, but Lance's continued look earned some words after a few seconds. \"Well... uh... not really... no... I kind of... hid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance's let out another sigh and then followed up with a shake of his head. \"So... moving on... we can't just stand around the Freedom Fountain all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? It's got good, clear views and junk,\" Camo replied quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance was beginning to think he may have chosen a partner too quickly. \"Because then we're not patrolling, Camo. We have our route. Both start and end here actually, so it's just which way you want to take first. We go to the right and we'll pass the huge Vorare Estate first, or we stick to the left and through the Faust Memorial Guardians?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamo huffed loudly, looking between the two and then shrugging. \"Either way we'll walk past them both anyway,\" he pointed out. \"You pick, Lance.\"</span></div></div>",

This family was known for gluttony and lavish parties, most of which ended with less ponies leaving than entering. And it was clear when you looked at any members of this family. Each and every single one of them was sporting a huge belly, which the Vorares were very proud of. \"Alright Camo, let's stick to the Estate wall and go past as quickly as possible. These nobles are bad news. More so than usual. For now Lance was hoping that, if they appeared busy to any onlookers, they decided not to bug them on their patrol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they began their patrol on the right path, where the huge estate was immediately visible. For nobles, houses were not so much homes as they were status symbols.

The Vorares had one of their gatherings in the garden with classy music, coffee and cakes. This brunch became visible as the two guards stood in front of the gate. A long table was set up in the garden, with Lady Vorare sitting at the prime spot. Directly in front of the chocolate cake. Some paces behind her, a small band was providing the nobles with music. Despite the peaceful scene, there was still a certain tension in the air. The Vorares did not throw a single party without one of the guests ending up in the belly of one of their family members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Vorare was the matriarch of the family and its most influental member. This mare was massive in size and her chair creaked in protest at the fat ass placed on top of it. Her coat was a light pink with her shining white mane tied into a bun. The golden-yellow eyes always had this predatory gleam wo them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this looks so fancy. Hey, do you think we can get some of that cake?\" Camo asked, earning a dumbfounded look from Lance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt somewhat occured to the unicorn that his choice of partner was wrong. \"Camo... these nobles would eat us at the tiniest, perceived slight. Do you seriously think it would be a good idea to just go in there and ask one of the nobles most known for voracious appetite for cake?\" Lance asked his partner. Camo would need a crash course in staying alive if Lance wanted to go back to the barracks with partner in tow. Or at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance looked back at the party scene, ready to urge his partner to advance as he saw something going on in the garden.</span></div></div>",

The glowing around Lady Vorare's horn and a hungry look showed off that the Lady of the house has chosen her next meal. The unfortunate noble was of new wealth, just recently risen up among the ranks. She was younger than Lady Vorare with a white coat and blonde mane. The cream colored summer dress and her pearl necklace were torn away by Lady Vorare as she levitated her meal closer. Her victim screamed for help but none of the other nobles decided to intervene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, this was a legacy nipped in the bud Lance thought, ready to move on.

Lance knew he should move on, quickly run, but he was as stunned as Camo, the two rookie guards staring like bunnies at an oncoming train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it isn't two members of our prestigious guard,\" Lady Vorare announced grandly, her voice carrying all the way out to them. A pair of large stallion in waistcoats trotted towards them, looking like some mixture of butler and bodyguard.

A large hoof came down in front of him, stomping into the ground, and a sharp glare suddenly came from one of the towering stallions. Camo almost jumped out of his fur, but managed to swallow it down before looking over to the mare and bowing his head. \"I would be honoured, Lady Vorare!\" he corrected himself. The stallion lifted a hoof, and Camo was allowed to pass once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, enjoy yourself, feast on our sweet treats, get yourself nice and plump,\" Lady Vorare called to him. Lance saw her lick her lips, and then her eyes settle on his again. \"And you, private. Please, come and join the party, it's the least we can offer in return for our safety,\" she said, her eyes twinkling menacingly.

Immediately the stallions gave chase, but Lance was smaller and more agile.

This being the noble quarter, even the alley was fairly clean, but there was a large dumpster nearby that would make a decent hiding place.

Lance tried to scream when a pair of horrendous, wretched farts filled his lungs, the stallion\u2019s breath stolen by the nastiest of stinks. Lewd grunts came from both massive stallions as gassy blast after eggy cloud ripped out and into the dumpster, the trash smelling like fresh cut grass by comparison to the horrendous butt stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thick log of stinking brown began to slide from the cheeks right above Lance\u2019s head\u2026 and the guardspony desperately tried to move, but he\u2019d gotten his legs wedged in the trash. \u201cNo...no\u2026\u201d he managed to gasp as he saw the log stretching, an equine hoof and various scraps of coloured fur embedded in the log\u2026 then it broke. With a wet thump it splatted onto Lance\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 those parties are always fun, but damn do live meals give me messy shits,\u201d one of the bodyguards grunted as thick buttsfudge squeezed out of his cheeks, the thick and solid mass squeezing out and slamming down with a splat over Lance\u2019s hindlegs, everything below his waist being buried in the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately thrashing, Lance managed to free his muzzle, and then his face\u2026 just in time to see a skull staring down at him\u2026 and the massive compact loaf of shit behind it. \u201cNoooo!\u201d Lance squealed before it dropped with a horrendous squelch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, you hear something?\u201d one of the guards asked the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d the other replied, shaking his ass to help squeeze out a long line of mushy crap as a loosely held together coil, unknowingly spreading it all over the struggling guardpony\u2019s chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno\u2026 just thought I did,\u201d the first said with a shrug, before grunting and letting another solid slab of shitty brown and then a sigh. \u201cWell I\u2019m done.\u201d<br>\r\nThe other big stallion finished up with a last grunt, and a final thud of shit. \u201cLet\u2019s go find the Lady a meal then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll find the guard while we\u2019re at it. We\u2019ve still got a lesson to teach him,\u201d the first stallion replied with a laugh and the pair of them trotted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dumpster was left wide open, stuffed full of messy, filthy shit. The only part of Lance still visible was a white hoof that twitched and wriggled, the rest of him utterly buried under pounds of pony shit. The wriggling soon became more frantic, and then went still, the hoof going limp\u2026 Maybe being captured would have been better.</span></div></div>",

Music bled through the air and the sounds of refined joviality could only mean one thing... and that was to stay away. \"Let's head out to the left. Gardens are most beautiful in the morning,\" Lance stated, gesturing with his head in the stated direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamo's response was a simple shrug. As soon as Lance started trotting, so too did Camo, the stallion sticking to Lance's side. Their golden armour reflected the light of the sun as they trotted side by side down the paved street. \"So you been to the gardens before?\" Camo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance had been liking the silence, but gave a sidewards glance with an emerald eye as Camo opened his muzzle. \"Once or twice... though only to the publicly available part. There's a large field of flowers that is popular for picnics and other outdoors activities. We're being tasked to patrol the whole grounds though, give them a one over for any signs of ponies where they shouldn't be,\" Lance explained as the pair's hooves clipped and clopped against the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spiked and tall fence of golden metal came into view soon enough, marking the edge of the park and breaking up the endless rows of fancy townhouses. A bit further along lay the large and impressive gate, it wide open for public entry. Golden letters stenciled above proudly proclaimed this was indeed the one and only 'Faust Memorial Gardens'. \"How about you?\" Lance asked, turning to Camo. \"First time here?\" Camo nodded his head with an affirmative, and Lance grinned. \"Then follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond the gate a smoothed out gravel path led the way forwards, and almost instantly the grass gave way to a sea of flowers. All kinds of brilliant and vibrant colours created a mesmerising rainbow of floral decoration, the plants put down in clear grids of solid colour blocks. Between each a marble statue of an alicorn was placed, all the way down to a central plaza, where an even grander statue of shaped gold tried to capture the glory of the supposed mother of equinity. Camo let out a loud whistle as he approached. \"That can't have been cheap...\" he stated, his vision filled by the golden statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance rolled his eyes as Camo acted like a colt. The plaza had a few ponies around, though none seemed to be the type of noble they were trying to avoid. Beneath the statue was unbroken grass, and beyond that stretched the large and famous field of flowers that went on for a mile at least. Several wooden benches provided places to sit, some also featuring tables for the picnickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamo spotted the sign first and trotted over to it, stopping in front and looking up. \"So all these places need to be patrolled?\" Camo asked, looking back to Lance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guardstallion trotted over to quickly double check and then gave Camo a nod. \"Yep. We've got the exotic flora greenhouses, most of them off limits to any but staff or researchers from the Canterlot Academy. Those are to the East. On the West side we've got the largest hedge maze in Equestria... though we probably don't have to actually enter it. And of course up ahead is the sea of flowers. Question though is which to hit first...?\"</span></div></div>",

Lance and Camo easily joined one of the larger groups, eight rookies trotting side by side out of the barracks and to the district. Wanting to be in the centre of the action, Lance had picked a place right out in the main plaza, and when they arrived he quickly began to reconsider his choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Plaza was massive, a sea of colourful fabric on wooden stilts as a veritable sea of market stalls selling everything and anything filled the place. The yell of merchants advertising their wares made it hard to hear, and just below their volume was the endless drone of thousands of ponies chatting at once. Mares and stallions of all ages and sizes passed from stall to stall, buying whatever they wanted. How were you supposed to spot a criminal in this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... market day is busy,\" Camo said, earning multiple glares for his all too obvious statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should fan out but stick to our pairs,\" a green unicorn mare stated, earning nods from the others. \"Anypony shouts for help and we all come running.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me,\" Lance replied, before spotting a nice shaded spot where the crowd weren't trotting. \"Camo and I'll set up over there,\" he added, giving the mare a nod before gesturing for Camo to follow. The two stallions trotted away, the group soon disintegrating into four pairs that all spread out to cover just this quadrant of the massive marketplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't easy going just getting to the spot as the two guardsponies had to elbow through a few ponies, muscle their way through the crowd. More than once it had seemed like Lance was about to be crushed between two mares, but he squeezed past just in the nick of time. The two were panting when they arrived, marking out their location to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can we get a drink?\" Camo asked, looking at one of the nearby stalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance gave a shrug. \"Well I guess we can...\" he said, his eyes wandering. It was then he noticed the striped flank of a zebra disappearing into a side alley. His eyes narrowed, and just behind trotted a unicorn stallion with a very suspicious trot.</span></div></div>",

Was he carrying a briefcase? And wearing a fedora? Were criminals really that obvious? If things were this easy, then how did the guard lose so many eager recruits? Lance shook his head, and then looked over to Camo who was openly staring right at the figure before it vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... yeah, okay, I think even a newborn would find that suspicious...\" Camo said, a visible frown on his muzzle. \"If anything it's too suspicious... like, no criminal would do that so it has to just be a legitimate deal,\" he concluded, giving a shrug. \"So can we get a drink now? I need something sugary or I think I'm going to pass out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance sighed, his eyes having long rolled. \"There's no such thing as too suspicious, Camo. It's still suspicious, so I'm still checking it out. You coming with?\" the unicorn asked, giving the pudgy earth pony a definite look.</span></div></div>",

I'm going to get a drink, then start patrolling,\" Camo replied with a slight growl. The earth pony then stuck his tongue out foalishly and trotted away, breaking the first rule of the buddy system and leaving Lance quite alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need you anyway!\" Lance called after him, before turning and shaking his head. He'd just get him caught. Lance could shut down whatever deal was going on by himself, and then they'd make him a captain or something. If they resisted then all he had to do was call for help, and he was sure backup would be just around the corner. The white unicorn straightened his armour, then raised his middle to stand tall. \"We'll see what Accipiter thinks of this,\" he stated with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alleyway led off of the main street, but like all the worst alleys there was a nice big bend in the middle, only a small one to get around a building but enough that there was a small stretch that couldn't be seen from either side. Unfortunate for Lance as it meant he had to get right up close. He briefly pressed his back to the side of the wall next to the alley to check down it, earning a few looks from passing ponies trotting about enjoying market day. The coast was clear, smelly and dirty, but quite clear. The unicorn circled around and pushed himself to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grungy floor kept trying to tug his hoofcups from his hooves, forcing him to curl them as best he could with each step as he tried and failed a silent step. Fortunately there really was no guard positioned out there. Sure, he had only seen two individuals, but that didn't mean there couldn't be more. As he got close to the bend, passing a filthy dumpster that positively oozed a slime comprised of junk, his ears flicked at the sound of voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we are good to go, yes? All the product is in the briefcase. I hoof it over, you make a few calls, and soon we'll hit complete market saturation... boy, the streets will never recover from this,\" the clear male voice which had to be Fedora stated, ending off with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We good, hooves. Long as you ain't gunna pull no funny business,\" the zebra replied, at least Lance assumed it was based on the colloquialisms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't. Believe me. Though you may want to make sure your house is sealed tight. When they start dosing they'll become ticking time bombs,\" Fedora pointed out. Lance blinked at this... that didn't sound good. That didn't sound good at all. Then he heard the sound of hooves as Fedora started heading his way. The guardspony's eyes went wide as he realised he had two choices here.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was it, he had to do the thing right now. \"Stop in the name of the law!\" he yelled at the top of his lungs as he leapt out into the open, landing right in front of a very confused looking fedora wearing pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna's Teats!\" the stallion responded, stumbling back... then he looked twice. Lance wasn't the most threatening of figures... his shiny golden armour was actually a little loose on his decidedly short and rather skinny form. The zebra's eyes bounced everywhere, expecting guards to come pouring out of the woodwork... but nopony came. In fact nothing seemed to happen for almost five seconds, the guard's chest heaving as he stood there and the two criminals just... waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the zebra looked back at Lance. \"So... where's the rest of you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance blinked, then looked around. \"Uh... well... Backup!\" he yelled, his voice echoing down the alleyway. Once again there was five seconds of silence. \"B-backup! This is Cadet Lance! Requesting assistance!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFedora blinked disbelievingly, then shook his head with a snort of laughter. \"Cadet? Really? You try to bust our deal alone, without backup?\" the unicorn began then cut off into a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuzz really sent their best, huh?\" the zebra said to Fedora, before sharing in the laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance blinked, his smile completely frozen on his muzzle but slowly cracking. \"I... uh... w-well... it's... my first day...\" he stammered slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two criminals then looked at each other and started laughing even harder, the zebra actually falling on his back as he let out peels of laughter. Fedora's eyes were tearing up so much he shifted his shades so that he could wipe them with a hoof. \"Celestia's taint, kid, you must be the dumbest pony in the guard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance's smile completely collapsed, the unicorn's eyes watering a little as he started to shuffle uncomfortably under the face of such laughter. This really was a bad plan... \"I... I'm just... going to let you off with a warning...\" he said slowly, making it up as he went along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zebra stood back up at those words, and Fedora wiped a last tear before settling his shades back down. \"Oh no, kid... afraid I can't let you do that,\" Fedora stated. His horn began to glow and instantly Lance felt his whole body seizing up in one instance, all feeling vanishing as he suddenly fell to the floor and onto his chest. He was powerless so fast he couldn't even squeal. The aura of black magic dragged him up the alley, dropping him to the floor right between Fedora and the zebra, the young stallion left limp and fully exposed before them. His young and vulnerable body was draped across the ground, his rump cheeks slightly parted and his mouth left half open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... uh... we gunna rape him?\" the zebra asked after an awkward moment's silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Fedora replied sharply. \"No... uh... well... that'd be... really bad...\" the unicorn's tone changed pretty clearly as Fedora noticed he was salivating. Lance was filled with relief when the prospect of being raped in a dark alley by a pair of criminals was shoved off the table, even if he couldn't express it via anything other than the shine to his eyes. Those only slightly curvy white rump cheeks filled his vision, the dark hole between promising untold delights for his steadily slipping out shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... okay, hooves. Then let's-\" the zebra began to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait, wait!\" Fedora was even quicker to get in there. \"I... uh... well... maybe... you know... we could... give it a try?\" He suggested, awkwardly rubbing the back of his neck as his shaft started to throb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance's mind was sent reeling, his eyes widening slightly as suddenly the prospect of being raped was thrust back onto the table again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zebra blinked. \"So... now we are raping him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFedora was visisbly sweating as he felt the eyes on him. \"W-well... I mean... he's kinda sexy, right? In that small... defenceless and meek kinda way, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... sure. Whatever, hooves... I'll get my dick wet,\" the zebra replied with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFedora swallowed again, clearly knowing this was super wrong and not the sort of thing he should do... but damn if that limp, tasty rump wasn't calling out to him. His black magic surrounded those hind hooves and suddenly Lance was lifted up, the pony managing the weakest of squirms as he was pulled up into the air. \"Don't worry, kid... we're going to kill you after anyway so you won't suffer long,\" Fedora said reassuringly... at least somehow he assumed that was the case.</span></div></div>",

He shook his head, finding it a little hard to meet Camo's eyes. \"L-look, thanks for the offer, but I'm going to see if I can get one of the veterans,\" Lance said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Camo replied quietly, looking down for a moment. \"Well... okay then... yeah, good luck with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance nodded his head a little bit, a hoof reaching up to rub against the back of his neck, before realising that was now hidden away by armour. With a sigh instead he turned to the side. \"Good luck to you too. I'm going to... you know, check out the veterans,\" Lance explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamo didn't say anything and Lance shrugged before trotting away. As soon as he was a few feet clear he let out a loud sigh. Damn, that was awkward. Why did he have to make it so awkward? Couldn't have just said no... So busy ruminating on things Lance missed the doorway by a few inches, trotting up right to a towering earth pony guard, his black fur rippling with muscle except for his pendulous and hanging guy. Lance caught himself a single step from bouncing into that balley, the rookie guard having to crane his head up to look at the equine. The guard looked back with green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a hoof almost as big as Lance's head was on his shoulder. \"Where do you think you're going, rookie? This pond of guppies too small for you? Want to swim with the sharks?\" the towering pony boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance found himself shaking a little, the massive pony proving quite intimidating indeed. Hooves that could crush his head, a belly that could hold his form and a toned but curvy ass that could press him into paste. He was a guardspony, though... and a tough pony like that would make a good teammate! Though maybe it would be best to shift the topic and get past him... surely another pony could help. All you needed was an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Second only to Accipiter here. I don't do patrols, not any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance frowned a little, but honestly found it a little relieving. He probably wouldn't have felt that safe with this sizeable stallion anyway. \"Oh, sorry, I didn't realise,\" he said politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion snorted another laugh at Lance's response. \"Some of the guardsponies in the other unit through here might be looking for a tagalong.

Where would Lance be if he couldn't trust a more experienced guard? It was just paranoia preying on his mind. At least he wasn't going out on patrol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trot to the barracks wasn't actually that far, but with all this playing on Lance's mind it certainly seemed longer. From behind the powerful and large stallion he could see sizable black bowling balls bouncing with every step from the corporal, the musky stench combined with the sweaty odour of poorly washed flanks hard not to notice as it wafted over his nostrils, making the air muggy and harder to breathe. The muscled yet still rounded flanks were soaked in sweat, the heavy and hot armour on his back no doubt contributing to the fragrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance almost walked into him when Bulldozer abruptly stopped, but managed to catch himself with his muzzle inches from that sweaty crack. \"In here, rookie. Look alive,\" Bulldozer ordered. Lance's hooves responded before his brain could, halting in their march and turning him to the door. It was the barracks, the same place he had left this morning. He stepped through the door, eyes wandering across the multitude of empty beds, small chests at the foot containing personal effects, leaving the room itself rather under-decorated and plain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot breath spilled over the back of his neck and Lance froze up, feeling a large and sweaty hoof wander down his chest to find the buckle for his armour. With a flick it was pulled up, and then taken off. \"S-sir?\" Lance called meekly as the Corporal stripped him, pulling away his helmet, and prising off his hoof cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't have you wearing armour meant for guards now... can we, my new assistant?\" Bulldozer called with a menacing chuckle. \"No, you're even less than a rookie now,\" the stallion teased further, before giving Lance a hard shove forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white unicorn squealed as he almost tripped flat onto his face, barely catching his hooves at the last minute. He backed away from the door, from the menacing, hulking stallion who now stomped forwards. \"P-please, sir, I made a mistake,\" Lance began to babble, sweat pouring down his face. Out of the corner of his eyes he noticed one bed wasn't empty, the sleeping figure of the thestral from earlier curled up inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulldozer chuckled as he lifted a hind hoof and slammed the door shut behind him, leaving a round and sweaty imprint on the wood. \"Oh, you sure did, squirt.

His green eyes switched back and forth. \"I... uh... w-well, that's nice of you, but...\" he stammered, caught very much off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... I insist,\" the stallion said, giving Lance a light push that was more like a heavy shove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance almost fell on his face, but the stallion straightened up again... though on legs that were visibly shaking. \"Okay... yeah. This way...\" Lance started to trot away, casting a last look over his shoulder to all the other rookies. A lot of them were looking at him, no doubt suspecting what was going to happen. For a split second Lance's eyes met Camo's, seeing that look of apology, reminding Lance he could have just gone with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe larger stallion then blocked off the sightline, his looming form filling Lance's vision. \"Through this door, then just on the right,\" the stallion growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks,\" Lance stammered meekly, seeing no choice but to do as was asked. He trotted along in front of the huge stallion, his hooves clopping against the tiled floor, though thwy were completely eclipsed by the larger stallion behind him. His slender almost girly flank shook back and forth which each step, and he could feel those eyes staring at him. This silent marching was killing him, making him feel like he was trotting towards an execution. \"S-so, what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion behind let out a snort of laughter, the hot air from his muzzle washing over Lance's butt and making him squirm a little. \"Corporal Bulldozer. I'm your superior in more than one way, Rookie,\" the stallion declared, then snorted again. \"And right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance nodded his head, turning towards the door that clearly marked the bathrooms. He shivered, when the door pushed open and another stallion stepped out, still clasping his helmet on. \"Oh, hey!\" he called cheerily, then he saw Bulldozer. He snapped a quick salute, then gave you quite the look of pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At ease, Brass. Get out of here,\" Bulldozer growled, and the stallion did just that, clearing off and leaving you with Bulldozer. The huge stallion pushed the door open with a hoof, poking his head in to check the coast was clear.</span></div></div>",

Hooves thudded as hard as his heart pumped, the stallion galloping away from Bulldozer and the bathroom, fleeing for his life. He had to get away, there was no telling what the hulking stallion wanted. An aggressive yell from behind had Lance turn around, looking back to see the stallion glaring right at him, then he twisted his head forwards again. He had a second to see the curvy yellow mare ass right in front of him. A yelp escaped as he tried to stop his hooves, but only succeeded in tripping himself, sending him lurching forward like an arrow aimed right at the butthole in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SQUELCH* The sound must have echoed throughout the whole base as in one second Lance was reduced to a twitching pair of hind legs. The mare groaned as she flexed her hole and then contracted it, a loud slurp sounding as those hindlegs were dragged up and inside, Lance not even getting a last hoof kick before he was entirely sealed inside, already being dragged off by intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulldozer caught up and slapped her on the back. \"Guardspony Shelf! What did you do with that recruit?!\" The stallion yelled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare span around in response, turning to look at him. \"I didn't do anything, sir! He just jumped up my ass!\" she said defensively, looking down at her pudy belly as it started to bulge out, the form of a stallion already starting to swell it out. She gave him a poke and smirked, before looking up at Bulldozer. \"Sorry, sir, but I can't really let him out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulldozer glared harder, and then just gave in with a growl. \"You're filing the accident report,\" he spat before turning and trotting away, leaving the mare to her catch. A loud and bassy fart from the mare's behind had him tense up as he trotted away, muttering under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuardspony Shelf reached down to stroke her belly, pushing back against the struggling stallion. \"You chose a good belly to end up in, rookie. Better to add to my plush plot than end up on the Corporal's gut.\" The squirming bulge in her belly didn't seem to agree as it wriggled and fought, but it was no concern for the mare who merely laughed and carried on with what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance would be stewing in her gut for a while, the mare continuing her day as he pushed and wriggled inside her stomach, making indentations against the gurgling and glorping gut until he could wriggle no more. She patted the weakening bulge with a hoof, making her gut groan again with a smirk as she put the pen to paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name: Pointed Lance... Accident Level...\" A sudden belch forced its way to her maw and then out from it, a thick *BRRRRRAAAAPPPPP* filling the air as white hairs and saliva sprayed all over the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Accident Level: Fatal. Recruit did not watch where he was going and headfirst into ass. No follow up necessary.\" The report filled in, Dusty dropped it into the already full box and trotted away, her belly burbling slowly around the meal within.</span></div></div>",

Bulldozer was obviously not a nice pony and Lance could think of hundreds of bad scenarios for how this would play out. But then he thought better of it. Bulldozer is a Corporal in the Princess's royal guard for Celestia's sake. He had heard about sports teams trying to scare the new guy as a way of initiation. Hazing, it was called. That must be what this is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident in his reasoning, the recruit closes his eyes and takes a deep breath to calm his nerves. In and out. This wasn't so bad when he viewed it rationally. Another victory for logic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance is so confident in fact, he misses Bulldozer hooking a foreleg under his barrel. His eyes burst open as he is lifted roughly off the floor and thrown through the ajar door into the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOF,\" Lance exhaled, as he lands flat on his back. He feels discombobulated as the air rushed out of his lungs. He lays dazedly for a few seconds trying to catch his breath as Bulldozer calmly walks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a clang, a bolt on the door is jammed across the door-frame. Bulldozer turns to the stupefied unicorn  and trudges over with a sickening sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance heaves as he finally evens his breathing. His vision settles on the ceiling, or what should be the ceiling. What he actually sees is the upside down and hungry visage of the black stallion. Stricken with confusion and fear, the recruit is left trembling in terror. The monstrous earth pony doesn't wait for Lance to build the courage before talking down to the muzzle below his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been to long since I've gotten to do this Rookie,\" he says. A large, lopsided grin seems to have been plastered to his face. His eyes burrow into Lance's soul as a musky smell hits the unicorns nose. With a quick unconscious look Lance spots the source of the scent. His pupils dilate as he sees Bulldozer's own lance standing rigid a hooves-length from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDread washes through Lance's entire body as he stares at the massive pink rod with black splotches around the base. His concentration is broken however when Bulldozer snickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, shocked?\" He gleefully said, with more emotion than he had used since Lance and almost stumbled into him. \"You're going on a long, bumpy ride rookie!\" He exclaims as he lines up his cock with Lance's snout. Lance inhales sharply in a valiant effort to scream, but is stopped when the massive member is slammed into his face with a grunt from Bulldozer.</span></div></div>",

As if an afterthought the helmet was torn off and tossed aside with a clang. The musky fluid that slathered over the rod that was almost half the size of Lance ground all over his face, covering his white fur in messy fluid as he tried to resist the huge cock grinding against him. Lance should probably have seen this coming... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the flared fat tip of the cock started to stretch. Before Lance's eyes the urehtra stretched open, gaping in hunger as it salivated pre all over the rookie's face, covering him in the musky, thick fluid. \"Afraid it's a one way trip, rookie,\" Bulldozer grunted loudly as Lance stared into the steadily yawning and fleshy abyss... then Bulldozer gave his first hard thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a lewd and wet slap as the massive cock crashed into Lance's face, the widening cock slit clasping around the stallion's muzzle, the pink flesh stretching around to squelch noisily around his face. \"Mmmmpppphh!\" Lance finally found his tongue in time to scream into the depths of Bulldozer's cock, earning another lewd grunt from the big stallion as he almost drowned Lance in pre. Feeling the rookie try to pull back, his hoof clutched harder at Lance's mane to push him the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worming out this one, Rookie... hope you like the taste of cum,\" Bulldozer said before letting out a low chuckle. His sweaty hoof ground back and forth against the back of Lance's head, getting itself ready... \"Deep breath now,\" the stallion grunted, giving Lance a second to squeal and then pushing his head forwards in one direction, while thrusting his cock in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud and lewd squelch echoed around the entire bathroom, followed by a roar of pleasure as Bulldozer's throbbing cock was now wrapped around Lance's shoulders, the Rookie's head showing as a clear and wriggling bulge inside the length of the fat and flared shaft, every detail of his muzzle etched into the tight skin of the throbbing pink mass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Lance everything was a tunnel of pulsing pink, the cock throbbing in hard pulses, dragging Lance deeper into the horrendously musky tunnel of moist warmth. \"Mmmppphh!\" he screamed again, desperately yelling and flailing as best he could, but with another pulse the shoulders were gone, his forelegs locked to his side by the trapped joints. All he could do was wriggle his hind legs, his slender rump bouncing and shaking as the taller stallion stood over him, effortlessly cramming him into that throbbing and pulsing cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlurps and squelches accompanied every sinking inch of the unfortunate rookie, his armour still clinging to his chest, the smooth and slick metal earning more grunts of pleasure as his stomach was squeezed into the slick and wet pipe. Pre squeezed out around him, forming a belt of fluid around his waist, before the ooze dribbled down the bulging shaft to splatter into a steadily growing pool on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance's face was just now bulging the black spotched base of the cock, the drooling tip just advancing to his flanks. A loud slurp and Lance saw the tunnel twist, his muzzle driving into a more open space. The air was somehow even muskier, the overwhelming stench of male virility filling his nostrils, so overpoweringly strong. His own sheath stirred as his comparatively miniscule shaft slipped from its trappings, slapping against the massive cock beside it as his hind legs still desperately wheeled in mid-air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buck... you really know how to squirrm,\" Bulldozer grunted in delight, rolling his hips as he kept on thrusting hard, his hoof cupping Lance's rump as he squeezed the rookie inside of him, cramming him deeper and deeper with every push, his cock bulging wider as those hips sink, one cock being slurped up into another. The rookie's face wa snow clearly displayed against one of Dozer's sagging balls as he gave another hard shove to Lance's ass, squeezing it inside and leaving just those legs remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose hindlegs kicked and shook, trying to avoid their end, but Lance's spasms only heightened Bulldozer's pleasure. The larger guard let go of the ass as it vanished, and the stallion then turned to face the wall. \"Get... in... there,\" he growled lustfully as he pressed those kicking hindhooves against the back wall, forcing them to flatten, and then the hard thrusts resumed. More muffled cries and begs came from the increaisngly swollen balls as Bulldozer railed those legs against the wall, each thrust earning a loud squish and more inches of hindleg until Lance was up to his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hind hooves pressed together, wriggling weakly as the only things sat on that fat cock tip. Bulldozer groaned in delight, lifting his own hoof to lightly rub against them, teasing the soft, delicate soles of the rookie and making them shake against the lips of his flared tip. \"Damn, rookie... you really know how to please a superior...\" Bulldozer groaned as he gave the soft cleft in the hoof a last tickle and then pushed hard. With a final squelch, Lance was fully sealed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulldozer's swollen and fat balls grew fatter with every inch of Lance being crammed into them, the bulge in his shaft steadily sinking with rhythmic pulses, compacting the stallion and curling him up and inside the swelling sac. \"Not... fast... enough...\" Bulldozer grunted as he flopped down onto his ass, it slamming intothe ground as his huge, bulging cock pointed upwards and to the ceiling. With both forehooves he took hold of either side of his massive cock, felling the bulges inside, and then starting to work them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance squealed as he felt his lower body being compacted harder, Bulldozer's hooves squeezing him downwards, and stimulating himself further. Already the rookie's white fur was soaked through, covered in a cummy mix as the balls bounced and squeezed... but now he felt himself softening, the cum working against his skin. Hips bulged out the splotched base of the shaft, and then with a slurp they were pulled down too, followed quickly by the legs in one long and steady suckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bounce the swollen balls stretched to their widest, becoming huge beanbags full of the squirming shape of a rookie as Lance tried to fight his way out, even as he softened. The balls audibly churned, gurgling like a stomach as Bulldozer kept on working his cock, pumping his shaft, the muffled cries of the stallion being churned into ball batter inside only making him pump harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celestia's... engorged shaft,\" Bulldozer groaned in pleasure, his muscular thighs squeezing against those sloshing beanbags as gurgled cries continued from inside. Lance's entire body burned, an indescribable sensation spreading through him as he desperately hammered against those balls. The imprints of hooves, and then his muzzle pushed out against the taut flesh, stretching out as the stallion was clearly visible inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis next hammering hoof earned a squish... and then he felt his hoof collapse, his entire foreleg just falling apart with a splatter, dissolving into a mess of cum that splashed back into the pool. The rookie tried to scream again, howling in terror, but it was a wet gurgle, cum spilling from his lips as already the process had started inside of him. The ever more filling pool worked its way up his body, reaching his shoulders as he tried to keep his remaining hind hoof and neck above the pool... but it was all for naught. Bulldozer gave his nuts a big squeeze and with a splat Lance fell apart into seed, only his armour left floating in the otherwise purely liquid mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Bulldozer came, the stallion roaring in pleasure as his massive shaft erupted, the thick tube pulsing as the tip splayed open and hot, thick and sticky seed came roaring out. His cock was spurting like a geyser, splatting the hot and thick fluid all over his crotch and the floor, completely coating the floor in the messy and thick cum, it rushing from his thick cock to splash and splatter in all directions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain and again, the cock pulsed, the hose erupting with more and more, every throb earning a splatter of the thick white seed. For a moment it seemed to stop, but then the stallion gave another squeeze of his cock and out came flying a golden backplate, the armour completely coated in the cummy remains of the rookie that had worn it as it loudly clattered onto the floor, another spurt of cum splattering on top. After several gallons of thick and sticky seed the flow finally stopped, a last throbbing of his generous shaft giving way to nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulldozer let out a last groan, before rising to his hooves, looking down at the distinctly equine shaped splatter of cum, the armour still seeming in just the right spot. \"I'll go and get the janitor, sit tight,\" Bulldozer said with a grin, before trotting off chuckling. Lance didn't have much choice but to do just that... the rookie nothing more than a puddle of stallion spoodge. Maybe next time he shouldn't try to bullshit superiors.</span></div></div>",

Going to have a word with the captain,\" Lance replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... well, okay, sure,\" Camo replied, his face clearly falling a little. \"Well, good luck with that,\" he added before turning and trotting over to another rookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance nodded his head and then turned away himself. The door to Accipiter's office beckoned. Surely the sergeant would take Lance's family into account and cut him a good deal, maybe a guarding job, those were much safer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rookies chatted excitedly behind him Lance trotted up to the door and lifted his hoof, giving it a gentle knock. \"Come in,\" Accipiter's voice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white unicorn took a deep breath and then pushed the door open and trotted through. \"Sergeant,\u201d Lance led with, snapping a smart salute as he stepped inside. Wandering green eyes took in the plain looking room, a few framed pictures the only real decoration besides the heavy oak desk Accipiter was sat behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasi\u2019s blue eyes were quick to narrow. \u201cCadet Lance,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be out there with the other cadets?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance swallowed, but he\u2019d expected such a response. \u201cI should, Sergeant\u2026 but I think that patrol would be a waste of my talents,\u201d Lance declared, the only excuse he could summon up that didn\u2019t make him sound pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA raised eyebrow was the first response from Accipiter, before he shuffled in his chair to a position where he could lean over the desk. \u201cToo skilled for patrol\u2026\u201d Accipiter repeated, before bursting out laughing. \u201cI saw your test results, cadet, you may be smart but you\u2019re not ready for the big leagues. Go out and play with the other rookies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn frowned at those words. He couldn\u2019t go on patrol now. They\u2019d all be paired up and he\u2019d have to head out alone. He\u2019d committed to this path now. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly why I should be at a desk or an assistant or\u2026\u201d Lance replied, desperation edging into his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAssist\u2026\u201d Accipiter said slowly, shaking his head. \u201cYou want to assist?\u201d The pegasus stood up, rising to his hind hooves and then setting his forehooves on the desk in front of him. \u201cThe son of Captain Strike wants to be an assistant?!\u201d Accipiter bellowed, his hooves trembling\u2026 when suddenly he stopped. It was more unnerving than the anger for Lance as a small smile crossed Accipiter\u2019s muzzle. \u201cAn assisant\u2026 investigator. Yes. Fine, cadet, you get your promotion. You\u2019re being assigned to Investigations as a Trainee Investigator. They\u2019re always clamouring for more horsepower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance blinked. His plan\u2026 worked? Surely being an investigator was less risky than being on patrol, right? And maybe they\u2019d foist the paperwork on him and keep him out of harm\u2019s way completely. \u201cT-thank you, sir!\u201d Lance said with a grin, snapping a salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow get out of my sight, TI. Don\u2019t make me regret this by dying on your first case. Report to Inspector Sergeant Watcher, unless you find this disagreeable too. There is one last place I can reassign you,\u201d Accipiter said, looking up with a grin across his muzzle.</span></div></div>",

My patrol's tonight!\" she called cheerily. Accipiter's big speech hadn't put her off, she couldn't wait to start off her career as a Royal Guard.

Really all she had to do was keep on doing what she was doing. She clamped her eyes a little tighter, her body tensing up before she relaxed everything again. Somewhere in the stupid room she could hear a clock slowly ticking, it's constant tick-tock a pain in the ass. She was stronger than it though. She wasn't going to let some clock come between herself and an illustrious career as the most heroic guardspony ever. She could see it now... adoring fans, a member of Luna's personal retinue... a unit of thestrals willing to do anything for her... anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her restlless state her mind chose to latch onto that idea. Stallions and mares who would fight under her on the battlefield... then lay under her in the barracks. Mares begging for her to set on their face, stallions rubbing their erections against her thighs... the thestral shifted a little in her bed, rolling onto her back. She was alone, she knew she was alone... so why not treat herself. Her hoof wandered down to the space between her hind legs, to the small pink slit in her silver fur. A light stroke and she let out a soft gasp, those mental images of studly stallions and needy mares filling her mind. She let her hoof rest against her marehood... and then she teased it in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother gasp escaped her as her two sharp fangs sank into her lower lips, nipping them. \"Mmm... Leatherwing...\" she moaned in her sleep, gently pressing the tip of her hoof into her marehood, pushing apart the slippery lips as she delicately pressed the tip of her hoof inside. Another gasp escaped as she pushed it inside, the smooth curved edge quickly becoming slick as it pushed into her soft and squishy depths. A hot moan issued from her lips as she pressed it deeper, her hind legs twitching in the air as she pushed it inside of her. \"Buck me... take me...\" she gasped at her mental image of a muscular thestral standing over her as she worked her hoof harder and harder inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silvery grey thestral squirmed against her bed, writhing on her back with her wings outspread as she worked that hoof of hers in and out, quiet moist squelches accompanying each push of her hoof as she worked back against the bed, her rump wriggling as she pulsed that hoof inside of her again and again. Her marehood clenched back around her hoof, squeezing against it as it filled her pussy excellently. Hot pants and moans got louder and louder as she pumped her hoof, imagining a thick, flared cock ramming deep inside of her again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn only a few minutes she felt herself reaching the edge and she bit down hard on her own forehoof to muffle the shriek of pleasure that escaped her, before that rush of sweet mare honey splashed out of her and into the bedsheets below, stickying them with each pulse as it oozed out around her hoof, squelching with each push. Her whole body clenched with her orgasm, and then slowly relaxed. She lifted her hoof from her jaws, two pin points leaking blood from the pressure of her bite. She let out a last pant and then lay her head back, covering her mess with a blanket before she closed her eyes. Sleep came much easier this time.</span></div></div>",

Naughty thoughts no doubt occurred to the stallion stood over her, especially in such an empty room, but he had a job to do. The grey thestral stallion lifted a hoof and reached down, gently placing it on her shoulder. \"Cadet Moonbounce,\" he called softly, giving her a shake. The mare groaned, shifting slightly. \"Moonbounce?\" he called again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thestral mare's eyes opened, her warm amber irises fixing on the slitted blue eyes above her. \"Mmm... Leatherwing?\" she said softly, still blinking away sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually it's Nox. Sergeant Nox,\" the stallion corrected, giving her a sharp toothed smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon blinked, and then her eyes went wide. \"Ah!\" she squealed in surprise before leaping out of bed, kicking off bedsheets as they tried to trip her so she could stand before him and snap a salute. \"Cadet Moonbounce reporting for duty, sir!\" she said snappishly, trying to look tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox straightened up, his purple helmet featuring a more pronounced and spined crest, the eye gem that clasped his collar was a deep blue. \"At ease, Cadet Moonbounce. Good to see you followed Sergeant Accipiter's advice,\" the stallion stated. \"Get your armour on, it's time and sorted out. I'll meet you in the briefing room in five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" Moonbounce called cheerily, the thestral running over to her table and then bending over to grab it, lifting her delightfully plush rear into the air with no hesitation. Nox got a great view of her silver rump cheeks and the crack between, her pert ponut and already moist netherlips completely on display. Nox licks his lips at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The notion made Moon both relieved and, slightly oddly, disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope your sleep fostered vigil,\u201d said the Sergeant exactly five minutes later in his office. \u201cFor tonight\u2019s going to busy.

Gathering intel on them should be a piece of fruitcake for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox smiled at her brashness. \u201cThe case is yours then. Well, half of it is. Remember, cadets are first supposed to learn patrolling, then how to take down griffon mafia. I\u2019ve already assigned an investigator for this operation: Corporal Silhouette. You shall meet her tonight in the tavern of Silver Horse, and your main task is to offer whatever help you can to her. Understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYessir,\u201d said Moon, albeit less boldly than before. For a moment she had thought she\u2019d get to lead an investigation on her own \u2013 not just work as someone\u2019s sidekick. In any case, that was the case she had chosen, and it was what she\u2019d stick with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours from the briefing, when the evening started stretching its limbs over the streets of Canterlot, Moonbounce headed towards the Silver Horse. From outside it appeared like any other tavern in Canterlot, which wasn\u2019t to say much. Ins such as the Horse were turning scarce in the magical city, being replaced by fashionable caf\u00e9s and restaurants. A sense of nostalgia wafted from the place into Moon\u2019s nostrils as she stood at the door. Correcting her uniform one more time, she stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faint music that had spilled outside turned out to come from a piano in the corner, played by an aged stallion more or less admiringly. Long, measuring looks greeted Moonbounce on pace with the slow melody. For a moment it seemed like the whole room was inhaling her presence, tasting her like fine smoke, then returning back where it had left with an exhale that left her feeling less than welcomed. Nonetheless, she ordered a drink (a water with ice) and sat down at one of the empty, round tables like everyone else, waiting for her contact to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could not help noticing that a larger than average portion of the customers here were griffons. This had to be some sort of a haunt for the small avian minority that inhabited the Cliffs of Canterlot. Even the bartender was a griffon \u2013 the first of her kind Moon had seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, somepony sat opposite to her. \u201cCadet Moonbounce?\u201d asked the slim-built, sea-green pegasus mare dressed in Lunar Guard\u2019s uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah, that\u2019s me,\u201d said Moon, not quite sure if she should salute or not. \u201cUhm\u2026 Corporal Silhouette?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s Princess Sparkle,\u201d said the mare, rolling her sapphire eyes. She noticed the doubtful look on Moon\u2019s face. \u201cGot a problem, cadet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Moon, suffocating her surprise. \u201cI just assumed you\u2019d be, uhm\u2026 Well, a thestral.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI pray your assumptions aren\u2019t all as awful,\u201d said the Corporal. She waved a hoof, which earned her a bottle of apple cider. She uncorked it with her teeth and emptied half in one go, right before Moon\u2019s stunned expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t we on duty?\u201d she managed when the bottle hit the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo me a favour, cadet,\u201d burped Silhouette, wiping foam from her jaw. \u201cStop being green. Right now. This side of town, green is what the bottoms of cobblestones are made of.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You listen, watch, and do exactly as I say and, who knows, you might learn something tonight.

Come, pay the bill. We\u2019ve got to hurry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really should pay her own drinks at least, thought Moon as they set off on the streets. There was no doubt that the corporal was a bully, but if she could really teach her something important, Moon was ready to suck up the barks. For this one night, at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did they tell you about the smugglers?\u201d asked Silhouette while they trotted from one beam of streetlight to the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much, really,\u201d confessed Moon. \u201cIt was just Sergeant Nox\u2019s hunch. He said griffon gangs were under suspicion for several crimes, including assaults, theft and trashing. For painting graffitis,\u201d she specified when the corporal raised an eyebrow at the last crime. She snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFigures. Do they even read the reports I send them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean the griffons have nothing to do with anything resembling a crime in these parts,\u201d said Silhouette. \u201cI\u2019ve been tracking a whole different lead; a real whammy, mind you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Moon. \u201cOdd. Sergeant Nox seemed so sure that\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetween you and me,\u201d said Silhouette, glancing at Moon, \u201cSergeant Nox would suspect a griffon if an ice cream disappeared in a desert. Not his favourite race, you see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re saying he\u2019s\u2026 biased?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that thick after all, are you. There\u2019s a story buried there, you can bet on that. Behave and maybe I\u2019ll let you in on it one of these nights,\u201d Silhouette said, smirking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Moon. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the whammy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDogs,\u201d drawled Silhouette. \u201cDiamond dogs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t even know there were diamond dogs in Canterlot, much less criminal ones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout time you learned then,\u201d continued the corporal. \u201cOfficially there aren\u2019t any, that\u2019s true. But unofficially, the mountain\u2019s loaded with tunnels filled with the creepers. I\u2019ve been shadowing their activities for a long while now, trying to keep a lid on this thing. It\u2019s huge, you see. They\u2019re smuggling all sorts of stuff for pretty much anypony who can afford them, from arcane items to slaves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSlaves?\u201d gasped Moon. \u201cThere are slaves in Canterlot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dark world under the mountain,\u201d said Silhouette grimly. \u201cNot something they tell in the tourist brochures. Not good advertisement, you see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s so much I don\u2019t know about my own city, thought Moon. So much I will have to help make right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the naked moon, they arrived to the lower cliffside. Canterlot\u2019s general architecture was vertical, starting from the lower strands of the mountainside and ending almost halfway to the peak. It was common knowledge that there were lots of tunnels in the mountain, old dragon hives and exhausted mines mostly. Nopony much came down here unless they wanted to catch the odd loose rock on the head or get buried in a collapsing tunnel. Or expose a gang of enslaving diamond dogs, added Moon mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Silhouette as they crouched behind a large rock looming at the entrance of a mine shaft. \u201cI\u2019ve been feigning cooperation with these bastards to get their trust, and it has finally paid fruit. We\u2019ve arranged a deal, one that will put them down for good. All I need is evidence, for which I desperately need help. Up for it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Because I\u2019m going to sell you as a slave to them. Not actually, of course,\u201d Silhouette added quickly when she saw Moon\u2019s face. \u201cYou see, the dogs have in their possession a powerful magical item, which they intend trading for somepony in the city. I managed to bargain a better deal, but one that demands the best merchandise in return. You, that is. But once I can deliver the item to the Castle, I can prove the dogs, not the griffons, are behind the smuggling in the city. You\u2019ll help expose one of the biggest crime rings of Equestria, right on your first night on duty. Aren\u2019t you proud?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, but,\u201d started Moon. \u201cWhat happens to me after you\u2019ve\u2026 sold me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, you\u2019ll just spend a few hours in their custody. They don\u2019t wanna harm valuable property, silly! At worst you\u2019ll have to wait in the dark a bit, then we\u2019ll crack down on the place and free you, the hero of the hour. Now, there\u2019s not much time to waste anymore. Are you in, or are you out?\u201d</span></div></div>",

It didn\u2019t kill the taste of fear, but reminded her that honor wasn\u2019t meant to be a sweet treat. \u201cLoyal to the death, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Silhouette with a smile. \u201cOkay, take off your clothes. Yeah yeah, of course you can\u2019t march in there dressed like a guard; the gig would be up instantly. In fact, under no circumstances are you to tell them you\u2019re a member of the Guard, got it? It\u2019s super important: otherwise they might panic and bury you in some hole where we could never find you. Just keep your mouth shut and your eyes low and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce certainly felt less than fine as Silhouette walked her, at the end of a string and a collar, into the mine. It was a damp, black, moonless place, smelling of dead things and mold. Unprotected from the rains, the mine had nearly turned into a swamp inside the rock. Moon could only hope she would not get sick during her time in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn\u2019t need to walk far until three heavy-built figures cut their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, friends,\u201d said Silhouette. She had stripped her uniform before entering, revealing a simple cloak underneath. Moon on the other hoof had nothing to cover her from the moist chill of the underground air. The gleaming eyes studying her from the darkness helped her tremors none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s her?\u201d said one of the dogs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho else?\u201d said Silhouette tiredly. \u201cNow, do we have a deal or what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog looked once at Moon, then at the corporal, then at Moon again. A mighty paw scratched a chest like a barrel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have a deal,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilhouette smiled, then hoofed him the end of Moon\u2019s rope, which was immediately yanked. She followed with her head bowed, like she had been told to. As she passed Silhouette, the corporal brushed her encouragingly with a wing. It gave Moon unexpected comfort while she was escorted deeper into the awful tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe narrow track continued sloping downwards, following rails long since rusted to ruin. It was getting so dark that even Moon\u2019s sharp eyes had trouble to keep her from tripping. The dogs didn\u2019t slow down at the face of utter blackness, which meant they had to have the eyes of owls or that they knew the mine like their own paws. In any case, Moon was getting more worried by the minute. Her anxiety peaked suddenly when she heard one of the dogs behind her whisper to his friend:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember: this time I gets the ribs. I see you anywhere near that pony before my turn, you\u2019ll be dining through straws the rest of your days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon had to bite her tongue to keep herself from yelping. Had her fear finally condescended into delusion, or were they really planning to eat her? In the heat of uncertainty, she spotted another tunnel splitting to her left \u2013 the first one yet. She could try to flee now, or stick to the plan and try her luck with the dogs.</span></div></div>",

Without wasting a moment, she jerked her leash violently. It came loose, and soon flapped behind her as she galloped into the darkness, the barks of the dogs flying like arrows at her back. The cry \u201cCatch the meat!\u201d in particular made her hooves light and heart flutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis tunnel was significantly narrower than the first one. Instead of rails on rock, she now ran on rotten wood, splintering planks as she went. A few sharp twists interrupted her race with painful collisions with a wall, but still she dared to hope she was losing her pursuers. Their voices faded in degrees, lost in the twists and further splits of the mine until only echoes churned around her. Only when she couldn\u2019t make out the words anymore did she settle down, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce\u2019s rest proved short-lived however, for no sooner had she sat her bum on the floor when it gave up under her, plunging her into the void. She screamed, first during the fall, then right after the landing. Cold metal halted her drop, catching her by the ribs, a couple of which she cracked. That wasn\u2019t the worst of it though: she was moving again, and gaining speed by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m in a mining carriage, she realized in horror. The ancient wagon propelled onwards, rattling like the rusted heap of metal that it was. Moonbounce cried as loud as her lungs would allow, right until the corroded rails failed and she fell again. The experience did not differ from the first one, although this time she caught the heavy carriage right on top of her back. She passed out under the fireworks of agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awoke at the sensation of something nibbling at her feet. Alarmed to the sudden intake of reality, she jolted up, or at least tried to. The fallen carriage pinned her down mercilessly, thwarting her efforts to move it or herself. In the pitch-blackness she shouted for help, for any help, even for the dogs. Only her own, broken voice answered her \u2013 along with the incessant scurrying of tiny feet around her. Rats, she thought. They\u2019re just rats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor hours she tried to get up, get help, or in any shape or form milden her suffering, all in vain. Hunger and thirst crept to her conscious battling with pain and exhaustion. In the end, she could only lay still, sobbing, hoping for a miracle. Instead, she only got more rats, moving a little bit closer with every ounce of strength she lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet off of me!\u201d she cried, throwing rocks at the infernal noises. \u201cGet the buck off of me! I\u2019m not going to be anyone\u2019s food!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rodents chittered relentlessly. The boldest returned to nibble at her feet trapped under the wagon regardless of how many times she kicked them away, and their numbers seemed to be growing every time. She could not hold them off for long, she realized. That was one scary thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharp teeth sank into her ear. She screamed, slashing at the beast, which scurried away with a piece of her along. At the same time, its sibling bit her into the ribs. That one she killed with a wham of her leg. Three more took its place. And then, like a tidal wave the vermin flooded over her flailing, shrieking body until all that could be seen were two front legs and her one good wing waving manically above a sea of black fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon\u2019s mind blanked in the face of terror itself. Teeth and claws like needles sank into her from every side, ripping away pieces like paper, seeping into every crevice and fold of her figure. Her face came apart in a flurry of bites, her lips, ears, cheeks and eyes being shredded while she still wriggled. The biggest rats fought for her meaty thighs, soft belly and sensitive tits, munching right through her beautiful skin into the intestines. Her puffy pussy posed the most prized delicacy: it devoured vermin almost as eagerly as they devoured it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last the mare\u2019s cries fell silent and her body surrendered its struggles, albeit not its twitches. The rats dived in the buffet from holes old and new, scouring every tasty bit they could out of the thestral and into their starving guts. Soon enough little but bones, shreds of leather, mane and hooves remained, the rest filling the hundreds small stomachs of the black horde.</span></div></div>",

And who knew, perhaps they were simply messing with her mind with whispers of pony ribs. Surely they knew thestrals had good hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any further incidents they arrived to what must\u2019ve once been an ore refinery, build deep inside the mountain. The room was comparatively large, lighted with lamps and cleaned much better than the rest of the mine. It smelled heavily of smoke. Clearly the dogs not only traded but lived here, too. Various items from furniture to mining equipment filled the space, but Moon\u2019s gaze was mostly drawn to the huge furnace now standing cold on one side of the room. It sure looked large enough to fit a whole pony inside. And that massive cauldron steaming next to it didn\u2019t look any less threatening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTie her down,\u201d commanded the spokesperson of the gang. \u201cI\u2019ll get the other one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two dogs forced her down and began to tie her legs and wings together with the leash while the third went to dig around the remains of the fireplace. Moonbounce did her best to cling to the plan of shutting up and hoping this was all a hoax, a trick, a terrible misunderstanding. Corporal Silhouette had assured her she\u2019d be fine, right? Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA precipice of sorts approached her in form of a gag one of the dogs was about to put on her. After that, she could not longer even try to plead for her life, or to rely on the authority of the Guard, however flimsy that might be.

The thick rope secured her legs in pairs, then bundled them. She was nothing short of helpless now. At least she could (in theory) stop worrying about the consequences, for there was nothing she could do to advance her cause anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that she saw the third dog raise a cooked, partly scorched flank of a pony from among the ashes of the fireplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRolf, you imbecile!\u201d he shouted. \u201cYou buried it too close to the surface! Look how it burned!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s how I likes \u2018em,\u201d growled the one addressed as Rolf. \u201cHow\u2019s the ribs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou tell me,\u201d said the dog who pulled the pony out of the earth. \u201cI\u2019m not eating this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce\u2019s wide eyes shimmered at the sight of thoroughly cooked unicorn stallion. Judging from his steaming, blackened flesh, he had spent hours stewing under the fire, probably alive from the excruciating look on his destroyed face. A stump of a horn oozed liquids over the cracked cheeks, popped eyeballs and dried lips. His mouth hung open, a limp, swollen tongue falling out with the stray ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop bitching,\u201d said Rolf, tightening Moon\u2019s last knot. \u201cYou know the other flank\u2019s just as you like it: medium raw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d said the third dog, hauling the stallion over a table. \u201cI\u2019ll prepare this one: take the bat to the pot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna\u2019s craters, thought Moonbounce in dismay as Rolf hauled her over his broad shoulders. They\u2019re eating ponies! They\u2019re eating ponies! They\u2019re going to eat me! Her voice, ear-splitting in her head, spilled through the mouthpiece as pathetic squealing. The dog minded her feeble resistance none, but walked right to the steaming cauldron, of which he lifted the lid to allow both him and her get a good look inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Moonbounce was so stunned she almost forgot to panic. The thick, deep-brown substance bubbling faintly in the pot looked almost like\u2026 But that was stupid. Why would anyone heat up such a vast amount of\u2026 And for what purpose if not to\u2026 Oh no\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHandling her like a straw doll, Rolf turned Moonbounce around and started lowering her, rump first, into the substance. She wriggled and squirmed as best as she could, but inevitably her buttocks touched the broth. It wasn\u2019t exactly boiling, but the heat scalded her nonetheless; especially when it came in touch with her nether regions. She screamed internally while her pelvis gradually sank in, the syrupy goo tainting her groomed fur, irritating with its sultriness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pot was only deep enough to allow her submerge up to her shoulders. The gunk was so dense the dog didn\u2019t even need to hold her still. All her efforts to escape the itching, baking heat melted like the sweat on her brow, mixing with the salty tears. Her pussy filled up with the stiff, syrupy goo, burning her from inside and outside both. There was no longer any doubt as to what she had been dipped into, or what, in due time, she would be turned into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several agonizing minutes she sat in the pot, squinting as the slug seeped into her fur and invaded her bottom until she could sense the same radiating warmth in her ass as she could in her cunt. When the dog finally started pulling her up, she wept uncontrollably, wanting nothing but to empty herself which way ever possible of the sweet, horrible stuff. Brownish mass trickled from her pussy, ass, legs and torso while she was turned around. Her mouthpiece came off with a wet smack. She gulped in air, tried to voice her objections, but without any further ado the dug stuck her headfirst back into the dark chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoo\u2013ghmpphh!\u201d she garbled as her muzzle broke the sticky surface. The sizzling, broiling cocoa blocked her nostrils, but not like water or any thinner liquid would. A sense of pressure became immediately present, and combined with the stuffing humidity her situation turned from insufferable to unbearable in a matter of seconds even before the rest of her face disappeared under the face of candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog let the mare sink up to her shoulders, then cut the rope holding her hind legs to the rest of her body. Hanging her by the limbs, Rolf let the pony dive a little bit deeper, up to her navel. His firm grip kept the mare\u2019s legs still, confining her twitches to her engulfed upper body. Chocolate bubbled around the shaking pelvis, poured out of the ass and pussy, and then finally he felt the mare\u2019s rigid frame relax after a brief but intense fight. A few larger bubbles rose to the surface, carrying an echo of a scream. The dog huffed, then let go of the chocolate covered legs. Licking his paws he watched them slump up to the knees, which were left sticking up amusingly. Rolf gave the hooves a tentative lick, then left the mare brew in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the three dogs had reduced the roasted stallion into a pile of bones and digesting meat, Rolf returned to the cauldron. The fire below extinguished, the chocolate had hardened around the mare whose legs still protruded from the middle like two trunks. The mass was rather flimsy and came apart easily as the strong creature dug the pony out for critical inspection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks good to me,\u201d said a dog picking burned hairs stuck between his teeth. \u201cBreak me a piece.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce\u2019s coated ear came off with a gentle crack and was delivered as requested. The dog bit down on it, chewing the mixture of stewed meat and sweet chocolate, relishing the rich flavour. \u201cNot bad. Now gimme a piece of rib.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiece by piece, the mare vanished from existence. The texture of her meat softened by the heat, she offered an ideal dessert on top of a nourishing roast. Even most of her insides had been drenched in the sweet chocolate, which had poured down her throat, clogging her lungs and stomach, and, stuffed from the others holes, her womb and intestines. The dogs enjoyed her slowly, taking their time to savour her, making sure not a bloated eyeball, not a stewed tit, nor a loaded pussy went to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the pile of bones doubled in size. Blood and chocolate rimmed three canine mouths, three stomachs bulged handsomely and gurgled loudly, their various contents roiling in digestive acids. Meat and candy became one in a dance ordered by a cacophony of burps, gastric noises and the occasional fart.</span></div></div>",

Hold on a second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeat speaks,\u201d observed the dog. The casualness of the comment had something very terrifying about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m no one\u2019s meat!

Moonbounce prayed she hadn\u2019t botched everything, including her chances of survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA guard\u2026?\u201d said the leader dog, turning slowly to Moon. The yellow eyes drilled into her viciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am,\u201d she said carefully. The cat was out of the bag; she might as well let it out the door too. \u201cCadet Moonbounce, Lunar Guard, second division.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA guard,\u201d growled the dog. His paws squeezed into fists. \u201cFellas, we\u2019ve been tricked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s ya mean, Berg?\u201d asked the dog who had been about to muzzle Moonbounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bloody feather brains!\u201d shouted Berg. He grunted at the questioning looks of his friends. \u201cYou don\u2019t see? The griffons sold us out. There\u2019s a bunch of soldiers marching here right now, about to capture us with one of their own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d asked Moon. \u201cThe griffons?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy my fleas, you\u2019re right,\u201d said a dog. \u201cIt\u2019s a trap!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we do? What do we do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you mean, the griffons sold you out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d barked Berg. \u201cShut the bat up! I needs to think\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, wait!\u201d Moonbounce tried as the dogs grabbed her again. This time they didn\u2019t stop at her pleads, but secured her tightly and muzzled her mouth shut so hard her teeth ached. Wordlessly she watched as the dogs withdrew to argue. Meanwhile, another battle took place inside her head. How were the griffons involved in this? Did the dogs think corporal Silhouette worked for them? Had she infiltrated into their camp too? But she had said the griffons were not a factor\u2026 None of this made sense to Moonbounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did made sense, horrible such, was the smell of cooked meat wafting from the spot Berg had been digging. If she strained her neck, she could just about see half a leg sticking out from the ashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flinched as the dogs suddenly stood around her. That was the last thing she saw before she was stuffed into a sack and lifted up, to be carried into the night. From the little information she could gather she deduced they headed back to the city, deep into its heart. After hours, the sound of paws on cobblestones finally stopped. Shattering glass signaled a broken window. They entered a building of some sort, the characterizing smell of which was\u2026 cream?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoist her there,\u201d she heard said. She felt as she was carried up, possibly via ladders. Her cramped, painful and suffocating situation finally ended when the sack\u2019s mouth was opened. She stretched out her neck, desperate for air and information about her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like a factory, but not what she imagined a factory should look like, if that made any sense. Steel and ceramic tiles dominated the site. Strange machines shone in the moonlight spilling through the large windows. She hang over a huge metal vat filled with some pale, bleak liquid. Cream, Moonbounce realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, drop her,\u201d said Berg from down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce whimpered as her sack was emptied into the vat. The fall ended with a mighty splash. The cream was shallow enough to let her hit the bottom hard yet deep enough to electrify her with the fear of drowning. She struggled to keep her head afloat, the white, thick substance matting her fur all over. She looked up, but the dog had already disappeared. What were they planning to do with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere around her, wheels started turning. The dogs were operating the machines, bringing the factory to life. Moonbounce felt lost and panicked in equal measure. The cream seeped in past her closed lips, overwhelming her with the taste of sugar, fat and spices. Somewhere very near, a loud humming noise intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat should do it,\u201d said the distorted voice of Berg from beyond the metal wall. \u201cProblem solved. They\u2019ll find her in the morning, far from our den, got with nothing to do with us. Still, we better start thinking of changing the city. This one\u2019s getting too small for us and the chickens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t we stay to see how she turns out?\u201d asked another voice. It was met with an angry growl. Beyond that, Moonbounce was left alone with the humming. She floundered in the cream for her life. It stretched her imagination to think of a worse situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, and Moonbounce kept involuntarily swallowing countless gulps of cream. Perhaps she could drink her way out of this. Perhaps she would not need to. For some reason, the white pond around her was turning less liquid by the minute. At first she thought she was turning it into whip cream with her thrashing, but then another realization struck her: it was getting increasingly cold. Warmth fled the vat as if driven away by the incessant mechanical humming. She was shivering now. And the cream only kept turning more freezing, stiffening until it almost resembled\u2026 ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the morning came, Moonbounce wasn\u2019t shivering anymore. She barely breathed. Thin slices of air moved back and forth her ice-blue lips half immersed in ice cream. The engines had purred all night, solidifying the cream and almost turning Moon into a living snowbat. She couldn\u2019t feel anything anymore. In fact, when the humming finally stopped, she was actually starting to feel a bit hot. It was the last phase of hypothermia knocking on the door of her life. I have to get out of here, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the vat, the first early bird worker had turned up, noticed somepony had left the machines on for the night, thus readying this batch for further processing. Whistling to herself, she pushed a few levers and released the hydraulic press on the ice cream, which would be pushed out of the hole in the bottom and under the conveyor belt below, on which empty packages already awaited to be filled with the delicious treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout to carry on with other tasks, the worker suddenly halted when the press began complaining. Gears grinded one another, clearly encountering unexpected resistance. She looked at the vat, wondering what hindered the compression. The pressure increased dangerously; already she could hear the boiler whining. This time its screaming sounded even more equine than usual. She was about to stop the engine when the high-pitched noise ceased, at the same moment when something gave inside the vat with a crunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, ice cream started flowing through the funnel as intended. There was something off about the color though. The worker walked to the conveyor belt and scooped a hoofful of the pinkish sorbet. Mindful that nopony saw her, she gave it a lick. Funny, she thought. This batch was supposed to be plain vanilla, but she detected a hint of apple.</span></div></div>",

Her built was sturdier than Silhouette\u2019s, but the smaller mare\u2019s punches had both vigour and professionality to them which Moon could only dream of. The corporal really wanted to subdue her, but for the life of her she couldn\u2019t understand why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease stop!\u201d wailed Moon, trying to escape. The corporal responded to her shouts with a sharp kick to the ribs. Moon threatened to get trampled under the merciless feet. She rolled on the coarse rocks, not even feeling them cut into her skin as the desperately tried to stand up. Silhouette\u2019s wing put a stop to that, whapping her painfully on the ears. She fell to her knees, her guard let down just long enough for one of the kicks to reach her jawline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStubborn bitch,\u201d said Silhouette while Moon groaned on the ground. \u201cThis would\u2019ve been a lot easier for both of us if you had just have followed your orders like the good filly that you are. The dogs would\u2019ve gotten rid of you nice and quiet, and I would be strolling home for supper. Instead, you decided to grow a spine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeething in confusion, anger and pain, Moonbounce listened to the corporal in utter disbelief. She understood every word what she said, but the sentences they formed had no shape that would fit her mind. Her gut told her to fight, but her broken jaw assured her that rising up was not advisable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only question remains, what to do with you,\u201d continued Silhouette. Her slender stomach chose that exact moment to grumble loudly. A grin any pumpkin would envy spread on her cheeks. \u201cI suppose that, since you made me skip my meal, it\u2019s only fair you\u2019ll serve me a new one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow her words not only baffled but scared Moonbounce. As the corporal approached her she tried to scramble away, to shout for help, to lose the wiry wings that embraced her temples and strong hooves that pressed her down. Lastly, she tried to stop the corporal\u2019s wide-open mouth from covering her vision. She succeeded in none of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuit struggling or I\u2019ll snap your neck,\u201d mumbled Silhouette, whose lips parted to accommodate Moon\u2019s muzzle inside her own. In one fluid motion, the jade fur spread over its darker cousin. Flat teeth chewed her gently, then clamped down to pull her deeper. The thestral jolted, the pain of her injured bone peaking. The pegasus only squeezed harder with her wings, her hooves, her jaws. Eyes shimmering in tears and fear, Moon stared at her assailant right until the moment her ravenous mouth engulfed her up to her ears, glued against her skull by pressure and saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, not bad, rookie,\u201d moaned Silhouette. Her wings hugged the back of the batpony\u2019s head, locking her still while she savoured her plump cheeks, full lips and salty sweat. Her saphire irises rolling exploratorily, Silhouette squiggled her tongue over her meal\u2019s closed eyelids. Applying modest pressure, she started prying the thin skin open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon gargled and gasped, her nostrils clogged by sticky saliva. As if the pain in the jaw wasn\u2019t bad enough, her assailant now tried to intrude her eye sockets. Despite her fierce resistance and all hopes to the contrary, the nimble tongue slipped between her eyelid and eyeball, which it immediately started slathering in spit. At that point, heedless of the agony it inflamed, Moonbounce screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilhouette smiled at the feeling of a primal shriek travelling down her throat. The rest of the bitch would follow soon, but not before she had drained every last drop of taste out of her. The eyeball she rolled over was a treat to lick, indeed. The closest comparison she could come by was apple jelly: all bouncy and springy. For a moment the corporal fancied plucking the thing out and chewing it down to mush. That would\u2019ve taken a while though, and she was in somewhat of a hurry. Gracing the oculus with one more dap, she withdrew her tongue and gave the back of Moonbounce\u2019s head a mighty shove with her wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon\u2019s scream ended in sorry coughing, but her trip down the gullet of the pegasus resumed fast. Smell of rotten vegetables and gastric juices floated up to greet her, an ugly promise of what her last moments on this earth would be like. In the end, she\u2019d share a destiny with countless lettuces, cabbages, carrots and other greens, slowly churning away in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, Silhouette had to slow down her feeding while the meal started fighting back worse than before. The pony\u2019s wings, ending in claws that could cut bone, proved especially challenging as they whipped the air blindly. In one quick move, she trapped both of the leathery pennons by the roots with her green-blue feathers, pinching them until she could feel the thin bones inside shifting. And then she wrenched roughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon hadn\u2019t believed she could be hurt more, which goes to show how easily such notions are in general entertained. Deep inside the throat she screamed for the second time from the bottom of her lungs. A tiny echo returned to her from the depths ahead, carrying a message from the starving emptiness that lay waiting there. Abundant sobs paved her way as Moonbounce continued her one-way voyage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first wrench had broken the stems of the thestral\u2019s wings, but it took a lot of wringing to tear them loose for good. Silhouette took her time, gulping down the mare up to her shoulders while her dexterous wings worked on their own. The pennons were mostly bone and leather, as nutritious as they were tasty. The pegasus discarded them in short order, careful not to stain her feathers in the bleeding stems they left behind. Around that time she had finally made it past the meaty shoulders, with only the hooves sticking out from her jaw now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure choking Moonbounce was finally alleviating, but only because she had finally made it into the stomach. Her face was lodged uncomfortably against the sphincter muscle at the base of the stomach. It wouldn\u2019t give in an inch \u2013 not when her figure was still solid. That wouldn\u2019t be the case forever though, as the stinging, itching feeling seeping into her fur testified. The belly rumbled eagerly in her ears, the muscles rubbing acids all over like a giant apple. She\u2019d have cried for the third time, but plain breathing demanded effort now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe struggles of her prey were finally dying, Silhouette observed. That was a shame, for towards the end she had actually developed a liking to the sensation of a living being moving around within her. As her swallows reached the thestral\u2019s pelvis, however, she got an idea of how to stir a few more ounces of fun out of the bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen only the dark tail and a pair of hind legs protruded out of Silhouette\u2019s maw, she sank her tongue into the pussy inside her mouth. At once this earned a twitch and a faint moan from her belly. The corporal glanced down and snickered at the sight of the batpony\u2019s features imprinting against her fur. Another lick merited a similar reaction, after which Silhouette set to steadily eat out the mare. Her cunt was the best part of the wretch, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the stomach, Moonbounce sloshed like a clot in a vegetable soup, unable to control the reactions the pegasus incited in her. The acids were starting to pool now, and much of her forehead was already immersed. Moon\u2019s mind blurred, the lack of oxygen drilling the final nail into her coffin. The bliss of unconsciousness lay right ahead, and she was ready to accept it wholeheartedly. But not before the third scream, loudest so far, exploded in her lungs, raced up her throat and drowned in the gastric pond that swooped in from the other direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever ever until now had eating a mare out been more incisive a phrase, thought Silhouette while she enthusiastically feasted on the batpony\u2019s pussy. There was something intimately satisfying in sending another mare down, piece by delicious piece. The last thrashes in her belly put a cherry on top of that cake, which she finished with a contented sigh. After that, the remaining feet were but a formality with which she dispensed without much attention. The limp tail she suckled up like a spaghetti. For a moment she swayed on her enormously engorged belly, gave her flank a few careful pats, then bellowed a mighty burp that send a couple of the tail hairs trailing through the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that went smoothly,\u201d Silhouette commented. She looked at her belly, across which quivers travelled in rhythm of long, drawn out gurgles. Inside, fur fell apart, muscles liquefied, bones crunched. From experience she knew that she\u2019d better eat enzyme pills before the night to aid her digestion, unless she absolutely wanted to tear her ass later down the line. An equine digestive tract could only deal with so much of bone, hair, teeth and hooves. And she would definitely not wish to repeat the experience of shitting out an intact horse skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another moderate burp, she set towards her home, belly swinging and murmuring.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Moonbounce could feel the prickling of angry eyeballs on her skin. Silhouette didn\u2019t seem to mind the attention at all, for her cackle seesawed into giggling during a span of several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood one, Moony,\u201d she finally said, wiping tears off her cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019ve really made my night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf only I could say the same,\u201d replied Moonbounce, yanking up her collar to cover her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSIlhouette took note of that over her raised drink. \u201cBah, never mind these knuckleheads. Let them think what they will. This place could use some mirth, I always say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the table and through the faint cigarette smoke, Moonbounce glared at the pegasus who was supposed to be her superior; somepony she was supposed to look up to and learn from. All she could see was a loudmouth jerk with a possible drinking problem. The quicker she could depart from her company, the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understood you had a case in your hooves,\u201d said Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn right I do,\u201d replied Silhouette after finishing her cider. She leaned conspiratorially forward. \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018another round\u2019. You up for it, Moony?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop calling me that,\u201d growled Moonbounce under her breath. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t be serious: we\u2019re supposed to be solving crimes, not drinking our asses off in a lousy bar!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last part came across louder than she had intended. The eyeballs crept up her neck along with the red of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d retorted Silhouette. She stood up. \u201cMake yourself useful and hold onto the table: I have a call of nature to answer to. And order the drink too. That\u2019s an order.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the flaming on Moon\u2019s face wasn\u2019t all due to shame. If looks could kill, the corporal would\u2019ve been blown to bits as she swaggered towards the toilets. <i>I swear, Sergeant Nox will get a report the likes of which he hasn\u2019t seen since the Great Betrayal of 716,</i> she swore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Moonbounce was about to order another cider (since orders are orders), she noticed how, right after Silhouette had disappeared into the mare\u2019s room, a griffon sitting in the nearby table got up and followed her. Ordinary as the observation was, there was still something about that which tickled her suspicion. Perhaps she too should pay a quick visit to the lavatory. On the other hoof, that would mean running into corporal Silhouette possibly several minutes earlier than was necessary.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was probably nothing, reasoned Moonbounce. In any case, nothing so important that she would bother eavesdropping the corporal taking a leak, break wind or both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a blissfully long while, Silhouette finally returned from the restroom. Moon expected her to seat and uncork the fresh cider, but instead the pegasus, after dropping a few bits on the counter, tacitly gestured her to exit the bar. The prospect of getting some action relieved Moon enough so that she didn\u2019t even bother wondering why the previously laid-back mare would so eagerly abandon her drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere we\u2019re going?\u201d Moon asked as they stepped outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo the barracks,\u201d said Silhouette. The green-blue mare set off to fly down the street with Moonbounce behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I says so,\u201d snapped Silhouette without looking at her. Moon used the opportunity to stick out her tongue at her rump. The corporal seemed a lot tenser than a moment ago, but apparently her manners were coarse regardless of her mood. <i>That report will be a joy to write</i>, assured Moonbounce herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey flew across the city without exchanging words or looks. The route they took wasn\u2019t what Moon would\u2019ve chosen, which made her consider the option the corporal wasn\u2019t only unruly but incompetent too. But as they halted in the middle of a construction yard, Moonbounce became convinced her partner was neither of those things \u2013 she was simply mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShoot,\u201d said Silhouette, landing. \u201cI forgot my drink back there. Gotta fetch it before they steal it.\u201d She turned to Moon and said, with emphasis, \u201cStay here. Stay right here. Got it? Right here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me,\u201d gasped Moonbounce. \u201cYou\u2019re flying back for a bloody drink? In the middle of our shift?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, who's the corporal here?\u201d demanded Silhouette, pointing at the solitary stripes on her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019ll do as you\u2019re told or you\u2019ll fly out of the Guard sooner than I can get that cider! Now wait here, right here, until I get back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she was gone and Moon ready to seriously reconsider her career choice. A devoted and eager guard that she was, a night paired with corporal Silhouette tested her loyalty more than facing a changeling army alone ever could. The bugs at least had the decency to kill you quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeething in anger, Moon nonetheless grew bored. There was not much to look around. The fenced area they had been crossing harbored the makings of a new library. Mighty pillars supporting a half-finished roof loomed next to her, the lone ropes used to haul huge rocks into the heights blowing in the faint wind. Moonbounce sighed. Above her, something creaked. The wind swooshed a tad stronger. She looked up. She screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, corporal Silhouette landed on the spot which Moonbounce had very recently occupied, but which now contained nothing but a massive chunk of marble. It stood there in silence comparable in intensity only to the brief shriek and loud crunch that had preceded it. The pegasus walked around the rock a couple of times, looking for any signs of success, which she for her worry could not find. The rim of the boulder was spotless, betraying neither a hair nor a drop of blood, although in the darkness it was hard to be sure. That she had to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a crowbar, jack and a lot of sweat Silhouette managed to lift one side of the slab enough to get a look underneath. Despite the gruesome sight and a sickening squelch of tissue breaking free, a satisfied smile spread on her lips. The crane had been difficult to align, but she had hit the bullseye on the first go. Oh yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground under Moonbounce had sank an inch under her figure rammed flat by the impact. The mare\u2019s flanks had burst from both sides, and mushed entrails spilled from among several broken ribs. The ruptured spine pierced skin at several places. Mangled wings sprang up as the rock departed them, protruding into unnatural directions. The batpony\u2019s four legs had survived the best, the meaty thighs excluded, although that wasn\u2019t much of a compliment. The reasonably well-toned muscles were but minced meat now. The overall impression was of a bloated water ball thrown at a brick wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat surprised Silhouette was how well the head of the thestral had been preserved. An indentation almost as big at the bottom of the marble had preserved it, if not unharmed, then at least relatively whole. The mare\u2019s muzzle ended in a bleeding stump now, but one could still clearly make out the petrified expression stuck on her face; hear the last note of her wail sprouting from the wide open mouth. Thick streams of blood trailed from her ears and eyes, and if Silhouette wasn\u2019t completely wrong, the pony\u2019s heart had somehow actually jumped up to her throat, clogging her gullet at the last seconds of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, that was the easy part</i>, thought Silhouette as she let the rock fall with a wet smack. The hard part, she knew, was to feign tears when she\u2019d alarm the Guard of the unfortunate end of cadet Moonbounce.</span></div></div>",

She got up and headed towards the toilets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was bigger than she had expected. Five stalls lined one wall, the opposite of which had a score of sinks and a few mirrors. Dirt was less of an issue than she had unconsciously presumed it would be. It appeared as if someone actually cleaned here once a year or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest surprise, however, was that there was no one else around. Where had they gone? After a shy peek into a couple of the stalls, Moonbounce got her answer. At the back of the room, behind the last stall, there was backdoor. It was narrowed open, and the cool air that seeped in told her it lead outside. In the backyard, somepony was talking. Moonbounce pressed herself against the frame to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2013don\u2019t need to tell me that,\u201d said corporal Silhouette\u2019s voice. \u201cI got this, as always. But not like I originally planned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf not with the dogs, how then?\u201d said another voice, which Moon presumed was the griffon\u2019s. A hint of unmistakable self-sufficiency salted with avian accent left little room for doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m working on it,\u201d said Silhouette defensively. \u201cShe\u2019s tougher than I anticipated a cadet to be. Maybe smarter too. It\u2019s no use feeding her a story she won\u2019t bite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSnuff her out here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Silhouette. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst idea. Or do you want the Guard come sniffing? They're already suspicious about the Horse, I told you. We got to be more\u2026 subtle about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe griffon grumbled something, but Moon\u2019s mind already raced the other way. It did not take a paranoid to figure out they were talking about her \u2013 about \u201csnuffing her out\u201d. The shock of the news traversed Moon like a lightning, splitting her brain in half. The first part wanted her to take wing and flee the place ASAP. The other wished the exact the contrary: to know why they planned getting rid of her, and how she could perhaps counter the hospitality in kind.</span></div></div>",

She would get the hell out here and give her report to Sergeant Nox sooner than intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart bouncing, Moonbounce backed away from the door. Mindful to avoid making noise, she dared to turn around only at the exit, through which she surged as if on fire. As a consequence, she bumped head-on to the griffon moving the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Moonbounce hastily, trying to squeeze through the bulk of the creature. Griffons as a rule outweighed ponies, but this one dwarfed most carts, too. \u201cUh, excuse me, I really need to get through\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the rush, little pony?\u201d asked the griffon. He stepped forward, pushing Moonbounce back into the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone of your business,\u201d she retorted, desperately trying to circle the hindrance. As unlikely as it seemed, the resistance the griffon posed wasn\u2019t all passive in nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig words,\u201d the avian-feline commented casually. A clawed hand that could cover most of Moonbounce\u2019s face settled on her shoulder. It stayed there, and so did the rest of Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what\u2019s this?\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA surprise,\u201d said a familiar voice behind her. Colour fled Moon\u2019s face as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw her creeping in after you,\u201d commented the big griffon at Silhouette and the other bird who had returned from the backyard. \u201cThink she overheard you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d yelped Moonbounce, way too quickly. \u201cI mean, I didn\u2019t hear anything I\u2019d remember, okay? In fact, I heard so little I could move out of the city tomor\u2013tonight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can keep her, right?\u201d said the griffon holding Moon\u2019s shoulder. The hopefulness in his voice made her neck hair rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead, Falke,\u201d said the other griffon. \u201cJust be quick about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d complained Falke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce tried to voice an objection, which Falke\u2019s massive talon over her mouth stunted. She looked pleadingly at Silhouette, who only shook her head slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you to stay still, Moony. Not that it would\u2019ve saved you, but at least I would\u2019ve made sure your passing would be quick and clean. As is, well\u2026 At least this place can\u2019t possibly  get any messier, so there\u2019s that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce followed in growing fright as she was left alone with Falke. The door\u2019s lock clicked after its closure, ensuring no one would come bothering them. Panicking, she was about to try and wrench free, but the feeling of the griffon\u2019s beak sliding along her neck eliminated the option. One wrong move and she\u2019d be sliced open like a fish. She jumped as Falke inhaled her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, like fresh apples,\u201d he commented after the long and extremely intrusive sniff. \u201cWon\u2019t be that fresh for long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Moon could hypothesize the meaning of the remark, she got picked up like a doll and smashed through one of the stall doors. With both of his hands clenching her shoulders, she could finally scream, for the whole three seconds it took for him to ram her headfirst into the toilet seat. Slimy, murky water gushed out while she dived deep into the filthy drain. The bare shock of it triggered an instant fit, which she jerked through while Falke rinsed the grimy pipe with her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before she was about to drown the griffon pulled her back, allowing her lungs fill with the precious, stale air instead of the toilet\u2019s contents. Her matted mane glued over her eyes, preventing her from seeing how Falke hurled her out and against one of the sinks, under which she slumped. Body convulsing in grips of wet coughs, Moonbounce couldn\u2019t summon any resistance as the griffon walked to her, grabbed a tuft of her hair and yanked her head up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot as good as olive oil, but that\u2019ll do for lubrication,\u201d he said while lifting a hind leg over the sink. \u201cBon voyage, bat-bitch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last distinguishable sentence Moonbounce could muster, starting with \u201cPlease\u201d and ending with \u201cNo\u201d, was smothered by the griffon\u2019s anus. The pale ring of elastic, wrinkled flesh stretched with unexpected ease around Moon\u2019s moist muzzle, welcoming her with a warm, humid embrace. The easy ride stopped as the wiry gluteal muscles clenched her jaw so tight her teeth ached. Held still by the butt and Falke\u2019s hand on her neck, Moon could but stare at the furry rear of the griffon into which she\u2019d soon be forced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, keep doing that,\u201d groaned Falke while she fiercely tried to unclench herself. \u201cMake sure to wriggle all the way, cunt. Otherwise I\u2019ll have to make you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce couldn\u2019t care less what the griffon might do, for the worst was already happening. As the muscles relaxed, a window opened for her to automatically draw breath. It almost killed her on the spot. The wind coming from the griffon\u2019s bowels was the most hideous mix of rancid, rotten, fermented air there was. It made her fur fall of. It also stung her eyes, which now squeezed past the fleshy brim regardless of how much she fought back. A few grunts and shoves later her whole head had vanished between the bulging cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the mare firmly stuck, Falke could afford to rest a moment. He let his raised leg hit the floor, shook his shoulders taxed by the labour of the day. Looking behind, she saw the pony pressing her legs against his back, vainly trying to pop her head free. He didn\u2019t even need to tense anything to desist that. Lack of oxygen was plug enough for her efforts. It was the signal that some more should be allowed in, along with the main course of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rank stench combined with the strangling pressure were about to overwhelm Moonbounce when her fleshy prison shifted again. The rim of the anus gaped open, feeding in her neck and spilling out her sorry scream infused with a fart. With fresh vigour she made another attempt to escape her unbearable destiny \u2013 to no avail. The griffon simply sat down, and Moonbounce was rammed up his ass all the way to her shoulders. The muscles tightened again, repeating the process, only with more intensity. Gasping, suffocating and crying, Moonbounce shrunk beyond the last glimmer of reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalke\u2019s tongue lolled out at the unbelievable sensation of fulfillment. The mare was just the right size to teasingly test his limits. Granted, some of it was due to the insufficiency of lubrication \u2013 he had taken in whole stallions before, properly oiled. The friction remained manageable, although the shoulders would demand a touch of duress. Preparing himself for the feat, Falke started stroking his already flaring erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deeper she plunged, the more obnoxious the reek turned. Moonbouce swore her nasal hairs crisped already, and that her eyes would run liquid at the end of her journey. The stink had an almost material momentum; it seeped into her fur and beyond, burying into her insides by the rubs of the rectum. She wasn\u2019t merely covered in filth and muck: she was changing into sludge with every inch of the way.<i> I\u2019ll be shit even before I get to the stomach</i>, she thought in horror. The picture of herself as a brownish log travelling through the griffon\u2019s intestines became interrupted by unimaginable pain of her shoulderplates grinding against her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrrh, you are a thick one, aren\u2019t you?\u201d grumbled Falke, cramming Moon\u2019s upper half up his butt. His strategy of quick back and forth rocking with his hips was working, but every inch of meat took a lot of persuading. Moreover, the flabby wings were more irritating that he would\u2019ve thought. More leverage was required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery new wail of agony meant swallowing more gastric gas than she could stomach, but she could not resist her body\u2019s natural reaction to being effectively crushed to death. Already she had disjointed a shoulder. Right now things had slowed down, a bend of a bowel staying her passage. She prayed, with whatever hope she had left, that it would be enough for the griffon to defecate her. She didn\u2019t care if she\u2019d be splattered all over the toilets like a bad diarrhea (with which she presently strongly identified) as long as it meant leaving this hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough of the mare had been incorporated for Falke to stand on all fours, which left the remaining bottom half of the pony dangling amusingly from his rear. She had grown quite still during the last push. He could feel she was still alive though; the movements of the moderate bulge in his abdomen testified to it. It was time to extract the last wriggles out of his prey before the ultimate climax. Drawing a couple lungfuls of strength, Falke dropped all his weight on the pony\u2019s hind legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mighty crunch echoed off of the ceramic tiles, followed immediately by a muffled shriek from deep within his intestines. That had taken care of her legs. The next buck crushed her pelvis, stirring an even shriller scream. The voice vibrated pleasantly within him. The pony\u2019s parts sufficiently loosened, sucking them in with loud blorbs and squelches dotted the i\u2019s and crossed the t\u2019s of the griffon\u2019s thrill. Via a broken mirror he followed the tips of Moon\u2019s hooves getting suckled in his pucker hole, which sealed neatly after them, leaving but a few odd tail hairs hanging out. He pushed them in with a claw one by one, then lay down to study his spherical, quivering belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the ride, little pony,\u201d he mused while prodding the lump with a claw, inciting the odd indistinct shout or a violent convulsion. \u201cEnjoy your new home while it lasts. In a week or so you\u2019ll be out for good, fertilizing the grass on which your kin likes to feed. Perhaps some of them will follow your lead. It\u2019s the circle of nature right there. Adios.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving himself one more pat, Falke stood up and wobbled to the bar\u2019s side. Contrary to his customs he\u2019d order an apple cider. It was the least he could do for the mare to offer her a drink, after all.</span></div></div>",

She\u2019d find out what exactly corporal Silhouette was planning, with whom and why. But before that she\u2019d have to return back to her table, because it looked like the corporal and the griffon were about to finish up their scheming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said Moon as she pushed through the restroom door and bumped into another griffon heading the other way. He gave her a long, measured look which she could not help but make a note of. There was no telling the extent of the corporal\u2019s conspiracy, and until she\u2019d get to the bottom of it, Moonbounce swore she\u2019d trust no one save herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou took your sweet time,\u201d she said as Silhouette returned to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut it, cadet,\u201d she retorted. Without seating, she nodded her to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d she asked on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re heading back to the barracks,\u201d said Silhouette. \u201cThere\u2019s some\u2026 authorization issue I need to check before the night\u2019s mission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat sort of authorization?\u201d queried Moon as they set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTop secret. Come now, get a move on: we\u2019re going to have our hooves full tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Moon slowly. For now she was content playing the part of the good, ignorant cadet. It was one facade against another, with the exception that Moon had spotted the corporal\u2019s tapestry curling at the edges. The plain treason it hid became even more conspicuous as, without any apparent reason, they stopped at an empty construction yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shoot,\u201d said Silhouette, landing. \u201cI forgot my drink back there. Gotta fetch it before the buggers nick it. You wait here: right here, until I get back. Shouldn\u2019t take long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you say, corporal,\u201d said Moon slowly. Silhouette raised an eyebrow, but glided away nonetheless. After she had disappeared, supposedly back where they had come from, Moon faced another decision \u2013 spy her again or hold still. Both options had their risks.</span></div></div>",

The next alley she made a u-turn and returned to the construction site, although this time from behind the building. After making it to the unfinished roof, Moonbounce followed her rummage around the edge, looking for something in the darkness below. It was then that she could not tolerate the suspense anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe last time I saw, the Silver Horse was on the roof of some other library.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could almost hear how Silhouette\u2019s heart bounced up her throat. The pegasus spun around, wide eyes feverishly scanning the miscellaneous construction scenery. She only spotted Moonbounce as she stepped out of the deepest of the shadows, grinning with all her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBat got your tongue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery funny, cadet,\u201d said Silhouette, recovering somewhat. \u201cWhat the hell? I ordered you to stay down there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, about that,\u201d said Moon, casually stepping forward. \u201cWhy did you lie to me just then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got no right to\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce leapt. Silhouette, still clinging to the old script, hesitated a turn of breath too long. Moon toppled the lighter pegasus easily, and after a brief struggle ended it with her fangs on the jade-green throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on,\u201d Moon said. \u201cFinish your sentence. Oh, and then you could explain just why you planned \u2018snuffing me out\u2019 with that griffon back in the Horse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ensuing silence was all the confirmation Moon could\u2019ve hoped for, and from Silhouette\u2019s eventual reply she deduced the pegasus had arrived to a similar conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying jack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, that means you\u2019re fine with me ripping your throat open?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilhouette snorted. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t. You\u2019re just a cadet. How\u2019d you explain that, killing your superior? The griffons won\u2019t talk. That leaves you bluffing with no cards. Tell you what: get off of me now and we might come up with a deal that serves both of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce shifted uneasily. She hadn\u2019t really considered things might come down to this. It was true, she was bluffing about the ripping of throat part \u2013 or so she had thought, up until she had been called out and left to choose between trusting a pony she knew wanted to end her and breaking the Guard\u2019s code of conduct. She sighed mentally, then made up her mind.</span></div></div>",

She stood up and wiped dust off of her with an air of somepony who did this sort of stuff all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, how did you figure me out?\u201d she said. \u201cYou eavesdropped us in the Horse, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did,\u201d conceded Moon. \u201cBut the warning had come earlier. Sergeant Nox is onto you. He instructed me to keep an eye on you.\u201d The lie came to her out of the blue. It seemed wise to hoard some extra playing chips at her end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d asked Silhouette slyly. \u201cWhat\u2019d he say, I wonder?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said you had a deal on your mind,\u201d said Moon coolly. \u201cSpit it out here or in the barracks, it\u2019s all the same to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, aren\u2019t we bold now,\u201d teased Silhouette. \u201cThink you can take me on twice in a row?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll night long if that\u2019s what it takes. Now spill it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Silhouette looked like she was considering the range of her life-options from a completely fresh angle. Whether this was truly the case or merely an elaborate ploy to play time, Moon could only guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much d\u2019you know about the Beak Gang, exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough,\u201d said Moon, who had heard the name for the first time. \u201cYou\u2019re working for them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s one way to put it. More concretely I\u2019m a slave to them \u2013 one of many, mind you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon frowned. \u201cA slave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey hold my friend a hostage,\u201d said Silhouette, suddenly with tears in her once arrogant eyes. \u201cShould I fail to do as they say\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was openly weeping. Moon felt at loss in the face of the novel turn of events. Her first inclination was towards disbelief. Nothing thus far had hinted the corporal was under coercion. On the other hoof, a threat on one\u2019s friend\u2019s life offered a plausible explanation of why a corporal of the Guard would turn her coat to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost a moon,\u201d sobbed Silhouette. The last traces of aloofness peeled off her in slight trembles. The shimmering gaze turned to Moon. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for betraying you, Moon\u2026 But I had no choice! I didn\u2019t know what to do! Please, have mercy on me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey,\u201d said Moon. She approached the pegasus in undecidedly consolidating and/or cautious manner, which culminated in the hoof she laid on her shoulder both as a guard and comfort. \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. We can figure this out. What\u2019s your friend\u2019s name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilk Weaver,\u201d sniffed Silhouette. \u201cShe used to work as a tailor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she shall in the future too,\u201d assured Moon. She sighed deeply. \u201cThe best thing you can do for her is to come with me to Sergeant Nox and explain all this to him personally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d cried Silhouette, jumping back. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t! That\u2019d be the end of Weaver. The griffons told me they have other guards in their pocket, but I don\u2019t which ones. If one of them snitches on me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure they\u2019re not bluffing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not! But I can\u2019t risk Weaver\u2019s life like that! Do you think I haven\u2019t gone over all the possible scenarios in my head a dozen times already? There is no way out from this. None except\u2026 No, that\u2019s stupid. And dangerous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilhouette scraped the roof\u2019s tiles nervously. \u201cI\u2026 I know where they keep Weaver. They let me talk with her once a week. Tonight\u2019s the time. With your help, we might be able to break her free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon gave her a deadpan expression. \u201cBreak into a mob lair? By the two of us? Are you serious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I have no right to ask you that,\u201d hurried Silhouette. \u201cNo right whatsoever. Only desperation. Please, I don\u2019t know how long I can keep up the facade, or when they reason I\u2019m becoming too much of a liability. It could already be too late! I think that after forcing me to get rid of you, it would\u2019ve been my turn. I\u2019m scared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon looked into the big, wet, green eyes and knew her heart had only one answer left in store for them.</span></div></div>",

He\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d Moon spread her wings, about to take flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was stopped by Silhouette who hurled herself around her neck, strangling with all her might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I won\u2019t!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet go off me!\u201d wheezed the shocked Moon. The two mares flailed on the rooftop, wrestling for their lives, failing to notice the egde near which their uneven waltz took place. As one struggling ball of legs and wings, they fell, rolling over each other for the few velocious seconds the plummet took. Their combined screams ended abruptly at two sickening splats, like melons hitting a carpet of nails. In the end that was not that far from the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Moon a moment to comprehend what had transpired. They had hit a concrete mold rife with solid steel rods awaiting to support the oncoming structure. Two had impaled her right leg, one had struck through her chest, probably puncturing a lung. Breathing had never been this painful. She coughed blood, blinked, and finally screamed. Inside her, fractured organs spread apart at the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the corner of her fading vision she saw Silhouette hadn\u2019t faired any better. The mare had dived right into one of the bars, half of which now stuck from between her broken, bleeding teeth. An agonized gurgle fled her throat stiffened by the rod inside. She had turned into a living treat on a stick. The frightened eyes turned to Moon, sinking as her body weighed her down along the pole. One more gurgle and she fell silent, her protruding hind legs twitching randomly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood riddance!\u201d spat Moon with her waning strength. Blood trickled down the bars in earnest. She could not move a muscle without ten others hurting like hell. She was dying. Until, in due time, she wasn\u2019t.</span></div></div>",

The Beaks hold headquarters in a warehouse not far from the Silver Horse. Weaver is being held inside. If you arrange a little distraction, I think I can manage to get her out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s get to it then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure this is the place?\u201d she asked when they arrived at the warehouse. From outside it looked like any other magazine in the city which lived off of imported goods. No guards, no lights, not even a fence indicated anything exciting, much less criminal, was going on inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s protected by cunning, not by power,\u201d explained Silhouette. \u201cThere\u2019s never too many griffons present at once \u2013 a dozen at most.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dozen criminal killing machines, each one packed with more muscle than we have between us, thought Moonbounce. Suddenly the idea of reinforcements seemed a lot more appealing, and she told Silhouette as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease,\u201d begged the pegasus. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this. I could never forgive myself if something happened to Weaver. She\u2019s already suffered so much for my sake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d sighed Moon. \u201cBut right after we\u2019ve secured her safety, we\u2019re marching to Nox with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two mares descended on the looming building as per the plan, which boiled down to two decisive moments. Silhouette would get in the front door to give her report, giving Moon a window to slip in from one. While Silhouette would attract the attention of the guards with a wild tale, Weaver could be rescued. It all seemed simple enough. Almost too simple, thought Moon as she creaked one pane in the row of glass lining the top of the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Silhouette had revealed, it was dim inside. Griffons had better night vision than ponies \u2013 almost up to bat pony standards. Squinting, Moon could see a bunch of griffons gathering around the main entrance, where Silhouette waved them closer as agreed. On the other side of the large hall, beyond the mountains of crates, light burned from inside an office. That\u2019s where Weaver would be. After checking the route was clear, Moon closed the pane carefully and glided by the wall until she could get a glimpse inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA certain unexpected relief washed over Moon at the sight of a tied, gagged pony laying in the corner. At the back of her mind the idea she was being played stopped whispering, albeit not grumbling. The pony was a thestral. Why hadn\u2019t Silhouette mentioned it? Maybe she hadn\u2019t thought it\u2019d be important. In any case, there was also a guard in the room, idly tending to his claws with a file. It begged the question what else Silhouette had failed to mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlame would have to wait for its due proceeding. The important thing now was to rescue the mare. As things stood, Moon could see but one way to it: she\u2019d have to take the guard out. And because he was twice her size, she\u2019d have no choice but to put her teeth into play. The Guard\u2019s regulations had nothing good to say about exercising lethal force on citizens who hadn\u2019t been read their rights before, but in the circumstances\u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA clawed hand the size of a shovel grabbed her from behind and bowled her against the closest crate so hard she crashed right through. Inside she had precisely enough time not to black out before the box was ripped in two in one apparently effortless motion. The hand came at her again, picked her by the scruff of her neck like a puppy and raised her from among the splinters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBloody gales,\u201d rumbled the griffon who held her for inspection. \u201cFor once your slick tongue told the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor you always, Wiff,\u201d said Silhouette. She pushed her way past the griffons that now flocked to the site from all directions. They were all ogling at Moon, who hang helplessly like a fish from a hook. The obvious now dawned to her in all its naked horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou lying filly of a\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe griffon muzzled her with a grip that could bent steel. \u201cFeisty still? How unexpected \u2013 and pleasing. The lively ones tend to have this spicy taste I adore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmphh?!\u201d erupted Moon. Suddenly she became highly alert of the starving stares the griffons were throwing her way. One of them actually licked their beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTough luck, sweetheart,\u201d giggled Silhouette. \u201cSeems like we arrived just before dinner time. I could not have planned this better, even though I says so myself.\u201d She raised her impeccable grin to the griffon called Wiff. \u201cSo, what\u2019s on the menu today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Moon\u2019s panic, Wiff gave her exposed belly a long, ponderous lick. \u201cAh, perfect. Chubby yet not flabby. She\u2019ll make for ideal burger filling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, not burgers again,\u201d growled someone from the ranks. \u201cThat the only course you know to make of ponies? Let\u2019s deep fry her! With those sliced potatoes they make in Prance!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver my dead body!\u201d snarled another griffon. \u201cI swear, if I even see, gales forbid smell those things ever again I\u2019ll retch my guts out. I demand we stuff the cunt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe culinary row quickly escalated into dishes Moon hadn\u2019t even heard of before, and which she certainly would not wish to hear from ever again. Tears of fear smeared her vision at the thought of imminent death. How could she be so stupid as to fall for such an obvious ploy? Now her parents would never get to know what happened to her. On second thoughts, maybe that was a good thing. The last mental image she needed was her gravestone inscription reading something like \u201cHere rests Cadet Moonbounce, who left the world in a deep fryer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon\u2019s self-pity became interrupted as Silhouette\u2019s voice cut through the quarrel. \u201cGuys, guys, guys. Can\u2019t we go about this like civilized people? I\u2019m sure there is a certain recipe around which all of your suggestions more or less gravitate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBurgers?\u201d said Wiff hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilhouette rolled her eyes, which then set to circle around the company. \u201cLikely not. I\u2019m referring to a bit more primal manner of consumption. A true griffon cuisine,\u201d she said, her eyes stopping at Moonbounce. \u201cRaw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe consenting murmur this raised chilled Moon to the core. As if the idea of being cooked and eaten wasn\u2019t devastating enough: now there the promise of excruciating pain lingered heavily in the air too. Wiff\u2019s slaver matted her fur again, this time along her leg. It could not end like this, she told herself. She couldn\u2019t end up being torn apart and gobbled up by a flock of thugs. She had a life to live; a horizonful of plans to draw; mistakes to make and courses to take. She\u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2013bitt her tongue as Wiff ripped into her thigh with his beak, tearing off a gory chunk of sinew. He wolfed down the meat, licked the blood off of his beak, then nodded approvingly. The small crowd stirred like a pack of wolves over a kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust like the old times,\u201d commented Wiff. He heaved the mare a few times in the air before tossing her high in a spray of blood. \u201cHave at it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screaming Moonbounce hardly reached the peak of her trajectory when the first griffons were already on her. Claws and beaks tore into her from every side, ripping, rending and slashing her soft flesh, at places to the bone, which soon enough shone from dozens of open, flooding wounds. Like a ragdoll trapped in the games of wild dogs, the batpony didn\u2019t stand a chance. Piece by piece she vanished from existence, through a dozen hungry gullets until nought but the inedible bits remained, scattered around the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground, Silhouette gently leaned against Wiff. He didn\u2019t need to recognize the gesture to get that the mare was in heat \u2013 her smell was telltale enough. It never clicked with him why witnessing butchering turned her on like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill hungry for some pony meat?\u201d she cooed, nuzzling his feathers. \u201cMaybe a little dessert\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy chance Moonbounce\u2019s head, finally torn loose from the neck, fell near Wiff, who caught it with one claw. He studied it thoughtfully, then pecked free the tongue hanging loosely out of her mouth. By his side, Silhouette purred at the sight, driving her muzzle against his bulk. As the horny mare moved down on him, Wiff kept chewing the decapitated head. It would be a good night ahead.</span></div></div>",

She hadn\u2019t really expected the corporal to remain this steadfast with fangs on her throat. But if she backed now, Moon would lose all her credibility in her eyes. She couldn\u2019t let herself be bossed around anymore \u2013 those roles were long due for a reversal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you\u2019d come to your senses,\u201d said Silhouette as Moon\u2019s fangs withdrew. \u201cNow, be a good girl and \u2013 mhhph?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus\u2019s words were garbled as Moon\u2019s muzzle stretched over hers. The batpony looked into the confused eyes below her, winked, and tucked her prey deeper in. Perhaps the prospect of one way trip down her gullet would be intimidating enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime there was nothing stopping Moon from cherishing the subtleties of the other mare\u2019s taste. The agreeable piquant flavour reflected the pony\u2019s personality remarkably. Moon took it all in eagerly, soon reaching the forehead, where her tongue stopped to explore the thin, delicate skin of eyelids. This incited the first serious struggles from the would-be meal, but Moon\u2019s better position and generous figure outweighed the resistance easily, especially after Silhouette\u2019s head squeezed into her esophagus. Such a satisfying torture made Moon emit a low moan. Together with the whine coming from her throat the sound reverberated pleasantly within her. The scarce words she could recognize implied the corporal had become willing to reconsider her recent decisions in life. It mattered none now \u2013 Moon simply had to get more of this treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving to the shoulders it became increasingly difficult to keep wolfing down the pegasus, so Moon flopped onto her flank. The feeding resumed quickly from there, all the way to the wildly flapping wings, which she sucked in like wriggling spaghetti. The next delicacy of the meal was the slim, tight belly, which ended in an even tighter pussy. Moon drank the snug cleavage enthusiastically, incidentally driving her poor prey to the egde of orgasm. Her ultimate release was denied however as Moon gobbled up the hind legs, followed by the fluffy tail. After the final, drawn-out swallow the batpony rolled onto her back, her balloon of a belly sloshing and churning loudly as its occupant refused to settle down for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should\u2019ve come clean when you had the chance,\u201d teased Moon. A burp brought up the poignant taste and a couple of tealish feathers, which she spat out. \u201cThe only way you\u2019re going anywhere now will be anything but tidy, let me tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frustrated scream replied her from the confines of the stomach. The walls were beginning to contract around the pegasus, forcing her into a cramped, quivering lump with sharp outlines bulging out. Moon patted her meal\u2019s head with off-hoofed comfort, the postprandial drowsiness already descending. She burped up a few more feathers, then fell asleep with one of them sticking out between her lips. Silhouette kept fighting against asphyxiation for several minutes, but eventually her wails and twitches drowned under the glorbing and massaging of digestive acids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, you\u2019re going to go straight into my butt, I just know it,\u201d complained Moon. With some effort she got up, her belly almost touching the ground. It was a good thing she lived only a few blocks away. It would take days before she could get back on duty; days and quite a handsome number of visits to the lavatory, she suspected.</span></div></div>",

The corporal\u2019s behavior was shady, but calling her out too soon might ruin the advantage Moon now held. Besides, what was the worst she could do behind her back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething went swoosh above Moonbounce. Her instincts already tense, instead of looking up she dodged to her side, a moment before a boulder of marble twice her side crashed down on her previous location. In trance she stared at it until reflex reminded her to breathe again. She heard someone approach. Stunned and shocked, Moonbounce managed to gather enough of her sense back to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the shadows she watched Silhouette slide to the scene looking for something. It demanded no great imagination to figure out what that was. She tried to squash me! Moonbounce realized. Black rage boiled around the thought. Moonbounce advanced towards the pegasus, who now tried to crank up the boulder to inspect its underside. As Silhouette peeked inside the emerging crack, something snapped inside Moonbounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, let me help you,\u201d she said, and kicked the raised rump before her. The pegasus tumbled forward, right as Moon laid her wing on the handle of the jack. \u201cOops.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare let out a strange whine as the slab came down on her head. The crunch that followed was quite ordinary though. The athletic, streamlined body jerked once, then fell limp like an empty sack. A pool of blood spilled past the white stone\u2019s edge. Moonbounce spat at the corpse and left it there before her stomach could turn all the way around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what now? she thought a little distance away from the corpse. According to the Guard\u2019s procedure and common sense, she ought to return to the headquarters to report. What a mess that would sprout. Technically, a cadet crushing her superior\u2019s head was bound to raise some eyebrows. What if they refused to believe her version of the story? By the dawn she might find herself on trial for murder. Come to think of it, in the light of objective evidence she liked her chances in court not one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce gulped at the conclusion her reason was obliged to draw. Somehow she would have to prove her actions had been justified. That meant gathering evidence of the conspiracy the victim of which she had almost fallen for, and that meant returning back to her only source of clues \u2013 the Silver Horse. The idea had a sour taste to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo did the atmosphere she found herself the center of for the second time this evening as she stepped into the bar. The friendliest glances she got were merely irrespective, the rest had her feeling hunted. These included a few which, she could swear, were surprised to see her again. Now why was that? It wasn\u2019t as if they knew she wouldn\u2019t be returning, was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeigning unobservance, Moon seated herself to the same table she had occupied with Silhouette half an hour ago. Funnily enough, the cider the corporal had supposedly returned to fetch was still there. For reasons both practical and metaphorical, Moon finished the drink while continuing to discreetly survey the bar\u2019s mood. The griffon Silhouette had talked with in the back alley was nowhere to be seen. That was both good and bad news. Something had to happen for wheels to start turning. On the other hoof her life was still certainly very much under threat, for reasons she was dying to find out. Should she try to speed things along herself? Or simply let the events take their own course?</span></div></div>",

She would not make the same mistake twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no shortage of possible suspects around, but the most promising one had to be the bartender. He ran the place after all, and the looks she received from along that curved beak had something inviting in them. Thus Moon finished her drink and steered to one of the stools by the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother apple cider,\u201d she said. As a bottle hissed open, a line she had once read in a detective novel came to her. \u201cTell me: is that the only whisper you\u2019ve heard lately?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe griffon gave her a long, blank look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I mean, have you heard any interesting rumours recently?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottle\u2019s bottom scraped both the counter and Moon nerves. The bartender picked a pint, which he begun cleaning slowly and deliberately with the characteristic towel his kind carried by their shoulder, all the while drilling Moon with his yellow hawk-eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what would it be that you find interesting?\u201d he finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon tried to shrug casually, but her shoulders were way too tense to manage anything but a cramp. \u201cOh, the usual stuff. The rumours. Anything, really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towel kept leisurely turning in its transparent prison. \u201cThey say there\u2019ll be rain before long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Most likely true,\u201d struggled Moon. \u201cBut what I\u2019m after is more related to, uhm, say, adventures? Excitement? Of the criminal kind for example,\u201d she added in the face of total impassiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe price of beer is a real steal here,\u201d called a voice from behind, inciting laughter and announcing to Moon that she was being listened to by more ears than she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly, the bartender leaned forward. \u201cI catch your drift. If you will, there is something at the back that might suite your\u2026 interests.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Moon against her backbone instincts. The way the griffon stressed the word \u201cinterest\u201d set off all the alarms wired in Moon\u2019s brain. But if she backed down now, she would risk losing her only chance of uncovering evidence to support her innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe griffon grinned, then disappeared behind the counter. Something creaked. As Moon stretched to look, she saw a secret hatch in the floor had been opened, revealing ladders leading into stuffy-smelling gloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you said \u2018at the back\u2019, not \u2018down below\u2019,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you wanted to find something interesting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon spent a few more moments in pointless thinking, then climbed over the counter and down the hatch. The climb was steep yet short, and ended with a cold wooden floor spreading into a dimly lit corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd ahead we go,\u201d said the bartender descending behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon had no choice but to take the lead and step into the unknown. The decayed smell grew more noticeable as she advanced, as did the beats of her heart. At the end of the tunnel, a door loomed. Moon\u2019s mind raced for the possible futures it contained: painful torture, sudden death, rows of cages stuffed with prisoners. Of those options, the last one turned out to be correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is all this?\u201d she gasped, unable to help herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe selection, naturally,\u201d explained the bartender calmly while closing the door. He turned up the valve of a few oil lamps to better illuminate the gruesome scene. In a sort of a cellar, dozens of creatures, most of them ponies, had been confined to cages no bigger than what the bare minimum demanded. There were also diamond dogs, wild beasts, pets \u2013 even griffons. Countless haunted, hollow stares arose towards Moonbounce to express a thousand burdens and a singular plea. It was that close she didn\u2019t retch her guts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite the\u2026 collection,\u201d she braved, fighting against vomit. She loosened her collar, gathered a few promising-looking thoughts to orient her next lines, then said to the bartender slash slaver: \u201cWhat prize does that blond mare in the corner fetch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFour thousand whole,\u201d replied the griffon without a pause. \u201cIn pieces, variedly, depending on how you want her served.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon fell into dark silence. \u201cYou\u2026 You deliver them in pieces too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaked, boiled, creamed, stuffed, gutted, etc. We deal in all sorts of orders. Surely this doesn\u2019t surprise you? Our customers often know particularly well what they want before entering.\u201d The griffon shifted a bit closer. \u201cI expect you\u2019d like to have a closer look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Oh, yes, her. Of course. Please, lay out all the details. All of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping by the mare\u2019s cage, the bartender started to list facts spiced with opinions about the pony. A local asset, a month short of twenty and grown in the fancier part of the city. \u201cIn other words, ideal material for bedroom or dessert \u2013 or both if one will\u201d. The well-developed thighs earned plentiful praise, along with the overall health which was \u201csimply marvelous, easily capable of enduring several hours worth of excruciating agony, say during a special slow roast\u201d. A regrettable downside came in character, flawed with red-hot stubbornness and a keen inability to submit. \u201cNothing that couldn\u2019t be cured with the right medicine and a little extra fee, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon listened with half an ear only, not simply to retain her lunch, but mostly to give room for an emergency plan to come together. Raiding this place would award her with all the proofs she needed. The only question was how to get out of here alive. Should she play along and hope her act lasted until the end, or go for a more direct approach</span></div></div>",

That was reason enough to keep on familiar tracks, even shaky ones, reasoned Moonbounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d she said as the griffon finished his pitch. She put on a deliberative face, pretending to consider her options. \u201cWhat you offer is interesting, but I always consult my banker one last time before any major purchase. In this case my cook should also have her say. So, how about we continue this tomorrow with fresh insights and secure accounts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I mean is, you won\u2019t be needing to consult anyone regarding your future,\u201d explained the griffon, now inches away behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon\u2019s neck hair sprang up, then flattened again as the griffon\u2019s claws closed around her throat and lifted her up. Before she knew what had hit her, she found herself crammed into a cage, one of the smallest in the room. It barely had space for half of her ample figure, and by the time the bartender had finished forcing her rump in, she felt like a tuna fish in a sardine can. Her flanks, thighs and other plumpier bits squeezed painfully through the steel bars, stoking a burning sensation all over her body. On top of it all, in the racket her prison, along with herself, had ended up upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow stupid do you think we are?\u201d said the griffon. \u201cStriding in like that, you might\u2019ve as well served yourself on a plate! Makes no matter in the end, I suppose. There\u2019s a high-hat dinner party tonight where we have delivered a special menu. The schedule will be tight, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll fit right in. Just stay put and make yourself comfortable: someone will get to you in no time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, no!\u201d burst Moonbounce painfully. \u201cThere\u2019s been a terrible mistake! This is no way to treat a paying customer! Here, let me show you my\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe knew you worked for the Guard already before you strode in the first time. What we don\u2019t know is how you got back.\u201d The griffon bended over the upside-down Moonbounce. \u201cTell me: what happened to Silhouette?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s held under arrest,\u201d said Moon quickly. \u201cBack at the barracks. She squealed everything the minute I had subdued her, after she attacked me. The Guard knows the whole story. I came here to offer you a deal: let me out and we can start the talks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe griffon studied her fear like an eagle soaring over a field rife with mice. His hand extended over her, where Moon couldn\u2019t see. She realized soon enough what he had noticed though. The claw felt cold against her labia pressed tightly against the bars. It tickled the base of her entrance, slid easily over her length. She gasped and quivered as much as her confinement would allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe truth, now,\u201d said the predator. The claw stopped over her clit, light as a feather, heavy as doom itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is the truth!\u201d she wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe claw flicked her clit. The whole cage jerked along with the jolt springing from Moonbounce\u2019s spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe truth. Now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026 please\u2026 I\u2019m telling the truth\u2026 I swear for my life!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe callous gaze pierced her\u2019s. For a moment, the room collectively held its breath, all attention sucked into the vacuum between the claw and the love button. Then, the fang began to circle the deep-pink flesh like a fish preying an insect fallen into a pond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce shut her eyes. The touch was nothing short of gentle, the barest breeze on her skin, yet nothing before had laid so much pressure down there. Still, she remained silent. The lie could be her only route out of here in one piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d spoke the griffon\u2019s deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 It\u2019s the truth,\u201d sobbed Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe claw stopped is swirling. An agitated wheeze escaped Moon as it drew a neat line between her folds, persuading them apart before hardily lancing forward, all the way to the knuckle. Several inches of sharp bone in her pussy, Moon was forced to remain still as stone, although inside she wanted to thrash and scream with all her might. Bitter tears poured from under her clenched eyelids. Meanwhile, the claw kept probing her insides, in the process coating itself in her involuntarily flowing essence. She squealed under its duress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like this, don\u2019t you?\u201d whispered the griffon. \u201cYou can lie more, say you really don\u2019t. Go on. Don\u2019t be a disappointment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI lied!\u201d Moon erupted hysterically. \u201cI lied! I lied! I killed Silhouette with the same boulder she tried to kill me with! She\u2019s dead! Nopony else knows about you, or this place, about anything! Stop! Stop doing that! Please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe avian hook remained in position, pumping in and out in a steady rhythm. Physically the sensation was actually mildly pleasant, but mentally the bare thought of the knife-like object sawing through her privates, under dozens of witnesses, was pure torture. It was like having a razorblade travelling over your throat a time after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a cute thing,\u201d the griffon said, almost softly. \u201cFor a bat, anyway. It has been a while since I laid your kind. And you succeeded in saving my night from total boredom, which alone counts for quite a bit nowadays.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs suddenly as it had penetrated her, the claw was pulled free and wiped clean against her thighs. \u201cTell you what: if you let me mount you, I promise to suggest a deal to my boss which just might save you from ending up as budding, or whatever they\u2019d else make out of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her awkward angle, Moonbounce stared at the griffon in disbelief. Could her salvation really become reality after all? She was completely at his mercy in any case: why try and strike a false deal with her? That would be the ultimate cruelty. Was there a soul twisted enough capable of such a feat? More importantly, even if the deal somehow helped her survive through the night, could she live with the shame it had cost her?</span></div></div>",

Well, for now at least. I expect the forks will have to remove it eventually.\u201d He turned around,  turned off the light and left the cellar, leaving Moon with her dignity and oncoming fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former took its sweet time arriving. Two other griffons stomped in from a door in the other end of the room and strode directly to her cage, which seemed to have shrunk even further during the interim. They hauled her up and through a new tunnel into some sort of a warehouse filled with bustle. Among the piles of crates, pots and ovens of various sizes had been organized into a more or less transparent order. Vegetables were chopped, wine poured, ingredients mixed, meat cooked in a hundred different ways. A delicious smell hung in the air. Had Moonbounce not seen all the dishes from which it originated, she might\u2019ve actually become hungry. Now she only got sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got another one!\u201d shouted the other escort as they laid her on a table. To Moon\u2019s surprise, a pony dressed in a chef's hat and a bloody apron turned up and gave her a few measured looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHas it been washed?\u201d the chef, a unicorn mare, asked pointedly. As the griffons threw questioning looks at each other, the pony slapped herself hard on the forehead. \u201cGreat! They expect me to cook a late dinner for a hundred people with ingredients for fifty, and now they tell me they haven\u2019t even been properly prepared! Fruit Salad may be a goddess in the kitchen, but even her miracles are a limited supply!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t say it isn\u2019t washed, we just don\u2019t\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d interrupted Salad. \u201cPut her over there. I\u2019ll have to think of a recipe which doesn\u2019t need her to keep her skin. In the meanwhile, for Celestia\u2019s sake, shave her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d cried Moon as the chef swooped away. \u201cWait! This is a mistake \u2013 I\u2019m an officer of the Guard; I\u2019m being missed and searched by hundreds, you can\u2019t\u2013hmmmh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large apple was stuffed into her open mouth, reducing her begs to muffles. It didn\u2019t matter much, for the griffons preparing her were equally irrespective of all the noises she made. Efficiently they started removing her hairs with scissors and shears, starting with her mane and tail and ending with her eyebrows. Soon she shivered in the chilly open space, her beautiful fur piling at the bottom of the biowaste basket. At the end of the night, what\u2019s left of me at the plate\u2019s edge will follow the same way, she thought, and almost fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second she was stark naked Fruit Salad appeared to the scene. She walked around the cage once, sniffed Moon from a few select places, then licked her neck. After a thoughtful smack she said: \u201cPerhaps all is not yet lost with you. A fine flamb\u00e9 should emphasise that taste of apple nicely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven without words, Moon\u2019s outburst conveyed an unmistakable message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes yes, I know it\u2019s a shame,\u201d conceded Salad while levitating a basket of bottles by her side. \u201cWith time you\u2019d turn into an excellent roast. It\u2019s what you ought to deserve. Alas, these mortals do not understand a thing about cuisine!\u201d She kept complaining loudly, occasionally mentioning herself in third person, while artfully pouring alcohol all over Moon\u2019s back, buttocks, neck and shoulders. The liquid was warmer than the air, but Moon didn\u2019t feel any less frigid for all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t cry now, dear,\u201d the chef comforted. She dabbed Moon\u2019s red, moist eyes with her apron. \u201cIt ruins the balance of salt. Here, open your mouth: your insides need a good coating too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon resisted as best as she could, but after the apple was removed the bottle jammed into her throat didn\u2019t ask her opinion. The sharp taste of cognac, which she had never particularly liked, glutted her mouth, esophagus and even nostrils so that she almost choked on the first bottle. The third distended her belly to the point of bursting and left her throat raw and itchy. But that was nothing compared to the sensation which plugging her asshole with hard glassware caused. More liquid got pumped into her system from a different end. Moon wasn\u2019t the shyest of drinkers, but a load like this would have tested the limits of several alcoholists combined. She felt lightheaded, surreal, detached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe friendly, plump face of the cheff floated from the descending mist into her vision. She was smiling. \u201cThere, it wasn\u2019t so bad, was it? Not far to go anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce mumbled something incoherent, the excess cognac flowing past her lips. Next to Fruit Salad\u2019s face, a lighter was lit. Moonbounce\u2019s eyes grew wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, make me proud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sound like \u201cwhomp\u201d. The world exploded in pain. Terrible, excruciating pain. It was worse than a receiving a thousand cuts in a snowstorm. It was an intolerable, inexplicable, indescribable tide of agony. It burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few steps back, Fruit Salad marveled at the flaming batpony in her cage. The skin was already turning slightly brown, and a sweet, cooked smell wafted from the pyre. But that was only half of the magic. Turning on her horn, she deployed the spell she had used years crafting. By her will she could moderate the temperature of alcohol inside the mare, set it just perfect. For now that meant boiling. She could tell it was working, for colored steam started rising from the pony\u2019s butt, mouth and nose. The pony was, in effect, aflame both inside and outside. No wonder then that her eyes popped like overripe tomatoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFruit Salad kept poaching Moonbounce for a few more minutes at high heat. At some point her life fled its unhappy vessel. When the color and smell were fully pleasing for the chef, she quenched the spell and pulled the ready dish out of the cage onto a large silver tray. With melancholy she watched it being carried away to its final destination. There went a pony who would make a dozen others happier and more sated than they had been in all their lives.</span></div></div>",

That good enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed. It had to be good enough, for the alternative certainly wasn\u2019t. The goon would most likely rape her regardless of her answer, so at the very least she might pretend to belief she had a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said meekly. \u201cI accept your terms. Will you let me out now so we can\u2026 fulfill them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to,\u201d said the griffon, clearly glad about her decision. He maneuvered himself on all fours above Moon\u2019s cage so that his pelvis, and the assets they harbored, lined with her head. \u201cIt\u2019ll be more fun this way. Remember to mind the teeth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare let out a quiet whimper at the sight of the cock that was already sliding out of its sheath. The size alone had her worrying, and those barbs appealed to her none. Nonetheless, this was the road she had chosen. As the head navigated its way through the steel grid, Moon obediently opened her mouth in welcome, though reservedly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer worst fears didn\u2019t come true. Instead of being ravaged by an awful-tasting schlong, the dick she was offered in fact had a mildly pleasing, meaty flavour. Neither did the griffon ram it down her throat, but let her pick her own pace. She sucked the tip teasingly at first, seeing how he\u2019d react. A satisfied grumble encouraged her to accept more of the cock. The gagging-reflex kicked in midway, but with discipline she pushed past it and swallowed him deeper. An exasperated grunt rewarded her efforts. He started humping her mouth, attentive to her tolerance which remained generous, even leaned towards eagerness. By the time she got her first taste of avian precum, her own loins were demanding attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly the griffon not only noticed this but also returned the favour. The familiar claw approached her pussy once more. At first Moon jumped at the touch, but with her body more relaxed she allowed herself to try and enjoy the entry. Now that the imminent threat of violence had vanished, she found the claw quite joyful. Agile and nimble, it rubbed her with precision and tenderness, which was more than her own hooves could at times afford. Losing herself to the rising pleasure, the cock she sucked glided in more effortlessly. Before she knew it, she lapped at the underside of his smooth, heavy balls, the tip of the cock bulging her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer deepthroating technique soon lead to results. The griffon was about to burst his undoubtedly generous loud right into her stomach. But simply getting him off was no longer enough for Moon; not as the skillful claw drove her a beat short of her target. Pulling back as much as she could, she let the cock pop out during one of the thrusts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you fuck me now?\u201d she panted, saliva drooling over her chin. \u201cPlease?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he replied, equally stoked. \u201cD\u2019you want out first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo time: let\u2019s finish it like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe griffon didn\u2019t need to be convinced twice. The big hands grabbed the cage from both corners, aligning Moon\u2019s dribbling pussy right in line with his glistening, barbed cock. As the two merged, both moaned. A fierce rutting started, the griffon ramming against the tight slit crammed between steel bars with all his strength. Moon\u2019s position was so compact she couldn't even bump against the opposite end. All she could do was brace herself, utterly helpless to do anything but withhold the onslaught. Considered from a certain angle, that made the banging she received simply amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the griffon finally reached his peak, Moon had already enjoyed a couple herself. She yelped as the powerful arms raised the cage into the air for optimal adjustment. The cock sunk farther than ever before, practically tripping Moon over the moon. The griffon\u2019s lungs emptied in a primal, high-pitched shriek, during which several shots of cum spurted up Moon\u2019s distended passage. Most of it poured out along with the cock, staining the floor and the partners in creamy goo. The mess kept dribbling from the still hard cock over Moon\u2019s cage, which might\u2019ve as well been glowing, the way how hot she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 was\u2026 just\u2026 wow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d agreed the griffon. He collapsed next to the cage, chest heaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe afterglow extended into an ocean of bliss. At its end, a horizon gradually appeared, concealing the end of the world. Moon renewed her sense of the surroundings, including the hollow gazes which their act had mesmerized. From the corner of her eye she watched the griffon, who appeared to have fallen asleep. After a pause she decided to break the spell, and coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 You mentioned this deal?\u201d she asked as the griffon opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up, wiped dust off of his feathers. \u201cYou really got rid of Silhouette?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon nodded. \u201cAs self-defense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe griffon shrugged. \u201cSo it goes. Never really liked her. Too noisy. In any case, we need another informant in the Guard now that she\u2019s gone.\u201d He looked down at her meaningfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 I should become a turncoat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to live. A right word from me into the boss\u2019s ear, you\u2019re as good as hired. I have a good feeling about you. You\u2019re ready to do what it takes to survive. In this line of business, that takes you far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon fell silent. She had been part of the Guard for less than 24 hours, so the burden of duty wasn\u2019t exactly non-negotiable. Her life, on the other hoof, she had had for quite a while, and she very much intended to keep it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, now that he wasn\u2019t in the process of torturing her, the griffon undeniably had some attractive sides to him. Maybe joining his team meant making life-choices other than forced ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Moon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKloy,\u201d he answered, slightly baffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKloy,\u201d she said. \u201cYou guys don\u2019t mind if I keep the cage?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCan I see her teeth?\u201d asked Moon suddenly. \u201cYou know, for hygiene and all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe griffon frowned at the interruption, but obeyed nonetheless. The blond mare covered in her cage as he bended over to grab her jaw and force it open. Behind him, Moon furiously sought the heaviest item around she could lift. The chair resting against a nearby wall looked most promising. With baited breath she shifted next to it, picked it up, advanced on the griffon who was still occupied with wringing the resisting mare\u2019s mouth wide. As the chair raised over Moon\u2019s head, the pony happened to glance at her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon swung the piece of furniture with all her might, which wasn\u2019t all that little. But the mare\u2019s glance had warned the griffon a hair\u2019s width too much, which was also about how much the chair missed the back of his head. Instead it shattered against his shoulder. The griffon howled in pain. Moon pressed on her desperate attack, beating him with the stick left in her grasp. Few seconds speeded by when she thought she might win. And then the griffon straightened himself to his full height from the cover of his wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRats, thought Moon as the menacing shadow covered the room. She turned to flee. She didn\u2019t manage three steps before the griffon lunged at her back, bringing her down hard. A taloned foot pressed her neck against the floorboards, driving dust into her nostrils and the lance of fear through her heart. She squirmed for a bit but stopped at the deep, wound-up voice above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrave little pony. Didn\u2019t think bringing you down here would pose problems. Pretending to play along you're sorry act was starting to turn fun, too. For your sake, I hope the next part makes up for your insolence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon already had a nasty idea what the next part would be. Her worries were confirmed as the griffon pinned her wings and forelegs to her sides while effortlessly lifting her up on two feet. She was brought face to face with the dark-red feathered head, hungry eyes and, most terrifying of all, a wide-open beak leading into a slick, pink tunnel with nothing but impending darkness at the back. Without further ado she was plunged right in. The rotten stench of meat hit her nose the moment it entered the mouth, evidence enough that the griffon wasn\u2019t stranger to a carnivorous diet. The image of her imminent future hit Moon even worse than the smell did. Cramped in a sac of pulsing flesh, wasting away in acids until nothing but bones, hooves and some hair remained, gluing together into a repelling mass, the expelled pile of which would be unrecognizable even for her own mother. It demanded way less to get Moonbounce to scream from the bottom of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice lead the way for her forehead. Her muzzle squeezed painfully into the throat. Saliva filled every crevice and hole in her face. The griffon\u2019s sharp tongue spread it evenly all around while drawing every bit of taste it could from her matted fur. Meanwhile, the strong hands fed more of her into the merciless beak, no matter how much her hind legs kicked and bucked. Although the spit filling her sensitive ears made it hard to hear, there was no mistaking the gastric noises emanating from below. Glorps and Blorps cut distinct trails into the ubiquitous sucking, chomping cacophony. The growing aroma of decay would\u2019ve made Moon vomit, had she managed to get her mouth open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was already shoulders-deep when her one-way dive came to an unexpected halt. Soon, a powerful convulsion travelled from the pit of the griffon\u2019s stomach, vibrating all over Moon. Accompanied by a disgusting retching sound she was pushed back up in one smooth motion. Dribbling saliva all over, Moon found herself once more facing the griffon. Hope sparked in her chest: perhaps he had merely intended to scare her, make her more compliant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a sweet thing for a bat,\u201d he said, smacking his mouth and licking the rim of his beak. \u201cToo sweet to go down quietly. I want to hear your begs until the moment I snap my beak and close you into your tomb. Well, temporary tomb at least.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce gagged at the long, teasing slurp he gave her cheek. There was nothing she could do while the griffon rotated her like a particularly long loaf, then resumed to feed on her hooves. Warm moistness soon engulfed her ankles, which bulged his throat much like her head had a moment ago. It was the same process all over again, except this time she\u2019d have to watch herself being eaten. Uncontrollable sobs erupted at the thought, even as she swore she\u2019d never beg in front of the bastard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did make plenty of other noises though, especially when the griffon reached her pelvis and nether regions. The unabashed tongue probed her labia without concern, even dipped in for a quick taste before ravenously flicking at her tits. Moonbounce gasped, whined, moaned and cried at the torment. Her plentiful buttocks got stuffed in one after another like huge melons, in comparison to which her slim waist disappeared from sight alarmingly quickly. By the time the beak touched her chest, Moon was hyperventilating, her hindlegs already pushing into the stomach. The mound they made was modest, but that would soon change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear Celestia, save me!\u201d she eventually wailed. \u201c Help! Somepony help me! Help, help, help, hel\u2013hmmhh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head finally enclosed within the griffon\u2019s. The overflowing saliva got into her mouth again, drowning her hopeless shouting. The room\u2019s gloom gradually changed into the darkness of his esophagus. Moon kept her front legs out as long as she could, flailing for a grasp, for anything, even as the last sliver of light vanished behind the uvula. Her last, gurgling scream ran from the gaping beak, which snapped shut with the disappearance of her hooves. The griffon realigned his jaw, swallowed one more time, then watched as his belly expanded with the mass of the batpony. She wriggled admirably, probably because the digestive enzymes were already working on her skin, on their way to reducing her to meaty soup. The griffon sat on a nearby crate to relish the internal massage stirred by the dying struggles of the sweet bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a hunch you wouldn\u2019t disappoint me,\u201d he said, stroking the lump he assumed was the pony\u2019s head. He could feel an opening gaping, which had to be mean she was fighting for the same air he felt the growing need to expel. \u201cIt\u2019s been *burp* fun, but this is where we say farewells. Bye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA formidable belch exploded from his stomach into a thin cloud of stomach fluids, saliva, some hairs and an aftertaste of apple. The skin around his meal contracted, killing the mare\u2019s last resistance. Her muzzle actually formed an imprint of sorts, where the shadow of the agony and terror she experienced were encapsulated. He knew she had passed as a certain tension relieved within him, leaving but a fully sated sensation behind. The griffon let out a few more smaller burps, then curled on the floor around his midsection. No one would come here for a few hours, which left just enough time to enjoy a little postprandial nap.</span></div></div>",

Eavesdropping had gotten her this far, right? There was no reason it would not see her all the way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether that was true or merely wishful thinking, Moon got never to know, for after some half an hour of idle waiting, the door to the bar opened discreetly. Shortly after the chair opposite to her was drawn out in the very particular way some unicorns do niche tasks to show off their unique abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood evening, cadet,\u201d said the mare seating herself in the table. She put her front hooves neatly in front of herself, corrected her ever so slightly posture, and gave Moonbounce a courteous smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm\u2026 Good evening?\u201d she replied in the lack of alternatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I offer you anything?\u201d the mare continued, speaking like an old friend. \u201cI understand your kind fancies fruits?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s the stereotype, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn apple juice it is,\u201d the mare said, with nothing to suggest an order had been made. Nonetheless a glass of golden liquid was produced in between them without delay. Moon gave a suspicious glance first at the drink, then at the pony before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom voice to gaiters she had dressed herself like only the nobility of Canterlot could. The vest alone had to be worth what Moon made in a year, and it was simply criminal to think what all those jewelry had to cost. Everything about her radiated grandeur, which was precisely why Moon found its authenticity doubtful. Nopony who had to try that hard to look fancy couldn\u2019t really be all that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d the pony asked. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to ask already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon gave this a thought. Then she said, \u201cWho are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked. You see, I\u2019m not going to give you my actual name, obviously, but it would be rude to withhold everything from you \u2013 especially considering I know so much about you \u2013 so why not call me Diamond?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away Moon could tell two things about Diamond: she was good at pretending and excellent at dropping threats like needles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond drew a short breath before continuing. \u201cNow, since you asked me a question, it\u2019s only fair that I may return the favour.

Immediately, a noose fell past her tufted ears, then fastened around her neck. She panicked as air stopped moving into her lungs and tried to get up. Instead, strong, taloned arms grabbed her and tied her hooves and wings, even as the rope on her neck kept pulling her towards the ceiling. When her feet lifted from the floor they were kicking in frenzy, her whole body twitching and spasming at the end of the noose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the table, Diamond took a sip of the juice while watching her flail. \u201cTold you to think hard. As you see, it\u2019s much neater than dancing hard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd laughter erupted at that. Moon heard none of it. All she heard was her mad heartbeats, her desperate, raspy gasps for breaths, the creaking of the tight rope as it hung from side to side along with her struggles. Bloodshot eyes bulging, she feverishly looked for salvation, but only found uncaring stares and excited grins. The tips of her hooves were inches from the planks; inches and miles, the same difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was starting to lose it. The gags turned one after another shorter, sharper, and more painful. She could taste blood in her gaping mouth. Her neck felt like it was being bended by a gorilla. Black mist gathered at the edges of her spinning vision. Deep within her lungs, the ultimate appeal for oxygen surged upward, tearing its way with hooks made of glass, reaching from her gullet with one last dry gargle. With its passing, Moon\u2019s corpse fell all limp, her wide open eyes staring at nothing, her saliva dribbling-tongue hanging past her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet her down and feed to the pigs,\u201d commented Diamond after an extremely brief silence. \u201cSave the wings though. Seem like decent enough of leather. Who knows, maybe my tailor will be able to turn them into something useful, like a purse.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A flinch was all Moon\u2019s face betrayed after she had bitten her own tongue to stay any ill-thought reactions it might be tempted to sprout. This was not a situation to be taken lightly. The threat was evanescent to pure reason, but in her spine Moon felt a tingling sensation much older and firmer than any sapience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some preciously slow yet intensive deliberation Moon replied: \u201cIf you did, I couldn\u2019t buy the next round?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis stirred some sniggering in the crowd the center of which their table had now become. To Moon\u2019s eternal relief, Diamond soon joined chortle with a high-pitched giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA joke. Very clever. Very disarming. I like your thinking \u2013 it reminds me of my sister\u2019s. Of course, eventually I had her buried alive in scorpions, so I wouldn\u2019t trust that too much in the long run.\u201d More laughter followed this, albeit this time from but a single throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Moon felt her own gullet had tried up for good, despite the juice she poured down on it, her hoof shaking tenderly. Furiously she tried to get on top of the situation. Who was this pony? What did she want? Had she really buried her sister in scorpions?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you\u2019re thinking whether I really buried my sister in scorpions,\u201d continued Diamond. She smiled coily. \u201cIt\u2019s an entrapping thought, isn\u2019t it? Imagine what it must be like \u2013 swimming in a sea of seething stings, feeling them crawl all over your skin, digging into places you need a mirror to see into yourself\u2026 and then one of them wounds you. The rest go absolutely crazy! Soon you\u2019re bleeding from a hundred cuts, each oozing burning poison, numbing your screams inside your lungs, breaking down your muscles, organs, eyes\u2026 leaving behind but a skeleton on which tiny legs skittle for the rest of eternity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point of her exposition, Diamond had closer her eyes dreamily. As she opened them, she found not only Moon but half the bar looking at her as if she had turned into a changeling. She returned them a confused expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Did I say something funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t so much what you said as how you said it, thought Moon while biting her tongue again. It had seemed as if Diamond could have masturbated at the horrible words her mouth formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, whatever,\u201d said Diamond in the absence of answers. She turned renewed interest in Moonbounce, who had never before wanted to evaporate into thin air so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI realize I\u2019m straying from the topic at hoof, the topic being you. I like you. Or I think I like you, it\u2019s always hard to tell, you know, when you like or actually hate someone. In either case you usually end up murdering them anyway, am I right?\u201d The unicorn leaned forward. Her horn lit up sickly green. \u201cAm I scaring you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d whispered Moon, nailed on her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d whispered Diamond back. \u201cThe right answer. They always get it right, that one. In my trade fear is what water is for sailors. You either float above or drown in it. You make it your bitch. Do you understand me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce stared into the eyes illuminated by the magical neon-glow and saw madness. Pure, simple madness imprisoned in spider webs which might tear open at any moment by a lunatic spider ravaging its own house in search or a fly that wasn\u2019t there. There was no reading a mind like that. The actions such a force demanded were completely opposite to understanding.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The smell wafting from there was unlike what Moon had ever sniffed; it brought to mind rancid meat. Coming from what presumably was a vegetarian stomach, the notion was alarming to say the least. Not as alarming as the fact that the unicorn had frozen Moon stiff with her horn, but still, quite distrustful in its own ominous way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmell that?\u201d Diamond spoke, closing her mouth slightly. \u201cBefore I was informed of the complications your unexpected reappearance here caused in my subjects, I was quite enjoying myself in a party not far from here. Especially the menu had me occupied. Why, some of the dishes practically begged to be eaten! In fact most of them were begging the exact opposite, but figuratively speaking\u2026 eh, you get the idea. The point is, I was not unable to finish, not by a long shot, of what by rights was supposed to be a night I had been awaiting for a handsome while. And it has made my hunger so very much, much more noticeable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jaws parted again, this time more than Moon\u2019s eyes could believe, and more than her mind wanted to. Forced by the unbending magic, her head was brought within the tasting range of the slavering chops. Diamond\u2019s tongue snapped forward eagerly, blindly lapping wherever it could reach, including Moon\u2019s nostrils, teeth, lips and chin. It chilled Moon to realize she was actually being tasted by another pony, utterly without restraint or concern for the concept of respect for another fellow equine. All she could do was twitch her eyelids and watch as her face became rapidly coated in foreign saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a yank. Moon\u2019s muzzle sank into the moistness before her, with two rows of flat teeth clamping on her from above and below. Slowly and deliberately they begun chewing her \u2013 not quite painfully, but with an experimenting, curious intent that removed the last doubts of whether Diamond was being serious or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmhmh-not-hhmmh-bad,\u201d commented Diamond amidst her efforts. \u201cTastes-hmhm-like apples.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe batpony screamed internally as more of her head bulged the other\u2019s mare\u2019s powdered cheeks. Thoughts glowing with anger and fear, she tried to resist the arcane powers curbing her muscles, but the stupid horn was more powerful than what she had ever had to encounter before. The last glimpse Moon had of the outside world was the sight of the spiralled bone overwatching her imminent sliding into the slick depths reeking unimaginably awful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst of it wasn\u2019t the stench of decay alone, but the knowledge Moon enjoyed of its origin. Her keen sense of smell now turned into a foul curse, for she could pick up several distinct aromas under the overwhelming wave of digesting meat, including french cream, some vegetables, fruit, even a few spices. The poor pony Diamond has feasted on had been cooked by a first class chef. I instead will be served raw like the day I was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond had to realign her focus as the unfinished meal decided to turn ill-mannered. It was impressive the pony could so much as tremble under her horn, least so much as cause her to notice her struggles. If nothing else, the little fight fuelled the unicorn\u2019s appetite. Gathering some strength, she gave the batpony the first proper swallow, sending her forehead down into her gullet where it formed a noticeable bulge. Novel ground conquered, Diamond set out to quickly harvest its fruit, leaving not an inch of the delicious neck fur untasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbearable tightness combined with oppressive humidity to deprive Moon of the sherds of her psychic cohesion. The fragrance of the late diet invaded her nostrils completely, from there her brain and good sense. She saw herself as but a raw steak, a portion of flesh trapped in a sac of corrosive acids shredding her groomed fur, eating away her beautiful skin, dissolving her sensitive entrails, eyes and all other soft bits, leaving behind a pile of corroded bones, a clump of hair and four pairs of hooves. The rest would be turned into fat around the very belly that had digested her, with the leftovers unloaded back into the cycle of nature. The idea was a flash in Moon\u2019s head, like a knife: quick to disappear, slow to heal. She wailed at the sheer insanity of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Diamond had progressed to accommodate her prey\u2019s shoulders, one at a time. As she worked one joint after another, a problem presented itself attached to the pony\u2019s back. Those leathery appendages didn\u2019t look appetizing at all. If anything they looked like the makings of a new purse. But for that purpose they would have to end up in a different address than where their current owner was heading to. Unceremoniously reaching for her bag, Diamond produced a pair of scissors she always carried around for situations not completely alien to the present one. Securing the mare within her with one more swallow, she put the blades to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one the crowd in the room grimaced while the bat pony\u2019s wings were severed from her back and dropped onto the floor, where a pool of blood quickly enlarged. Deep within her, Diamond could hear agonized screams resonate. They tickled slightly. In any case, the time had come to finish this particular dinner, and the fresh blood was just the lubrication she needed to do that. Standing up and using her magic to align the pony better, the unicorn fed her straight down her throat in a series of heaving gulps. Soon all but remained were a pair of stiff hind legs sticking out along with the tip of a black tail. Diamond sucked them all inside like spaghetti, then steadied herself as the newly acquired mass settled itself into the most economical position in her swollen belly. Only when she was certain her stomach could handle the load, she let her magic lose control of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately a jolt-like scramble began down there, joined with more screaming. Imprints of hoof pads and facial features appeared on her tightly stretched skin, only to bounce back in short order. It was all too little all too late. Nonetheless, the struggle did have one beneficial side: aiding the excess air exit more easily. Sure enough, Diamond felt pressure climbing up, then explode in a mighty belch heavy with saliva, hairs, and the tainted badge of the cop-bitch. The piece of silver clattered on the floor for about as long as the last row in her belly lasted. Afterwards, only the deep rumbling of acids in their work followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis would probably be time for some clever remark,\u201d burped Diamond. \u201cCan\u2019t think of any. Oh well, not that she was that special a case to begin with.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cTell me more about these kidnappings,\u201d Moonbounce said. \u201cHow come they\u2019re just \u2018possible\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps I should start from the beginning,\u201d said Nox, leaning back on his chair. \u201cThe first report of a missing pony arrived three days ago. A mare in her twenties got lost on her way back from the circus that had arrived to town earlier the same day. She had a coltfriend along, according to whom Cake Walk (her name) disappeared in the bar they went into after the show. One moment she was there, the other not. He isn\u2019t that specific about details though, him having been drunk most of the evening. The two other cases have some similarities to the first. Young mares, moving with a friend or two, on their way back from the circus at night, vanish at some point without the others knowing anything about it. You can read all about it from here,\u201d Nox finished, pulling a file from his drawer and hoofing it to Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the kidnappings are just possible because there hasn\u2019t been any ransom demands,\u201d she said after leafing through the thin file.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d said Nox with a smile that said she had passed a test of some sort. \u201cThere\u2019s some who wouldn't even consider the cases related, but my gut says that they are, and that the circus is the glue. We\u2019ve questioned the people there of course, other audience members included. Seems to be nothing out of place going in there. Which is exactly what I find so suspicious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 How should we proceed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a plan,\u201d said Nox, with a face Moon had trouble reading. \u201cA slightly unconventional one, but that\u2019s precisely what we need with an unconventional case, isn't it? Well, I\u2019m not going to beat around the bush: I want you to go to the circus, undercover, with a partner, and see if you can arouse the kidnapper\u2019s attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cWait\u2026 You want to use me as a bait?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said undercover,\u201d said Nox calmly but sternly. \u201cAnd yes, as a bait too. That\u2019s the unconventional part. The thing is, the clock is ticking, and we need to get results. Three lives are at stake here, cadet. You\u2019ve sworn to protect them. Will you stand up to the task?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox had her cornered, Moon realized. If she refused, she\u2019d let down the Guard on her first night on duty. That wasn\u2019t an option. So, like her mother had always said, when there\u2019s only one thing to be done, you do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYessir,\u201d she said, and saluted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew I could count on you, cadet,\u201d he said with the characteristic grin. \u201cIt\u2019s all set then. I\u2019ve already picked a partner who will act as your coltfriend tonight. The show starts in an hour, so you two have a short while to mingle and get your act together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce bit her lip. \u201cSir\u2026 What do you expect me to do there, exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox shrugged. \u201cTo be yourself: a young, cheery gal having a night out with her coltfriend. I\u2019d tell you to look cute, but you got that covered already. Put on something suggestive. Comb your mane too, it looks messy. That\u2019s your facade. Inside, you keep your wits near you. Keep an eye out for anything strange. I swear, all\u2019s not right with that circus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-kay\u2026\u201d said Moon. \u201cAnd this \u2018coltfriend\u2019 of mine: who\u2019s it going to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox\u2019s grin spread to his ears. \u201cWhy, me of course. Now go and get yourself as pretty as you can; we\u2019ll set off in forty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>***</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they told me the Guard would be the place to show off my assets, this wasn\u2019t what I had in mind, thought Moonbounce as she walked side by side with Nox towards a huge tent lit with colorful lights. She wore a dark-blue miniskirt which rather emphasized than covered the generous form of her rump. Four pairs of black kneesocks with pictures of bats in them covered her hooves. According to Nox, those had been a necessary addition, although he had been somewhat vague as to why this was. In the end, she didn\u2019t even care to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hoof, seen from a certain perspective there were worse predicaments than her current one. The pay of a cadet earned a living but not much in the way of entertainment, and it had been years since she had been to a circus. The night had a promise of beauty in the air, and the few drinks Nox had offered her \u201cto increase the authenticity of our infiltration\u201d made her feel lighter than usual in the head. And to top it all, on a closer look, her escort didn\u2019t look all that bad in a suite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrace yourself,\u201d he was saying. \u201cWe\u2019re going in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Moon had to gasp, first at the sheer size of the tent, then at the bare splendour of it. The ceiling had to be at least twenty meters above them, and most of the vast space was filled with blinking lights, open fires, and acrobats soaring from a rope to rope in the middle of their warm-ups. For a moment she was but a filly again, eager to be amazed at everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that could not be. She had a job to do, after all, even if she was doing it in kneesocks with bats in them. Already she had spotted a few clowns at the edge of the ring who harbored a suspiciously keen interest in a cannon. And that cotton candy seller was laughing way too loudly for her taste. Even some of the audience had an air of guilt about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeeing anything?\u201d she whispered at Nox as they seated themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said the Sergeant. \u201cI see plenty, alright. That skirt sure leaves no room for imagination.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at him, incredulous. There was no telling if that had been a sorry attempt at a joke, an effort to keep in character or a blatant vulgarity. They were on a serious mission, after all. But that didn\u2019t seem to stop the unmistakable bulge in the Sergeant\u2019s pants betraying the less professional side of his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her luck the awkward moment passed as the clowns fired the cannon (with one of their smaller kin inside) and thus launched the show. While Moonbounce the cadet paid attention to every shade of suspicion, Moonbounce the filly wore out her eyes while consuming all the wonders of the spectacle. The acrobats toyed with gravity and life in equal measure: the clowns had gravestones (literally) laughing at their goofes. The magicians displayed the arcane arts at the apex of their glory. The circus even included a score of rare, magical beasts, like a manticore, a hydra, a cocatrice and a chimera. The stunts the animal trainers did with the monsters could only make her wonder how none of them got eaten on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show went on, on and on until it didn\u2019t anymore. Moonbounce was still coming down from the heights the experience had her lifted as she and the Nox joined the current on ponies leaving the tent. But before they could get to the streets, the Sergeant suddenly pulled her aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t drift off, cadet,\u201d he said. \u201cOur work has just begun. Now, I want you to start wandering around the nearby streets, preferably quiet ones, looking like you\u2019ve lost your way. If anypony makes contact with you, play it smart; let them try and help you, see if they\u2019ll try anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYessir,\u201d said Moon. A bit more hesitantly she added: \u201cWill you be watching over me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I\u2019ll take a look around the tent and the backstage. If I don\u2019t find anything, I\u2019ll seek you out. Now go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon watched the Sergeant melt into the crowd. Granted, she had not know him for long, but already she could tell Nox was not your average, shout-and-spit-a-lot kind of Sergeant. His behavior back in the tent still nagged her, but perhaps a hint of coarseness was something she had to get used to in the Guard. In any case, like he had said, she had a mission to accomplish, although she still wasn\u2019t quite sure what it was exactly. To be honest, wandering aimlessly around the streets wasn\u2019t what her excited mind was in mood for right now. She had done enough observing in the tent already. She craved for action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hoof\u2026 that would sort of be like breaking a direct command\u2026</span></div></div>",

If Nox seriously thought she\u2019d play the part of the bait like a little filly, well, he was wrong. And when she\u2019d solve this case, he\u2019d have to admit his error to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the audience departed and left the clearing mostly quiet, Moon slipped into the shadows. If Nox\u2019s gut had the sniff of truth it boasted, there would have to be some clues in the tent\u2019s vicinity, or perhaps in the camp they had set in the nearby park. Three ponies would not just vanish off the face of the earth.</span></div></div>",

Who knew, perhaps she could fish information out of the employees in a casual conversation, or find some other hint of the missing ponies\u2019 fates. Adamant in her effort to act like a real investigator, she slashed a cut into the canvas with a claw of her wing and stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the lights had already gone out, leaving the interior of the tent wrapped in gloom. Sneaking beneath the rows of seats, Moon circled the main ring, her night vision scanning the site for movement. Her ears turned out of their own accord, alert for the tiniest of sounds. All around her, the darkness loomed, as if holding its breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething rattled on the other side of the tent. Moon froze, peering through the seats to see what it was, but nothing stuck out from the dim background of crates, circus equipment and cages. She waited with bated breath, her every sense wired to the extreme. Nothing stirred in the silence; not even the big water pool at the centre of the stage, which the clowns had left there after their last show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe if I fly to that pole I can get a better look around, she reasoned. She could fly quieter than a leaf would fall, after all. With her wings spread out, she practically glided upwards until she landed on the round platform at the top of the central pole. At the same moment, something clanged below her. Automatically, she focused her eagle eyes at one of the crates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a hole in the wooden side, something looked back at her. Moon blinked, a sudden dizziness and cold capturing her on the spot. She couldn\u2019t stop staring. A sense of dread spread over her, starting weirdly from the legs. She tried to look away from that slit, but for her life couldn\u2019t, as if something forced her eyes to look straight in. A numb, heavy sensation climbed up her feet. Mustering all her willpower, she looked down from the corner of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith astounding velocity, her legs were turning to stone; into gray, hard, cold granite. It was already up her knees. She knew it was impossible, completely ridiculous, yet it was happening. Right now. And yet she could not look away from that, that, that\u2026 crate which read, in big bold letters, \u201cDon\u2019t look: a cocatrice inside\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcentrating her every brain cell, she broke the eye contact with the box. It was too late though; her legs were but dead weight now. Carried by the momentum, she swayed from side to side, the terror of immobility squeezing her throat. Under her, the planks complained loudly. And then she fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the help of her wings and the ropes crisscrossing the air, Moon succeeded in slowing down her acceleration so that she didn\u2019t end up as a wet smear on the ground below. But with all her limbs stiff as rock, there was no helping the crash, which ended at the center of the water pool. The splash she made echoed around and removed a good quarter of the liquid in one go. Unfortunately, that left still plenty enough for her body to immerse completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna\u2019s craters, she thought in horror. I can\u2019t move! I can\u2019t move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t completely true. Her left wing whipped the surface furiously, and whatever part of her hadn\u2019t turned to stone thrashed as in fever. She was but a meter deep, yet she might\u2019ve as well been laying in the bottom of the ocean. Eyes wide she stared at the shimmering surface, cheeks bulging from the little, precious air she had gulped during the drop. It was running out fast. Already her lungs ached; soon they\u2019d be burning. She fought against the instinct as best as she could, but in the end, the reflex kicked in, and she breathed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater gushed into her throat instantaneously. Her scream rose with a pillar of bubbles, unheard. On the surface, the lone wing that hadn\u2019t been crushed under her body went briefly mad, then stiffened, then fell limp. From the bottom of the pool, glazed ember eyes stared at nothing.</span></div></div>",

Their camp, however, could well contain things of interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was customary for travelling groups, even whole circuses, to accommodate in Canterlot\u2019s public space. The city had plenty of open parks capable of hosting a generous number of people, so why not put them to use when the need arose. The Cinnamon park, named for the spices that grew there, was among the more popular locations for camps. It had well, and it wasn\u2019t too close to any apartment buildings. Conveniently for Moonbounce, it also had lots of bushes to sneak around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large fire had been set in the middle of the camp, gathering people around it to sing, chat and booze. There were all sorts; muscular acrobats, fat clowns, solitary magicians and other, less recognizable figures. It occurred to Moon that perhap the missing ponies had simply ran away and joined the circus. It seemed like a lot of fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there, cutie,\u201d said a rough voice behind her. Moon flinched, whirling around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, hello to yourself,\u201d she said uncertainly, eyeing the stallion who had appeared behind her. There was not many a pony who could sneak up on her like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d the stallion said after a moment\u2019s silence. From his slur it was clear he had been drinking. \u201cGo on. Ask away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh,\u201d started Moon. \u201cWhat should I be asking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion snorted. \u201cYou want to join the party, right? You don\u2019t have to hide in the bushes to do that. Come on, don\u2019t be shy: I\u2019ll introduce you to the rest of lot.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon blinked. It did seem like a good opportunity to infiltrate the camp. Perhaps too good. The stallion, one of the acrobats by the look of his muscles, seemed genuine enough, but she could not shut down the doubt that not all was right with him. What should she do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThanks!\u201d she said cheerily. \u201cGosh, I can be so shy at times. I\u2019ve been sitting here forever, just rolling my hooves. Thank Luna you happened by, Mister\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClear,\u201d he replied. A swaying hoof was extended between them. \u201cSteer Clear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you, Steer,\u201d she mused. It was apparent she was arousing more than politeness in the stud, so why not take full advantage of it. She accepted the hoof graciously. \u201cThey call me Cherry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet they do,\u201d he said, still shaking her hoof. The grip of the pony could have crushed a small tree. \u201cI bet they do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, she had made her way into the camp. The welcome was fierce and merry, and in mere minutes she felt like being one of the flock. Maybe the drink they pushed on her from the start had something to do with it. She couldn\u2019t refuse of course, although the liquid burned her throat with every gulp. It had to be homemade. With everypony drunk she\u2019d be sure to tease answers from them with innocent questions. If only she could remember what those were, or why she had to ask them, or why she was here to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first warning signal came when, out of nowhere, Steer kissed her deeply. They were in his wagon then, or at least Moon assumed it was his, although there was this other stallion present. He kissed her too. Or perhaps she kissed him, it was hard to tell at that point. Everything was turning into a blur of dance, singing, secret missions and booze, booze and booze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBent over, Cheery,\u201d she was being told. She giggled, but didn\u2019t move a muscle; not until strong hooves pressed her down. She was too tired to resist; too fuzzy too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s happening,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cI\u2026 I have an invest\u2026 gation to finish\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn right you do,\u201d said a male voice he didn\u2019t recognize. She did recognize the tip of the cock that tickled her lips though. She was about present a question, but at her rear a rough tongue flicked her clit, inciting a deep moan from her instead. Inch by inch, the musky, meaty rod sank into her mouth. It seemed like the natural thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon had little enough focus on her to stand straight, much less to suck a dick, but the stallion was more than eager to help himself. While he pumped her loose, relaxed throat full of horse cock, Clear on her other end finished the foreplay with a slobbering kiss at her cunt and a smack on her quivering buttocks, which he spread wide before his throbbing member. Moon\u2019s moans thickened as the shaft found her entrance and filled the moist pussy to the brim with a hot, pulsing dick. Helpless and mostly oblivious to anything else around her, she passed out at the sounds of two studs pounding her both ends with vigour. The last feeling her brain registered was a stream of thick, salty spurts painting her throat white from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome the morning, Moonbounce found herself in one of Cinnamon Park\u2019s bushes, her skirt and socks torn, her body sore all over, and a hangover the size of a melon bursting her head in half. By the time she had made it back to the barracks, she was intercepted by Sergeant Nox, who, after a short questioning, to which she in her current state could not come up with nothing but the tattered truth she remembered, expelled her from the Guard for life.</span></div></div>",

But thanks for the invitation anyway.\u201d She made a move to pass him, which he stunted with a hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey, not so fast,\u201d he said, breath reeking of something awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said no,\u201d she insisted, trying to circle the stallion. This was hard, for he was a good head and shoulders taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome one, I know you want to,\u201d he went on, sounding sweet as moonshine. A heavy, clumsy hoof rose surprisingly quickly around her neck, almost tipping her over. \u201cWe got lots of liquor, ya know? Liqueur and comfy, comfy beds in the wagons\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet off me!\u201d she exclaimed, wriggling from his embrace. When he tried to reestablish it, she pushed him. It was like pushing a stone wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, sweety,\u201d he said, with a lowered voice. \u201cNo need to get like that. Only gets ya hurt, that.\u201d The veins on his thick neck pulsed like garden hoses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Moon felt it best to avoid sudden moves. \u201cO-kay. No pushing, then. But I really should be going now, see? My mom\u2019s must be worried sick about where I am.\u201d That was the lamest excuse in the world, but in the heat of the moment it was all she could think of. It wasn\u2019t like she could expose her cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hulking stud snorted so hard Moon\u2019s mane blew back. Clearly something was moving behind those misty, unfocused eyes, although what exactly was anypony\u2019s guess. The idea of legging it made an appeal in Moon\u2019s mind. But she had seen how quick the stallion could be, despite his size and intoxication. But could she really talk her way out of this?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI promise to come back tomorrow,\u201d she chirped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother snort. It looked like she could win him over. Just a little push and she\u2019d be there; she could feel it in her gut. \u201cYou know, I could come visit you in your wagon then\u2026 Just you and me, boozing away, getting comfortable. You\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t you, big colt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis earned an approving neigh. But the stallion wasn\u2019t moving yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about right now?\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 Right now, what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a boulder he shifted right next to her, dwarfing her with mere presence. \u201cYou know what, sweety.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if guided by fate, the wind chose the moment to swat Moonbounce\u2019s face with the muskiest scent she had ever smelled. There was no mistaking its origin. She gulped, returned to the option of running, but it was too late. There was no telling what the stud would do. She could reveal her true identity, but in her miniskirt and socks the weight of the argument could be measured in the laugh it would incite. Instinct told her to retain the little control she had over the situation, which meant swallowing her pride. It couldn\u2019t be that bad, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-okay,\u201d she managed. \u201cUhm. You wanna show the way to your wagon now...?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. We do it here. Crouch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last word resembled more a statement of a fact than a suggestion. Moon got down on all her knees, the cool grass brushing her belly. The stallion simply walked over her, stopping his crotch above her head. Already halfway out of its sheath, the biggest cock she had ever seen hung over her like a bell tongue, accompanied by a heavy set of furry orbs. The pink, black-spotted tip swayed in front of her, excepting attention, which she did not dare to deny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first lick she gave flooded her mouth with the same musky flavour that filled her nostrils. It wasn\u2019t exactly bad, just\u2026 compelling. Above him the stallion rumbled quietly while she kept moistening the massive dick, working on the flare mostly. The mass of flesh grew steadily, pulsing and throbbing greedily with every new taste. A part of Moon watched herself from a distance, wondering how a fresh cadet had ended up blowing a complete stranger in some park, dressed in a miniskirt and kneesocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly, the stallion bucked his hips, bumping the head of the cock against Moon\u2019s fangs. A disastrous conclusion flashed in her eyes: she knew from experience it was a challenge for a thestral to give a bloodless blowjob to a regular stallion, but with this monster there would be no way to make it work. Still, the cock prodded again. Shivering at the thought of hurting his volatile mate, she inched her mouth over the head of the member, mindful of keeping her lips between his flesh and her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe method seemed to work, although at a price of chafing her lips raw and probably dislocating her jaw. The cock slid in and out, in and out, barely one fifth of the length ever making it in. The stallion\u2019s bucks grew more forceful at each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeeper,\u201d he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon popped the dick out, gasping. \u201cI can\u2019t! It\u2019s too big! I swear, that\u2019s no clich\u00e9: this thing\u2019s huge! Please, I fear I might hurt you with my fangs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chuckle like thunder carried down. \u201cStupid little bat. You can\u2019t hurt me. Now swallow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelpless, Moon obeyed and took the cock further than before. It pained to cram her mouth that full. Now the stallion was humping her, and the fangs pressed against the meat. Moon squeezed shut her eyes, gagging at the dick that now stuffed her esophagus. It actually felt she might break a tooth. Trying to make the stud cum quicker, she cupped his balls with a wing. She knew it was impossible, but she fancied to actually feel the seed churning inside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, she had to spit the dick out or choke. \u201cNo more! Please, I can\u2019t take it anymore! We could finish this tomorrow, I promise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy breathing filled the night. \u201cIf you can\u2019t take me in, little bat\u2026 maybe I can take in you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-what?\u201d she blurted. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all she could express out of the dozen questions she had before the cock came at her again. This time, it was different. The flare\u2019s slit spread wider than good sense would allow, hitting Moon\u2019s muzzle with a wet squelch. It did not stop there. Like a snake the cock plunged forward while sucking her deeper, and before she realized what was happening, her eyes were already disappearing into the urethra. It was then that she started really fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmh!\u201d she mumbled, the cock encompassing her mouth and swallowing her words. Grasping for leverage, she pressed her front hooves against the stallion\u2019s abdomen and pushed. That at least stopped her head from sinking deeper. The stalemate was war from fair though, for she could not breathe in the suffocating, compressing tunnel. In desperate rage, she started beating and kicking whatever her blows could reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer protests suffered a major setback when the stallion crashed down on her back. The impact came that close of snapping her bent neck, but it did not fail to crush her front legs, trapped as they were between a rock and a hard place. Inside the cock, she screamed in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she wailed, her journey into the leathery sacks continued with renewed speed. The flare had already lost much of its original shape, now turned into a pink, elastic layer that covered Moon\u2019s head, neck and soon her shoulders. Above her, the stallion neighed and groaned, grinding the mare below with his bulk to aid her slide more smoothly into him. Sounds of breaking bone, tearing wing and muffled sobbing drowned under the frivolous melody carrying from the camp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the ravenous dick had devoured Moonbounce up to the stems of her now useless wings, the stallion rose up. With amused chuckle he followed how the bruised body of the mare vanished twitching into him, escorted by quiet slurping sounds. Already he could sense the weight of her head resting in one of his balls. Stretching a bit, he saw the imprint of an open muzzle and the indentations of eye holes forming against the smooth, dark skin. Eager to finish off what he had started, he began stroking his massive girth. Combined with the wriggles of the pony within, he was panting in minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the testicle, Moonbounce verged on the limit of her existence. Little air managed to squeeze into the fleshy tunnel, and with every sip she had to swallow down twice the amount of the creamy cum, which by now had rubbed onto every centimeter of her fur. Not only did it make her slicker to devour, it also tingled in the way semen shouldn\u2019t; it was almost burning at places, at her eyes especially. Screaming had ceased to be an option way back. What little resistance she could muster anymore was spent on trying not to drown in cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that remained outside was a pair of hind legs, hanging limply by the knees from the mouth of the stiff, protruding cock, along with a few visible hairs of her tail. His chest heaving from all the pleasure traversing his mighty being, Steer Clear could hold back no more. Digging all four legs into the ground, he focused on powers gifted to him long ago by entities no longer walking on this earth. All along the length of the cock, strong muscles started kneading the treat within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in her unreal state of mind Moonbounce realized that a change had occurred. She wasn\u2019t moving deeper anymore. Instead, she was being rubbed from all over. At first it was an almost pleasant massage, but soon it got more forceful \u2013 a lot more forceful. In addition, the cum now stinged worse than ever, even in places it hadn\u2019t before. A definite sense of diffusion hit her. That was one of the last coherent thoughts she had, before the contracting flesh cut short her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteer Clear let out a gasp of bliss as his dick grounded the mare down into pulp. In no time, cracks of breaking bone joined full gurgling tinged with echoes of cries. The hind legs were sucked in, joining with the fleshy soup the pony had now turned into. But that was only temporal. Shreds of meat, intestine, brain and bone were soon liquefied, their essence turning to salty, rich, thick cum. Loads of it already bursted out. Unable to contain the flood, the stallion simply let go, releasing an ocean of cum on the spotless grass. The tide took over his mind and the ground both, covering them in perfect, dim white dream speckled with not so much as a hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the stream finally ceased, Steer Clear swayed back and forth, utterly spent. The nearby bushes were all but covered in cum, dribbling the substance from every leaf. It would disappear by the morning though, like it always did, either draining into the ground or getting lapped into the bellies of whatever animals moved in these parts. It was highly tasty and nourishing, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore leaving, he happened to glance at one of the many puddles on the scene. It made him smile to notice it actually looked kind of like a bat.</span></div></div>",

But rather than turning her back, she ducked right under the stallion, slipping past his defenses before he could so much as flinch. To cover her escape, she gave a nasty bite at his balls on her way. A wicked grin spread over her cheeks at the taste of blood in her mouth and the whining complaining of the stud in her ears. A few bushes away she rose to her wings, losing the sorry sight of the pony in the embrace of the evening sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was close, she thought, gliding through the air. In any case, the incident was history now insofar as her mission was concerned. The hour was getting late, yet she felt she still had no glue as of what leads to pursue, or where to find them in the first place. Perhaps she should just have listened to Nox\u2019s orders to begin with? It wasn\u2019t too late for that yet, was it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Perhaps it was high time she started acting like a responsible guard, Moonbounce thought. Sergeant Nox was her superior after all, not to mention much more experienced in the job. Surely he had good reasons for what he did, even if those didn\u2019t excite Moonbounce all that much. With a dutiful sigh, she headed to the quiet alleys in the tent\u2019s proximity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from the motions of the moon, she spent a good hour cruising the cobblestones, doing her best to look innocent, lost, scared and whatever else she thought an alluring victim should look like. If nothing else, she aroused the interest of many a homeless pony and a drunk socialite on their way to the next bar. Not exactly an achievement, but at least she was assured that her figure still turned heads, even if those were not the heads she wished to be turned in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince time was a resource she had amply at her disposal, she started thinking the case. Were there really no connections between the three mares other than the obvious ones of age, sex, and looks one could objectively describe as attractive? The little file Nox had given her to read hadn\u2019t included much information about them, save their professions (a student, a cook, and a gardener) addresses (all around the city) and pictures (attractive, like said). None of them were particularly rich. Perhaps the kidnapper knew this, which explained the lack of ransom demands. That lead to the question, what other reason there was to kidnap them. If they were indeed kidnapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother strange thing about the case was how it had been handled by Sergeant Nox. Why would he choose to vest such a puzzle to a mere cadet, for whom common street patrolling represented novelty? Granted, she had chosen the case herself, but this wasn\u2019t what she had had in mind then. All and all, the more Moon thought about her current predicament, the more reasons she could find not to like it one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmersed in her thoughts, Moon utterly failed to pay attention to the road, which resulted to a collision. An umbrella dropped, which she hurried to pick up. \u201cOh, sorry,\u201d she said, hoofing the parasol back to the pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all well, dear,\u201d said the stranger: a mare in her fifties, dressed in a long, laced gown stretching all the way to the ground. Moon couldn\u2019t vouch for the impression, but she fancied recognizing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadame Rune, I am,\u201d said the Madame, reading the question from her lips. A shade of foreign accent shined through her low, delicate voice; a hint of Saddle-Arabia, if Moon was any judge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce blinked. Then the revelation struck her from the back of her mind. \u201cOf course: Madame Rune! Sorry, I didn\u2019t recognize you at first without your costume on. I loved your show, I really did! It wasn\u2019t like anything I had seen before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere there,\u201d the Madame said, tapping the side of her shoe with the tip of the umbrella. \u201cIt\u2019s not me your awe should be due, but the powers I merely serve. And if you liked it so much, please, do come again tomorrow, with a friend if you will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will, certainly,\u201d lied Moonbounce. For the first time she looked at the other, younger mare accompanying Madame. A strange, faraway look occupied her face, as if she wasn\u2019t fully awake. \u201cAnother awestruck fan?\u201d Moon hazarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet us call it that,\u201d said the Madame. She took hold of the mare by the neck, guiding her along. \u201cGoodbye to you, dear. Hope to see you tomorrow. With a friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye,\u201d said Moon, watching the two press into the night, towards the direction of the circus. In her mind, duty nagged Moon to let them be and continue the patrolling. But another trait of hers, called suspicion, voiced its contrary opinion. Ordinary as the encounter had seemed on the surface, there was something disturbing about it \u2013 especially about the forlorn mare. She had almost seemed like one of the volunteers in Madame\u2019s circus show, which was to say, hypnotized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of different paths unfolded after that observation, all leading to conclusions wilder than the one before. If this wasn\u2019t her gut speaking, it probably couldn\u2019t talk in the first place. Moon simply had to follow the couple. There was something to be confirmed here, although what exactly that was eluded the clarity of a proposition. That\u2019d be the first thing she\u2019d get clear about: of what exactly she suspected Madame guilty of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of every shadow, Moonbounce tracked Madame and her escort from a safe distance. Like her initial hunch had predicted, they were heading towards the tent. At the doors Madame glanced around the clearing, as if checking nopony saw them, and then they walked in. Now that was odd, indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was, what to do about it? Should she sneak into the tent too? Or perhaps seek out Nox, let him know what was going on. Both paths had their merits, their downsides. Either she\u2019d ridicule herself in the eyes of the Sergeant or she\u2019d plunge alone into possibly very real danger. And as so often before, time was not on her side.</span></div></div>",

She had to be saved now, not in the distant future, even if that meant putting her own life on the line. That\u2019s what being a guardspony was all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGliding to the tent door, she peeked inside. Seeing nothing, she slipped in, crouching by the ticket booth. Nopony jumped on her, which she took for a good sign. Still, the silent gloom was pregnant with possibilities. Anything could happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in the tent, hoofsteps started their steady pacing: two ponies, if her ears were any good. Raising her head, Moonbounce saw two figures moving further away over the arena. Those had to be Madame and the victim. She\u2019d have to make an intervention of some sort. A key element in that would be to disarm the Madame of the weapon Moon knew she wielded: her parasol, which could be used to hypnotize a pony over a distance in seconds. She had to get close enough to snatch it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere seemed to be only one way to it inside the tent. She\u2019d have to circle around the rows of benches, meet Madame on the back entrance and surprise her. To that purpose, Moon set off, laying as low as she could while going as fast as she could. Thus she did not quite have the mind to watch out for the suspiciously waving canvas past which she skittered. Only when something big bulged out of it right before her did she notice the danger, albeit too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran straight to the appendage, which gripped her almost like a limb. Inside the canvas, something gripped her, pressing her against the iron bars which the fabric had been covering. Voice muffled, she still made a lot of noise while being squeezed through the barely wide enough gap. Her wings almost got crushed in the process, which ended with her tangled inside the canvas, kicking and screaming. She fought her way out, then wished she hadn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dim of the cage, a manticore the size of a cart growled at her. The scorpion tail hung over the beast, swinging heavily from side to side. Paws ending in vicious claws scraped the steel floor. The demonic head, made up mostly of a massive mouth it seemed, inched closer to her. Teeth clattering, Moon retreated deeper into the canvas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-g-good kitty?\u201d she tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not good enough. The manticore roared, then lunged at her, mouth agape. Moonbounce got out one scream before the jaws clamped on her upper body, shaking it violently from side to side. Her torso was that close of breaking in half, the teeth like knives digging into her body from several points. Her spine in splinters, she coughed blood into the feline\u2019s mouth, then died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manticore chewed the thestral a couple of times, then tossed her into the air, only to catch her by the ass this time. In a series of quick swallows, it devoured the mare all the way to her shoulders and beyond, until only her bloody face could be seen peeking from the gullet of the cat. A sparse number of swallows sufficed for the lump of meat to travel, as a single bulge, into the stomach, where the mare curled up into a solid ball of flesh. The manticore yawned, licked its chops clean of blood, then retreated back to its pen to digest the little pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, the beastmaster of the circus happened to be by cleaning the hydra\u2019s cage when he noticed the manticore get up, crouch and defecate a generous load. Since monitoring the metabolism and health of the animals was one of his tasks, he went over the feces, prodding them to look for abnormalities. In some other circus, these would have included a few rib bones, a dark ball of fur, a pony skull, four pairs of hooves, leathery bits and mostly digested ruins of a miniskirt. But in this roadshow, those were treated like any other dung, and discarded to manure the local grass.</span></div></div>",

In this instant that authority went under the name of Sergeant Nox; ergo she should seek him out ASAP. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was easier said than done, though. They had not agreed on any way to contact each other in a case of emergency, which in hindsight seemed like a decisive operational shortcoming. Nevertheless, Moon set out finding the Sergeant, first heading towards the backstage of the tent. It was where he had said he\u2019d start his investigations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe backside of the tent had a sturdy, tall fence around it to keep wandering audience members out. A few red and yellow triangles had been nailed on it, warning against trespassing \u201con pain of pain\u201d. It was nothing her wings and courage couldn\u2019t circumvent. If she was caught, she could always fall back on the cover of her kneesock-induced innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after landing it dawned on Moonbounce what a maze the backstage was. Cages, pillars of crates, piles of rope, wagons and carts had been packed in the fenced area in apparently arbitrary order, creating twisting paths and narrow alleys in their scores. It was an ideal site to sneak around, but also excellent for getting caught with one\u2019s pants down. Not that she wore any, but extreme caution would have to be her cue from now on nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuided by pale moonlight, Moonbounce navigated deeper into the compound. After a while of listening only her own breathing, she caught trace of a hushed conversation. Standing in centre of a clearing, three ponies stood, talking. One had lit a cigar, the red end pulsing in the dark like a living being. Try as she did, Moon could not hear what they were saying, and she couldn\u2019t get any closer without risking exposure. Was the gamble worth it?</span></div></div>",

It seemed empty, so she headed onwards. But suddenly, quick steps approached her. The echoes made it difficult to tell the direction of the noise, and the gushing panic was not helping. The steps came from both ends of the corridor now, it seemed. She didn\u2019t dare to fly out; somepony would surely see her then. Then she spotted a hole in the wall of crates, barely wide enough to let her squeeze in. Should she go for it, or hold her ground come what may?</span></div></div>",

As estimated, it was a snug fit, but fit it did, although her meaty rump grinded against the rough wood badly enough to tear her miniskirt. The passage widened shortly after the mouth, however, so she crawled further, desperate to escape notice. She could swear she heard the steps stop right on the entrance of the hole, the beam of flashlights already tickling her bum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweaty and scraped, she eventually got onto the other side of the tunnel. She rolled on the sand, panting as hard as she dared, listening if anypony approached her. None did, as far as she could hear. Instead, she came to acknowledge that something was already there with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked into the gloom. Iron wire fence lined the small cage, harboring half a dozen little houses. In front of each there was a food bowl, with names like \u201cSpot\u201d, \u201cScratchy\u201d and \u201cWoof\u201d inscribed in them. All this was clue enough that she had stumbled into a dog pen. The strongest evidence of the fact were of course the six lean, big, black-brown dogs, all looking at her with dark, gleaming eyes. At the same moment, it occurred to her the food bowls were all empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood doggie?\u201d she squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one, the Dobermans attacked. That\u2019s how they had been trained to treat intruders, after all. For them, a plump, slightly bleeding mare was more than an adequate addition for the raw meat their daily diet consisted of. And like all predators, the dogs preferred their dinner resisting anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce did not adopt her new role without objections, however incoherent or futile those happened to be. Bare reality spoke for itself though, and the six killing machines put a quick end to her screams. The first hound closed its jaw around her throat, the next around her face, and the rest on whichever part of her they thought was the tastiest. Her pudgy flanks and thighs proved to be especially desired, inciting some bickering in the lower hierarchy of the pack. While meat was efficiently scoured from her legs and torso, the alpha male on her throat shook its head violently, tearing a mighty chunk out before starting on the thick shoulders of the mare. The alpha female, ravaging the pony\u2019s face so that bare bone already shined through at several places, sank its teeth into the prey\u2019s neck. After that, a steady chorus of gulps, swallows and chews ensued as Moonbounce was gradually distributed evenly into six starving canine bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome the dawn, the circus\u2019s dog keeper was stunned to find that the usually ravenous hounds would barely touch the food he delivered them, choosing rather to extend their sleep by basking in the sun, round stomachs gurgling happily. Only the bitch, which he knew was expecting a litter, bothered to treat itself to the meat, abandoning the thick femur she had been gnawing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile feeding, the bitch suddenly started retching. For a moment the keeper was afraid the animal had swallowed a bone, but then it threw up, clearing its throat and resuming  to eat. Glancing at the vomit, the keeper noticed the second peculiar thing of the morning. It appeared as if there was a piece of half-digested garment sticking from the mess; a piece of something knitted, maybe a sock, with a faded image of a bat on the side.</span></div></div>",

Thus she detached from the side of the crates against which she had pressed herself and prepared to meet her pursuers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened as she noticed those composed of a single pony: Sergeant Nox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSergeant!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWhat are you\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quieted down as Nox cut the air over his throat sharply with a hoof. Looking both up and down the aisle, he pulled Moon into the shadow of an indentation where they couldn\u2019t be spotted so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCadet,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI saw you sneaking here. What in the name of Luna do you think you\u2019re doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Moon started, still shocked by the turn of events. \u201cI came to find you, Sergeant. Listen, I have something important to tell you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave her short report about Madame Rune, her companion, and the suspicion she harbored about the incident. Nox listened without interrupting neither his silence nor his stare directed into the depths of her pupils. Moon could not decide which had a more disquieting effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you came?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause you bumped into an old lady on the street?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear, that\u2019s not all of it,\u201d pressed Moon. \u201cThe young mare, she looked just like the volunteers in the tent: hypnotized. You know how easily Madame can do it. A roll of her umbrella and she had the ponies acting like chickens! And she had her umbrella along with her, even though there hasn\u2019t been a hint of rain for days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox kept eyeing her mutely. \u201cAnd you saw them enter the tent just now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox pulled back, once again looking in both directions of the corridor. He remained silent for a thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to admit, that\u2019s more than what I\u2019ve managed to gather so far. This place is a mess. You could hide a whole town worth of ponies in here without breaking a sweat.\u201d He looked Moon in the eyes again. \u201cSo, how would you proceed from here, cadet?\u201d</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t everyday a Sergeant asked advice from a Cadet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox nodded. \u201cMakes sense. Keep up that way and you\u2019ll make a fine corporal in no time, Moon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost blushed. \u201cUh, thank you. Sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, follow me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve spent enough time here to have learned the place inside and out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Nox\u2019s lead, they made it back to the clearing where the three ponies had been talking. It was empty now, but the backdoor exit to the tent lay all but unguarded. Glancing at each other for one final confirmation, the two guardsponies headed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside everything seemed to be like during the show, only darker. Lone ropes swayed from the ceiling, stirred by the wind that blew in from the hole at the top. At the centre, tiny waves lapped the edges of a big water pool. A sense of expectation hung heavily in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did they go?\u201d asked Moon. \u201cCould they have left already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Nox. He nodded at the other side of the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon followed the direction. Behind a large curtain, something awoke waves in the canvas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou take that side,\u201d said Nox. \u201cI\u2019ll take this one. We\u2019ll meet on the other side. Be careful,\u201d he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two started the circle simultaneously, using the cover of the seats. Moon kept viewing, in turns, the flapping curtain and the Sergeant, whose head bobbed between the rows now and then. She felt time slowing down; her heartbeat clogging her ears; the cold sweat breaking through her skin. She was close now, so very close. The curtain had stopped moving. She could not see Nox anymore. She waited for something to happen. Nothing did. Eventually, she could not help herself anymore, but walked to the curtain and peeked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roar of the manticore struck her like a sledgehammer. Knocked back, ears ringing, she fell onto her back, the heart stuck in her throat paralyzing her body. Somepony ran towards her, she realized, shouting her name. Her head turned sideways. It was Nox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMoon!\u201d he shouted, kneeling next to her. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Moonbounce could stutter her mostly affirmative response, they were both seized by a voice carrying over the growling of the manticore. Stepping from behind the cage the curtain had covered, Madame Rune appeared, her umbrella waving back and forth before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we have, what exactly?\u201d she said while elegantly crossing the sand between them. \u201cSpeak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox stood up. \u201cI think it will be you, Madame, who\u2019ll do most of the speaking from now on.\u201d Fishing into his pocket, he flashed her his badge. \u201cSergeant Nox, Lunar Guard. What the hay is going on in this circus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame stopped walking but not smiling. \u201cGuardsponies. How lovely. On the case of the disappearances, I assume? Why, the circus has already done everything in its power to help the officials there. Lack of faith it shows, you trespassing into private property like thieves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have sufficient reason to doubt your integrity,\u201d said Nox. \u201cEarlier this evening you were seeing entering this tent with a young mare, possibly against her will. I demand you show us where she is. Right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame pursed her full lips. \u201cDemands. Such nerve.\u201d With surprising dexterity, she flipped the umbrella open right before the Sergeant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNox, no!\u201d shouted Moon, but too late. The Madame whirled the cane, and the octagon exploded into a whirlpool of color and form, gravitating around an unmoving, fixed centre. Moon shielded her eyes with a hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, the umbrella closed. At the same moment, Sergeant Nox dropped his badge. Narrowing her eyes, Moon gasped at the sight of his face, now clouded beyond presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSergeant Nox,\u201d said the clear voice of Madame. \u201cArrest the pony by your side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d shouted Moon as Nox, without a moment\u2019s pause, grabbed her. She tried to fight back, but laying on the ground she could not muster enough strength against the stallion. In any case, she would\u2019ve had to hurt him, which she couldn\u2019t make herself do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bastard!\u201d spat Moon as Nox pinned her to the ground. \u201cYou manipulating, deceitful hag! We are officers of the Guard! You can\u2019t do this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame rolled her painted eyes. \u201cDear, you really should have stayed in the audience, not enter the show. You have no sense of drama, not one bit. You don\u2019t even have the sense to beg. Not yet, at least. I\u2019ll let you have your free will for now just for that: to see if we can persuade some humility into your thick bat skull.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do to us?\u201d said Moon, less fiercely. The unshaken confidence of the Madame unnerved her, although she\u2019d rather die than show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d said the Madame. \u201cSergeant: bring her along. The night grows old, yet there is so much to do yet. So much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox yanked Moon up roughly, then dragged her after Madame. \u201cNox, listen to me,\u201d whispered Moonbounce. \u201cYou don't have to listen to her. You\u2019re not yourself. Please, you\u2019re hurting me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox did not even glance at her. Moon hadn\u2019t known him that long, but seeing him reduced to such a state of slavishness was not just revolting; it was infuriatingly wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear, you\u2019ll pay for this,\u201d she seethed as they halted before another covered cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d said Madame absentmindedly. \u201cTie her down, Sergeant. That chair will do, and there\u2019s rope over there. Good, thick knots, yes. Now, come here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFettered to a chair, Moon could only watch as Nox stopped in front of the canvas. Behind, something moved. Ordered by Madame, he pulled the cover aside, revealing the many-headed hydra they had seen do tricks in the show. Back then, the dangerous beast had offered nothing entertainment. Now, the scores of eyes studying her and Nox arose nothing but dread in Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, what are you planning?\u201d she asked, already afraid of the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame threw a bored look at her over a shoulder. \u201cWhat do you think, dear? Feed the thing, of course. Sergeant: listen to me carefully. Hydras can be very particular about their diet, even while starving. If we don\u2019t make you tasty first, it\u2019ll just spit you back after a while. First, take off your clothes; those cause nothing but indigestion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d cried Moon, the panic mixed with disbelief in her voice. \u201cYou can\u2019t feed a living pony to that thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Madame as Nox lost his suit. \u201cNow, pour that bucket of spiced oil over you. Yes, rub it everywhere thoroughly. Drink some, while you\u2019re at it. Ah, that should do it. Here\u2019s the key: open the gate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this where all the other ponies disappeared too?! cried Moon. \u201cDown the gullet of the hydra?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? Oh no, no, Shi does not actually like pony meat all that much,\u201d said Madame dismissively. \u201cWe mostly feed him fish. But perhaps he\u2019ll like bat more, we shall see. The other ponies you speak of, they served\u2026 various purposes. Our circus is\u2026 one of a kind. It takes special measures to keep it in shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she spoke, Nox entered the cage and closed the door after him. The hydra surrounded him with snake-like necks ending in vicious, huge mouths blessed with more teeth than Moon cared to count. Shaking, she could not tear her eyes off the scene, although she knew it would only end in bloodshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSergeant,\u201d called the monotonous tenor of Madame. \u201cA long day drags behind you, and come home all you desire is rest. You\u2019ll find that by your beautiful wife, who's already waiting for you in the bed. All you have to do to meet her is climb through a short tunnel. It\u2019s a bit wet, the children have been playing with water balls again. Never mind that. Oh, and when you hear me counting to three, you\u2019ll wake up. Bon voyage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin on his face that almost made Moonbounce retch, the Sergeant leaned towards the closest opened maw and stuck his head inside. But unlike what Moon had been expecting, the jaws did not immediately clamp down. The poor pony did most of the work himself, digging deeper into the gullet. It was just like in the show, except now it was all real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce his shoulders had slipped into the slick tunnel, the hydra lifted the head and pony into the air. The long neck stretched out vertically, and the stallion practically plumaged in, his figure forming a recognizable bulge as it dived down in one seamless motion, lubricated by the oil. Roughly at the same time, all the dozen or so heads licked their chops, a satisfied expression beaming from each reptile face. Entering the bulk of the beast, Nox the lump gradually vanished from view, only to reappear again as a slightly less conspicuous bump between the hydra\u2019s legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now, my dear, comes your turn,\u201d said Madame, turning fully to the stunned Moonbounce. \u201cOption one: I count to three and thus bless our friend Nox with the experience of being digested alive. This might well take hours. A dozen heads will swallow as much air as the others can burp out, and since Shi\u2019s stomach hasn\u2019t accustomed to such tough food as the Sergeant, it will take a while before he\u2019ll break down completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the second option?\u201d managed Moon, a lone tear on her cheek condensing the roil of emotions in her soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Madame licked her lips. \u201cHmm, I suppose you\u2019d have to halt my tongue from counting to three by digressing my thoughts\u2026 mayhaps with tongue of your own?\u201d She brushed her hind legs together, rubbing the black lace between her thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing full well both the stake and the price for it, Moon made her choice.</span></div></div>",

After that, her features grew more serious. Clearly and unmistakably, she enunciated: \u201cOne!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon kept staring at her, unmoved. \u201cThat\u2019s as far as you can count, bitch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust do it!\u201d Moon screamed. \u201cDo it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you truly certain?\u201d queried Madame. \u201cAfter this, there is no turning back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce spat at her, missing her feets by a few inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, nothing happened. Then the movements in the belly of the hydra turned more restless. Imprint of a hoof pressed against the scales, followed by another. Moon could pick out muffled speech coming from the stomach, which by now sloshed loudly. More hoofprints emerged, then the contour of a face; a scream, subdued by layers of fat, scales and sinew. It was when the stomach quivered violently that the hydra let out a vexed groan, pushing the belly with a clawed foot. This only incited more thrashing and screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a shame,\u201d said Madame. \u201cI think Shi actually liked him. We\u2019ll see how long he lasts before throwing him up. The burns will have eroded much of his skin at that point, so he might spit out just a mess of entrails, bones, hooves and hair. Then again, he might still be alive, his eyes, ears, and most other nerves exposed. I hope you\u2019re happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoll over and die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHead tilted, a glint lit in Madame\u2019s bright green eyes while she studied the thestral. A rhythmic tapping of the umbrella joined the incessant gurgling, screaming and thumping coming from the hydra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, our circus contains many wonders of this world, but so far we\u2019ve never had a thestral join our ranks. Come to think of it, can\u2019t think of why that is. You have fire in you. Some of it\u2019s just youthness, that is ignorance, but the rest\u2026 I cannot say. You\u2019ve aroused my curiosity \u2013 a tall order nowadays. What do you say: have you ever considered joining a circus?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The sharp point approached her face, which she kept still as stone. And then it simply pecked her on the forehead. Few seconds later, she fell all limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slave to style, Madame blew the tip of the parasol clean. The little poison she carried there could knock out a raging bull. The thestral would wake up with the headache of her life and with her recent memories wiped clean. By the time the Guard would connect her amnesia and the absence of Nox to the circus, it would be well on its way to the mountains, out of the reach of pointed questions.

You do not want to know what happens if you don\u2019t mind the teeth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon yelped as her chair was kicked back. Lying on her back, the sobs turned into mute freight as Madame walked around her, then lifted her skirt out of the way of her bottom, now all exposed for Moon to behold. Generous, pouty lips of the mare\u2019s pussy winked at her, already moist with juices. Like some ancient beast from the depths, it eclipsed her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time Moonbounce had gone down south on another mare. But she had been safely drunk then, and more importantly not tied to a chair. Thus her first attempts remained timid, experimenting. She suckled the puffy lips, lapped at the swollen clit, attentive to the reactions her efforts incited. Madame hummed from time to time, yet refrained from explicit instructions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the flourishing scent of her arousal, Moon deduced she was doing at least something right. She kept her tongue busy, minding the teeth, and immersed into the pussy as best as she could from the awkward position. As a reward, strong juices flowed into her mouth and face, matting her fur. Stretching her neck a bit, she could reach her ample tits, the nipples of which she sucked eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Madame decided to end the foreplay. In one fluid motion, she crammed her cunt at the younger mare\u2019s face. The high-pitched yelp mixed with the slurp of her labia spreading over the pony\u2019s muzzle. Madame moaned deeply, fixed her position, and lowered down more, sucking the top of Moon\u2019s head inside her. It felt amazing, being stuffed so full down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce had lost all clue as of what was going on. Her world consisted now of mare\u2019s cum flooding her nostrils, mouth and eyes. Her forehead sank into the folds of warm flesh effortlessly, barley causing pressure to form, as if she was being pushed through a honeypot. As her neck met the rim of the pussy, her head entered a larger cavity, where she could at least gasp for breath. In rising panic she wasted most of it in futile screaming and sobbing though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fine blush colored Madame\u2019s cheeks while the head of the batpony popped into her womb. Rubbing her abdomen with a hoof, she could feel her struggles inside, sense her sobbing resonating within. She simply had to get all of the mare inside her as quickly as possible. To ease the absorption, she fell onto her flank, upper hind leg raised, and began stuffing the mare\u2019s shoulders in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore of Moon crammed into the humid, incredibly wet pussy. It was starting to get real cramped here. The worst thing, however, were the lucid groans of Madame which she felt reverberating all around her, trembling the jelly-like flesh enveloping her. From the distant outside, cracks of wood echoed, and she knew Madame was breaking the chair around her to get the rest of her engulfed. While her lower body became released, a final hope lit in her tortured mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame actually stopped her suction just to enjoy the bliss the thrashing of the little bat produced. With moans that almost turned to screams she watched the lower stomach of the mare wave, her hind legs kick the air madly, and her tail and wings slash at the floor. The show didn\u2019t last long though, like Madame suspected. All that wavering must\u2019ve been so exhausting on lungs already short of oxygen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon\u2019s last desperate efforts melted into hopeless crying. After the momentary pause, she got sucked in up to her pelvis in record time. There again came a halt, the reason of which she soon figured out as Madame started playing with, not only her own clit, but with Moon\u2019s too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame cummed several times, teasing pleasure both directly from herself and indirectly from the mare within by playing with her pussy, rubbing and clopping her adoringly. Moon could not help but writhe in pleasure and agony. Dazed by lust, Madame almost ended up summoning Steer Clear, her trusted lover, to come and share this wonderful creature with her. It would be a sight indeed, have him pound the little mare stuck in her pussy, jamming her deeper with every thrust. But in the end, there was no way Madame could postpone the inevitable any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving one more playful slap at Moon\u2019s clit, Madame sucked the rest of the thestral inside in quick order. The dark tail vanished with a mere slurp; the hooves with a messy squelch; the tips of her wings with a few wet flaps. After that she just panted on her side, idly rubbing her clit the size of a cherry. Her pussy was actually so full the outer lips would not close properly, and one could see a struggling ball of darkish, slimy fur, wings, hooves and even the occasional eye peeking from the inside, forever shifting round, unable to find peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame knew to enjoy the sensation as long as it lasted. By the next morning her magically altered womb would have drained whatever life it could out of the mare, thus extending her own endurance beyond natural capacities. In a slightly less divine process, she\u2019d expel the batpony, by then reduced to a fleshless, juiceless, utterly lifeless leather sack of bones and shrivelled organs not even the circus\u2019s dogs would touch. The slimy husk could be conveniently buried in the park, Madame decided, right before drifting off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

I saw light inside. That\u2019s weird, considering all the others have accommodated in the park.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 what about Madame and the tent?\u201d tried Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe later.

Resting against the fence\u2019s corner, the magician\u2019s blue-and-yellow wagon stood. It definitely looked like somepony was inside. A puff of smoke rose from the chimney, and light glowed through the drawn curtains. Aside from those, there was nothing suspicious going on, which Moon felt she should mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy gut says that place is worth a look,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThe problem is how to get in\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe she just thought to spend the night alone,\u201d hypothesized Moon. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s one of the quiet types.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCadet, I\u2019m growing weary of your friction,\u201d said Nox, frowning in deep thought.

As he knocked on the door, she immediately raised her head, pressing her muzzle to the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the slit between the curtains, a unicorn in glasses looked back at her. Something flashed, and Moonbounce started to feel\u2026 weird. It started with her vision. The world suddenly looked a lot larger, enlarging more with speed. Then it occurred to her that it wasn\u2019t the world that grew, but she who shrinked. She screamed, but her voice was but a whine of an insect now, utterly unheard by anything bigger than a mouse. She fell, disoriented by the sudden change of scale. The window pane looked longer than Canterlot's main avenue; the window itself like the sky; the ground below kilometers away. When she finally got her wings working, she was looking the world from the perspective of a parasprite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened to me? she thought in horror. It had to have something to do with the flash behind the window. Had the magician cast a spell on her? Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the reason, she had to find a way to fix this. Peering into the darkness, she could just about see a gigantic form in the far distance. That had to be Nox. If she could only get to attract his attention\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she flew head on towards the Sergeant, she failed to take into account possible perils of her new world, such as those represented by spider webs. Like a fly she hit right in the middle of the fine strings, stuck tight at once. The more she struggled the more ensnared she became, and the more interested in her the spider got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlerted by a sudden sense of dread, Moonbounce looked up. A runaway from her nightmares, the spider scuttled towards her with all eight legs, the pincers of its mouth snapping. Moonbounce did not scream, didn\u2019t bat an eye. Terror held her heart in a freezing grip, and squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe regained some control when the spider was on her. The long legs picked her up easily from the web, handling her like any other fly. She kicked, bit and screamed from the bottom of her lungs, up until the spider\u2019s fangs sank into her fleshy ass. The sting hurt like hell, but the numbness that spread over her was more terrifying still. Even her mouth and eyes would fall limp as the paralysis took hold of her. Now free to handle its prey however it desired, the spider resumed by wrapping her in thick web, layer after layer, up till only a tip of her tail remained outside. The cocoon the arachnoid carried to its rightful place, next to the other catches of the evening. And then all it had to do, and all that Moon could do, was to wait for it to become hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs is usual with spiders, this didn\u2019t take long. Moonbounce, immobilized as ever, listened with bated breath as the spider came at her again. The sting hit her rump, but this time she was pumped full of some other substance. Very soon, her insides started feeling a lot looser than before. The spider\u2019s mouth closed on the wound, and unmistakable slurping sound carriying to her ears. The monster, having liquefied her organs, was drinking them through her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider glugged, gluggled and glugged, all the while Moon\u2019s train of thought blurred. A void, empty sensation gained foothold within her. Her outer form too suffered from dissolution, caving in and mixing with the corrosive goo her body quickly turned into. When the spider started slurping her spine like a long noodle, the mare\u2019s mind fell blank. The spider finished whatever pieces she liked about this new insect, which was almost everything. In the end, only four hooves, some hair and bones remained in the cocoon, the rest of Moonbounce the soup sloshing inside the spider\u2019s gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor inexplicable reasons, days afterwards the spider fancied to weave patterns resembling bats onto its webs.</span></div></div>",

It seemed like simple enough of a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the wagon door, Moonbounce could not help but feel nervous. Out of the corner of her eye she saw Nox getting into position under the window at the end of the wagon. It\u2019d be just a quick peek, right? She wouldn't need to sound credible, just\u2026 long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knocked on the door, thrice. Nothing happened for a while. She was about to knock again, but somepony tapped her on the shoulder from behind, making her jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked a mare unicorn dressed in a long gown and wearing thick glasses. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the hay did you get there?\u201d blurted Moon. \u201cI swear, I didn\u2019t hear a thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pony tapped the horn protruding from amidst her raven black mane. \u201cI\u2019m the magician. You came to see me so you should know that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d laughed Moon tensely. \u201cOf course I know that. You just surprised me. Heh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magician\u2019s expression told her she still expected an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm,\u201d started Moon. \u201cYou see, I was watching the show today, and\u2026 well, I just loved it so much! The tricks you did with that closet were breathtaking; I became an instant fan. Soo I was thinking, maybe you could bother to write me an autograph\u2026?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d the magician pressed. \u201cThis area is off limits for audience. Did you break in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d burst Moon. \u201cI, uh, I have a friend in the circus. He let me in. I know, I know, I shouldn\u2019t have, but I really wanted that autograph, see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magician\u2019s eyebrows plummeted. Then her horn lit up black (that was how Moon would have described it) and a piece of paper and a pen materialized between them. She scribbled something there quickly, a few lines and curves, then tucked the thing to Moon\u2019s chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow leave,\u201d she said, pushing her way back into the wagon and slamming the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon did not need to be told twice. She galloped back to the shelter where she and Nox had hatched their plan, and stayed there to wait. She waited, but he didn\u2019t come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s up with him? Moon thought in dismay. Surely she had bought him enough time, even if she hadn\u2019t waited for the signal. So where was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moon trailed across the cloudless sky, and Moon was getting really, really worried. She couldn\u2019t wait here until morning, but neither could she just leave: that\u2019d be violating orders. Biting her claws to ruins, she understood that the only choice she had was to return to the magician\u2019s wagon, to see if Nox was still, somehow, there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started by crawling under the window. Sure enough, there were footprints there. So Nox had gotten this far, like she knew. Had he flown away? Without telling her? It seemed unlikely. Then the idea creeped on her: could he somehow be inside the wagon? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike all the other windows of the moving house, curtains covered this one too, but not completely. There was a gap, however small. Nox must\u2019ve peered through it; she could see the faint stain of crease in the window. Gathering her courage, Moon followed in suite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no movement but the flickering light of some kind of a crystal. In the halo that painted everything darkish-blue, she saw rows of glass bottles on shelves, a table filled with books and paper, a narrow bed, a stove, and a rack for clothes. The big closet was there too. What attracted most of her interest were the glass bottles. In the twinkle of the mad light it was hard to tell, but it almost appeared as if some things moved within them. Squinting her eyes, in one illuminating turn of the crystal, she saw what they were. Or rather, who they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later she had stepped inside, regardless of the messages her primal instincts were sending down her spine. There was no sign of the magician, which was what worried her the most. Moon was about to grab the bottles and fly for her life, but just then the closet chose to start making sounds as if it was about to sneeze. The door creaked open, somepony stepping out. Moon had half a heartbeat time to decide what to do.</span></div></div>",

But on the yard, her every muscle suddenly grew stiff as a plank, a thin, black halo surrounding her completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould\u2019ve known better than to try and run from a unicorn, you,\u201d said the magician, walking casually before her. She studied her over her glasses for a moment, then appeared to come to a decision. \u201cSo you were working with that other fellow after all. I couldn\u2019t be sure the first time, but since you\u2019ve insisted to cross my path again, I see no other choice but to treat you as I did him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shudder passed over Moon, or would have if her body would\u2019ve been able to muster a shudder in her current condition. As the blackness around the magician\u2019s horn intensified, she started feeling\u2026 weird. It started with her vision; the world suddenly looked a lot larger, enlarging more with speed. Of course, since she had seen what those glass bottles contained, she already knew it was not the world that grew bigger, but she who shrinked smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Moon was but an inch tall, the magician lifted her still rigid body for closer inspection. Her now enormous glasses glinted in the moonlight. \u201cNever ate a thestral before. I wonder if you\u2019ll taste like apples. I\u2019ve no idea why you would. How odd.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she opened her mouth wide and dropped Moonbounce right in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment she splatted on the wet, soft tongue she could move again, but at that point it did her no good. The huge tongue rolled over like a tidal wave, taking her flailing and screaming body along and plunging it into the esophagus. Saliva stuck to her wings, making them useless. Not that she could\u2019ve flown in the tight, undulating throat to begin with. A moderate bulge could be seen outside as Moonbounce dived in, aided by gravity and strong muscles. The magician let out a pleased sigh, then trotted into her wagon to continue her research.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Moonbounce\u2019s trip in complete darkness and horrible, acidic smell ended in another short drop and a splash. She sank into the stomach fluids, surfaced gasping and looked around in flaming panic. She still couldn\u2019t see a thing. She could feel plenty though; the tingling, irritating itch of the acids seeping into her fur. The fluid was deep enough and sloshed tumultuously enough that she couldn\u2019t swim, or hardly even stay afloat. She was about to go under for good when something vaguely solid bumped into her. She wrapped around the object as best as she could, and although it kept losing bits and pieces, it at least kept her alive, whatever it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it dawned on her she was grasping onto Sergeant Nox\u2019s half-digested corpse, she retched. But she still held onto him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter some thirty minutes, which to Moon felt more like thirty hours, Moon could not feel her legs anymore, or most of her lower body. That was a blessing, for towards the end the pain had almost made her pass out. Her pussy, eaten raw from inside and outside, had caused the worst agony she could imagine. Nox was hardly solid anymore. It would not be long anymore that she wasn\u2019t, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something rumbled above her. Moon didn\u2019t turn to see, for she had no strength left, and in any case it was still pitch black. Then something pushed itself through the stomach\u2019s opening, hit the gastric lake near Moon and caused a roll that finally took her under the surface. There she fought for the few seconds she could before finally giving up and drowning in the acids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her wagon, the magician tossed another peanut into her maw, swallowing it whole. A light burp travelled up her throat, tasting \u2013 surprisingly \u2013 a bit like an apple.</span></div></div>",

The mare was caught between the heavy door and the frame, letting out a shrill scream. Moon glimpsed her horn lighting up. So she rammed the door on her again, again, again, again and again until there was not a twinkle left. Then she rested her back against the closet, slowly sliding on the floor, trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she felt like standing again, she checked the magician was really out of it. One didn\u2019t need a medical degree to confirm this was the case. Moon felt not a shade of pity for her. She had seen what she kept in her bottles. Speaking of which\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClueless of how else to proceed with a score of shrinked ponies trapped in jars, she very carefully packed them into a suitcase she found, apologizing all the while, then flew as fast and as steadily as she could out of the circus and into the barracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, half of the Celestial Guard raided the circus, rounded up all the employees and put them in jail for further investigations. Moonbounce was awarded with the highest medal of honor the Lunar Guard could supply, and also promoted a corporal. Sergeant Nox too was awarded for his sacrifice, for he was never found. Neither were two of the kidnapped ponies, of which only one had been among the glass bottles. Whatever happened to them remained a mystery that haunted Moonbounce for the rest of her life.</span></div></div>",

Her training had taught her that casual conversations among themselves was where criminals got the most careless with their words. Granted, she did not yet know these three had committed any felonies, but that was just a minor detail in her mind set on solving this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeploying all her stealth skills, Moon got behind a large cauldron which barely shielded her from the ponies. Should any of them take a step in the wrong direction, she\u2019d be revealed. But at least she could hear them clearly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three ponies turned out to be the clowns of the circus. It surprised Moon to notice they still had their makeup on, along with the colorful, oversized clothes. They didn\u2019t look nearly as hilarious as before though. The one smoking the cigarette in particular looked more like a gangster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s taking her so long?\u201d said one of them; a mare with unnaturally shrill voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeen quarter of an hour already,\u201d said the second: a fat stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third one only inhaled his cigar. Ash trickled on his bright, red shoes which might\u2019ve gone for a canoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBah, that\u2019s what you always say,\u201d screeched the mare. \u201cYou always take her side. Just \u2018cause you two banged once doesn\u2019t mean she cares a buck about your arse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore ash fell, in the way of carefully chosen syllables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, come on,\u201d squeaked the second stallion. \u201cShe\u2019s here any minute now, I\u2019m sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d said a new voice, which Moon, with a stifled gasp, recognized as Madame Rune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally,\u201d exclaimed the mare. \u201cGot caught by your umbrella on a streetlight, did ya?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere is the night\u2019s delivery,\u201d said Madame, ignoring the insult. Peeking behind the cauldron, Moon saw how the forlorn earth pony mare was pushed in middle of the clowns like some merchandise for inspection. All three eyed her critically for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy d\u2019you always pick the scrawny ones?\u201d complained the fat pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d agreed the mare. \u201cThis butt here: all bone.\u201d To make a point, she bit the mare\u2019s rump. The lean, compact flesh yielded but a skinny piece for her to wring loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoking clown grumbled, but for Moon it was unclear at whom this was directed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you a million times: it\u2019s not about the body, it\u2019s about the spirit,\u201d said Madame tiredly. \u201cAnd the one\u2019s I\u2019ve brought you are premium quality. Young, fresh and, most importantly, virgin. Can you imagine how hard it is to find those in this city nowadays? No, you can\u2019t, because it\u2019s always me who does all the hard work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, oh, that\u2019s what you think?\u201d shrieked the mare. \u201cEver tried to cook a pony, did ya? Ever wondered how long they oughta stew, what spices to use, or what firewood? Huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve no time nor patience for this,\u201d said Madame. \u201cI expect to get my share by tomorrow. Adieu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLousy nag,\u201d muttered the mare when Madame had left the site. The gangster snorted threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, you too?\u201d snapped the mare. \u201cWith what balls, I\u2019d like to know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, guys,\u201d cut in the chubby. \u201cPlease, cool down. Sure, Madame could appreciate our input a bit more, yeah? But maybe we should return the favour sometimes, hmm? Can you remember the last time we thanked her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud snort from the smoking pony ended her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d she conceded after mumbling something. \u201cWe gotta mare to cook. Quickly, get her into the pot before the hypnosis wears off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Moonbounce snapped from her seat in the audience back onto the stage. The fat pony was about catch her in his line of sight. She could not fight one against three. That left her with two options. She had to choose between trying to come up with the biggest lie of her life, or flee.</span></div></div>",

There\u2019s somepony here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon\u2019s mind raced for theories, stories and tales, none of which included the fact that she was a guardspony whose duty it would be to arrest all of them in the light of what she had heard. While the clowns gathered around her yapping, wondering and grumbling, a ghost of a believable lie flashed before her. Like a drowning pony, she grasped the end of the string.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, alright!\u201d she cried. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything! Please, please, just listen for a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpit it out!\u201d the mare shrilled, her voice like broken glass. The other two stared at her mutely and, Moon could swear, hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI work for Madame Rune,\u201d Moon explained. \u201cShe, she, uhm\u2026 She hired me to spy on you for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stunned silence followed. It was broken by a cracked scream of the mare: \u201cThat bitch! I\u2019ll skin her alive!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, Pin,\u201d said the fat one. \u201cJust hold on. Why would Madame want to spy us? She knows our ritual backwards and forwards \u2013 she\u2019s the one who taught it to us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe thought you were making a mess of it,\u201d said Moon hurriedly. \u201cShe told me to make sure you follow her instructions to the point. Please, I\u2019m just here for the money, I don\u2019t care anything what you do to ponies here. I can even tell Madame you did perfect job cooking that mare!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe always do perfect job with our ritual,\u201d said the fat pony slowly. A gleam of suspicion shined in his beady eyes as they scanned Moon\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know we do,\u201d said Pin. \u201cBut does Madame think that? No! She always has some pointy comment to make, like \u2018the texture is too soft\u2019 or \u2018the spirit has been watered down\u2019 or some other complete bullshit! I\u2019m telling you, Nip, this time she went too far!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNip cringed, turning to Pin. \u201cEh, come now, that\u2019s not fair. Madame has a demanding taste, I know, but don\u2019t you think you\u2019d had too if you were 200 years old? And look how much she has taught us already: without her we\u2019d still be just the \u2018Pin, Nip and Harold show\u2019, with our cream cakes, farts and bad jokes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d screamed Pin, her pupils the size of pins. \u201cWe owe that bitch nothing! She\u2019s the one who should be grateful to us, for all the free work we do for her! And now she\u2019s sending spies on us, afraid we\u2019ll mess her precious formula!\u201d Without warning, she lunged at Moon, grabbing her by the throat. \u201cI should cut yer dirty head off and shove it up her ass!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon didn\u2019t even get to gag properly when the mare was removed from her, thrown back by the kick of the pony whose name was, against all odds, bound to be Harold. The big stallion growled at Pin, the end of the cigarette burning red hot between his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bastard!\u201d wailed Pin, bouncing up like a rubber ball. \u201cI\u2019ll smack your head around for that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys!\u201d shouted Nip desperately. \u201cStop this! Listen, all we have to do is go to Madame and ask her if she really\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Moon\u2019s eternal relief, reason entered the argument a punch too late. With a bloodcurdling scream, Pin threw herself at Harold like a sparrow against a brick wall. However, this sparrow apparently had a hammer hidden somewhere in her overlarge skirt, which she did not hesitate to use on Harold\u2019s jaw. The big pony staggered back, swallowed his cigar, and charged at the mare like a bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, not again,\u201d griped Nip. That was all he could say before Moonbounce gave the back of his head a good whack with the biggest rock she could come by. The clown swayed for a second, then fell over like a tree. Pin and Harold didn\u2019t appear to notice, being too busy wrestling each other senseless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words \u201cGot to get out of this madhouse\u201d flamed within Moon\u2019s mind, but there was still one more thing she would have to do before that. Scrambling to the captured mare (who for the whole while had stood still like a statue), she gave a strong shake to her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey, you, snap out of it!\u201d she said in hushed hurry. \u201cThey\u2019re going to eat you, you hear me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-whah?\u201d the mare sputtered, blinking. \u201cWhere am I? What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain later,\u201d rushed Moon. The sounds of fighting were starting to die down. \u201dRight, there\u2019s only one answer needed: can you run?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes?\u201d answered the mare uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen run!\u201d shouted Moon right as she heard Pin ask, \u201cHey, what happened to Nip?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ran. Direction did not matter: speed did. Moon tried to vaguely follow the path she had entered the compound in, but at full speed it was no easy task. Besides, although the obstacles in the way were no problem for her wings, the still dizzy mare came dangerously close to tripping with every wrong step she took. Moon fought against the urge to abandon the poor mare, but if choosing that meant sparing herself from that cauldron, well\u2026 she could not vouch for her loyalty. Somewhere, dogs started barking. Shouts of \u201cGet them!\u201d rained from every side, it felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, on the worst moment possible, the mare tripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d she cried, hitting the dirt. She had stepped in a coil of rope, tangling her legs. Moon sorted that out with sweaty hooves, but when the mare announced that she had sprained an ankle, her heart fell. Behind her, breathing of a volcano caught her attention. She looked back: it was Harold. The huge stallion scraped the earth once, then charged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye, Moon made the choice she\u2019d have to life with for the rest of her life.</span></div></div>",

If Moon dugged or rose to her wings, the mare would get trampled. She could not let that happen. In other words, she would not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer leathery pinions unfolded, their black claws drinking moonlight. She could not stop the hulk, but maybe, just maybe she could derail him from his trajectory. Beyond that, she had no plan save trusting her instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inevitable impact was seconds away when, out of the blue, an umbra of something faster than wind cut the pony\u2019s path. Harold kept running for a moment more, carried by sheer momentum alone, and then he crashed down like meteorite, ploughing a path through dirt right next to Moon\u2019s feet. A steadily expanding pool of blood spread under him. Moon stared, secure in the knowledge she was dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the holdup, cadet?\u201d said a familiar voice above her. She looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d continued Nox. \u201cHelp that civilian up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNox?\u201d she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn flesh. Now move on, cadet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Moon obeyed, barely registering that she did, the sound of running feet and sharp barks reached them. From another direction, Pin arrived, surrounded by six mean-looking dogs. She looked once at the unmoving Harold, then at Moon, and finally at Nox. Then she screamed: \u201cGet \u2018em!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet her out of here!\u201d shouted Nox, sweeping down to meet the attacking dogs. Moon craved to join him, but the voice of the Sergeant spoke to her bones directly, and with strength that she didn\u2019t know she had, she lifted the mare to her back and started galloping. The last image she had of Sergeant Nox was him baiting the dogs from the very egde of safe distance, drawing their and Pin\u2019s rage all to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Moonbounce made it to the fence, she simply broke through with kicks, then helped the mare to the closest door. After making sure she had gotten safely inside, she zapped back to the backyard, adrenaline gushing in her veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered possibly the strangest battleground Canterlot had ever seen. Nox still clung to the air, although her hooves were bleeding from several scratches and one of her wings looked badly tattered. As if avoiding six jumping maw wasn\u2019t hard enough, Pin was hurling dangerously fast and accurate cupcakes at him, screaming all the while. It would not be long before the valiant Sergeant would catch one of them right between the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought made black foam spill from Moon\u2019s heart. Gliding down from the clouded side of moon, she dived at the clown, who noticed her right as Moon wanted her to. The cupcake Pin had been holding dropped lazily to the ground. A moment later she followed the example, a gushing wound traversing the length of her painted face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing that something had happened to their master, the dogs turned around. What they saw was a black silhouette against a dark sky flapping its wings above them, the stench of blood rushing forth from the apparition. It hissed at them once. It was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor a moment there I thought I was goner,\u201d said Nox, gliding by Moon while the dogs fled. \u201cGood work, cadet. Good work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon finally dared to breathe out. \u201cI can safely say the same. You arrived at the eleventh hour, Sarge. How did you find us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith the amount of noise you were making, it was a miracle I didn\u2019t find you sooner,\u201d he said with a toothy smile, which ended in a grimace. \u201cIn any case, I think the full story has to wait until the infirmary. The dogs proved to be more vicious than I had anticipated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they headed back to the barracks.</span></div></div>",

The choice was harsh, but she could not save both of them. This way, she could at least make sure her kidnappers would be served the justice they deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost above the fence, a high-velocity cupcake hit Moonbounce right between the eyes. She yelped, trying to wipe the sticky stuff out of her eyes, losing altitude as she did. Before she had properly regained her sight, a lasso cut the air from below her, capturing her leg. The rope tightened immediately, yanking the batpony from the sky. She banged painfully against a crate, her back crunching sickeningly. In chill, she found she couldn\u2019t move her hind legs anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most unpleasant laugh she had ever heard rang in her ears. Pin the clown walked to her, tossing a cupcake in her hooves. In her wake, half a dozen Dobermans followed, growling at Moonbounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got to grant it to you, you had me fooled for a minute there,\u201d said Pin, sitting on a crate. The dogs circled around the now whimpering Moon, sniffing and snapping at her. She expected to feel their teeth on her at any moment now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the end though, the clown always gets the last fooling,\u201d said Pin. Her lunatic gaze wandered on Moon\u2019s broken figure, noting specifically her more than suggestive attire. \u201cGuess you came here for more than just our little recipe. Thought maybe to put up some hanky panky with somepony? Tut tut. Such a naughty bat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy Luna,\u201d begged Moonbounce. \u201cI just got lost here! I didn\u2019t mean to intrude! Please, I\u2019m really hurt! I can\u2019t move my legs! Please, just let me go, I promise to keep quiet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, quiet\u2019s exactly what I don\u2019t want you to be,\u201d giggled Pin. She pursed her lips, let out a peculiar, high-pitched whistle. The dogs reacted immediately, halting their circling and nailing their hungry eyes at her. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing stuff, what you can teach a mongrel do. They can be such a joy on cold, lonely nights. Old Husky here is a real charmer, mind you \u2013 for sure doesn\u2019t keep me quiet! Here, let me show you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother whistle. Like a clockwork, the biggest dog moved behind the shivering Moonbounce and, to her horror, went on to mount her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor Luna\u2019s sake, no!\u201d she howled. \u201cPlease, please, please, anything but that, anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clown cared of her pleads even less than the dog did. The powerful hound flipped the hem of her miniskirt out of the way with its muzzle, turned her over a bit, then laid down on her back while the tip of the canine cock pressed against her entrance. The moment it slid in, her scream broke out, long and shrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I think he likes you!\u201d Pin cheered while the dog humped her rear enthusiastically. Moon gritted her teeth together, trying to shut her mind from the horrible experience. The dig slipped a bit farther her passage with every thrust, until finally it reached the knot. When it started to stretch the lips of her pussy, she started screaming again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, I think Spot wants his turn too,\u201d mused Pin. She gave another whistle, and before Moon knew it the pelvis of another dog obscured her view. A new, hard cock plunged into her, this time from up front. She could only glugg repeatedly while the big dog satisfied itself on her mouth, its furry balls slapping at her chin. Spitroasted by the muts, there was no hole lower on earth she could sink into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Moon\u2019s rear, Husky ended its fucking with a generous spurt of canine seed pumped into her raw, ravaged cunt. The large knot came off with an audible pop, but was soon replaced by another one as a third dog started from where the first one had left, filling her again with hot dick. A similar switch happened on her other end. She could not spit out all the cum flooding into her throat before another penis shoved the load right back, with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the pack\u2019s males had had their way with her, Moonbounce oozed cum, not only from her pussy and mouth, but from her nose and ass too. Semen mixed with tears on her face, her body all but worn out, even though all she had done was lay there helpless through it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnd of the line, then,\u201d Pin said. Before taking a mighty bite out of her cupcake, she let out one more whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was the bitch who was first on the line to enjoy Moonbounce\u2019s body. The hungry jaws closed on her rump, meriting an instant wail and a mouthful of delicious, moderately fat rump for the dog to tear free and wolf down before going for seconds. The rest of the dogs didn\u2019t falter either. Their appetite stoked by the mating, they tore the mare apart in short order, sending her down on her last trip to their waiting stomachs in dozens bite-size pieces. Moonbounce clung to life for the beginning of the meal, making inequine noises until Husky decided to see if her neck taste like apples. It didn\u2019t, but he swallowed it down regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay, meal\u2019s over,\u201d said Pin eventually, jumping down from the crate. The dogs whined, eager to start at the delicious organs and entrails they had just revealed from the corpse, or finish the cream-filled pussy any of them had barely touched yet. But Pin remained adamant, driving the dogs back to their pen while dragging the carcass behind her from the rope still caught in the mostly attached leg. There was no point leaving a delicious, plump pony like her all for the dogs, after all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Right or wrong, clever or dumb, Moonbounce turned her tail and ran. Or at least she tried to. It was rather hard, considering she had over a hundred kilos worth of pony standing on her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d the fat pony asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared to death, Moon tried to wrench free, but the two other clowns were on her like wolves. A brief and one-sided struggle later, she lay at their hooves, feet and wings tied. The famine in their eyes was real enough to make her sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn errant onlooker?\u201d suggested the fat clown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA sneaky thief?\u201d proposed the mare. They both looked at the gangster, who in response swallowed his cigar. This stirred some very disturbing smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait wait wait!\u201d cried Moonbounce as they lifted her up. \u201cI\u2019m a member of the Lunar Guard! I\u2019m here on duty, you can\u2019t hurt me! You\u2019ll get into immense trouble!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeel how plump she is,\u201d commented the fat clown, rubbing Moon\u2019s flank and buttocks. \u201cShould we roast her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, she\u2019ll fight right in with the other one,\u201d said the mare. They hauled the resisting and objecting Moonbounce into the cauldron, already filled with water to the brim. The excess flooded out, first under her weight, then under the other mare\u2019s, who they also tied from head to heel. When they were both immersed up to their necks, the mare clown began adding various vegetables into the mix while the fat one started a fire under the pot. That was the final nail on the coffin of Moon\u2019s worst fears: they were going to be boiled alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp!\u201d she wailed. \u201cHelp, help, help! Sergeant Nox, please, help us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I cut out her tongue?\u201d asked the clown pouring sliced onions over Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? The more meat in the pot, the merrier for us,\u201d responded the fat one. Right then the flint struck a spark, and a fire crackled to life under the cauldron. Soon smoke wafted on Moon\u2019s nostrils; on her companion\u2019s too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-what\u2019s happening?\u201d the mare asked. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, they're both awake now,\u201d chirped the mare clown. \u201cWhat do you say, fellas? Should we organize a race?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, what race?\u201d asked Moonbounce as the two others grumbled approvingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith exaggerated aloofness, the clown mare rested her head against the rim of the cauldron, between the two ponies inside. \u201cOkay, sweeties, listen carefully, because the next twenty minutes or so will decide how painful the rest of your lives will be. Got your attention? Tremendous. Now, as you may have noticed, you\u2019re in a pot which after a while will be boiling. With you inside. I did mention that, right? Not a nice way to go, being a living soup ingredient. Who knows, you might well be spending hours there, squirming in all that heat, heat, heat seeping into your every hole, filling you all the way until you\u2019d rather chew away your own pussies rather than take it anymore. Get the picture? I see you do. Now, what do you say if I told you there was a way out of this for exactly one of you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Moon and the mare simultaneously. Under them, the flames licked the iron from all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clown grinned. \u201cWell, I say for either one of you, really I mean either one of your souls. Oh yes. Your bodies, they\u2019ll be our dinner no matter what. But what do you care if your souls get out before that? That\u2019s our deal with Madame Rune. We give her the souls, keep the meat, and she teaches us\u2026 stuff as a bonus. So, you wanna hear how to save your souls from an agonizing, torturing, indefinitely long searing doom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d both mares cried, their tears streaming into the soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured. Suffice to say, there\u2019s a lot of magic mumbo-jumbo going, right? You don\u2019t have to worry any about that; we\u2019ll take care of it. All you have to care about is making the other orgasm before they does the same to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at her, wordless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt goes like this,\u201d continued the clown, fixing her position. \u201cWe don\u2019t boil you alive just because it\u2019s fun, right: we boil you alive \u2018cause it\u2019s the best way to make you suffer a lot. The more you suffer, the less comfy a soul feels in your bodies. At a certain limit, it wants nothing more than fly away, doors banging. That\u2019s when we do a little thing. The thing is, we have room and use for only one soul. That means, the first one to let loose. And that means, your best bet at improving the odds is making the other pony feel just a little bit more comfortable, just a tad more relaxed. Which means\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same as Moon looked at the mare, she looked back at her. It was impossible to tell what was going on behind those teal, bright eyes, or that cute, snow-white face. Or it was, until she felt the faint tingle of a foreign hoof rubbing against her labia underwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, just wait,\u201d Moon hurried. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do this; we don\u2019t have to do as they say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hoof\u2019s caress only turned more tender. Despite the insanity of her situation, Moon could not help her body responding as nature had intended. And under her bottocks, she could already sense the water warming. In an impossible situation, she had to choose between the unimaginable and the inconceivable: either she\u2019d let the mare please her in peace, thus sealing her fate in the pot, or she\u2019d take up the challenge, roll the dice and escape the mortal pain into transcendence.</span></div></div>",

Easy, easy strokes. Yeah. Yeah\u2026 Keep that up\u2026 Longer\u2026 Higher\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare wasn\u2019t all that bad, all things considered. The ropes must\u2019ve been eating her wrists raw, but she kept her touches steady and gentle, adoring Moon\u2019s pussy like it was her own. The water offered all the lubrication they needed, and it even tickled pleasantly when Moon knew how to focus on the sensation. All the while the liquid warmed up too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce, if not exactly burning with lust, at least got turned on. In her mind she mated with Leatherwing, grinding his head with her pelvis, driving that nimble tongue deep inside her before returning the favour. To amplify the fantasy, she picked up a thick carrot with her lips, sucking it ardently. That got her close the mark, yet decidedly off it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much yet?\u201d the mare asked, sweating. Fine steam rose from the surface of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh, don\u2019t speak,\u201d said Moon, plushing. \u201cKiss me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey leaned forward, muzzles meeting at the centre. She was a good kisser. Their tongues mingled, intertwined, dived into one another\u2019s throats. Moon\u2019s pussy ached for release, her swollen clit petted by a pillar of bubbles rising from the bottom. A stream of her musky juices joined in, releasing their scent on the surface. On the finish line she just panted into the mare\u2019s humid mouth, letting her tongue lap her lips, chin, everything it could reach. And then she cummed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d she moaned, pulling back and arching her back. The hoof sank deepest yet within her, milking precious pleasure from her with firm strokes. Moon rode the wave as long as it lasted, then fell limp on the water quickly approaching the boiling point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear, I\u2019ll remember you in the next life!\u201d sobbed the mare, relieved both over the end of her straining task and her agonizing fate. \u201cBy Celestia, my hooves are so sore\u2026 And this water: it\u2019s getting so hot already\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve earned your rest, your life,\u201d mumbled Moon. A peculiar calm was taking over her. She knew she was going to experience a horrible death, but at least she could pass away knowing she had saved another pony from the same fate. Perhaps that knowledge alone was enough to alleviate the inevitable suffering, at least slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI say, that was impressive,\u201d said the clown mare, who had seen everything. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of finishing the incantation then. How\u2019s it coming along, Harold?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pony addressed as Harold flicked ash from his newly lit cigar, next to the fat pony immersed in reading some scroll in a strange language a little distance away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat,\u201d said the mare clown. \u201cOh and, by the way, the boiling alive thing is just really for fun, and for food of course. We can pick either soul we want. We ended up with the bat \u2013 for reasons of irony, you understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d said the white mare, now paler than ever. She looked at the equally aghast Moonbounce, whose soul was already leaving her mortal frame. An ethereal mist fell through her, leaving her body limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if behind a glass, Moonbounce followed how the white mare\u2019s face extorted into fevered fear and pain. She could not hear her screams, just like she couldn\u2019t hear anything else, either. Even the scene was turning invisible. Little by little, everything turned black, then white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d said the mare clown, closing the vial where Moonbounce had vanished. Madame would make good use out of a soul this altruistic. Meanwhile, she and her colleagues would make good use out of the plump, juicy chunk of meat now boiling in the cauldron. Out of her head she decided to add a few apples to the mix. They seemed appropriate enough, for some reason.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The situation was no longer about duty, honor, or even reason: it was about survival, blood simple. Whoever of them could induce more pleasure for the other would win, and the price wasn\u2019t something Moonbounce intended to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to try harder than that, love,\u201d she said, licking her lips alluringly. At the same time, she sought her rival\u2019s nether regions with her hooves. The ropes, loosened somewhat by the water, allowed her to reach them, but not without noticeable discomfort. But a sprained ankle would be nothing compared to what awaited the loser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus the race started. Both mares clopped one another furiously, doing their best to force the other feel at least slightly more pleased. The more one tried, the more the other had to surpass in order to gift relaxation. For her own part, Moon felt little but irritation, stress and discomfort, and she had no illusions her mate felt anything different. Resolution glared from both of them, with not a shade of enjoyment to be found, although each had a hoof half-buried up their cunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water was getting alarmingly sweltering when Moon realized that, if she could not win by inducing pleasure on her, perhaps she could by causing displeasure on herself. It was about who experienced the most pain, not who really about who cummed first, right? Clutching on to the thought, she pulled her hoof out of the other mare\u2019s pussy and bit down on her own tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the mare was baffled to see blood burst out of Moon\u2019s mouth, but she was quick to learn the new rules. She too tried to bite herself, but her flat teeth could not compare to the damage Moon\u2019s fangs could inflict. She chewed her own mouth, jaws, lips; even her other teeth. It hurt like hell, but the water was starting to boil now. In no time it would turn worse than she could imagine. So she fought back the tears and tore a new hole into the chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t, I can\u2019t,\u201d sobbed the other mare hysterically. \u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore\u2026 Oh my Celestia\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoser, thought Moon, excruciated yet secure in her victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d said the mare clown. \u201cYou two really are something. You actually believed what I said about the race. Gosh, I have to try that another time to see if this was a fluke or what.\u201d She turned to the two other clowns. \u201cHey! How\u2019s the incantation coming along?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pony with the newly lit cigar flicked ash to the ground, next to the fat pony immersed in reading some scroll in a strange language a little distance away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat,\u201d said the mare clown. \u201cOh yeah, we can pick the soul willy nilly. The boiling alive thing is just for fun, and for food obviously. We decided to take you, snowball, seeing that the bat was the one who should\u2019ve deserved to win. That\u2019s called irony.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-what?\u201d stuttered Moonbounce, mouth bleeding all over the soup. \u201cNo! No! That\u2019s not fair! That\u2019s not fair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to your new home, sweetie,\u201d said the clown to the translucent mist that evaporated from the mare\u2019s now limp body and vanished into the cask the pony held. After closing the container she pocketed it, and resumed adding apples into the soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce kept shouting, cursing, threatening and crying while more ingredients were added, including spices, potatoes, cucumber, cream and of course salt. Little by little the brew turned thicker, while Moonbounce\u2019s shouts turned into incoherent, ceaseless screaming. When the surface churned happily with bubbles, her eyes bulged out, mouth twisted into a horrible grimace. The clown spooned some of the soup for herself, blew on it and had a taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, not bad at all. Three hours more and we\u2019ll get excellent flavour out you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she closed the lid on the cauldron. Not quite submerging her, it sank Moonbounce deep enough that the soup started pouring into her gaping maw, burning her from the inside too. Vegetables and roots dashed into her stomach, filling her completely with soup made mostly of herself. Her anus and pussy took in their fair share too. When the pain finally reached a lethal boundary, Moonbounce greeted it with all her heart.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Perhaps it was high time she started acting like a responsible guard, Moonbounce thought. Sergeant Nox was her superior after all, not to mention much more experienced in the job. Surely he had good reasons for what he did, even if those didn\u2019t excite Moonbounce all that much. With a dutiful sigh, she headed to the quiet alleys in the tent\u2019s proximity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from the motions of the moon, she spent a good hour cruising the cobblestones, doing her best to look innocent, lost, scared and whatever else she thought an alluring victim should look like. If nothing else, she aroused the interest of many a homeless pony and a drunk socialite on their way to the next bar. Not exactly an achievement, but at least she was assured that her figure still turned heads, even if those were not the heads she wished to be turned in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince time was a resource she had amply at her disposal, she started thinking the case. Were there really no connections between the three mares other than the obvious ones of age, sex, and looks one could objectively describe as attractive? The little file Nox had given her to read hadn\u2019t included much information about them, save their professions (a student, a cook, and a gardener) addresses (all around the city) and pictures (attractive, like said). None of them were particularly rich. Perhaps the kidnapper knew this, which explained the lack of ransom demands. That lead to the question, what other reason there was to kidnap them. If they were indeed kidnapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother strange thing about the case was how it had been handled by Sergeant Nox. Why would he choose to vest such a puzzle to a mere cadet, for whom common street patrolling represented novelty? Granted, she had chosen the case herself, but this wasn\u2019t what she had had in mind then. All and all, the more Moon thought about her current predicament, the more reasons she could find not to like it one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmersed in her thoughts, Moon utterly failed to pay attention to the road, which resulted to a collision. An umbrella dropped, which she hurried to pick up. \u201cOh, sorry,\u201d she said, hoofing the parasol back to the pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all well, dear,\u201d said the stranger: a mare in her fifties, dressed in a long, laced gown stretching all the way to the ground. Moon couldn\u2019t vouch for the impression, but she fancied recognizing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadame Rune, I am,\u201d said the Madame, reading the question from her lips. A shade of foreign accent shined through her low, delicate voice; a hint of Saddle-Arabia, if Moon was any judge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce blinked. Then the revelation struck her from the back of her mind. \u201cOf course: Madame Rune! Sorry, I didn\u2019t recognize you at first without your costume on. I loved your show, I really did! It wasn\u2019t like anything I had seen before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere there,\u201d the Madame said, tapping the side of her shoe with the tip of the umbrella. \u201cIt\u2019s not me your awe should be due, but the powers I merely serve. And if you liked it so much, please, do come again tomorrow, with a friend if you will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will, certainly,\u201d lied Moonbounce. For the first time she looked at the other, younger mare accompanying Madame. A strange, faraway look occupied her face, as if she wasn\u2019t fully awake. \u201cAnother awestruck fan?\u201d Moon hazarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet us call it that,\u201d said the Madame. She took hold of the mare by the neck, guiding her along. \u201cGoodbye to you, dear. Hope to see you tomorrow. With a friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye,\u201d said Moon, watching the two press into the night, towards the direction of the circus. In her mind, duty nagged Moon to let them be and continue the patrolling. But another trait of hers, called suspicion, voiced its contrary opinion. Ordinary as the encounter had seemed on the surface, there was something disturbing about it \u2013 especially about the forlorn mare. She had almost seemed like one of the volunteers in Madame\u2019s circus show, which was to say, hypnotized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of different paths unfolded after that observation, all leading to conclusions wilder than the one before. If this wasn\u2019t her gut speaking, it probably couldn\u2019t talk in the first place. Moon simply had to follow the couple. There was something to be confirmed here, although what exactly that was eluded the clarity of a proposition. That\u2019d be the first thing she\u2019d get clear about: of what exactly she suspected Madame guilty of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of every shadow, Moonbounce tracked Madame and her escort from a safe distance. Like her initial hunch had predicted, they were heading towards the tent. At the doors Madame glanced around the clearing, as if checking nopony saw them, and then they walked in. Now that was odd, indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was, what to do about it? Should she sneak into the tent too? Or perhaps seek out Nox, let him know what was going on. Both paths had their merits, their downsides. Either she\u2019d ridicule herself in the eyes of the Sergeant or she\u2019d plunge alone into possibly very real danger. And as so often before, time was not on her side.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Written by myself and Voltwrecker in an rp.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go with-\" Moonbounce began when the door suddenly flew open with a slam, somepony clearly announcing their entrance. The mare saw Nox's jaw clench and she turned around, following his eyes to the door. There stood a pure white dragony, his spaded tail waving as he flicked his two tone blue mane up. Ice blue eyes and wings matched his large eyes, slitted pupils quickly flicking between her and Nox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox grunted as he looked over at the newcomer. \"Sergeant Dusk, do you not understand what occupied means with regards to the meeting room?\" Nox asked, his tone rather snubbish as he fixed his eyes on the dragony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I half expected to find you slacking off again.\" The dragony stepped into the room, glancing at the door to make sure he didn't break it. Dusk was smaller than the average pony, an unfortunate side effect of the tests that had been done on him. His worth and reputation primarily came from his agility and strength, regardless of his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is this the new recruit I'll be borrowing for the investigation?\" Dusk inquired with utmost certainty, adjusting one of the straps on his pure black combat outfit. It was far less regal or refined than the guards' armour, but just as durable and much more flexible. \"I trust you haven't forgotten, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox frowned as Dusk bit back, his tone as sharp as ever. One of these days Nox hoped the uppity test tube pony would get knocked down several pegs. At the reminder though Nox groaned. \"I'd been hoping to get you out of here before he turned up, cadet,\" Nox informed Moonbounce quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" the thestral mare replied. \"He seems pretty cool,\" she said, admiring his outfit that made him look more like special ops than royal guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you likely won't survive it,\" Nox said plainly. \"Sergeant Rider takes the most dangerous of assignments... and rarely returns with his partner intact,\" Nox said, speaking louder so Dusk could hear him badmouthing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please. Don't blame the teacher for the student's lack of talent. Try giving me someone who can keep up, then maybe I'll bring them back in one piece.\" He scoffed, flicking his mane again and smiling at the bat mare. \"But don't worry, dear. I'll be sure to keep you safe, as long as you can keep up.\" He glanced at Nox. \"Though if he's been your teacher, I doubt that you will. He specializes in stuffing his face and sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to see why Dusk seemed to dislike Nox so much, of course the stallions were polar opposites in most ways. Dusk was a pristine, well kept and seemingly well mannered stallion while Nox was...not exactly fitting those descriptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce felt more excited than afraid as Dusk went on, talking about how he outspeeds all the other guards. She'd wanted to prove herself and this here was a big shot straight out the stable! \"I can keep up!\" she said confidently, snapping into a ready for action pose. She looked and seemed confident, but her overly proportioned rump and slightly tubby belly definitely made it look like Nox had been teaching her well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox snorted, making a mental note to appeal to Accipiter to get Bulldozer to crush this puny ingrate at the next convenience. \"Well since he's Covert Operations you don't get any choice in the matter anyway,\" Nox reminded Moonbounce. The thestral stallion trotted over to the desk and pulled open a drawer, lifting out a folder he had conveniently forgotten about before tossing it on the table. \"Your assignment,\" he said, gesturing Moonbounce take a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk nodded to her, heartened by her enthusiasm. It was rare that a recruit wanted so eagerly to go on a real mission in their first week or even their first year. Most were content to stay on patrols and guard duty while rising in the ranks and on the weight scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk shot Nox a glare as he saw the way he was looking at him. He could tell he was plotting something, but there was a reason that his quarters had a warning on both the door and the window for, hilariously, the safety of anypony who tries to attack him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, dear.\" He said, smiling at Moonbounce. He wasn't too much smaller than her, but when standing face to face, it would be more fitting to say face to chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce smiled at Dusk, though it was weird looking down at him. He was a dragony, a superior officer, and a pretty studly stallion... but he was a little short. \"I'm honoured, sir!\" she said smartly, before flipping open the folder. A number of pictures came out, along with some wordy looking documents. A quick glance at the photos seemed they were mostly of a rather large and imposing mare with a scar on her cheek and a cutie mark that looked like a cartoon explosion. The next picture looked kinda like a bomb, but loaded with some glowing purple energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox rapped a hoof on the table to get her to look back up. \"This is a high profile arrest. The mare, Plastique, is on so many watchlists it isn't even funny. We have documented cases of sabotage tied to her in Manehattan and Trottingham, and we have a confirmed sighting of her in Canterlot... the slums,\" Nox stated clearly, tapping a hoof on a small map. \"We don't know how long she's been hiding here, or even where she's staying but we do know she's going to be meeting with a Diamond Dog demolitions expert who's apparently selling something exotic. This is a tier 1 threat, and you are authorised to kill her if you have to. Questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk already knew all that he needed to know about the mission, so he shook his head. However, he was expecting the recruit to ask questions, as she was, well...a recruit. He sat down, waiting for the inevitable barrage about 'regulations' and 'proper arrests' to come...but Moonbounce did seem a bit different from the cadets he had worked with before. She listened, but didn't seem confused or nervous...at least for now. Only time would tell if she was up to the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce blinked. \"So... we're hunting down a terrorist and we're allowed to kill her? Do the royal guard even do this?\" she asked, looking quite taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Covert Operations are kept covert for a reason. We don't want to incite panic. Last thing we need is ponies thinking they're being watched all the time... even though they are,\" Nox replied. \"If your choice is kill or watch an explosion kill civilians then you kill. I know that gut of yours isn't just for show,\" Nox said, pointing at Moonbounce's belly and making her blush a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce took a second to process that and then grinned. \"Well... this is kinda cool! I like it. So do I get a cool uniform? And gadgets or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox sighed. \"You're not a spy, Moonbounce. You're still a guard, and you're not Covert Ops. You have your sword if you need to use it and that's all,\" Nox replied straight, deflating Moonbounce a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was made even more deflating by the fact that Sergeant Rider was fully decked out, a pair of goggles on the top of his head, a composite bow on his back and an odd looking gauntlet on his left front leg. He probably had other things on him as well, but perhaps this was a compliment on their part. Perhaps they figured Moonbounce was so skilled that she didn't need all of the fancy gear...while in reality Dusk was just scared of her weight breaking his equipment, which he had designed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce looked over at Dusk, expecting him to chip in, but he just gave a shrug, his equipment clearly on display. \"Horseapples,\" Moon muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox slid the picture of the mare to Moonbounce and then closed the folder again. \"Track down Plastique. The deal is going down in the Slapped Ass tavern, down on Greengate Street at midnight. It's right in the centre of the slums, which is going to be dangerous at night... especially as you're going to need to keep to the alleys as you approach so as not to tip anypony off. There isn't going to be any backup, not out there, so do not fail,\" he said, looking more at Dusk on that one, almost as if he expected Moonbounce to not make it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. You know me.\" Dusk stood up again, stretching out and straining the suit's fabric as he flexed his limbs. The suit was designed to stretch, but it was too expensive to make a knew one after he had bulked up, so he was stuck with a tight fitting suit that made him look like a male stripper cosplaying as a SWAT pony at times. He smiled up at Moonbounce. \"Shall we go? Or do you need some time to prepare?\" He asked, seeming like the type to not care much either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox rolled his eyes. \"Exactly,\" he replied straight. He whisked the folder away and chucked it into a drawer. \"I'll see you when you return, Cadet. Do try to do so as you left, in one piece,\" he replied before trotting away, being sure to shoulder Dusk as the trotted past and out of the breifing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce blinked. \"Well... I guess I'm yours, Dusk!\" she said, giving him a grin. \"Oh I want to get out there! Spent all morning sleeping and I'm buzzed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk shouldered right back, and despite Nox being nearly twice his size, he cracked the doorway by knocking the bulky stallion into it. \"Don't push your luck.\" he growled, then turned back to Moonbounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then. Let's head out. The faster we finish, the faster we get back and you get to add to your reputation. Maybe even rise up a few ranks.\" He smiled at her, seeming far nicer with cadets than with his fellow high ranking members.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Written by myself and Voltwrecker in an rp.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce liked the sound of that. If she finished her first day as a Corporal she'd even beat her dad's record! She eagerly followed Dusk, the two setting out onto the darkened streets, moving at a quick canter all the way until they reached the divide. A small river with a bridge across marked the end of the more rich districts and the start of the slums, the difference in construction quality even clear from here. Slowly the pair trotted across, their hooves clopping on the cobbled stone as they crossed into the darker, poorer district. The magic street lamps got fewer and further between, but as a thestral low level light wasn't a probelm for Moonbounce. \"So we going to stick to the alleys like Nox said?\" She asked Dusk, nodding towards the dark and foreboding alley entrance nearby, which was even more threatening than the dirty poorly lit street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the best idea.\" Dusk nodded, starting to walk towards the entrance. Did he just...gulp? It was quite audible and Dusk's head bobbed in time with it, but surely a seasoned soldier like him wouldn't be scared. It must have just been a building creaking. Besides, he seemed to walk into the darkness with little apprehension, lighting up a strip of luminescent tubing on his legs to illuminate the alley and make it less foreboding. It was quite a long one as well, easily a hundred or more metres before the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce looked at Dusk, her head twisting. \"Are you okay?\" she asked, seeing how he seemed almost... scared? Nah, that couldn't be it. He trotted in first, then rubbed his forelegs tofether and light rubing suddenly lit up the place, spooking some rats which ran away squeaking. The light had a blue tint and looked kinda weird, but they could see at least. \"Should be a few of these alleys, right? The Slapped Ass is pretty far still,\" Moonbounce said as she trotted next to Dusk, her pace not slowing and forcing the smaller dragony to move a little faster than he normally would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We shouldn't have to turn too much, should be a straight shot.\" He took a deep breath, silently sighing and calming himself. Truth be told, he was what many soldiers would call a coward. Not in the sense that he ran away from battle, but rather that he would stay at the back of the ranks or in the shadows and take out opponents that kept him in complete safety. He was not used to working with others, which was why he usually came back alone; he would often leave the cadet, complete the mission himself and return to the barracks alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of them, they could see a rather dirty mare behind a dumpster, half asleep but clearly drunk at the same time, an empty bottle of liquor sitting beside her. She was certainly not the skinniest, and any pony with pudge on them was one that should be treated with caution. However, the alley was wide enough for them to stay out of reach, which Dusk was already doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce nodded her head. She'd been here a few times while at the Academy, but never at night. The darkness was her element though, Thestrals naturally preferring it so it wasn't a problem for her at all. She trotted alongisde Dusk, the mare not noticing him adjust his path to keep to one side of the alley. She saw where he was looking and turned herself, surprised to see a mare there. She looked filthy, and full of booze, maybe some kind of hobo. Moonbounce didn't have any change to throw and that would probably be rude anyway so she ignored her just like Dusk did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare continued to sit there in her drunken stupor as the two walked past, continuing down the alley. \"Trust me, that's the least dangerous kind of pony you'll find out here. Smallest, too.\" He grunted as they walked along, the alley becoming a bit smaller as they went further down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the mare was out of ear shot, Dusk leaned over and and whispered to her. Moon blinked. \"She was dangerous?\" she asked, turning back, finding it hard to believe a grubby little hobo could be a danger... then again she did seem surprisingly well fed... \"Hmm. Well, she wasn't to us at least,\" she replied, shrugging as the pair of them passed into a smaller, tighter alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a good way to look at things. Anything is a danger in the slums.\" As he said 'slums', his voice cracked a bit, but surely that was just an accident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk suddenly stopped, holding out a hoof to stop Moonbounce as well. Ahead of them was a much larger mare than the last, this time standing directly in their path with her back facing them. The two could hear loud slurping and gulping noises, the mare assumedly scarfing down some scraps of food she found. She shone gently in Dusk's artificial light, the sweat on her fur shining gently. Her stomach hung low, lower than Moonbounce's, who in comparison was about three quarters of the mare's size. </span></div></div>",

Dusk was scared. Scared of the slums... of these ponies. Maybe they really were dangerous... Just as she thought about it a hoof pushed out in front of her and she walked into it, the leg squishing into her belly. She opened ehr mouth to speak then saw the mare. This one was big, big enough to fit Dusk inside her swollen, sagging gut. She was loudly scarfing something, which had Dusk spooked. She saw him sneaking off to the side... and decided maybe that would be the smart thing to do. She tried to sneak past the other side of the mare, away from Dusk's lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk smartly turned off his lights to avoid startling the mare, his eyes still glowing gently in the darkness. He slipped by easily, but unfortunately, Moonbounce did not get by without attracting attention. The mare turned to her, her eyes locking onto the thestral and stepping in front of her to block her path. \"What're y'all doin' here, prissy bitch?\" she immediately opened with a foul mouthed insult, snarling. Dusk paused, waiting to see what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce edged in the darkness, but the swaying of her chubby flanks was enough motion to catch the mare's eyes. Suddenly the large dirty looking mare was right in her face. \"O-official guard business! Please stand aside!\" Moonbounce retorted puffing up her chest and trying to look important, while her eyes looked for Dusk to come help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'all're guards? That makes ya twice as tasty!\" She laughed, rearing up on her hind legs and pinning Moonbounce to the floor, expertly removing her chest armour. It was clear she had experience in this, as she had the piece off in seconds and was already running her disgusting, slimy tongue up and down her bare chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk sighed, tipping his head in a half-hearted bow before firing his grappling hook onto a nearby roof, letting the winch pull him up as he vanished over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce expected the mare to treat her with respect, but instead she was shoved to the floor, her armour wrenched off in an instant and tossed aside. The huge, hungry mare leaned down, slurping over Moon's chest as the mare let out a sudden cry. \"N-No! No! You can't eat me! Help!\" she squealed, looking for Dusk. She saw his tail whipping away and vanishing onto the rooftops, then looked back to see the mare's slimy jaws right above her. \"Get off of me!\" she yelped as she tried to shove the larger mare off with her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot bothering with the golden boots or anything else, the mare opened her mouth wide, her drool dripping from her lips onto Moonbounce's face. Before anything could be said or done, she had already engulfed the smaller mare's head in her jaws, her rancid breath washing over Moonbounce as she moaned and licked all over her head, savouring the flavour of clean, fresh pony meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her purple boots clashed against the mare's chest, the mare decided to just start dinner. Moonbounce squealed and pulled back but her head was shoved forwards, crammed into the drooling, hot maw as lips clapped around her shoulders. She heard a moan over her flavour as nasty, horrible breath filled her nostrils and the tongue bathed her in sticky mess. \"Let me out!\" she squealed desperately, flailing her body, her tasty looking rump bouncing up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare was eager to finish her off quickly, having been hankering for a wriggling meal for days. She swallowed heavily, the one pulse of her muscles pulling Moonbounce in past her shoulders, chest and even halfway past her stomach. The mare was panting, her marehood beginning to ache from the sensation of devouring another pony. She'd have to find a stallion around after she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce's wriggles only sped up the swallowing, gulps and slurps dragging her deeper, her shoulders squeezing inside, followed by her belly, quickly reaching her waist. A clear bulge of her face and forehooves was already pushing out against the mare's bloating gut as the large shaped bulge of her midsection had the mare's throat nice and wide. The plump thestral butt and wriggling legs was all that remained of the guardsmare who wouldn't even make it to her first assignment, snatched up on the way by a hungry mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare wormed her tongue between the plump, doughy cheeks, and in most cases, a mare like her would have been jealous of such a perfectly round rump, but giving her own ass a smack she reminded herself that she was far more endowed than some prissy guard. Another swallow sent her ass packing down her throat, followed by her legs and finally her hooves slid down and her lips clapped shut behind her, her tongue slowly coming out to run over her lips and grab the last bits of sweat and flavour she could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce let out a moan as the mare tongued her sensitive ass cheeks, the soft mounds vaguely tasting of apple, but much sweeter and the pudge was just the right level to be delicious without being too fatty. She stole some nibbles before the swallow carried the ass downwards, and then those legs in long slurps. Hooves wriggled for a second, shoes falling off to expose soft Thestral soles for a second before they were slurped up too. A loud gulp echoed as the mare licked her lips, and her huge belly sagged with the entirety of the mare guard, Moonbounce already starting to struggle and scream harder, begging to be let go as she jiggled the belly with her kicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after her stomach was filled, the mare's lips were fluttering once more as a rancid belch erupted from her gullet, carrying with it several grey feathers and one purple, saliva coated boot. She giggled to herself, licking her lips again before standing up and beginning to walk away, her stomach sloshing and jiggling uselessly beneath her. Moonbounce would never see the light of day again, that was certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk looked back as he heard the colossal belch erupt from behind him, a soft blush spreading across his face. A shame...he did have a thing for pudgy mares, but he also had a thing for living. Besides, he had plenty of mares fawning over him back at the barracks.</span></div></div>",

The guardspony instead stood up a little taller and trotted forwards, stopping behind the large mare. \"Excuse me?\" she called up to her. When the mare turned slightly Moonbounce would smile. \"Would you mind moving out of the way please? I've got to get to the Slapped Ass,\" she said, thinking nothing of the name drop, and the reputation that place had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder normal circumstances, the mare would have just sat down and crushed the guard, but hearing where she was going...she figured she would face a much worse fate there. Giving an exasperated grunt, she stepped to the side, pulling with her the greasy bag of some kind of fried food and continuing to eat whatever it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce smiled. \"Thanks!\" she said cheerily before trotting past, paying no mind to the mare as she trotted past, Dusk staring at her in shock as she announced her position and didn't end up drooping out a sagging gut. She could hear the mare munching behind as she carried on down the straight path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk shook his head, figuring this cadet wasn't even going to make it all the way to the Slapped Ass. The two exited the alley, finally, and found themselves on a dirt road leading to the center of town. From here, they could either continue to wind their way through alleyways fraught with danger, or they could take a straight shot down to the Slapped Ass, while risking the chance of being discovered. Dusk seemed indifferent, so the decision was up to Moonbounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce shrugged at Dusk's head shake. \"She was just minding her own business! Can't assume everypony's dangerous,\" she said, only making Dusk shake his head more. They emerged from the alley and they could see the tavern down a straight street, the image of a donkey gettings its ass slapped with a hoof proudly on a sign at the top. It was a large place and actually didn't look that shitty, minaly because rumors were it was owned by one of the gangs... not that that stopped hoofights and vorings happening nightly. Moonbounce didn't even consider the street, following Nox's orders as she trotted back into the alley unaware of the choice otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk blinked, staring as the bat mare walked into the alley and ignored the straight shot to the end of the mission. He groaned, following along with her, frankly unable to take his eyes off of her rump as he found himself falling into pace behind her, blushing ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce was in a good mood, adding more spring to her step, which just meant more of a show to any watchers. Her butt seemed to have its own gravity, bouncing and swaying and jiggling with each step as she trotted down the dark alley. Dusk breathed deeply, trying to avoid getting too aroused as it would be obvious against the fabric of his suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alley was relatively empty, and the ponies they did see were mainly skinny and harmless. Once they reached the end, however, they found a very large, muscular yet still pot-bellied stallion sitting in a corner behind a dumpster, quite obviously doing something...private. However, Moonbounce could hear muffled crying and movement from  between his legs. </span></div></div>",

She blushed as she realised what had happened. \"S-sorry,\" she apologised to Dusk... when he pulled out of her butt she pointed out the stallion ahead, moaning in delight as she heard the sound of crying. \"It... sounds like a pony there might need some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk choked as the disgusting blast of gas hit him directly in the nose, sending him reeling against a wall, retching and coughing. While Dusk recovered, the stallion thrust his hips forward and the sobs became even more muffled, the stallion's grunts and moans getting louder as he moved his hoof up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce looked back to see Dusk coughing and choking against a wall, trying to get rid of her butt fumes. To distract herself from that fact... as well as out of moral obligation... she cantered forwards. \"E-exucse me, everything all right over there?\" she asked, addressing the pair of stallions as it sounded quite... problematic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion grunted, a loud SCHLORP sounding out from in front of him before he turned to her, his absolutely massive and sweat coated erection throbbing in front of her. His balls were visibly churning...but he was a big guy. There was no evidence there. \"Yeah? 'fuck ya want, mare?\" He had a thick Aussie accent...or perhaps it was Southern. Regardless, he didn't seem like the kind that one would want to mess with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce winced at the loud schlorping sound, his sweaty and huge cock shaking in front of her as his balls burgeoned with cum. She blinked, unable to believe a stallion could be so... huge there. \"S-sorry, my mistake. Thought you were someone I knew,\" Moonbounce quickly apologised then turned around and trotted back over to Dusk. At least she'd confirmed he wasn't voring someone in front of her which settled her fears as she quickly trotted on, leaving him to his business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk followed Moonbounce, still foolishly sticking to her butt like glue. \"Might I ask why you didn't take the dirt road, Moonbounce? It would have led us directly to our destination in half the time.\" He seemed a bit angry, but it was hard to keep his voice stern when her butt was jiggling right in front of him. He gulped and panted a small bit, trying to keep himself together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce and Dusk continued on, the path still dark and dangerous as ever. She could hear Dusk behind her, the mare not wanting to stop in front of him again in a hurry. \"Well, Nox said to stick to the alleys... must be some kind of watchdogs out there, right?\" Moonbounce replied, the mare thinking the best of her superiors, and not thinking that Nox might have just wanted Dusk to take the most dangerous route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You realize Nox hates me, right? He likely wanted us to use the alleys because they're dangerous.\" As he started going into a tangent he sped up his pace, growling. \"And he doesn't care about this mission. Hell, he probably profits off of the Slapped Ass, knowing that useless sack of-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish, he had re-focused, but all too late. He rammed face-first into Moonbounce's ass crack, squealing in an almost feminine way as his increased pace wedged his head firmly in her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce frowned at Dusk's words. Shortly Nox couldn't be that vindictive. She shook her head and turned back. \"Come on, Du-\" she began to reply when his head rammed into her again, this time Moonbounce squealing in surprise. Her hooves slipped and her ass fell back, a loud squelch sounding as Moon's ass slipped halfway down Dusk, the top half of the pony entirely buried inside her ass as a horrific blast of nasty gas filled his lungs, burned his eyes, the fart ripping out and around him in a PPPpphhhhhbbbbbttttt<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk frantically kicked and struggled, his face buried in the remains of her last meal as he was bombarded by horrific blasts of thick, smelly gas, his eyes red and bloodshot as he kept trying to pull back, but the shocked mare was taking far too long to stand up and get him out. \"LET ME OUT! G-GET ME OUT OF HERE!\" He screamed in a demanding tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce's ass cheeks squeezed around Dusk's waist, his own flanks shaking inside hers as his legs kicked out. She groaned, squeezing her gut which only made a follow up blast of abominable bowel stink rip out, a horrible trumpet going on for almost half a minute as Moonbounce moaned in relief. \"I-I'm trying,\" she groaned, pushing against her tailhole harder as she stood up, his own flanks leaving the dirty alley to wobble between her sweaty cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk was practically sobbing by this point, the smell worse than any stomach or mouth that he had been in before. He continued kicking and trying to force his way out, regretting his obsession with the very same ass that was trying to devour him now. He was lucky that Moonbounce had fairly good control over her muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce squeezed hard, shoving back and there was an ominous squelch sound from ahead, then Dusk was suddenly slammed into by a deluge of rancid, sloppy scat, not properly formed as it sprayed all over him, covering his face in the mess as Moonbounce blushed hard. \"Sorry! Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk gasped in relief as he popped out of her ass, panting before he was knocked to the ground, his body immediately buried in a torrent of near liquid shit that poured all over him and he was forced to swallow some of it, coughing and sputtering as he fell onto his back, twitching and trying to supress both his rage and his lunch from coming back up his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk popped free, but so did all of Moon's bowel contents, she tried to stop it but he was showered in her shit, covered in liquidy mess... and then solid chunks as logs thumped him in the head, almost crushing him under their weight as they kept coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk gasped as he sat up once the torrent was over, choking and rolling out of the pile that was now bigger than his whole body. He retched and bent over in the corner, vomiting up the contents of his stomach, which was barely distinguishable from her scat anyway. He then flopped down on the ground, panting and coughing weakly, his whole body dripping with shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce whimpered, still feeling her butt fudge splattering onto that growing heap, pounding on it as it grew taller until she was finally empty. She heard retching behind her and looked back to see him vomiting up her shit, it splattering on the floor in a putrid pile of its own. \"Sorry... Dusk you just... I'm really sorry,\" Moon apologised, whimpering as she gently put a hoof on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe coughed again, trying to get angry but not having the strength at this point. \"Just...keep...walking...\" He said through gritted teeth, stumbling to his hooves and starting to walk along. The stallion near the dumpster, meanwhile, had been watching the whole thing with his hoof constantly stroking his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce whimpered and nodded, having just shit all over her superior officer would probably look real bad in the review... unless Nox gave it then he might give her a promotion. She led Dusk lead again, not wanting to risk anything like that again as she walked sullenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point during their walk he found a faucet sticking out of a wall and rinsed off with it. The water probably wasn't potable, but at least he didn't smell like shit anymore. He found that taking some time to recover made him less angry, and finally he turned to speak to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I know you probably expect me to be mad, right? Well I'm not. I was the one who wasn't paying attention. It's my bad. Don't beat yourself up over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Moonbounce found it hard to meet's Dusk face, even as he washed himself clean. He looked at her and apologised and she blinked. \"Y-you're not?\" she asked, then sighed with relief. \"I didn't mean to trip, you just...\" she began and then stopped herself. \"H-here, let me,\" she said, kicking off her purple hoofcups and taking some hoofulls of water to help clear off her own scat, helping Dusk in his impromptu shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, letting her assist him. His suit was clean enough already, as it was water resistant, but his face was stained. The water smelled odd though...like stew, kind of. A mix of meat, vegetables and other seasonings...Dusk didn't seem to notice it, probably because he had been smelling nothing but scat as of late. Little did either of them know that somepony was dumping out a bucket of stew water, and plumbing wasn't well made in the slums. It certainly didn't help that, in an effort to make her family eat her food, the mare who had cooked the stew had put a potion in it that made it impossible to resist when tasted and very hard to resist when smelled.</span></div></div>",

Her nose wrinkled as the muck washed away. She lifted a hoof and curiously licked it. Her eyes suddenly went wide and drool began to pour from her lips. \"More...\" she said, looking down at Dusk and suddenly grabbing him, pulling him up against her gut. Her belly grumbled as she stared down at him, her maw opening and showing off that plush cavern as he smelled her hot and nasty breath. \"Delicious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-....\" Dusk yelped as he was pulled against the pudgy stomach, blinking in confusion. \"Wh-what the hell are you doing?!\" he started panicking, trying to pry her forelegs open. He was strong, but the ordeal he had been in had taken a toll on his energy. \"L-let go of me cadet! CADET!\" He screamed, staring down her cavernous gullet as she lifted him towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce was drooling all over Dusk's head, her eyes seeing him as nothing but a huge chunk of meat in a stew. She was bigger, and with him pinned he couldn't use his tricks. She lowered her jaws, widening her lips, and her tongue stuck out to lick up from his chin and to his forehead, then her mouth lunged forward and her teeth bit around his shoulders, her tongue batting him in the face as she greedily slurped off the stew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-CADET! STOP!\" He screamed out loud, trying to ram his hind leg into her gut, her chest, anywhere that might affect her, but he couldn't in this position. He desperately struggled, trying to escape from her grasp, but with this much of him eaten already, it was inevitable that he would perish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce moaned in delight, loving the flavour, ignoringt he struggles. His head slipped back, his screaming vanishing down her throat, followed by his head as she gulped loudly, dragging in his shoulders and working down his chest as he flailed and wriggled for his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could do nothing, his energy quickly fading as his suit provided more hindrance than help, his eyes starting to roll back as his suit constricted him due to the pressure, coughing and gasping for air as her throat did the same, preventing him from breathing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce slurped and gulped, dragging in over his waist, giving his cock a long and lewd slurp to clean all the stew off of it, and then digging into his butt to do the same, even poking his tailhole to get the trace remains as Moonbounce needed every drop of that delicious stew, her stomach gurgling eagerly as Dusk's head hovered above the acids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk screamed in horror as his head was dangled above the bubbling, sizzling acids like some sort of spy movie where the hero would get out at the last second...but of course that didn't happen. With another swallow his head was dunked in, his cheeks bulged out and his eyes shut as he tried to hold his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce gulped lously and in went his butt, a last tongue slap squeishing it before that was gulped down too. His hindlegs were next, slipping inside, hooves too and then all that remained was his spaded tail. It flicked back and forth in front of her as she sucked on it, leaving the tip to flick for a moment as inside he screamed into the acidic soup of her gut, beind dunked in and held there as she played with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe choked and started inhaling the acids, screaming hoarsely as they started to burn his lungs and, ironically, his stomach. He felt his tail outside, desperately flicking and wiggling it, trying to cut her or do something with it to remind her who she was eating. \"C-CADET! MOONBOUNCE!\" he screamed, only to fall back under the frothing, sloshing acids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce swallowed his tail last, a slurp claiming it and gulping it down before it landed in her belly, and with it Dusk was free to thrash and struggle all her wanted, his screaming only making her hotter as she flopped onto her back, moaning in delight as her belly wriggled and thrashed, muffled screams and squirming hooves earning nothing but a thick belch from the satisfied thestral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk kicked and thrashed as hard as he could, but the acids were pouring in harder and harder, sapping his strength and soon covering him to the point that he couldn't breathe anything except the noxious liquid. The sad thing was that he had been engineered to breathe underwater, so he was kept alive even longer than he should have, watching as the acids turned red and his eyes began to burn as much as his skin. On the outside, she would just see a few weak twitches and some harsh lurches before it all went quiet with a CRACK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe satisfied mare laid back underneath the tap, drinking all the stew water, guzzling it and filling her belly. At least Dusk would drown part of her thought, but not even that as he kept on struggling and kicking, her belly bouncing and shaking until with a crunch it stilled again. Another belch and a saliva covered and acid eaten piece of black armour slammed onto the floor, the thestral clapping her lips together then sinking back with a snore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she eventually awoke her mind was completely blank... all memories of her life and who she was just gone. A good job that helpful huge stallion and his equally humongous cock was there to remind her that she was his cocksock... and with her body entirely stretched around the massive length, flared head poking from her jaw and her ass stretched massively she felt so good she wouldn't want to believe otherwise.</span></div></div>",

What was going on. She sniffed her sergeant, and he smelled delicious, then the tap and... oh. It was the water. She twisted the tap off and shook herself. \"Well, you're clean... and smell intoxicating... so... be careful with that,\" Moonbounce said, her mind somewhat addled by proximity to the scented stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh...what?\" He glanced at her, then shook his head and started walking again, shaking himself off. The smell would likely remain for a while, at least until he was washed with something that was either actually water or...not the stew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk stepped out of the alley ahead of Moonbounce, who was clearly salivating over his rump this time, looking up to see where they were. To his delight, they were right at the entrance of the Slapped Ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached the door a pony came flying out the other way, their ass raw and glowing from what looked like the slapping to end slapping's \"If you come back 'ere you'll be going up my ass next time!\" A huge donkey mare brayed, giving her belly a slap. She snorted at the two newcomers, looking at Dusk and Moonbounce. \"I hope you two aren't looking to start trouble or we're going to have a problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk blinked, then looked at the donkey. \"Of course not, ma'am. We're just looking for someone. If that's a problem, I'm sure we can work things out.\" He smiled warmly, forgetting that he smelled like fresh beef stew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe donkey looked at Dusk, smelling him and licking her lips. \"Oh I'm sure we will. Antagonise any of my patrons, guard, and you'll end up a messy dump in my private toilet!\" she growled at him, then she stepped aside. \"Now get in there and drink yourself silly,\" she said, before returning back to the bar herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk smiled, blushing a slight bit as he recalled the last donkey he had been with. He found himself fantasizing, completely losing track until a sharp poke from Moonbounce brought him back to reality. \"H-huh? Oh, right. Uh...\" He stepped forward and entered the tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce shoved Dusk through the doorway and into the tavern. All around tables were full of all manners of creatures... and moast of them bloated with more than just beer guts. Drinks were all around, the air was heated and full of action, and there was too many faces to accurately scan at a glance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to split up, I think...\" Dusk said, already eyeing some of the mares. \"U-uh, er, for um...efficiency...\" he looked at Moonbounce with a confident smile. \"Unless you need to stick with me, rookie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce frowned. \"Split up? But this place actually looks super dangerous!\" she whined. It would be more efficient though. \"I guess I'll be fine... if we spot them though meet up at the bar. We're looking for a big grey dog remember!\" she called after him. With a sigh she turned to the chaos, looking for anything eye catching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk turned away and headed over to the opposite side of the room, starting to walk through and look around. He certainly saw plenty of eye catching mares, but not the one they were looking for, none were quite furry enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Moonbounce headed the other way, looking at everypony in detail, analysing faces as she stumbled past huge mares and musclehead stallions.</span></div></div>",

I haven't eaten all day and with flanks like yours...\" Nox's voice came from behind her, making the mare's eyes go wide as she assumed he had trotted off. \"Going to have to transfer you to the food department,\" the Thestral said with a greedy smile, his forked tongue licking his lips as he still had the delicious taste of Moon's rear on his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce's mind reeled at his words, the officer she had been waiting for, her commanding officer, deciding she'd serve him better as a meal than as a guard under him. It was almost enough to make her cry... but she wasn't going to let anypony chew on her rump! Her trademark bouncy rump cheeks suddenly shoved back with strength, bashing Nox in the snout and pushing him back, right into line as she lifted her two hind legs in a powerful buck. \"Get off of me!\" she shrieked as all the air slammed out of Nox's lungs, the officer letting out a wheeze before he stumbled back and landed on the floor with a slam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadet Moonbounce blinked as she turned around, looking around, and then down at the stallion who was still hacking out his lungs on the floor.

This pony was just plain mean, trying to eat her when she turned her back... but then her belly rumbled. Deciding not to let him just get up, she pinned him down, using one of the straps of his armor as a muzzle for his muzzle so he couldn't bite. She gave him a toothy grin. He looked back in fear as she opened her mouth wide as if to swallow him, before just giving his cheek a lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that wasn't very nice of you?\" She frowned at him shaking her head. \"I could have gotten really hurt. And besides if you were transfering me to the food department, I should be a bit more fat don't you think?~ Well I can see something fattening right in front of me~\" She giggled and put her mouth around his head, licking it while he got a good view of the back of her throat. She wasn't really planning to eat him, but she wanted him to have a good scare. Though now that she thought about it, for suck a jerk he did taste kinda good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was distracted from this line of thought when she felt something hard poking between her legs. She gasped, accidentally getting his muzzle to press in against the back of her throat for a moment. This was turning Nox on. She was threatening to eat him, and he was getting turned on. She could feel him trying to use what little movement he could with her pinning him to try and thrust into her. Though all he managed to do was rub Moonbounce's flower with the head of his cock. This made her blush, though it also turned her on a bit, her wetness leaking onto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly grumbled again, demanding food. And she did have something right in her mouth. Though swallowing it might get her in trouble, he was tasty. Then again perhaps if she spared him she could convince him to serve her. After all, this encounter proved how easily she could overpower him if he tried this stunt twice. Though either way, the jerk had gone and got her horny, and she would deal with that first.</span></div></div>",

The upright shaft was twitching like a living being itself as the Thestral sank her two curved teeth into that upright and throbbing slab of meat, digging in deep as Nox let out another cry of agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop! Please! Stop! I'll do anything!\" Nox whimpered, earning nothing but a wink from Moonbounce for his trouble... and then she began to suck hard, draining the blood from his thick sausage as her fangs sucked like twin straws. The thick, agitated blood was delicious, only helped by how the sergeant squirmed underneath her. Her rump lifted and slid back, her pulsing pucker and fragrant flower hovering over his face, giving him a show of her nethers... and then she sat back. Nox's screams became muffled, lost in her plump booty as she pinned him there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer amber eyes closed in pleasure as she drank from his shaft, each hard suck dragging a mixture of sweet blood and salty semen that had her moaning in delight. Her marehood ground against his muzzle as she lustfully rubbed herself against him, his snout squeezing in between those labial lips to press into her soft petals. She only moaned harder as his panicked breaths gushed into her, the mare's eyes rolling as she gave into the delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his own shaft retreated, growing flaccid under her bite, the thestral unleashed a wild shriek of pleasure, and let loose a powerful flood of sticky fluids, her pussy ejecting its sweet and sugary payload all over the stallion's face.

The stallion was still pinned under her, Nox gasping for air against her sopping wet marehood. The moist folds made wet slurps with each struggle from the pinned sergeant, but already it was so much weaker than before. The mare grinned as she ground her butt back, adding a bit more force to her heavy rump as she squeezed it against the stallion's skull, those heavy cheeks squishing against either side of his head, blocking any air from coming in from the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox's lungs burned, his muscles screamed. He needed air and he needed it bad. His hooves pushed up against those pudgy thighs, trying to shove off the heavy cadet who was all too eager to push back. His wings twitched, his hind legs kicked, but there was nothing he could do. That plump pussy kept on grinding against him, giving only sickly juices to slurp and no air to survive. His face was turning blue, his limbs growing sluggish as he choked beneath the mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare wouldn't give in now, not when she was having so much fun. She felt his meagre pushes and struggles, the stallion having no hope of lifting her with his muscles so weak. Each desperate inhalation and panicked exhalation pushed into her marehood, his dying sounds echoing into the depths of her vagina. She squeezed harder, clenching her ass cheeks and adding pressure, compacting the soft and doughy pudge of her butt around his bony skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe struggling stallion gasped and panted, torturous chokes the only result from his desperate attempts to take a breath, to fill his deflated lungs and give him a moment longer... but things only got worse. The mare's plump butt squeezed him in deeper, the pillows completely blocking off everything. She wouldn't see his eyes go red as vessels burst, but she would feel his twitches, and spasms, no longer controlled, seemingly random... and then he stopped. His muscles all tensed and then they relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce felt the lift leave him, the mare sighing as she snuffed out the stallion. She rested there a moment longer, when she felt something wet coating her thighs. She blinked and looked down, seeing a spreading puddle of liquid coming from the stallion's thighs and across the floor. It felt warm against her fur. It was then she realised what it was. The mare jumped up and out of the pool of piss, her eyes locking on his sheath as it twitched, a last spurt of golden fluid leaking from the tip and onto the floor. \"Eww...\" the mare responded, reaching down to dry her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a door slamming open made her almost piss herself and add to the puddle, the mare jumping almost out of her skin. \"What's going on in here, a rookie heard screaming!\" a buff black earth pony growled. The two ponies at his side were already staring at her, and then he was too, their jaws dropping at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce still had blood on her face from her meal, it especially staining her fangs. Her crotch was a mess of her vaginal juices, and her hooves soaked in piss. On the floor before her was the corpse of Sergeant Nox, his face blue and eyes bulging out of his head. \"I... I can explain...\" Moonbounce began. She didn't get a chance to scream before the three guards jumped her, slamming her to the floor and straight down into the piss puddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bucking bitch! Pretend to be a rookie just so you can kill a sergeant?!\" the black stallion roared in her ears as the other two hurriedly threw on hoofcuffs and a wing binder. The black stallion ground her against the floor, his hooves weighing heavily on her, threatening to crack her bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bulldozer! Loosen up. Let the others take care of her,\" one of the guards urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she just signed her own death warrant,\" the other added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulldozer kept the pressure on, Moonbounce squealing as he her bones groaned... but then Bulldozer lifted off. A hoof grabbed the back of her neck and lugged her up and to her hooves. \"You hear them, bitch? You're going down permanently for this,\" he hissed at her. With a tug she was dragged forwards, the guards encircling her in an escort formation. They marched her out of the barracks... but where were they heading?</span></div></div>",

No, all decisions had to go through the princesses themselves, the monarchs of this land. Surely, from what Moonbounce had heard of them, they would be reasonable. She knew she would never get away without punishment, but the princesses did have a reputation for being kind...one of them, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe throne room was an imposing sight for anypony, and twice as much so when one was being dragged across the floor while accompanied by two armed guards and a heavy, angry stallion. She supposed that she was lucky she was in the throne room...they wouldn't dare to hurt her in the princess's presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the meaning of this interruption?\" Celestia asked. That didn't sound promising. She was clearly not in much of a caring mood. As Moonbounce was dropped to the floor and the guards stepped aside, she was able to gaze upon the princess herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was magnificent, her gleaming fur and ever flowing mane and tail shining as the sun shone down on her from the many windows around them. She did have...an odd amount of pudge on her rump and stomach, though Moonbounce only observed for a moment before looking away. She had completely zoned out while Bulldozer explained the situation in a surprisingly calm manner, given how angry he really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia sighed, putting down the papers she had been holding in her magical vice. \"Thank you, Corporal. You all may leave now. I will require privacy for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards and corporal glanced at each other before bowing respectfully and marching out, shutting the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce was terrified, to say the least. The princess seemed almost too calm, her eyes closed as she kept herself calm and considered her options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I am sure that you have some kind of explanation for this, correct? It seems you do not fully understand the gravity of your situation.\" She said gravely, opening her eyes. Those piercing purple orbs sliced right through Moonbounce's soul, making her quiver where she sat. In a feeble attempt to save herself, she explained what had happened, hoping that a fellow mare could relate in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia once again took a deep breath. In a way, she could in fact see that the bat mare's actions were, in some ways, justified. However, her handling of the situation lead to the death of a high ranking soldier and that, unfortunately, could not go unpunished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was about to stand up, a low, rippling growl came from deep within her stomach. She hadn't had a chance to eat today, she realized. She had been extremely busy with paperwork, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could easily use this criminal to sate her hunger, but that would hardly look good on her record. Then again...no pony would find out. Still, she thought, deep down this mare didn't deserve death, but who was she to care about who deserved it or not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Had Moonbounce been more controlled in her response, then this would of been clear cut. Unfortunately the fact remained Moonbounce had killed a superior officer, and all of the guard would be baying for her blood. Sending her to the prisons would likely end with one of the guards devouring her in revenge\u2026 no, there was only one solution that would be the best for all parties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer horn began to glow and Moonbounce was pulled up and to her hooves. The Princess looked down at her, then crouched down to give the guardspony a light nuzzle. \u201cI am sorry, Private Moonbounce. I feel for you, I do, but I cannot let this go unpunished,\u201d she declared. \u2018Besides, I\u2019m rather peckish and you look delicious\u2019 she added as a mental note. \u201cGuards!\u201d she then called loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door instantly opened again and Moonbounce\u2019s escorts marched in, stood behind the Corporal. They looked at Moonbounce harshly, then up to the Princess. \u201cAre we to take her to the cells, Princess?\u201d Bulldozer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia shook her head. \u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary. This mare is to serve as my meal. A life for a life,\u201d she declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiles spread throughout the guards at Celestia\u2019s words, for all except Bulldozer. The large stallion snorted loudly, his forehead almost throbbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia smiled to see that Bulldozer no doubt had something planned that just fell through, no doubt he intended for his muscled gut to serve as her cell. \u201cMoonbounce, you are found guilty of murdering a superior officer,\u201d the alicorn boomed quite officially, then parted her lips, opening her jaw and stretching it wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce stood before the royal alicorn, watching as she dipped her head low and opened her maw. She could see deep inside the Princess of the sun's mouth, the saliva slickened walls of flesh pulsing, showing off the palate and the broad tongue, past her perfect rows of pearl white teeth. She expected the mare to swing her head forwards\u2026 but she didn\u2019t. She left it hanging before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTraitor, you are to enter her lips willingly! Only through acceptance will the digestion of your body also remove your sins!\u201d Bulldozer barked behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce flinched at the shouting, but then noticed Celestia nodding her head. She had to climb into those lips herself. The chubby thestral mare whimpered, but there really wasn\u2019t any choice. There was no running from Celestia, and the guards would love to take her down if she tried anything. She was stuck between a rock and a soft, wet tunnel. An armed and muscular rock that would break her neck accidentally she was sure. Celestia\u2019s eyes had a tinge of sympathy, truthfully all she could muster for her would-be meal.</span></div></div>",

Her soft grey hooves settled on Celestia\u2019s tongue and she could feel it squirming, no doubt tasting her. Moon took a deep breath and then slipped her muzzle forwards, pressing it between Celestia\u2019s soft lips and into the fleshy maw. Her chin rested in the cleft of the tongue as she adjusted her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon\u2019s hooves slid deeper, pushing over the tongue, soft buds dragging across even softer soles, making Moonbounce shudder at the odd feeling. Her hooves slid back to the dark drop that marked the entrance to the throat. With a push, she shoved her muzzle to follow, sliding her head deeper into those jaws, lips squeezing around her neck, tickling her shoulders. The light from the entrance to the mouth didn\u2019t travel that deep, merely illuminating the plush pink of the maw and no further. This was the final plunge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia wouldn\u2019t even swallow, forcing Moon to make the choice herself. For almost a minute Moonbounce refused to move, Celestia gently suckling her front half, slurping over her face with that broad pink tongue and savouring the delicious slightly apple based taste of the thestral. A soft moan from the yawning chasm of the throat carried up the acrid scent of acids, interrupting the gentle and soothing aroma of a maintained and scented maw, cutting through the sweetness for a second of bitter and sharp stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA last whimper and Moonbounce slipped forwards, pushing her head into the pulsating tunnel of the throat, immersing it into the moist and squishy darkness. Her shoulders slipped across the length of the jaws, her barrel slipping past Celestia\u2019s lips until the Princess was bordering on the delightfully chubby gut. Bulldozer could be heard laughing at the sight of the clear outline of a thestral\u2019s head bulging out that elegant swan neck, it stretched in such a way it showed off every detail of the trapped mare\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wriggle Moonbounce managed to force herself deeper, Celestia\u2019s only assistance her smacking lips and explorative tongue, the alicorn sighing in delight about how delicious this meal of hers was proving. The Luna Guard\u2019s plump stomach slid its way into those jaws slowly, allowing her to take her time with tasting it, delving into every nook and cranny of the pudgy gut, even brushing against the mare\u2019s naval and making Moonbounce squeak. Perfect, princessly teeth slowly dug into the plush padding, lightly nibbling in a way that didn\u2019t hurt, but just reinforced that the thestral was little more than food now, just a delicious treat for the Princess to enjoy before she resumed her day, perhaps casting a single thought her way only when her skull got lodged in her butt on the way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thestral\u2019s muzzle dived deeper, pushing down the long tunnel that squeezed and squished, slowly guiding her to her final destination. Her adapted to the dark eyes could make out the sphincter before her, a fleshy opening that kept her out of the belly. All it would take was a firm push and into the gut she would go, crammed into the swelling stomach to endure a potentially long and slow digestion. She didn\u2019t deserve this\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough another tug and Moonbounce managed to lodge all of her stomach into those jaws. The palate and tongue squeezed and squashed, playing with the fat gut even during the slow and eventual swallow. The throat bulged wider as the imprint of Moonbounce\u2019s head vanished, the thestral pressing the entrance open and being crammed into the gut. The acrid stench of gut cut through the air, making her shudder at the volatile, near toxic stench of powerful stomach acids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease be gentle\u2026\u201d Moonbounce whimpered as her head pushed downwards, dipping into the slight pool of stagnant acids. As the mare started to slowly curl up, her butt was being chewed by the Princess of the Sun. Such plush and delicious flanks put even Luna\u2019s to shame, the taste of that delicious rump one that had Celestia salivating all the more as she nibbled and sucked, slowly taking in the wriggling butt as it quaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulldozer couldn\u2019t hide the erection he was sporting, his significantly sized shaft solid at the teasing show of two bouncing and shaking rump cheeks, framed by the lips of none other than Celestia herself. The thestral\u2019s stretched cutie mark gave a last show, before it was claimed by a slurp, and then with an audible pop, Moonbounce finally managed to cram her ass cheeks inside, leaving just her hind legs and soft hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around Moonbounce was the gurgle of an eager to begin gut, but still she had no choice but to keep cramming herself inside of it. It took some work to slip her legs inside, having to shake her body, shifting a little of one inside, and then the other, giving the unfortunate side effect of shaking her distinct bulge inside the throat. All the guards watched mesmerised as the rounded bulge of her sizable flanks, so tight even the crack was clearly visible, danced back and forth, seeming to jiggle inside of the tight tunnel that swallowed them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hind legs sank completely, just two wriggling hooves for a moment, the last show of the thestral as they danced back and forth, trying to find the inside of Celestia\u2019s lips. When they did find those lips they kicked forwards, pushing herself into fleshy abyss completely, wriggling against Celestia\u2019s maw for a moment before they vanished into the throat and then downwards. The bulges on the outside vanished as all of the thestral ended up deposited in the royal stomach, swelling it out and making it sag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe deed is done. Justice has been served. Moonbounce is on her way to bein-\u201d *UUURRRRPPPP* Celestia blushed pink and covered her mouth with a hoof, but not before grey fur escaped her maw. She reached down, pressing a hoof into her gut, hearing it churn and gurgle\u2026 but there were no screams of pain. Even as Moon\u2019s flesh was being torn from her body, there would be no pain. \u201cYou may leave,\u201d Celestia said to the others before turning around and trotting back to her throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the backs of the others as they trotted away, Bulldozer\u2019s arousal clearly shaking between his hind legs as they left the throne room, leaving Celestia draped across her throne. \u201cRest well, my little pony,\u201d Celestia said softly as she massaged her swollen orb of a stomach, speeding Moonbounce\u2019s end. Towards the end the only comfort was there were worse fates than padding Celestia\u2019s flanks.</span></div></div>",

She blinked again, shaking off sleep but the rump didn't move. Her eyes then wandered to the curious tail, following it down to the oh so clear serpent head right at the tip with its jaws wide open and her hooves just slipping inside. \"Mother of Luna!\" Moon squealed, and instinctively tried to kick the serpent away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stretchy throat easily caught her kick, the soft hoof slipping inside the rubber like throat, pushing deeper instead of shoving the snake-tail away. \"Wasss hoping you wouldn't wake... sorry, Cadet, but there'sss no room in the Lunar Guard... but can't have you jussst leave...\" a very sybiliant and serpent like voice came from the mare.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Moonbounce had one shot at this. The mare closed her eyes, concentrating hard. As soon as she felt the throat ripple she flapped both wings hard as her hooves shoved in unison. Her soft hooves pushed against the slippery and smooth surface, pressing against the ridges and launching herself forward. The snake jaw tried to tighten, but it was fighting the powerful motion as the mare hurtled back, freeing herself with a pop and then... *THUMP* Moon had failed to take into account the very solid wooden headboard at the top of the bed, and it was all too happy to catch her attempted escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try, ssslippery one,\" the snake tailed mare hissed with a smirk. Moonbounce's head was swimming, the thestral's vision gone quite blurry thanks to the vicious hit on the head. She struggled to make out anything, but she could feel the wetness on her hooves again. She knew what was happening. Her hooves kicked weakly, pushing back against the serpent throat as it advanced up her once more, her delicate hooves squished against the snake's tongue, before a gulp pulled them into the throat. The saliva hadn't even dried on her ankles before it was replaced, the pair of green jaws sinking softly to grip her in place. \"Almossst a ssshame... with a body like yoursss you might have got an officer'sss attention,\" the mare repeated with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop...\" the thestral moaned weakly, her head still spinning as she shook it repeatedly, trying to focus on the shape in front of her, the form of the mare's flanks slowly coalescing. From the blurs of movement it seemed almost like her mane was alive too, the thick strands of hair curling and coiling. She could feel the snake advancing up her, another slip and it was at her thighs, the slightly rounded and tasty chunks of meat seeming to make that tail maw salivate harder, thick drool smearing over Moonbounce's fur as the jaws opened again and slipped up higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curving of the cadet's bouncy moons strained the snake jaw, it visibly dislocating as it pushed up, stretching wider and wider. \"Ooh, you really are a tasssty little thing,\" the mare teased as Moon's flanks were encompassed, sitting on the tongue a moment as the forked tip caressed her sphincter and marehood, making her moan lewdly for a second along with a loud slurp... and then another gulp as she was pulled back over her rear in her entirety. Her eyes seemed to finally stop spinning, only to focus on the brand new snakeskin skirt she was wearing all the way up to her waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-helllllp!\" screamed the cadet, which only earned a sybiliant laugh from the snake mare, her tail gulping again as those leathery wings were pressed against her back, the snake sliding up a little higher, stretching around her chest and squeezing her shoulders together. All Moon could do wa sshake her whole body, wriggling inside the snake like a skin tight bodysuit, the clear indentations of her compacted body showing with each wriggle and push as she tried to resist. Another slurp and the saliva was at her neck, her vision growing darker as the shape of the snake jaw pushed over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside it was moist and warm, the muggy breath of the tail serpent just like that of a real snake as it's forked tongue circled around her muzzle. Tears stained Moon's eyes as they got that last view of freedom, though framed by the image of those sharp fangs above. A whimper escaped as she realised this would be it, and then the snake slipped upwards. All became pink as the snake slid over her, and then black as its jaws shut together, sealing her inside its length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare sighed as she lifted up her now massive tail, it having stretched entirely over the mare and become a thestral sized and thestral shaped length of green, before it gulped again. The insides of it rippled, the entire thing one long throat that was intent on pulling as Moon felt herself dragged a few inches deeper, pulled down and into the main body of the mare, pushing into the digestive system through the same exit as the anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnakebite allowed herself a single moan, before she straightened up and stood tall once more. She was just doing her duty after all, as much as she enjoyed it. When the Royal Guard needed to take care of one of their own, Snakebite was the mare they turned to. She reached back with a hoof to carress the constantly sinking bulge, Moonbounce already up to her flanks in Snakebite's as she left the long expanse of tail on her journey to the stomach. \"Sssorry, but sssometimesss it can't be helped,\" she apologised to her meal. \"If it's any consssolation, you were deliciousss... I jussst hope you don't add too much to my rump.\" She gave her butt a quick prod to feel how curvy it was already, she couldn't do with getting fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce's only response was a series of muffled cries, the \"Mmmmppphhss!\" quite unintelligible as she was pulled from tail to butt, the snake's throat bulge already pretty much gone as Snakebite was left with a sagging equine belly, it already letting out the burble of duty as Moon would drop right into the acidic pit, ready to be gurgled up into pudge and waste. She was quite powerless to resist after all. Her shoulders were squelched through last, pulled into the belly through the rear sphincter and pushing it outwards with her trapped form. Already a hoof pushed back into her from the outside, making the belly slosh and jiggle before the loud gurgles began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnakebite let out a loud and sudden belch, a mess of silver hairs coming from her maw and littering over the bed. She clapped her lips together to savour the taste and then smirked. \"Mmm, you were a good one. Ssshame I couldn't ssswallow you with my jawsss,\" she told her weakly kicking stomach, patting it again as she saw the indents of hooves, and the push of a screaming muzzle as the mare inside desperately fought her demise. It didn't do her much good though. Snakebite's snake tail shook and then seperated apart, the head seeming to vanish as it became strands of snake coloured hair, matching her living mane as it fell back into position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rookie's who survived their first patrol wouldn't be back for a while, and such a big meal left Snakebite sluggish. The mare gave a yawn, before falling back onto the bed she had snatched Moon from, stretching out across it as she sank her head back into the very same pillow. She squished her hooves back against her belly, feeling it bouncing and wriggling as she yawned and snuggled into the covers. Nothing made her sleep better than a full gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later and Snakebite was on the move again. She passed many guards who looked at her swollen gut, knowing it was another of them that she had shown the error of their ways as she trotted with a brisk pace towards the public guard toilets. The only show of anything improfessional was the occasionl flutter of her split apart tail as puffs of gas escaped her rear. She soon arrived at the toilet, entering and picking the first one she saw, ascending the porcelain throne and then taking her seat upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second her flanks touched porcelain her pucker pushed open and one of the messy logs the rookie had become emerged from her rear, sliding out as a thick but squishy mess which slid from her anus and out into the toilet below with the ease of driving a train through a tunnel, a wet plop below signalling the breaking of water as it splashed down inside. The next was just as easy, as was the next after that, the only thing breaking apart the monotony of the sticky but smooth logs was the occasional large bone which refused to digest, or the itchiness caused by a ball of fur or mane that somehow survived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first few logs she felt a pressure in her urethra and she pursed the lips, a warm golden shower starting to pour from her, while another log prepared its descent into the toilet by sliding through her rear. There was a constant trickle from of yellow fluid, drizzling over the messy pile in the toilet before another log slapped onto the pile with a wet thump, a horrified skull popping out to bury into it as well. She made no noise or face as she rose up and cleaned herself, then flushed away yet another guard down the drain. She took a moment to examine herself in the mirror and frowned at her now plumper flanks. \"Damn it... now my moons are all bouncy...\" she growled under her breath. At least Moonbounce left something behind... Maybe next time she should think before acting...</span></div></div>",

Well she liked her stuff slightly burnt anyway as it was more crunchy that way. Then she heard someone screaming in pain, and was that the smell of burnt meat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce opened her eyes, rubbing them groggily as thestrals ran past her in retreat. As she yawned she noticed three things. 1, the mare in front of her was now extra crispy. 2, there was a large purple dragon in front of her. Also 3, there was a section of the barracks wall missing, how strange. Still being sleepy it took her a few moments to connect the dots. Though perhaps watching Nox, her commanding officer, get snatched up by the jaws of the beast, screaming in terror, helped her get some perspective on the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo obviously the dragon was attacking. Oh and its claw was coming down to crush her. Oh no. She jumped out of the way getting grazed by the claw across her flank which left her bleeding a little but otherwise fine. It was this that fully woke her up at least, though meanwhile half the barracks was now on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now that she knew what was going on, and was not half asleep she had some life changing decisions to make. Clearly this dragon had to have a plan if it was attacking the guards, right? Perhaps she could reason with it and convince it to let her join its team. Seriously, it was not fair that it was the only one eating ponies today. Though she could also run for it like the rest of her troop, after all dragons were dangrous. On the other hoof if she somehow defeated it she was guaranteed to be promoted on the spot, maybe she would get Nox's position since he was now slipping down a dragon throat.</span></div></div>",

He hoisted her up, eyes glaring at her as Moonbounce started to struggle and wriggle in his grasp. \"I could do a lot better than some small, weak, pony. I'll burn them out of their caves, crush them under my claws. If the guard can't win, what can a normal pony do?\" the dragon replied rationally, its claws tightenening as Moonbounce was squeezed like a rubber toy, her flanks seeming to get rounder as her belly was pressed inwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon parted its jaws, revealing those huge, sharp teeth, already stained with blood and scraps of fur. Moonbounce's eyes went wide as she saw Nox's whole foreleg still lodged between two sharp fangs, detached from the rest of the stallion. A bloodstained forked tongue snaked out from the jaws and slapped into Moonbounce's face, smearing a mix of saliva and blood over her grey fur as she shook her head desperately. \"Please! No! I'll do anything! Anything!\" Moonbounce screamed desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snort of laughter left the dragon's snout. \"All I want is for you to be tasty,\" he replied, before tossing Moonbounce forward, throwing her like a piece of popcorn into his wide open jaws, the mare landing with a splat onto his tongue. The dragon's jaws snapped shut with an audible clap, snagging Moonbounce's short tail and cleaving the rest of it off, making the mare squeak in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce was trapped. The dragon's maw was hot and humid, saliva smearing all over her coat and getting everywhere. She gagged as some of the still bloody fluid got into her mouth, and then the forked tongue rolled her back. \"No! No!\" Moon screamed, flailing her hooves up and trying to grab onto the fangs. They slipped on the saliva slick teeth and she managed a curt scream before she was swallowed back with all the saliva, sent tipping back and into the dragon's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no stopping her descent as she was sent sliding down the waterslide of the throat. Hooves pushed out, trying to grip ridges as the small spherical bulge was dragged down, pulled from the back of the mouth and dropped down towards the distant stomach, slipping and bouncing and sliding until she hit a sphincter and was squeezed through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a splash she landed in the sea of acid that was the dragon's stomach... just one of tens of guards who had found their way here. All around her she could see guards in various stages of digestion, a mess of bones and twisted flesh. Moonbounce screamed in horror... then screamed louder as hooves grabbed at her legs. Right before her eyes Nox reemerged from the acids, his face a mess of muscles and blood, stripped mostly of flesh and missing an eyeball. He screamed in agony and she screamed in horror, kicking him back and throwing him away. With a splash he vanished again, leaving nothing but a slow sequence of bubbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce wasn't going to last much longer. She screamed as her fur was burning off already, melting into the bubbling stomach fluids as it was like she was sat inside a cauldron. The bubbles from Nox's last breaths had all popped now, and soon she'd be another victim. The acids worked against her anus, burning her tailhole and searing her marehood as she squealed and kicked, but there was nothing to grab onto, nothing to save her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somepony save me!\" she screamed, words no doubt most of the guards had screamed as they had been shredded themselves... and soon she would be too. Her furless belly was already burning, the flesh searing under the assault of the acids. \"Stop it! Stop it!\" the pudgy mare screamed as she kicked, unable to resist those scorching and burning fluids as they ate away at her, surging inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlesh slipped from her legs, being torn apart as acids splashed over the muscles, over the bones that lay beneath. Her marehood seared and burned away, the lips being stripped and melted. Her pucker was torn apart, her anus melting inside of her and slipping out with a slew of blood. Moonbounce screamed in utter agony, but it still wasn't over yet. Her soft belly started to split, the flesh peeling apart in the centre like some kind of zipper and then all of her organs were exposed. In rushed the acids, her poor innards being assaulted in an acrid rush of burning and boiling acid, picking at her as she screamed and thrashed with what muscles weren't already shredded. Her stomach burst, her liver rotted, her heart was enveloped in acids. Her chest leaked a mixture of digested organs and blood, when with a last spasm, he finally went still and sank below the acids, just another victim in the dragon's gut. Her corpse would terrify the next pony to end up inside that belly... and soon so would all of Canterlot. If only Moonbounce had known that when making deals with a dragon, a little more humility goes a long way.</span></div></div>",

With a tip of her body her forehooves hit the ground a second later and a grin crossed her face. She knew just the thing to help her get in a sleepy mood, and also to make the best impression when she met Sergeant Nox. The mare took one last look around the bunkroom before turning and trotting back to the doorway, finding it hard to suppress the natural skip in her step and march professionally like a real guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reemerged into the hallway, taking a brief moment to look back into the other room. From the look of it they'd pretty much all paired up amongst themselves, the mulitcoloured horde of rookies gathering around something at the far end of the room. Moon sighed lightly. They were so lucky to already be jumping right into this, and she would of liked to have gotten to serve with the ponies she trained with, but Thestrals were pretty rare. The Lunar Guard was smaller and some would say more elite than the Celestial Guard, not being reduced to ceremonial roles and taking the more dangerous night patrols.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon realised she's been staring for almost half a minute before she shook herself. A quick look around told her noone had noticed her lapse and she put her grin back on as she turned around. \"To the showers,\" she told herself. It wasn't a long walk, and only the rhythmic tapping of her hooves on tiles kept her company as she made her way to the two large guard showerooms. In no time at all she was stopping as she reached them, turning to the doors. On one side was the door marked with a blue picture of a stallion, the other a pink picture of a mare. She lifted her hoof to push the mare door open and stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was greeted by the sound of rushing water already echoing across the room. Eleven showes were arranged across the back of the room, three against the back wall and four spreading out and up the sides. Wooden benches and metal lockers took up the rest of the space. Steam was filling the room, wafting out from under all of the closed curtains as it seemed every shower was in use at the same time. A squad must have coordinated on it or something. Moon sighed, not wanting to spend her time waiting around... maybe she should check the stallion showers? If they had the same curtain setup then as long as she made it into and out of the shower then nopony would know.</span></div></div>",

On a backdrop of running water came the humming of one particular mare as she no doubt scrubbed herself clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed of Moon waiting patiently when the sound of a door opening made her ear flick. She turned and looked over at the newcomer... and her jaw dropped. One of the hugest mares she'd ever seen was steadily waddling into the bathroom, her rump alone almost the size of Moon. All too tight golden armour struggled to contain such a bountiful amount of pink flab, it protruding out in folds from her gut. A strap was buried right up in there as it tried to hold the armout tight to her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon couldn't help but stare, watching as the mare stomped her way across the room, her heavy hooves crashing down as her entire body seemed to wiggle and bounce with every step. The clear splash of sweat had her cringe as the mare approached. Then the mare turned around. Moon's eyes went wide as she saw that massive flank right in front of her. Those legs started to bend and she had a split second to react.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately for Moon the mare's sweaty and thick crack was perfectly lined up with the thestral, sparing her from ending up utterly obliterated by those mountainous ass cheeks. Everything went dark as a loud squelch accompanied the heavy impact of that huge ass slamming against the bench. It squealed in protest as Moon was crushed up tight, moulded to the huge sweaty and downright nasty ass cheeks that rested on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn desperation Moon tried to push against those ass cheeks, but it was like shoving his her hooves into dough, the fat almost absorbing her hooves as she pushed, earning a moist squish and more sweat over her. \"N-No! Please! Get off!\" the thestral cried, when all that happened was the ass ground back down in response, pushing her harder against the wooden slats of the bench, which in turn pushed her harder into that crack. She could see the poorly cleaned pucker right up in front of her, and then the hole began to shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Fffffffffrrrrrrrrrtttttttttt* A hot and rancid blast of utterly foul smelling gas ripped right into her face, the ponut shaking as the horribly pungent and awful mess completely filled the ass crack. Moon screamed at the stench, coughing and spluttering as it filled her lungs, making her squirm all the more as she tried to get any clean air, or better yet to slip out. All she wanted was a shower... and now she actually needed one thanks to all this mess. All she had to do was survive until the mare stood back up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes and more blasts of filthy ass gas later and finally the mare's rump shifted. It pushed back against Moon for a moment, making her squeal, and then up it finally rose... with the mare still crammed inside. If anypony had seen the huge mare trot, they might have noticed the kicking and wriggling silver hind legs, but sadly that was not the case. All that wobbling flesh was pretty tight... but maybe if Moon pushed off she might be able to slip free.</span></div></div>",

Every step the mare took had that rump quaking and shaking, the vibrations pushing up and down as Moon flailed. She had to time it... When the mare's fat shifted up the thestral rammed both hooves as hard as she could into the ass, burying them into the cheeks... then she heard a squelch. Her hooves were wet and sticky... Oh... oh no. Moon flailed even harder as she felt something pulling her forewards, dragging her deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlurp. The first tug of her hooves pulled her forwards, dragging her muzzle deeper and then she saw that massive, puckered ponut. \"No! Stop! Stop please!\" she screamed into the ass, her words going right into the pucker before her muzzle was set to follow. Already rank air instantly became a lot worse as she was shoved inside, the rubbery rim flexing as it begain to slide over the Thestral's face, pulling her in deeper. Muffled cries carried on as Moon's head was rammed into the stinking, slimy depths, the tailhole closing and squeezing around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of running water started up, the heated water already starting to pelt her legs, running down the huge mare's crack and washing over Moon's fur... making her nice and wet. The thestral desperately tried to push backwards, wobbling her body so that she might slide out... but the anus refused to give up its meal. Another hard tug and her water slicked fur made it to the edge... and made it nice and easy for that hard slurp. Suddenly Moon's entire middle was crammed into ass, it sliding all the way until her two hindlegs were all that remained, her desperately wriggling hooves the only part of her on the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming started up as the mare started to wash herself, bending her muzzle down to get her forelegs and lifting her ass nice and high. A last slurp and those Thestral hindlegs sank, two silver hooves giving a last wriggle before they were fully consumed, condemning the Thestral to the tight and long tunnel of those bowels. A last scream for help was sent rushing out along with a long and acrid blast of pure ass stink. Those fat ass cheeks shook as a few silver hairs scattered from her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteadily the bowels pulled, the long tunnel tugging on the mare and squeezing her forwards, pushing her further upwards. It was hot, slippery, and stunk even worse than the outside of the ass. Worse than all that though was how it pulsed, the walls throbbing as they tugged at the mare, pulling her deeper, pushing her up from the bowels and into a more acrid portion of the digestive system. The intestines were hot, the air inside stinging and smelling of acids... and it would only get worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon made it to the belly after a long and painful journey, having been dragged through miles of intestines, slathered in burning acids and only finally making it into a gut so large she had room to stretch out. She knew now she should fight but she couldn't muster the strength after her struggle all the way up until this point. She lay there, floating in acids, feeling them burning her back, watching as clumps of fur and wing bones floated up around her, the acids slowly dying red. With a last whimper she dunked herself, and she wouldn't come up for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother long and gassy outburst came as the mare stepped out of the shower, the huge mare reaching back to scratch her rump. Moon would barely add any bounce to those already huge cheeks... Sometimes staying still is the best option...</span></div></div>",

Sweat slathered over her back, a tail tickling her hoof as she came so close to becoming a pony pancake, barely clearing the bench. With a thump she lands on the floor, hearing the squealing protest of the wooden bench and feeling very glad to have moved. Almost kissing the ground Moon panted in relief, rolling onto her back. Her eyes opened again when she felt something dribbling over her head. She blinked, seeing sweat cascading from above, staring right at a pair of colossal hooves right over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the way the mare leaned over all four of her hooves were on display, huge sweaty circles with distinct frogs etched in the centre. Then they started to fall. \"No-\" she started to cry as they slammed down through the air. All the pressure came down at once with an all too audible squelch, the hooves slamming in unison as the Thestral went from no pressure to the heaviest weight she had ever felt in an instant. her body had no chance of holding up, the sheer pressure so intense that her body was reduced from solid to liquid, splattered into a sweatstained silver goop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon's one foreleg that hadn't ended in the hooves' shadow twitched as the rest of her was utterly pounded into paste beneath the massive mare hooves. Sticky and nasty hoofsweat slathered all over the smushed batpony goop. The huge mare sighed, not even seeming to realise as she absent mindedly wriggled her hooves on top of Moon. The thestal paste was crushed entirely under the colossal weight. Moon's forehoof joined the rest of her as a puddle of mare goop, leaking out from underneath those foul hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as a shower freed up the mare stood up, a moist splat coming from the puddle she was now stood in. She lifted a hoof and shook it, scattering some silver goop. \"What did I stand in?\" she asked herself before shrugging and stomping her way into the shower, unaware of the thestral she had dealt with using her hooves. As she trotted towards the now empty shower, silver coloured hoofprints were left in her wake. Moonbounce should have been quicker on her hooves...</span></div></div>",

The stallion showers seemed to be nearly identical to the mares, with the exception of blue undertones on the curtains and walls rather than the pink in the mares shower room.

Being part of the Guard was what she had been bred to be. Besides, as so often before, all the thrill of the day combined with the missed lunch had left her starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopping off her bed, she wandered into the general direction of where she surmised the kitchens to be. Moonbounce had no clue how eager the chefs would be to serve an errant guard (much less a thestral) to an untimely snack, but if the worst came to worst she could always practice her sneaking skills on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare didn\u2019t need to travel far until a promising scent made her nostrils tingle. Heading towards the smell lead her to a pair of large doors, one of which had the word \u201ckitchen\u201d burned into the woodwork.

Should she walk in, perhaps interrupt something, or return back with an empty belly?</span></div></div>",

What sort of a guard she\u2019d make if she couldn\u2019t risk that much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, since there was no point wasting an opportunity of sneaking around a bit, Moonbounce narrowed the door open carefully, mindful of the mere shadow of a creak. When enough room had appeared for a row of mice to march through, she slipped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a kitchen, the room offered no surprises. Kettles, pans and cutlery hang from the ceiling over a couple of sturdy tables packed high more cooking equipment. A lone pot churned on one of the stoves, next to a huge oven. Nopony seemed to be around. Nopony except whoever made the noises from beyond the smaller door at the end of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCareful not to disturb anything, Moonbounce sneaked next to a shelf packed with what appeared to be leftovers from the previous meal. As she quietly munched on various salads, carrots and bread, her ears sketched the scene the noises originated from. Not that she was eavesdropping, no \u2013 it was hardly her fault she was born with the ears of a bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of listening, there was no doubt about the matter. Someponies were having sex in what must\u2019ve been a storage. The muffled groans, wet slaps, quick panting, scraping of hooves against the floor were all telltale enough for a mare grown up with four elder, uninhibited sisters. Moonbounce wondered who they were that had risked their jobs for lust. Perhaps one of the maids had finally moved forward with her crush on one of the cooks? Or possibly a couple of her fellow guards had developed a bond deeper than brotherly. The possibilities galloped in her mind, even as she felt a stirring in her own loins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagination had always been somewhat of an abundant resource for Moonbounce. Two sweltering bodies pressed tight against one another; a hungry tongue licking the mare\u2019s neck, drinking her sweat; a pair of hips thumping in unison, their flesh sweet and bendy as honey\u2026 the visuals all came effortlessly for the thestral mare, who by now was doing a lot more listening and a lot less eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny \u201cmeep\u201d rolled off her lips as she brushed at the wetness gathering between her hind legs. Encouraged by one louder moan from the storage, she dipped a hoof into her folds, carving a path across the labia. A shudder joined her second moan. On the way back, her knees buckled. After blunting the initial edge of sensitivity, she set on a steady rhythm, keeping pace with the lovers next door as best as she could. In turns she was the mare bounded from behind atop a flour sack, then the stallion hilting a snug, wonderfully tight pussy all the way to the balls. She squeezed her eyelids tighter, increased her efforts, driven stupid with lust by the risk of being exposed, both sides of which she now enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her best clopping, the much-sought peak eluded her longer than she could afford. At any moment somepony could walk in, and then what? The thought was a needle inside the slick, pink cloud her thoughts had turned into. She couldn\u2019t keep going like this forever. Either she\u2019d leave now, or\u2026 or she\u2019d see just how bad the ponies around here were.</span></div></div>",

Either they\u2019d let her join in the fun or she\u2019d tell about them to Sergeant Nox. The dice rolling through the air, Moonbounce yanked open the storage door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, friends,\u201d she started. \u201cOff to a busy day, aren\u2019t weeeeee\u2026 e?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice trailed off at the sight before her. Inside the storage room there were indeed two ponies having sex; a stallion pounding a mare against a stack of sacks. By the looks of his breastplate he was a guard, while the mare\u2019s apron hinted at an occupation in cleaning. It was just as Moonbounce had imagined it, and yet completely, horribly different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing was the stud. Instead of the muscled, healthy creature of her fantasy, Moonbounce faced a skinny, scrawny nag. Through the pale grey fur, his ribs were showing. Yet he didn\u2019t seem that old. The general appearance was as if life itself had been sucked from him like juice from an orange, and what was left behind was but a mere dried-up husk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing Moonbounce noticed explained the first one, in a flash that left a red-hot thought blazing in her mind: a changeling. The mare\u2019s eyes, which had nailed on Moonbounce the moment she had entered, flashed green, and her innocent features warped into a feral snarl. With one swift motion she straightened herself, shoving the almost mummified stallion on the ground where he stayed like a drained fruit. Another snarl and she lunged towards Moonbounce, who had half a moment time to react.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her blank mind suddenly flooded with panic, Moonbounce did what all cadets were taught to avoid on their first day on duty \u2013 exposed her back to the enemy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe results spoke for themselves in no time as the weight of the changeling hit her on the back and brought her down hard. Her jaw hit the floorboards, and the pain flared in her whole skull. She tried to turn around, but instead she froze at the unexpected whisper right beside her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEavesdropping is a bad habit,\u201d said the changeling\u2019s voice, clad in the husky tone of a mare. \u201cDon\u2019t you know curiosity killed the bat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuelled by anger and fear, Moonbounce hurled herself around on the floor. Her kick missed the belly of her assailant, but gave the thestral a precious second to get up. The changeling came at her again, rearing and kicking. Moonbounce, her mind still set on getting the buck out of here and sounding an alarm, tried her best to defend herself while shuffling backwards. As everything she had ever learned in her (all too short) training clogged her thoughts, she utterly failed to notice a leftover sandwich she had dropped on the floor earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slippery mayonnaise did its thing and sent her tumbling again. This time, the changeling didn\u2019t waste a moment on sweet-talk. While Moonbounce fought to restore her balance, the fake mare grabbed the churning pot and hurled its boiling contents over the thestral\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearing agony blinded Moonbounce. She screamed, the scalding liquid seeping into her eyes and sensitive ears. Desperately she tried rubbing it off, only burning her hooves too in the process. Another scream climbed up her throat, this time for help, but the steaming broth met it halfway, burning her tongue and turning her shout into a pitiful squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is almost too easy,\u201d said the changeling from somewhere beyond the painful blackness. \u201cI can\u2019t see how we didn\u2019t conquer your pathetic city on the first go. It\u2019s a disgrace we were ever defeated by the likes of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears pushed past Moonbounce\u2019s swelling eyelids. Never before had she felt this devastated; not even when one of her sisters had stolen her coltfriend right under her muzzle. She had to get out of here; she had to warn Sergeant Nox of a changeling infiltrator. She couldn\u2019t fail her country, her city, her family like this\u2026 Crying, she began crawling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, what to do with you,\u201d chatted the changeling. \u201cIf nothing else, you\u2019ve posed me the problem of hiding your dead body. That storage can\u2019t hide another one. Definitely not one as fat as you. And on top of everything else, I have to cook up a new broth. Oh dear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long, pregnant silence followed. Moon liked it none. Hopelessly she headed towards the door. She could just about make out its contour in the blur of her vision. Behind her, metal scraped table as a frying pan was picked up. Just a little bit more, forced Moonbounce herself to think. Just a few meters; just a little; just a\u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Moon came around, the pain was still there, insistent as ever. In addition, she found herself to be tied around her own legs. The memories dropped on her like hammer blows, and the picture they formed was beyond believing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp!\u201d she managed to shout. Her burned throat objected, making her wheeze. Blinking, she saw the changeling-mare approach her. Looking at her upside down, she saw the text \u201cKiss the chef\u201d written on her apron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp!\u201d tried Moon again, but in vain. The end of her feeble efforts came in the form of a big, red, shiny apple, which the changeling jammed into her mouth. Her own fangs trapped the fruit in place, ensuring it would not come off unless they did. Like a large barrel, the changeling begun rolling her across the kitchen floor, talking all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny, I\u2019ve never tried cooking bat before. I wonder if you\u2019ll taste like apples. Maybe I should make a dessert out of you! In any case, it will be the first time for the Guard\u2019s officers too, so they won\u2019t have a clue where you suddenly disappeared. Just another cadet who couldn\u2019t stand the pressure, they\u2019ll think, even as they drift off with bits of you digesting in their bellies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon struggle as furiously as she could, but the ropes around her had been expertly knotted. Through watery vision she watched as the face of the oven approached ahead, already emanating heat worse than that of the sun. For the second time in her life, she trembled in this kitchen. Right before her head was pushed into the oven, she broke and let out a sobbing chorus of prayers, threats and screams, all muffled by the sweet, delicious apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warmth hit her face like a wall, forcing her eyes shut, flattening her ears against her skull. The changeling pushed in until her muzzle hit the iron grid on the other end. It burned worse than anything she could imagine. The apple was already sizzling inside her mouth. Behind her, the changeling had trouble closing the oven door, for Moon\u2019s generous butt would not fit all in. The bug attempted everything from ramming the ass in with a crowbar to cutting a slice off of it, but eventually she had to let the pudgy rump stick out of the oven like the new Moon over the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, it was all hell. Every centimeter of Moon\u2019s fur felt needle-stuck, from her ears all the way to her still moist pussy. The modest layers of fat on her sides and underbelly quivered, sweltering all over the merciless grid sinking into her thighs. Her dark, messy mane dried quickly and almost caught fire while it pressed against the sides of the furnace. Even the burns in her throat renewed as the juice boiling from the apple trickled there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, when Moon had spent a good while fluctuating on both sides of consciousness, her steaming, strongly tanned body was pulled outside and laid on the floor. The whites of her eyes had popped out and ran all over cheeks, her sensitive ears were all but ruined, but somehow Moon got the picture that the changeling stood over her, sharpening a butcher\u2019s knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA plump beef such as you should spent hours in there,\u201d said the voice far away, \u201cBut since I\u2019m already late on schedule, I\u2019ll have to serve you practically raw. Don\u2019t worry though: it\u2019s nothing a thick sauce couldn't cover. Aww, don\u2019t look like that. It\u2019s not every day a mere cadet gets to dine in the officers\u2019 table!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the knife kissed her meaty, steaming shoulder, Moon finally drifted off, and didn\u2019t come back. The changeling removed the better part of her shoulders, sides and rump, then cut them into bite-size pieces, which she fried in a strong-flavoured apple sauce before adding them to the new broth. In her mind she had decided a bat should taste like apple, and by Chrysalis she\u2019d do just that. In the officers\u2019 feast the delicacy merited an ocean of praises, although one colonel complained she had found a long, dark hair in her bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leftovers Moon had left behind the changeling packed into a crate out of sight. Later in the evening she\u2019d empty it into an alley, where the local stray cats and dogs would finish what was left of Cadet Moonbounce. Like as not, she\u2019d end up going on her patrol on the nightly streets after all, in the dozens of feline and canine bellies that had gorged themselves on her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The second difference between the two was that only the latter was reinforced with iron bands. The Guard prefered to keep its food unstolen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the echo of the mighty crash had died down, Moonbounce opened the door, heart bouncing. The changeling-mare had all but stunned herself, it seemed. With her eyes vigil for any movement, Moon stepped over her and hurried to check the vital functions of the guard. Still shocked, she recognized him as the same orange stallion who had asked her on patrol earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d she said, shaking his limp form. \u201cHey. Wake up. Wake up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe misty gaze flickered. Two hazy pupils turned to her, but didn\u2019t seem to see much. His pulse was nearly non-existent. Moon had heard stories of what happened to ponies who had mated with a changeling, yet seeing the truth of it with her own eyes was something completely different. In Moon\u2019s chest, a wave of nausea rouse to a high tide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d she said, more gently. \u201cYou did good. Really. You did well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon did not know if the pony heard her anymore, or understood, but perhaps her calming voice was enough to stir one last smile on his ghastly face. After that, the grey eyes clouded beyond seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t even ask his name, Moon thought. She sniffed, dazed by the moment. Then her ears pricked, alert at the shuffling behind her. The changeling was coming around. Moon stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot unlike a moment ago, a choice flashed its twintail before her deadpan expression.</span></div></div>",

Unflinching, the pools of carmine studied the stirring figure on the floor. She could hear the changeling\u2019s heartbeat better than she heard her own. A thin layer of saliva gleamed on her fangs, cooled by the hiss of her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhah\u2026?\u201d said the changeling. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d A light of some sort lit inside her head, which snapped at Moon. The creature\u2019s ears flattened at the sight of the thing staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaving fun?\u201d Moon whispered. She took a step forward. \u201cFirst time in Canterlot, right? Thought to make the most of it before returning to your sunforsaken hole of vermin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changeling scrambled up. She tried to gather another snarl, but a sharp hiss from Moon had her covering like a pup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI surrender!\u201d she yelped. \u201cI surrender! I\u2019m just a spy, not a soldier!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA spy\u2026\u201d repeated Moon. Another step. \u201cJust a spy\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terrified mare retreated into the kitchen. \u201cYes! I\u2019m not dangerous! I surrender: that means you can\u2019t beat me! You have rules. I know you have rules.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re just a spy,\u201d said Moon, \u201cWhat was he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changeling gulped, then looked at the direction of Moon\u2019s pointing hoof. A consolidating, nervous smirk spread on the sweating cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt ripped apart along with the creature\u2019s throat as Moon\u2019s fangs sank into it. She moved like a shadow, or how shadows would move if they ever did. She couldn\u2019t have explained how she did it; powers old as her race were in play now, tearing their way all the way from her spine into her teeth. Stuck deep into the flesh of the mare, they drank like they had never before. The changeling\u2019s struggles soon turned into twitches. The two throats undulated together, exchanging the nectar of life in liters. And it tasted so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last slurp, Moon let the changeling drop on the floor. She was all pale now, her gaze very much like the orange stallion\u2019s, right before he passed away. Moon gave a slow lick at her lips, wiping the few errant drops of blood. It had been fulfilling, more so than any other dinner she had ever had, but right now that wasn\u2019t enough. Not nearly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started from the mare\u2019s belly. The teeth like knives cut the flesh easily, separating a good mouthful of fresh flesh, which Moon wolfed down in one piece, right before going for seconds. Smacking, tearing sounds filled the kitchen while she feasted. By the time she had chewed her way into her insides, the changeling gave one last gurgle. Moon watched her idly while devouring an intestine like a long sausage. The changeling\u2019s meat wasn\u2019t as delicious as her blood, but at least there was more of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her belly, the juiciest part of the bug looked to be the thighs, which Moon munched enthusiastically until she arrived at the peak of her meal. The shapeshifter\u2019s ripe cunt wafted a full, rich aroma, which was a treasure on its own right. Moon took her time with the pussy, nibbling the puffy lips and the row of tits above them until she was drooling all over the dinner. Then she closed her jaws on the pussy in one massive bite, relishing the taste with every bud of her tongue. Having finished the labia, she dug her muzzle deeper, only to be most pleasantly surprised by all the seed the orange stud had pumped the mare full of before surrendering his life. It was like eating a creampie, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, a loud burp signalled the end of Moon\u2019s limit. She rolled onto her flank, belly bulging handsomely. In her post-meal stupor, a funny gurgle was enough to make her giggle and to tease out a series more with her hoof. Eventually that made her burp out a strip of meat, which she curled right back with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince falling asleep next to two corpses wasn\u2019t something Moon cared to explain all that much, she eventually got up and headed back towards her quarters, butt and stomach swaying. In the back of her mind she had a vague idea that somepony would have to clean up this mess at some point, but it would not definitely be her. After all, all she had intended to have was a little snack, which, technically, she had.</span></div></div>",

She wasn't going to interrupt, but she wasn't going hungry either. Maybe there'd be something in the dining hall. She turned away from the door, her lack of armour helping her body to bounce and sway with each step as her most alluring gait was sure to show off her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she passed an open door, a sweet scent hit her nostrils. She blinked, then stopped. Was that cake? She backed up and looked through the wide open door of some important officer. She trotted over and peeked through the door... empty. Her stomach growled as she looked at the cake again, her tongue licking across her lips. \"Just... a little slice,\" she said to herself, giving in and trotting through the doorway. She pulled the door shut as she entered, it sealing behind her with a click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cake stood before her beautiful. It was a two layer cake, with a nice frosting around the edge and an odd little flower at the top perfect to sniff even. The edges were rather strange as they had an abundance of the sweet creams of a cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce licked her lips, giving another look at the office. Was this Accipiter's? She saw pictures that had to be the pegasus scattered around, and then the name plaque on the table sold it. She really shouldn't try this cake... stealing from an officer... but it looked so good! And a butt like hers couldn't stay plump on veggies alone! She bit her lip thoughtfully with one of her sharp fangs, poking at it. </span></div></div>",

Just a sniff and she would leave... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got frosting up her nose, and the sudden agitation seemed to make the flower somehow twitch before it rose. The flower seemed to suddenly press into Moonbounces face, and then spread somehow. The flower of frosting was sudden over her head as she would fail to see the cake rising. A laugh breaking the air as the cake mare rose up forcing the muzzle right into the crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha~ Only took a few tries but I finally got you in just the right place alone,\" a voice stated, seeming to come from the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce got the scent of frosting as drops of it flicked into her nose. The flower bud before her twitched, and then it pushed back. Her amber eyes went wide as the flower of the cake pushed back and spread over her face, a loud slurp carrying it around her muzzle and to her neck. She gasped as her breath was suddenly full of Cake... and butt. What was happening?! \"Mmmphh!\" she protested, raising her hooves to try and push the cake when she heard a voice... what was happening? Who was talking?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was against a rather soft and squishy interior of something, alongside a heavy smell of baked goods and enough sugar to give her diabetes. She was suddenly pulled upward as the cake pony grunted to start pulling her into her rump. The interior made somewhat more of dough than cake at the point she was at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce flailed as she felt something pull her deeper, dragging her into something. Even though it smelled delicious and sweet, she knew that something very bad was happening. Her muzzle pushed between the cheek-like mounds of cake, and into the bud, pressing deeper and deeper as the rim slipped over her head, squeezing her into a doughy passage as she struggled and cried out in muffled yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally gotcha~\" The cake pony said as her stomach soon sat bloated and full on the desk. She pressed her frosted gut happily enjoying the full feeling hoping she could get out of the dangerous guard nest soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce had no idea who wanted to eat her and why, but it was clearly happening. Her slightly pudgy belly squeezed in between those two cake cheeks, her own bouncing butt soon following as it was squeezed tight into the buds. Her hind legs kicked and wrigged, trying to pull herself out as the Cake pony draped across the chest, her huge belly bouncing and wriggling with the form of her prey, muffled screams coming from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good good good~ you feel nice and lively~\" The cake pony pressed down more against her belly, enjoying herself more and more. She even felt herself leak a little butter cream at the enjoyable sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriggling thestral legs squeezed together, pushing against one another as they were slurped up into the bud, dragged inside in an instant. Only her hooves remained for a second, wriggling in place, feeling cream leaking over them before a pop claimed them both. Her attempts to struggle pushed the imprint of hooves and a muzzle out against the stomach, causing it to stretch outwards in that spot as the guardspony fought for her life against the cake trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad !\" The cake mare said, suddenly pressing on her gut. \"You are ruining my frosted coat,\" she said as she tried to force her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHooves mashed against the bulge that Moonbounce made, the belly wall squeezing inwards under the hoof and against the Thestral. \"No! Please! Don't digest me! I'm not Accipiter!\" she screamed, fighting to be heard over the gurgling gut and muffling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" the cake pony cried incredulously as her head shot up. \"Then who the buck are you? Why are you in his office!\" She demanded as she pressed on her gut hard to threaten her meal. Though there were few that would shout that out suddenly at the realization of what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce heard the voice finally twist and she opened her mouth to speak when the cake mare shoved down hard. There was a loud squelch and Moonbounce splattered into the acids, the hard squeeze ending her much too quickly... and robbing the cake mare of any more answers, just leaving her with a large and sloshing belly of mystery mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great....\" Cake mare said as she rolled onto her back. It would take a bit for her bely to shrink back down, and she had a high chance of being caught with her stomach gurgling away in there. She pressed it as the bat pony was reduced to dough and a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce was a mass of dough, ready to be reshapen as she sloshed about in that gurgling stomach, the cake mare's belly much too big for her to curl back up again. Her hooves sank into the stomach, pushing and squeezing it as she tried to compact the remains, and not end up getting discovered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed even thinking of trying to press her stomach into a book if it would work. She just needed to get it shrunken, or at least emptied. \"Stupid gut... can't even rush this out,\" she said with a grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce left plenty of mush... very inconvenient mush that her stomach steadily processed. All the gurgling and glorping working her down, melting her into a big load of chocolatee to drop. Even though she grumbled her pats and squeezes were working... though where she should dump them out was a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe just back on the plate...\" the cake pony suggested. She could slip out afterward hopefully and figure out something. She felt her stomach starting to compact finally at least. The pony within no longer even recognizable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly still refused to compact completely... but it was reducing in size. Even though it still gurgled she could feel some of the rich chocolate already pushing back against her rear. She could squeeze it as she digested if she really strained, the benefit of a powerful, predatory system designed for ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed. Her stomach acid was actually a rther thick frosting, much like everything else about her. She wanted to be done and to get out of there. She heard a pony pass outside and stopped moving, glad that it seemed to have gone. It took several more minutes before the gurgling stopped, only a steady slosh remaining from the liquified remains inside her gut, the mare guard mushed up into chocolate mulch, ready to be released. She rolled onto her gut so she could unload the second her rear was ready to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cake mare's rear parted with a loud burst of gas... and then a squishy squelchy sound as a thick brown lump of chocolate squeezed out of her flower bud, sliding between frosted cheeks and then falling onto the clean plate with a loud splat, leaving a steaming, almost spherical ball of chocolate waste. Her gut made a groaning noise, and she knew there was a lot more coming. Pressing her gut to the floor, she squeezed down, compacting all she had eaten back and towards her still parted tailhole as a second lump was already squeezing her way out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted loudly, forcing back as her back legs quivered slightly from the force she was pushing with her bowels. With another splat a second ball of chocolate fell, and then a third, none giving her relief as she just wanted to be done with this idiotic pony that had taken the trap meant for her target. A third and fourth sweet lump splatted down into the growing heap in swift succession, each flattening out a little as they piled on top of one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden sound of hooves had her freeze in place. She held her breath, not daring to move a muscle, a squishy brown clump of waste dangling from her rear, lightly wobbling to and fro as she held still, waiting until the hooves passed. The second they were out of hearing again she relaxed, the chocolate making another moist splat as it hit the plate, followed swiftly by a series of others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot and steaming pile of mush was missing something, and her twinging marehood had an idea. She let it loose, sighing as a spray of sweet, frosted drizzle squeezed from her marehood, splashing over the heap, giving a light icing decal to the top of each one as she sighed in relief. Soon she was done and she turned back with a smile, looking back at the plate of brownies that now sat on the desk instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped down and looked to the door, she unlocked it at the least. She would need to sneak out, and replan things. At the least there was one less guard to potentially deal with if she had the wrong target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccipiter would soon enough discover the plate of brownies and find them quite delicious. Compliments were made to the baker... Moonbounce's contribution just as much appreciated as unknowing as it was. At least she foiled an assassination plot... but sometimes the cake actually is a lie.</span></div></div>",

This was Accipiter's office, a well known hardass... why would he have a cake like this? No... this had to be some kind of prank cake. Moonbounce couldn't risk poison joke again... last time she'd almost ended up crushed under her own building sized butt cheeks... It had taken a lake of antidote to clear that up. She shuddered at the memory, it more than enough to put her off the cake. Instead she backed up into the hallway once more, and set her sights ahead. Somewhere in theis building there would be food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother five minutes of trotting and Moonbounce's belly was physically groaning. She was so hungry now... all this thought of food had her starving. The grey thestral's purple armour clad hooves clopped against the floor. She passed an open doorway, glancing inside and at a stallion mopping... then she suddenly stopped mid-step. There was something about this stallion that made her just completely stop her trot. She blinked to herself and her belly grumbled again and she realised what it was... he looked delicious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMint idly swished the mop to and fro, leaving trails of soppy water on the ground in an attempt to keep the ground looking clean. A task ultimately pointless as most guards simply prodded around without cleaning their hooves after their patrols, making the task a little pointless. Despite this he dutifully swayed his hips to the movement, his long mint green tail trailing after him. He noticed that somepony was nearby and raised for a friendly wave, not expecting much back from most guards as janitorial duty usually meant you were going to be the butt of jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce stared transfixed for a moment, her amber eyes focusing on those swaying hips, that long green tail teasingly rising from the floor and up to a tight rump. She realised she was salivating and wiped her mouth with a hoof just as he noticed her. She rose a hoof back and returned the wave, before stepping through the doorway and into the room. She'd heard about janitor duty, seemed Mint must have fallen out with some officer over something. Most of the Celestial guard were out on patrol, and the Lunar guard asleep, so there was almost nopony around other than the two of them. Moonbounce shut the door, making sure it clicked into place before she turned back to him. \"How's the cleaning going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMint was pleasantly surprised to have somepony to talk to, \"Well, it's the same as usualy. Clean the grounds and scrub whatever mess somepony left behind. You wouldn't want to know what that can be sometimes...\" He shuddered and stood against his mop for a bit looking at her quizically, \"Hey, aren't you part of the night guard? I thought most of you would be sleeping by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce nodded her head. \"Yeah, yeah, I can imagine. Some of those guards are pretty...\" she led off there with a shudder, picturing a particularly massive mare she'd seen wondering around who somehow turned battle dress into a thong with the size of her ass. Then again... this stallion could make a nice big mess when her body was done with him. She almost drooled at the thought again, her belly groaning loud enough to be heard. \"Oh, uh, yeah! I'm just hungry, looking to chow down before I sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised his eyebrows, \"O-oh, well, you'll either have to wait till lunch or head out to get something, I'm not sure what'll be served though. I don't have anything on me to offer.\" He clutched the mop and began swishing again to clean up some grime. \"I hope you don't mind, but I have a lot of ground to cover or I'll get in trouble. It'll just be a few more hours, I'll probably be there to so we could probably have a meal together.\" With that he gave her a friendly nod and continued with his duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah... I know, heh,\" Moonbounce replied. It wasn't a fact she was very happy about. She didn't fancy a walk across town, well not alone anyway. The stallion was still mopping at the floor, wiping away a very odd stain that looked almost orange. \"It'll probably be something boring again. The chefs don't have a lot of imagination,\" Moonbounce added with a shrug. The stallion seemed to notice the conversation going nowhere from his response. \"Well, uh, sure. We could meet up for lunch,\" she replied. The stallion went back to his duties and Moonbounce turned and trotted back to the door, opening it up. She looked back at Mint, noticing his back was turned now. Could she really eat another guard just to fill her belly? Maybe she should just go out and find some place to eat.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't eat another guard; even if he looked and smelled so delicious... no, no, she'd have to find somewhere open. It shouldn't be too hard. The thestral let out a puff of air in annoyance before she left Mint alone with the click of a shut door. She was back in the hallways, though it didn't take long to reach the entrance from there. She nodded at a couple of guards near the door before walking out between them and out into the city. Canterlot definitely had a lot of good food... along with its fair share of danger, but who would touch a guard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the radiant sunlight, the thestral found herself squinting, a leathery wing unfolding to try and cover her eyes from the burning late morning sun. She quickly burst into a canter to push to some shade where she stopped with a sigh of relief. Her stomach was quick to grumble again though, she needed something to eat! A small snack stall near the barracks caught her eye that had to be where most of the guards grabbed a bite on the way back from patrol. Greasy fryers were visible from where she stood, though other than a seemingly massive stall with a cushion, the only sign of the owner was a piece of paper helpfully stating \"Be right back\". The stall was easily opened up though... and no one was really looking. Slipping back there and starting up the fryers would be a breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust down the road though a new restaurant had opened up a few weeks ago. It seemed to be open for early lunches and late breakfasts. It was expensive, but apparently the food was to die for. Who would have thought dragons would make good gourmands? There wasn't a queue at the moment, she could easily grab a table and then order to her hearts content.</span></div></div>",

That meant no stealing cake, no eating guards, and no breaking into snack stalls. She fished around in her pocket and found her first pay packet. That could probably get her something nice. She smiled and trotted towards the restaurant. \"The Gourmand Grotto: a five star Draconic Dining Delight\" was proudly written on a large sign above what almost seemed like a cave entrance. A metal portcullis kept just anyone from walking in, a young adult dragon twice Moonbounce's size smiled down at her. \"Welcome. We are currently serving brunch. Table for one?\" the female dragon chirped excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!\" Moonbounce replied, feeling the enthusiasm. The gate groaned open and she was waved inside, stepping into a cave that would be pretty dark if not for the gleaming gems embedded in the walls. Artificial lights reflected off of the dazzling sapphires, rubies and emeralds to cast a multi-coloured rainbow of beautiful light. The other patrons might still have trouble seeing, but the eyes of a thestral had no problem with the dark. She was led to a small table hewn out of rock and seated on a comfortable and very smooth boulder. Her plump grey flanks spread out across the seat as she sighed, then looked for a menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked over the menu she could see various other ponies, Zebra's and gryphons either ordering or enjoying their meals as well as a few dragons that wandered about serving guests. In the far corner of the restaurant a was a carved out opening shielded by gem covered curtains from where dragons entered and left with meals covered by a silver dome, the meals dousing her in fresh scents of deliciously prepared meals and a cool wind blowing through tunnels in the restaurants ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the menu there was an option for an all you can eat buffet as a celebration of some kind, this seemingly a very lucky day to wander in. Besides that were some regular pony meals and special dragon meals to choose from, unsurprisingly either containing meat or gems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many delicious things were hinted at in the menu, this place most definitely specialising in meat, and what delicious smelling meat it was. The waiters seemed to thread between tables on purpose, carrying huge silver trays that wafted the enticing scent of spices and meat, melded into a luxurious and no doubt sumptuous dish. She almost got up and followed one heading to a nearby table full of eager zebras. The promise of an all you could eat meal was one that her licking her lips and prodding her totally empty stomach. Enough meat and she wouldn't have to eat for weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust out of sight however and deep in the darker, unlit corner of the cave was another opening covered by curtains that weren't entirely shut and as the breeze blew through a little more causing it to become more visible. In the darkness could be made out a draconic shape that wandered by pulling a moving sac by a rope, the suspicious activity well hidden in the darkness.</span></div></div>",

Something caught her eye... something she couldn't ignore. In the darkness her keen eyes spotted movement, a curtain blowing open and showing behind it a squirming and struggling sack. Rope tied it to the claws of a dragon who was clearly lugging it along, from a back entrance and what looked like towards the kitchens. If it was something shady it was her duty as a guard to investigate. She stood up, making it look like she was heading for the toilets but veering off at the last second and slipping behind the curtain, keen to follow the sack and find out what was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hallway was dark and only dimly lit by the very far spaced gems that lined the walls at natural seeming heights. There were no signs or any furniture as it seemed to round about the edge of the restaurant. A slight incline brought it close to an area just above where the kitchen seemed to be. She heard a few muffled groans from the bag, whatever was inside moved slowly, seemingly tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon pushed open a fake wall and stepped through into a rather large room containing some kind of box with an opening, a few tables and what seemed like cooking utensils lined along a wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon huffed for a moment before tossing the sack onto a table and opening it up to reveal a bound pony. The pony moved about sluggishly, their face inching aside as the dragon looked them over before tossing it onto their back and proceeding into another room. There was the sound of some shuffling, possibly other dragons and some metallic clangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce looked around, this corridor even darker. Dragons must have pretty good dark vision too... makes sense given them living in caves and all. Gems seemed to act as torches, the fires higher than Moonbounce was tall as she gazed between the two walls. There was nothing here, just a featureless corridor that circled around from the back entrance to the kitchens near the front... a secret entrance perfect for some illegal activities. Her eyes flicked at a groan from the bag, it moving in a way that most bags would most definitely not. There had to be an equine inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the dragon stopped, seeming to take note of a gem that was a slightly different colour. With a push it slotted into the wall, and the wall slid open revealing some kind of secret room. Moonbounce's eyes went wide, then even wider as the sack was tossed onto a table and opened up. The canvas fell away, and a pony was revealed, a grey earth pony mare with a two toned green mane. She looked pretty rough already as she was hauled up and carried through a side entrance in the secret room and off to another room. Moonbounce could hear the sound of dragons grunting and clanging metal from beyond and she swallowed. It would be difficult to follow that dragon deeper. She chewed her lip a little, pondering her next move.</span></div></div>",

She looked around it in detail, seeing the variety of knives, basters and pans so big that even she could fit inside them. This was all pretty damning evidence already... what was that box though. She peered inside, nose wrinkling at a sulphurous stink inside. Her ears flicked at the sound of something returning. With a split second to think she tossed herself into the box, diving inside the hole to get out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curtain opened up to reveal a few dragons, the one from before walking back out of the room as the other two, dressed in apron and chef's hat set about preparing various objects and setting them aside. One of the dragons walked up to the box only to glance at the other for a moment and ask whether things had been prepared before. The dragons looked at the secret door that had just shut and shrugged, thinking that they had already put something in the box and one set about chopping up vegetables from a sac that they brought and another went about on a table to her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragons hummed something under their breath, their tunes being accompanied by grumblings that came from their abdomens and after a short time of waiting one of the dragons stepped up to the box and turned around, presenting their rear to the small view hole in the box and with only a grunt of a warning a warm draft of pungent smoke wafted into the box as a warm, almost singing breeze that smelled heavily of egg and sulphur,-brrrooomph-. The dragon let out a happy sigh as they returned back to chopping just moments before the other rubbed their abdomen and began their approach to the hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce watched as a group of dragons returned, most of them wearing aprons and silly chef hats. This had to be some kind of kitchen. So this was the secret kitchen... probably where they prepared ponies... but where was the oven? Where was the spit? How did they cook ponies? All they had was this strange... box... oh. Moonbounce suddenly began to sweat. Was she in the oven? There wasn't any heat. She heard the dragons talking idly, their voices hard to make out. One of them seemed to start chopping vegetables... hardly a terrifying image. The others all milled around, their bellies groaning about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them split from the others and stepped over to the box. Moonbounce shifted back, sliding away from the view hole when suddenly it was filled by ass. A pair of sweaty and scaly cheeks squishing back against it as a pulsating pucker trembled between. What were they...? The sudden eruption of flatulence had her eyes widen, and then slam shut as the air hit her. It wasn't just warm; it was hot, very hot. Like being blown by a hairdryer that someone was blowing past a bowl of rotten eggs. She gagged at the stink, an edge of manure making her retch a little when she saw two more dragons approaching. Should she scream?</span></div></div>",

She couldn't let them know she was here... a guard in the kitchen. She'd be taken out for sure. She just had to sit still and outlast their gassy butts. Surely they'd stop eventually, give a window for her to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon wandered up to the oven and smirked at the opening, not being able to make out the pony that was inside or really caring as they turned about and pressed their large rump into the opening, letting out an audible moan as the scaly pucker bulged out and released a toasty rush of air -braaapt- that clouded the oven even more, the small area beginning to grow in heat more rapidly as the dragon swayed its hips from side to side letting out a few more toots before pulling its cheeks away and leaving a sweaty sheen on the ovens opening before wandering back to the vegetables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn audible chuckle was heard as the dragons conversed with one another, the first walking up to the ovens opening and chuckling with its rump aimed at the oven, ready to slam it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce saw dragon fangs, a sharp smile pointed right at her. She didn't see any eyes... but they knew something was in there... This wasn't good. This dragon's ass made the first look petit, those huge cheeks not even visible as all she could see was ass crack, and that huge gaping butthole. It quaked, already bulging outwards before it ripped a hot and rancid blast, the air turning visible green as it pumped into the oven, filling the air with stink. The metal panels that lined the box began to glow slightly, absorbing the heat and keeping it going as small toots puffed against Moon's face. There was a wet slurp as the asshole pulled away, leaving her be for a second, sweat dripping from the oven, but already another ass was sliding in front of the door. Moonbounce whimpered as this was going to only get worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ass gave her little time to think as they erupted with a foul blast almost immediately, its owner laughing loudly as the stream of toasty vapours poured into the small confines and it became boiling hot, the air causing her hairs to stand on end and slowly peel with the tremendous concentrated stench that had swept away almost anything breathable from the oven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quack sounded just beyond the cheeks and they were pushed aside as a second rear smooshed into it, both rears now aimed at the opening as one of the dragons that seemed to protest pushed them away as both giggled loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce felt her own armour amplifying the heat and desperately stripped it off, sliding off her breastplate and kicking off her shoes, tossing them into a corner away from her just as the third ass hit. Another dirty bassy trumpet of stink ripped into the box... but this one was so much hotter. It rushed inside, kicking the cold air out and replacing everything with that stink. Moon felt her throat dry, her belly sweat... and then her fur start to fall away. Her eyes went wide as she tried to clasp it in place with her hooves, but it was all over her. Her sweaty, doughy body was heating up; her skin starting to burn and chafe, and her fur was falling out. She had to get out now. \"W-wait,\" she croaked, her voice quiet and dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smashing of asses drowned her out as she tried to call for help, to get them to back off, but now two asses were smooshed in her path, both pointed right at her as their owners giggled. Moon could only whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragons both bored down, their puckers bulging outwards and glistening with sweat in the reflected colours of the gems. As if practiced both rings opened up in tandem, -frrrrrrt- -brrromfff- a visible cloud of filth streaming directly into the hole, the combined stink rancid enough to rob a skunk of its breath and the heat so searing that it made the opening seemingly wobble, the area oven around her now clinging to the heat as wherever she touched the oven the heat tugged at her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air was now as good as unbreathable, the unrelenting asses taking turns in releasing plumes of rear exhaust into the small box and shortly after one of them laughed and looked inside before closing the small opening as they both went back to preparing the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air only got hotter and hotter, Moonbounce having a second to take in those thick, sweaty dragon puckers before they pulled apart in a joint duet of horrible, nasty flatulence. The combined stink and heat earned a dry scream from Moonbounce, the oven filling with the utterly horrific gas, the air so unbreathable she felt like she was blacking out. With a flop she fell onto her back, her own ass visible inside the hole as her skin began to brown, her fur long gone as the scorching dragon gas roasted her in that hot box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief second the lid opened and a dragon looked down at her to laugh, seeing the thestral's browning skin, her desperate eyes, and maybe even noticing the guard armour in the corner. It was much too late for Moonbounce, just one more blasting like that and she'd pass out permanently for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opening remained closed for a short while, the broiling heat remaining constant and cooking her slowly through the surrounding suffocating air. After some time the opening opened up again only for one of the familiar cheeks to squish into it and release a deadly blast of stink towards her -bbrrraapt-. The dragon stepped away with a small sigh before closing the lid once more and dousing her in the silence of the heat singing oven around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just enough air to keep Moonbounce's brain whirring, but her body weak and heavy. Her buns grilled, the scent of her own roasting ass filling her nostrils along with the rest of her. She could feel her fat hardening, her pudgy belly going still and roasting up. Her eyes were barely open when she heard a noise, looking up, praying it was Nox come to save her... instead it was just another dragon butt. The ass cheeks filled the hole and let rip with one long and gassy concerto, a fart that went on for seconds, building and falling as stink and heat filled Moonbounce. When the ass finally pulled free and the door shut, the mare went still with a last twitch, Moonbounce well on her way to becoming a five star dining experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragons continued with preparing the meal, idly chopping away and mixing condiments for the meal. Every once in a while a dragon would walk over to the oven and open the lid, pressing their rump against it and letting out a happy sigh as a muffled fart resounded in the small space before closing it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of cooking one of the dragons walked up to the oven and opened it up, waving away the visible cloud of stench that rolled out before reaching in and pulling out the bottom on which the now nicely browned skin of the pony rested on. Her armour clattered to the side, glowing with heat, but the second dragon simply picked it up and tossed it aside, not paying it much attention as they went about placing her in a pleasing position and pouring the condiment mixes over her and smearing it out finely with a brush, surrounding her with a bed of vegetables and other smaller meats. They stretched her mouth open, the seared flesh tearing at the edges as it opened with a meaty sound before an apple was stuffed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce done both dragons looked down at the dish with a smile, one picking it up and walking down a small flight of stairs and entering a sectioned off VIP area that was filled with a small few very fancily dressed ponies and larger dragons.</span></div></div>",

He licked his lips, almost missing the waiter approaching until his platter was dumped in front of him and onto the table. The lid lifted off and the Prince almost drowned on his own saliva. \"Truly tremendous... now I see why auntie was so happy to give you the money you needed to set up shop,\" Blueblood remarked, giving a wide smile to the draconic waiter. \"Mmm... I feel like a good Coche-Dury Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru to wash down this... where did you even find a Thestral?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter shrugged and Blueblood just waved him off to fetch his wine. Now it was just him and his meal alone, he turned her around, wanting to face a sumptuous looking roasted ass over her face, licking his lips in delight as it was perfectly coated in sauce. The vegetables and meats were basically plating, this was the real delight. His horn glowed as he levitated the roasted pony up, shoving her hind hooves into his jaws and then slurping up to the butt, taking his time to gulp and slurp at her saucy cheeks, exploring holes and moaning at the flavour as his throat bulged wider, the stallion slowly swallowing and tossing his head back like a pelican, taking his time with this meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlueblood managed to just about work his jaw around his meal, the almost apple flavour to the mare's meat adding another complex note to the already scrumptious meal. Her rear finally slipped into his jaws as her heated pussy released his tongue, just in time for it to slurp her pudgy gut. The thestral had a lot of meat to her, far more than the usual scrawny fare on the flying ponies, it made sense they charged so much for a meal like this, though money was no concern to a Prince. His lips smacking around her gut, compacting and squeezing it, slowly dragging it inside inch by inch as his tongue played briefly with her naval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness who had been cleaning tables trotted past, and Blueblood didn't miss the opportunity to pinch her ass, making her squeal as he laughed around his huge meal, then settled back into swallowing. At this point his jaws were actually getting a little tired so he sped up, squeezing and squishing her mass of stomach until with a last gulp it was bulging out his throat so it was wider than his head. Her shoulders reached his lips and he swallowed over them, and lastly came the head. He worked his jaws over her, pointing her muzzle up so as her snout slipped into his jaws, his teeth clamped together and caught the apple, holding it in his mouth as he swallowed down the mare, a last few gulps dumping the roasted pony into his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud crunch came from the apple as he took a bite, then lifted it out of his maw... before a massive UUURRRRRPPPP tore from his Princely jaws, echoing through the cavern. He grinned, daintily tapping his mouth with a napkin before tossing the apple onto the platter and leaning back in his dining chair. With no regard for the rest of his meal he let his hooves rest in the mixture of expensive meats and rare plant salad, simply waiting for the waiter to arrive with a bottle of wine for him to uncork and guzzle greedily. A pat of his stomach earned another belch and a grin. \"Lovely stuff. Compliments to the chef,\" he told the waiter as his hoof patted the swollen sphere of mare meat that was his stomach. Moonbounce should probably learn to think more carefully about her hiding places... but hey, the dragons will never find her in the Prince's belly... or his private toilet.</span></div></div>",

She'd confirmed that this place was bad news. They were secretly serving ponies as food and that was enough for her to get the guard involved. She turned around in the hallway and started to briskly trot back, trying to be quiet and fast as she cantered down the carpeted and long hall, circling back around. Yeah, she'd get Nox and he'd get the whole Lunar guard here and they would shut these dragons down for good! Her tell-tale armour clung to her form as she arrived at the door, only for it to open right ion her face, the handle catching her in the chin and knocking her back onto the carpet, her plush ass hitting the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dragon huffed as it entered the building suddenly looking up at a loud clang and sound of something flopping onto the ground. Alarmed, it walked around the corner only to see a mass of dark armour and coat lying on the ground. It took only a moment to realise that it was either an escapee or an intruder and without hesitating the dragon lurched at her, stomping onto her heavily, the large claw squeezing into her soft rump as it let out a loud belch of air beside her face, \"Make a sound and you're done for, bat.\"</span></div></div>",

Her spinning head made out another big dragon as he glared down at her. Her eyes went wide as she readied to scream when a huge foot crashed down onto her. With a squelch her rump was flattened down, causing its gassy payload to rip all over Moonbounce, the thestral coughing in her own gas. The claw squeezed hard and then came the threat, the massive dragon pinning her down definitely enough to get her to bite her tongue and nod. There'd be a better opportunity... and not when a sweaty, scaly sole was grinding mucky filth into her butt fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon pressed into her sizable flanks a few more times with a pleased grin on its face before it reached down and grabbed a hold of her hind hooves. It pulled her along the long hallway, stealing a quick glance at her occasionally to bare its teeth at her. \"I don't know what you're doing here, but the boss doesn't pay too kindly to mice.\" It once again pinned her under a claw, pressing her onto the ground with its full weight and nearly squeezing all the wind out of her lungs as it pushed against a few of the dimly lit gems in order, causing the wall to shift silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce wriggled as the dragon crushed her butt, leaving an actual footprint across her rump cheeks as the Thestral was stomped silly. Her butt was like playing with putty, the squishy and doughy flesh splaying and squeezing between toe claws, before the foot finally lifted. The Thestral groaned, when she felt claws grab her hooves. With a squeal she was pulled back, bring dragged across the ground and her belly as she was being pulled somewhere. She tried to plant her forehooves down and wriggle free, but the walk to this secret door was shorter. A moment later she was dropped, and before she could get up and run a massive foot crashed against her back this time, pinning her down and forcing the air out of her as she flattened out against the floor. \"S-stop! I'm a guard!\" Moonbounce cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon chuckled and with the door opening another dragon stepped out, this one larger and more menacing looking. \"I caught us a little pony trying to spill our secret ingredients.\" It stared down at them both, lowering down to the thestral and letting out a snort before nodding and without word the large dragon grabbed onto her with its tail and slung her around in the air as it walked through the dark hall followed by the smaller dragon, \"Heh, the boss is not going to like this one bit.\" a toothy grin said at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce was still trying to stand, but the dragon's foot was just too heavy for her. She pushed upwards, but only slid that slick sole against her back. Another dragon then stepped out, this one bigger, his scales black and horns clear on his head. He growled down at her, and then crouched above her. \"I-I can forget about it!\" she squealed, when suddenly a tail lashed around her, binding her up like rope. With a tug she was pulled into the air, it effortlessly binding her as she was dragged behind the large dragon, seeing the small dragon walking behind him, the two facing each other. Moon shook her head, her pleading eyes looking up at the small dragon as she was dragged to meet the boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came to a stop near a large door only barely visible through the gem light and with a loud heave the large dragon pushed it open slowly, revealing what looked like a normal office, only a lot larger than usual. A large dragon sat at on a throne behind the desk, his frame thick and wide as he watched them enter. He looked down at the thestral with a glare, \"I was wondering why I was being disturbed. Bring her hear.\" He sat back in his throne as the comparatively small dragon brought her up and placed her on the desk. His head towering over her, \"My, my, it's not often that I get visitors. Tell me, pony, why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group stopped, Moonbounce unable to see where they were going with her body almost entirely bound up in tail, it wrapped around everything but her dangling hooves and head. There was a sudden groan, and then a door opened. She heard a voice, and then was lifted up, shown off. She gasped at the massive dragon that sat perched on what could only be called a throne, his belly spilling over his knees. Moon whimpered as she saw his sharp amber eyes glaring, and then she was thrown out, tossed up and onto his desk, right before him. He glared down at her, laughing at her as he spoke. The thestral whimpered. \"I... I... just came for a meal...\" she said innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon let out a loud chortle of laughter, his voice booming in the large cave like office, \"Well, you must have taken a wrong turn and entered a restricted area. I guess having the hall secluded wasn't enough.\" He scratched over his large stomach his laughter booming once again. He suddenly reached for her and grabbed her in his claws, squeezing her tightly, \"Why are you here?\" his voice was still somewhat amused, but his eyes were anything but.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon's chuckled echoed around the entire room, magnifying in a way that made Moonbounce flinch. She shook in fear, faced with such a massive and fat beast. It scratched its belly, making the flabby rolls mash together and shake... then all the laughter was gone. In an instant two claws wrapped around her, squeezing her like a toy, the mare's head swelling up cartoonishly as he crushed her chest. \"I saw something suspicious! So I came back and a chef was cooking a pony! I'm a guard, please!\" she squealed so fast it was hard to make out what was said without reviewing for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, \"Hmmm, that's odd. I don't remember us ever doing any harm to ponies...\" He brought her up to his chest and scratched her along the greasy scales idly. \"You must be mistaken. Our establishment is well known for its utmost respect for equestrians as well as the finest service.\" He held her against his warm body, sliding her up and down, being sure to gather up some of the moisture that had built up around his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the claws let go, allowing her to breathe again. The mare groaned, when his claw brought her closer to his chest. He rammed her against his sweaty scales, using her body to scratch some itch and making her fur all greasy in the process. The dragon brushed her off even as she sputtered and struggled, trying to push away from his belly as she was squeezed against it. \"M-maybe I was,\" she squealed when he slipped her further down, her body absorbing his sweaty filth like some kind of sponge. \"I-I must of been! Y-you never would hurt a pony!\" Moon cried desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon brought dragged her along his body, sliding her to his lower abdomen and between the rolls of his large gut to clean up the small caches of collected slimy substances that had built up over time. \"I would never hurt a pony, but then again, there's no pony in here is there?\" The other dragons chuckled along with him as he pressed her lower between his wide legs the tights pressing against her sides as he was squeezed down, nearing his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thestral nodded her head, smiling. He was just playing with her and he'd let her go because he wouldn't hurt her. She squealed as he then crammed her right up between his fat rolls, crushing her inside to swab at the filthy dank remnants that had congealed there into gooey slime. She gagged and retched, then heard the other half of his comment. \"N-no! I'm right here! Please! I won't tell a soul!\" Moon cried as the dragon used her to sponge all of his fat rolls, soaking her in greasy mess.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She fell to the ground, landing with a wet splat thanks to her soaked coat. She took a breath, and then saw the massive, filthy foot hovering above her. Her eyes widened. \"No! Please!\" she screamed before the claw slammed down with a moist squish, the mare being crushed under the heavy and poorly cleaned foot. Her snout ended up pinned between two rancid toes, their scaly, stinking surface grinding against her as she gagged at the stench. Meekly she tried to wriggle, when he just stomped again, pressing her into the ground, squeezing her against the floor. She cried weakly as the other two dragons walked away, leaving her for the massive boss to deal with, the door slamming shut like the entrance to a cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon continued to work at his desk idly, his claws squeezing into her slightly. After a short while he began to smear her across the ground between his claws, spreading them open slightly, the thick claws prodding at her, smearing her with the filth of the cave, \"I often forget how nice it is to have my feet cleaned I don't think a certain fly would mind giving me a little help with that? It may escape a squashing in that case\" he chuckled, speaking almost in general to the empty room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thestral mare tried to push away his claw, to wriggle out but he was too heavy, too strong. She could do nothing but be squeezed and squished, treated like a toy by those sweaty and filthy claws. When one finally lifted she rolled out, only for the other to take over, stomping her down, covering her in sweat, musk and dirt... then he spoke. She whimpered at his statements, how he insisted she was nothing but an annoying little fly... still she didn't want to be squashed. Shakily she opened her mouth, her tongue sliding out to run across his toes, slide over his soles and making the guards mare gag at the filthy taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon sighed happily as he felt her licks, allowing his claws to spread open and giving her access to the sensitive areas between his toes. A cheesy scent spread into the air as the built up filth between his toes. He allowed her some room to breathe while still keeping her tight in his grip. An idle hum droned in the cave as he shuffled somethings on his desk, going about his work as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce was nothing to the dragon indeed. She heard him shuffling papers, the scribbling of pen, he was hard at work... and she was just a toy. His toes spread and the most noxious and foul of the cheesy, stinking congealed substance of his toe jam beckoned. She closed her eyes tight, trying to pretend she was eating a delicious treat as she slurped it out, smearing her tongue and face with it in the process as she lowered herself from royal guard to toe sucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon\u2019s toes flexed as she cleaned them with her tongue, allowing her more room. \"Hmm, sometimes I wonder why I don't do this more often.\" He rose up slightly, his heel pressing against her and rubbing her across the ground. His body shifted slightly and he rubbed against himself, the scales gnashing loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce sucked on those horrid digits, polishing a toe at a time and all the gunk between. Just as she cleaned the last on one foot she felt him flex back. The heel of his foul foot crushed back, pounding her into the ground even more as he pressed her down, flattening her out with the force of his push, his toes sticking to her face as she seemed in danger of wrapping around the foot like some sort of trainer sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon pressed his foot against the ground idly, enjoying her attention, but losing himself in concentration. He moved his leg around slightly as he leaned forwards, causing her to be smeared across his claws and foot. He let out an unhappy grunt and remained in the same position for some time, squeezing her against the floor as he moved from side to side slowly, and loud scribbling was audible inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare was losing her form, her body becoming so liquid that when he ground her next her armour fell off, rolling away, leaving the almost puddle of grey mare to be dragged back and forth, smeared over toes and slathered over sole, the thestral in danger of becoming nothing more than claw and foot gunk from all of the dragons crushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure didn't soften as he continued to do whatever he was doing above her, some ruffling papers and clatter sounding around her as he moved things about. His foot pressed against her until she was squeezed into the ground, his toes pressing against her as he seemed to have forgotten that she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce couldn't even twitch, the mare still aware, but her body reduced to nothing but squishy mulch. Every squeeze and press pulled her sticky, crushed form across his foot, squeezed her up and into his toes, the mare replacing the sweat she had sucked off as just like a fly the dragon didn't even realise she had been permanently squashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon continued with his paperwork, idly shifting about in his chair once in a while and scratching against his gut. He could vaguely remember some dragons having entered his office before he became so enraptured and stretched as he pushed some things aside. He commented about his throne before getting up and loudly thumping towards a door at the side of his office, prodding through and walking along a long hallway that eventually opened up into a large open cave with about a dozen cave paths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while the poor pony that had been reduced to nothing but his toe gunk was squeezed tightly into the ground and collected more filth and gunk as he thumped through the cave floor, the hard surface crashing against her with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued into one of them with barely a moment of thought, his feet smashing into the ground loudly and smooshing against the dirty, wet surface of the cave floor until it opened up into an opening under a cliff hidden by forest canopy. \"What a day, I have the distinct feeling I'm forgetting something.\" He said with a stretch, his legs pressing against the grass beneath him, the soft, wet blades tickling against the thestral smear beneath him. He walked along the forest floor small insects and mud smearing across her body, wading through a small bog before reaching yet another cave covered by a large door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering his home he wandered onto a large heap of gems and gold, allowing his rump to flop onto it as he leaned against it and yawned loudly before falling asleep, his toes pressed against his riches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs those toes wriggled against the treasure, there was barely any sign of Moonbounce any longer. In foot prints along the whole path traces of a grey stinking fluid that might taste like apples was flecked the whole way, pressed into forest ground, smothered into mud, splattered over the hallways. The only bits that still clung to his foot were what lodged deep within his toes... Moonbounce replacing his toe jam for some future unfortunate to suckle out. For this royal guard, that was...</span></div></div>",

She held her hooves together, her eyes glimmering and her mouth began to water as after a short while the waiter returned carrying a platter as large as a pony and placed it down in front of her. As the dragon lifted up the lid she couldn't help but take a deep sniff and bask in the heavenly scents of prepared meats and confections, sided with some healthy leaves. The dragon bowed and told her to beckon if she wanted more and with that left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce stared at the spread before her, a large amount of chopped meats, steamed and cooked, and the smells surrounding her. With an almost trembling hoof she reached forwards and picked up a block of meat, feeling it squish slightly against her hoof, the texture covered with a nice thin layer of grease. She raised it up to her muzzle and licked across it tentatively, a shudder running though her from the taste. Feeling her stomach grumble loudly she opened her mouth and tossed in the juicy slab, munching down on it happily before swallowing it with a loud gulp. A satisfied sigh left her as she reached for more, picking up multiple at a time and greedily putting them into her mouth, finally beginning to satiate her hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooked meats, steamed fruits, she picked them up one after another and gulped them down almost in a fluid motion, the combination of tastes drawing her into a state of hunger deeper than she felt before and before she knew it she had finished the entire plate. A loud satisfied -uuurrp- escaped her as she rubbed a hoof over her belly happily, feeling it churn and grumble. She waved a hoof up to the dragon from before and with a nod it walked up to replace her platter with a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she had finished a waiter was back to see her, this one different from the earlier one as he seemed to look fancier, stand taller. A toothy grin crossed his muzzle as he looked down at her churning stomach, it swollen to the size of looking pregnant but she was still hungry for more. She would find the dragons could be very accommodating. With a lift of a claw and a click more waiters gathered around the table, marking the dragon as the head waiter. \"Clear away and bring the next course, chop chop,\" the head waiter called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly the platter was gone, pulled from Moonbounce's sight, and a moment later not one, but four platters were laid out, the entire table being covered in food. Lids lifted and delicious scents vied for attention, a whole roast chicken taking up one platter, while another was filled with bowls of sweetmeats. A third platter was actually a huge bowl of thick meat broth, with generous chunks of crusty bread. The fourth held all the sweets, a pile of donuts, an assortment of chocolate coated biscuits, and a big bowl of thick, blood red jelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce\u2019s eyes nearly bulged out of her sockets as her tongue lulled out and dripped with drool. She shook her head for a moment and stared at the waiters with disbelief, \"This can't be part of the meal, can it?\" She reached a shy hoof forwards and prodded at one of the sweetmeats, picking it up in her hoof and bringing it to her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a small nip out of it as she looked at the waiter and after a sudden surge of taste she couldn't hesitate and opened her mouth wide and toss it in chomping on it happily and allowing the taste to spread on her tongue as it slowly ground to paste in her mouth. She gulped the gathered mush down and tore off a leg of the large chicken, biting into it and ripping off a long swath of greasy sweet tasting meat as well as taking a large bite out of another small meat treat. Each new bite seemed to renew the flavours that danced on her tongue and even when she ate things that seemed not appropriate to go together it meshed incredibly well, causing a resurgence of hunger to shoot through her. In rapid order she reached for meats, and confections, happily munching away and grinding the foods to paste before swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally a loud belch would escape from her mouth, the ever increasing girth of her stomach pushing into the table and compressing some building up gasses out of her mouth as she felt herself lost in a feeding frenzy. It took her almost as much time as before to finish everything that she had on her plate, leaning back and prodding at her stomach as she smiled happily at the fancy waiter, \"This was all you can eat, right?\" she flashed him a dopey smile, her tongue lapping across her grease stained muzzle quickly followed by a crass belch that shot some spittle onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head waiter laughed politely. \"Indeed it is, mon cheri,\" he replied, before clapping again. Dragon claws pulled away bowls and plates, once again clearing the plates with such efficiency it was startling. With how much Moonbounce had eaten already she'd more than devoured her money's worth, but neither the staff nor Moonbounce seemed inclined to slow their pace as the next batch of dishes was brought out. A honey glazed ham, beer battered fish, a rack of ribs, a literal pile of steaks, a double layer sponge cake, a selection of chocolate dipped strawberries... all of it was heaped onto the table a second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... tell us if you are having trouble, and we will be happy to assist,\" the waiter told her with a smile, before lifting out a bottle of wine and pouring it into a glass. \"On the house,\" he added as he slipped it over. Moonbounce might recognise the enchanted vintage as a favourite in noble households as it made you literally forget your stomach capacity, eliminating the pain it would cause and letting you just keep on feasting and feasting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce rubbed her hooves and smacked her lips eagerly as the meal was laid out before her, she was about to reach forward when the waiter presented her with the bottle and it took a moment for her to recognise it. \"Thank you, this place is great!\" She emptied the wine glass with a quick swig and felt the burning liquid stream down her throat, it beginning to affect her stomach slowly. Where she had been feeling slightly stuffed a moment ago, now she simply felt her hunger return as it let out a loud gurgle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving the waiter a happy bow eliciting a drawn out belch she reached for the pile of steaks, sliding them into her maw one by one, drool and grease dripping down the sides of her muzzle and staining against the table and her now protruding belly. She wiped away at it idly, smearing it over her coat as she let out a soft belch that spread the stink of acid burned beef roll out of her. She munched down without reservation, picking the large honeyed ham between her hooves and biting into it like a stick of corn, tearing off chunks greedily and letting swaths of droplets splatter around as she dug into it messily. With a loud gulp she swallowed the last bit of the ham a low belch escaping -uuorrp-.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching forward she had to shimmy herself back and forth to reach over her now incredibly distended stomach, the rounding sphere way beyond what her body should be able to handle yet she rolled onto it, the compressing sack causing an annoyed set of glorps to escape before her tail fluttered with a bout of flatulence. Opening her mouth she dragged the large cake closer and stuffed large chunks of it into her mouth, digging into it with her hooves and swallowing down the incredibly sweet mass large globs at a time. Once done with the tasty treat she let out a happy belch and reached for the strawberries, swallowing them in small piles before she was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was huge, having been filled with enough food to feed a few hungry families. She looked up at the waiter lazily and smiled, her mouth positively soiled with grease and pastry mush, \"Think I can have some more?\" she chuckled a little tiredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter smiled. \"That depends, madam. It seems your original waiter did not take payment beforehand as we normally do here. The cover price for the meal is 200 bits, and you've more than eaten that much already,\" the head waiter said, before laughing at the poor joke. \"As soon as the bits are in my claw we will keep on feeding you, as much as you can eat as. That was a promise,\" he said, his smile seeming rather dark as he stretched out a hand and made a motion for the payment.</span></div></div>",

She reached into her saddlebag with a wing, but already knew that her pay packet and brought it to the table, opening it up in front of the waiter with a sheepish smile. \"-uurrp- Heh, I may be a little short on 200... do you keep a tab by any chance?\" She gave the waiter her most persuasive smile as her stomach grumbled beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A tab? Surely you jest?\" the dragon asked, looking down at the mare as she tried to smile at him. \"This is a classy establishment, Madame. You do not order what you cannot afford. That is theft,\" he said plainly. A glimpse at the pay packet and he shook his head. \"And a guard too. For shame,\" he said gravely. \"You will have to pay off your debt by helping us in the kitchens for the rest of the shift,\" he declared, clapping again as the dragon\u2019s waiters returned, clearing the table and then returning to help the massive mare shift. She didn't seem to have much say in heading to the kitchens...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce tried to offer some resistance, but felt her hooves barely able to reach past her stomach, the effort somewhat tiring, \"Oh, come one, it's not my fault I wasn't asked to pay first.\" She grumbled as she was hoisted into the air by the strong dragons, their bulky arms lifting her up with ease as she was slowly carried towards the kitchen. All the while her stomach groaned loudly, the mass of mulch within her slowly slopping apart and sloshing about. \"Fine, I'll help you -braap- clean-up for this shift. As much as I can do like this.\" she giggled nervously as she pressed her hooves into her malleable stomach, the groaning cushion beneath her feeling quite pleasant as most of the strain was ebbed away by the wine she had enjoyed. That was what they had in mind after all, right?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(This chapter was done in rp between myself and Dudey64.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were six waiter dragons holding up Moonbounce, the fat thestral not having much solid places to grab seeing as she was more than 50% belly at this point, the massive sack of a stomach sagging low, bouncing back and forth with each step the dragons took as she was carried over their shoulders like they were bearing a coffin to its grave. The head waiter led from the front, not feeling the slight squirming from the mare as his waiters kept her in their grip, even though her whole body shook and bounced much like a huge platter of jelly. \"Oh no, you'll be helping to fill tables,\" the waiter replied vaguely, smirking as the group left the main dining hall and entered the kitchens. Dragons looked up at her as she was pulled past, many smirking as she was brought to the back of the kitchens, where a huge metal rotisserie was slowly spinning, currently empty and waiting to be filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce felt unease creep on her at the waiters words and she began to feel a little helpless as her struggles did little more than to cause ripples to roll down her sloshing belly, \"Well, I guess I could fill a table, but I don't see much of a point to resting on one.\" she groped her stomach and looked about, it being slightly larger than the tables in the restaurant. She felt a shudder run though her as she looked at the smirking dragons that surrounded her, their eyes telling her that something was off and once she saw the huge metal rotisserie she began to sweat. \"Oh, you want me to roll the spit around, Well, I guess I can just about reach it like this.\" she laughed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragons all began to laugh along with Moonbounce, though it was clearly at her expense. The head waiter grabbed the spit, lifting it off and seeming not to care about the metal already being hot. The mare was turned around, her bouncy and now huge ass cheeks being spread wide to show off her thick rimmed pucker. She was too fat to even look over her shoulders, only feeling her ass cheeks spreading, knowing what the head waiter held. \"Oh yes, you will roll around on the spit, then we will sell you for 200 bits, to recuperate our losses,\" he explained. Then without ceremony the burning hot rod of metal was rammed up her ass like a lance, the pole burrowing all the way up through her intestines and to her stomach in one hard shove, every inch of flesh it touching burning with heat... but the wine's pain numbing effect meant though she could feel her insides burn, she didn't feel the agonising pain. She knew she was cooking from the inside, felt the pole being rammed up her ass, but it didn't hurt at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce whimpered in fear, \"You- you can't do that, I'm a royal guard!\" She tried to kick at the dragons, but was unable to reach much further than her belly as she was turned around by the dragons and her cheeks were spread by strong claws that dug into her doughy flesh. She tried to protest and gasped as she felt the searing hot rod prod at her rear, slowly sliding towards her ponut and poke into the tight ring. Though she couldn't feel the heat or the excruciating pain she should be going through she felt the split slide into her and tear at her insides, puncturing her intestines and various on its way through her. She bit her lip, unable to feel the pain, but somehow feeling the hunger slowly stave off as the liquids drained into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spit didn't have a smooth trip. The head waiter didn't give it time to follow tunnels and slide through sensually, no he had meat to cook. The rod was driven like a spike through Moonbounce's body, crammed up her ass, shoved through intestines, tearing through bowel walls and piercing minor organs. Only her stomach had the magical stretch to force it back into place, guiding it right up her throat. She'd feel it inside her, her throat pulsing to throw it up before it emerged with a splat, scarlet blood gleaming on the shining steel. The head waiter grunted as he pushed it harder, powerful muscles driving it through her insides, shifting them all around as more of the spike squeezed from her jaws pinning them open and making her unable to do anything more than gag. As he worked the other waiters removed her shoes, stripped off her armour, though the belt had long since snapped, it all fell to the side in a pile, leaving just one massive bat on a spit. With a great heave the spit was crammed into its locks and a button pressed... and Moonbounce began to slowly spin, the spike roasting her insides as the flames below began to lick at her fur, blackening the grey and burning it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guard will come looking for me and when they,-\" Moonbounce let out a choking gasp and spat up blood moments before the spike rut right through her and poked out of her opened mouth. All she could do was whimper and attempt to move her weakening hooves, the damage to her insides sapping her of her strength and she felt most of her senses leaving her slowly. The heat began to rise beneath her as, the warm flames licking at her coat and burning off her hairs, leaving dark scarred flesh that slowly broiled and dripped of liquids, the blood slowly dripping down through both of her openings and crusting up to make a nice gleaming sheen of liquids on her sides. She looked at the dragon desperately, trying to plead with her eyes as she teared up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head waiter looked at the pitiful thestral, watching her slowly rotating as her massive and food stuffed belly slowly began to roast the flesh under the fur showing stretch marks at how much her weight pulled her down. Her weak hooves were stubby compared to her fattened calves, which were already slowly darkening, the exposed flesh beginning to feel the heat radiating from the flames whenever they passed over it. Up and around, Moonbounce spun, no doubt feeling dizzy as the dragons all seemed to turn around. \"Ready the spices,\" the head waiter said for a grin, when six dragon butts quivered and then began to unload gassy and wretched blasts of pure stink, their rancid gasses adding more heat to the flame and that unique spice that the restaurant was renowned for, the thestral unable to resist as she roasted slowly, juices dripping onto the grill above the fire and sizzling loudly as the dragons waited for her to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce's lips quivered as the head waiter seemed not to change their mind, continuing to spin her about. The spinning slowly made her eyes grow weary, her stomach protesting from the liquids being spun about, the bile leaking into her stomach and coating her innards in blood and half-digested meats and foods, the tastes sinking into her body and spreading evenly. Even without feeling the actual pains he knew that there was no going back from this, her body was slowly being destroyed, she felt most of her mane curl up into thick stubble at her cranium and her ears slowly burning together, the softer flesh not posing much against the incredible heat.<br>\r\nShe looked to her side when she heard movement and was shocked to see a multitude of scaled rumps aimed at her. Unable to do much but shake her stomach slightly she saw their cheeks bulge out and gagged on the stench that wafted out onto her, spreading over her body and searing into her flesh. The warm cloud roasting her body as it spreading around and coating her in a fresh layer of stink that made her wretch and her eyes go dry. She frantically looked for any dragon she could get eye contact with, hoping for some reprieve from this hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly the head waiter met her gaze, the others much too taken with the steady application of spices with grunts and groans, ejecting their burning draconic gas all over her. Moonbounce was encased in the burning green haze even as the flames added yet more heat, roasting away at her slowly. Every spin had her whole body shake, sloshing about like a cocktail shaker as acids, bloods and other liquids burbled around inside of her, boiling slowly in the heat. If she'd been any fuller the pressure might have made her erupt, but as it was the skin managed to harden, to contract around her as it roasted up nicely, turning a golden brown. Moonbounce was dying, being digested from the inside by her own acids as they filled her form, working down her unsavoury organs and emptying the mare out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer organs were failing quickly, first her lungs giving out as the acids ruptured the sacs. Her heart was the next to fail, the muscle breaking down with glorps and gurgles, leaving her brain to slowly starve itself of blood, her eyes dimming as she felt everything turning to mush, everything but her outsides. She wouldn't be able to process it, but she'd see a hose jammed into her belly button, and then some kind of pump set up. Her organs were piped out, the slop of partly digested everything escaping as soup, leaving the mare virtually hollowed out in her midsection. It was then she died, roasted inside and out, but it wasn't the end of preparation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other dragon quit ripping ass, a last gassy burst the final thing Moonbounce processed before she died, and then it was left to the head chef to switch out the containers on the pumping machine. The acids were thrown away and rich garlic butter was slotted into place, with a flick the pump switched around and started to push the mixture into Moonbounce, filling her now emptied chest cavity, pumping her completely full. When the hose emptied it was disconnected, and her belly button patched with a sugar paper bandage. Satisfied the chef served her up, taking the platter to a random table. \"A Thestral Kiev, roasted in all natural dragon spices,\" the head chef said with a smile, kissing his claws. \"Bon' appetit!\"</span></div></div>",

She needed this stallion now. It wasn't like he would be her first, even if he was a guard. She shut the door loudly, making it sound like she was gone so he kept his back turned, then she lightly flitted her wings. Lifting off the ground she made no clopping noises as she gently flew across the room, stopping right above him. With a grin she lifted her legs, pointed down her bouncy rear and let her flapping wings still. \"How about some lunch plans right now?\" she called down to him to get his attention so as he looked up she'd drop straight down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMint perked up for a moment and looked at the voice, his eyes went wide as he noticed the mare hovering above him with a hungry glint in her eyes. \"Wha?\" It clicked a moment too late what she was planning on doing with him and his fist instinct was to toss the mop aside and shield his face with his forehooves, making himself more cone-like in shape, standing on his rear hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce was amazed at how perfectly her plan worked, the stallion reacting exactly as she'd hoped. She giggled as her rump fell, his forehooves dquishing right up between her cheeks and into her pudgy pucker with a squish. A resounding squelch accompanied the sinking of her butt hole right over his forehooves and head, her butt only stopping when it bounced on his shoulders, his entire head crammed into that stinking dark hole, imprisoned in the soft ass of the thestral as she started to wriggle against his shoulds. \"Unnnnffff~ You're going to fill me up so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMint shouted in protest as the rubbery ring slithered onto him and he was lost into the fleshy, rancid tube of her intestines, \"Get off me!\" With his forehooves trapped within her he tried walking about, his rear legs leading them both into a wall before they fell over and landed with her on her back as he slowly slipped up her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce groaned in delight, wriggling her rear around as she felt him stumbling beneath her. A muffled beg from inside of her bowels earned a gassy response as Moonbounce squeezed out a puff of rancid and wretched air, the quiet pfffftttt seeping out around Mint's shoulders and helping widen her rear. When his rear legs slipped and he fell back, Moonbounce was dragged too and another squelch claimed his middle, her butt bouncing against his lap as everything above was now encased in ass, his head deep in her long and slimy intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMint wiggled and yelped in disgust as the foul air squeezed out over him before blowing against his flanks, \"Please, let me out! I can get you some food!\" he whimpered as the only air around him made him gag and sputter, the walls lined with sickly fluids that matted his coat as he sank in further. He kicked back with his legs to grab a hold of something desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thestral panted hotly as she felt her meal wriggling against her, the desperate sound of begging coming from inside of her already bloating guts, his head well on its way to her stomach. \"It's too late now~ Should of offered to take me out for lunch,\" Moonbounce said, fighting not to moan until after she finished speaking. More foul gas squibbed out of her, Mint's fur losing a lot of lustre as some foul stuff dripped back onto the freshly cleaned floor. Moonbounce stood slowly, her ass bouncing upwards and dragging his kicking legs with her. Then she shoved his hooves abck against a wall, the impact crushing his crotch deep into her ass, his legs sliding in all the way to his hooves in one hard cotninual push as his head pressed up and through a sphincter to enter the belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMint continued to plead, \"I had to do janitorial duty, I couldn't offer that!\" He closed his mouth and scrunched as a rancid stench invaded his nostrils, searing at his senses as it slipped over his sinking body. \"Squeeze me out and I'll do whatever you want!\" He sputtered as he entered the last stretch of her intestines and squeezed into her stomach, the scent of acids and decay wafting against his face. He began to shout and kick uncontrollably to escape, pushing his forehooves into the stomach to push back against the thick, fleshy walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce had to bite her lip to halt a delight filled scream. Being this full was amazing, her ass felt wonderful and her snatch was already oozing sweet syrup like some kind of honeypot. \"Mmm, couldn't or wouldn't?\" she groaned back, giggling at how filthy she was making the cleaner. \"You're not getting squeezed out till my belly's done,\" she replied to his words as his hind hooves wriggled and kicked, then with a slurp they vanished to into her tailhole, disappearing from sight. A hot blast of stinking gas stripped some of his grey fur and green hair all over the floor as he vanished entirely into her guts. The fattened thestral fell onto her back with a thump, her belly bouncing above her as his kicks and struggles made it jiggle and hop, the imprint of hooves hammering against it showing through as bulges, and only earning a thick and meaty Brrrraaaapppp from the mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMint screamed from within and tried to push himself out by pressing against the walls, but the suction of the intestines behind him was far greater and with a sinking feeling he felt more of himself press into her stomach until he was forced to step into the broiling pool of acids below, a hungry gurgle resounding around him as more acids began to pour in. The moment his hooves touched against the acids he yelped in pain and retreated, his chest falling forward and he writhed in pain as the burning liquids tore away at his coat and skin. With all his effort he pushed himself out with his hooves and tried to withstand the pain that seared at him as more of his body slipped in. A sensation of hot air slipping over his lower body as a final insult as he felt her warmth now surrounding his body, \"I don't want to die like this, let me out! I-I thought we could be friendly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce lay in the centre of the freshly mopped floor, not caring as soapy water squished into the fur on her back. Afterall soap was much kinder than the bubbling pool of liquid Mint was trapped in. The acids kicked themselves into a broil, eagerly burbling as they assaulted her meal, stripping him of fur, burning away the skin of his hooves. Already he was bleeding before his rump squeezed inside, and then a last pulse of intestines forced in his hind hooves, completely sealing him inside the gut. His cries were so muffled that Moonbounce barely understood them. \"Just digest like a good meal~\" she said, patting her belly softly. \"That's what friends do,\" she said with another giggle. All of his pounding and shaking only made her moan again, her marehood oozing with excitement as she started to grind her pudy belly against it, her hooves uanble to reach with her filling meal, but the sagging stomach in just the perfect position. As she ground against her gurgling gut she felt it tightening inside, squeezing the stallion as his flesh seared off, quickly burning up in her roaring acids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMint was trapped in a world of agony as he splashed around in the darkness, desperately looking for an escape from the unrelenting bite of the acids. The pool slowly grew around him as with each gurgle and groan he felt splashes against his body, most of his coat had already slopped off him and his skin was slowly pealing away, giving room for the sensitive muscles and tendons within that were broken down by the acids, \"You can't do this!\" He yelled at the top of his lungs moments before the kneading walls squished tightly against him and several of his bones cracked. A few twitches escaped as his life slowly slipped away, he could feel her prods from outside as she rocked about, to his dismay she may be enjoying what could be his final moments. \"F-friends don't...\" His eyes slowly closed, the unrelenting pain becoming too much as his body began to convulse and shut down, his mind completely gone as his body fought on its own before growing still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thestrals's huge belly sloshed and glorped with each desperate movement of the trapped prey within. The unfortunate stallion was doomed quite quickly, and it only got worse as Moonbounce playfully prodded and teased, grinding against her gut. \"Mmm... it's a shame we didn't meet when I was so hungry, might have had some fun,\" she said, giggling as she watched him twitching inside of her, the last few struggles against her squeezing gut as the acids inside her stomach dyed red with blood. Exposed muscle tissue and bones seared as Mint screamed and begged, a tight hug earning a crack as the stallion was almost split into two. \"Nighty night,\" she wished her belly, giving it a tap and making it wobble as she heard a few pained wheezes and then nothing. Another squeeze of her belly and he snapped like a twig, breaking into two twitching, meaty lumps which the acids were quickly working into unrecognisable sludge. Her marehood squeezed into her belly and something bony prodded right inside. With a sudden squeal she finally orgasmed, splattering her sticky apple sauce all over her belly, matting up her fur. With a sigh she lay back and closed her eyes, just for a moment.</span></div></div>",

The mush that was Mint was worked down very swiftly, a thestral's digestive system one that was adapted to stealing prey in the night and flying out empty in the morning. Fat was added to Moon's lovely flanks, pudge packed onto her already chubby stomach, and what wasn't used was packed back, slogged through the same bowels that Mint had travelled up and pressed against her rectum, stealing her back from her sleep as a massive anf gasssy phhhbbbbbtttt ripped from her ass, a dirty trombone sounding for tens of seconds before it came to a close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, wassat?\" Moon said, sitting up, and looking down at her belly. It groaned again and her eyes went wide. There was no time to make it to a bathroom. She kicked over the mop bucket, spilling cold and soapy water over the floor before she hoisted it back up again and parked her flanks over it, her tail lifting as her rump cheeks parted to expose that fleshy and thick anal ring. Another gassy blast started, but quickly escalated into a wet squelch, before a thick and mushy log of ex-Mint began to slide from her bowels, squeezing from her pucker and falling with a loud and wet slap into the bottom of the bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the help, cleaner,\" the thestral said with a giggle, feeling her rounded belly with her hooves as her doughy rump cheeks shook, forcing out another thick and chunky log of stallion. Clumps of fur and hair, as well as fragments of crushed bone were encased in the thick brown as it squeezed out, coming as a solid sausage that squeezed outwards, before a splat broke the log and dumped half the mess into the bucket with a slap... and a moment later the other half of the log squeezed out to thump onto the growing heap inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce felt a surprisingly intact skull start to stretch her ass and she groaned in delight, her tongue lolling out from the gaping of her tailhole. The added pressure also caused her marehood to flick and a pulse of hot, golden urine burst forth, splashing wetly over the brown mound of scat, before the skull fell into the heap with a splat, crowning the top. Her urine spluttered and then cut off, leaving a fat and happy thestral, and the cleaner stallion a rancid and horrible mess in his own mop bucket. \"Now I can sleep,\" she declared with a grin.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><u>This is an interactive set in a vorish and other fetish inclined take on the world of My Little Pony. All fetishes are welcome here, and any that end in the death or permanant transformation or detainment of a character are even encouraged. <br>\r\n</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Welcome to the Royal Guard, cadet! The following day will be trying. Almost fifty percent of cadets end up shoved up butts, crushed under hooves or turned into cumdumps on their first day... but survive the first and things will get easier. Those reports you hear of young guards ending up smeared across heavy flanks, being splattered out into dumpsters, or dragged into a dark alley and gangbanged are not exaggerated. Canterlot's seedy and swollen underbelly hates every one of you, and will want to see you ruined. We have taught you all we can, but getting those street smarts fast is up to you. Now best of luck to all of you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this interactive you will choose one of two characters, and guide them through their first day as a guard, either leading them to ruin or victory depending on what you would like to see. As mentioned before permanant fates are encouraged, and there's no limit on what fetishistic fate befalls them, though vore will be a central theme in the story along with more cartoonish and slobbish fates thanks to personal preference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointed Lance - Lance is a unicorn stallion with a white coat and a dark blue mane, looking very much the part of the Royal Guard in his golden armour as he has chosen to serve Celestia. A military family with a proud backbone has seen him very much volunteered for a position which he would rather not be in. His disposition is fairly nervous and the unfortunate situation he finds himself in makes it hard for him to think positively. His eyes are a fetching green, and very often seen switching back and forth as he practices his detaining spells. His cutiemark is a lance with a fancy tassel of red tied around the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbounce -  Moon is a chipper silver grey coated thestral mare who has been training for this her whole life. She can't wait to serve Luna like her parents before her, and approaches any situation with optimism and a sometimes overdose of bravery. Warm amber slitted eyes grace her face, and her purple armour matches the leathery length of her wings when they are outstretched. A mane of dark blue sits atop her head and is usually messy, just like her tail. Her cutiemark is the moon appearing to be moving upwards courtesy of speed lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>I will be keeping an eye on updates and will be offering to fix up chapters that do not meet a basic standard for detail or other reasons.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am still working on this and will be adding chapters, but feel free to add wherever. No need to notify me. If there's a clash I'll work around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with OC art thanks to the awesome dddddd2!
