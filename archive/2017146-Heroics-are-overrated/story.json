The trees are swaying, the birds are chirping, the tropical flowers blossom under the warm and inviting sun, and 1000 feet under this particular island a two billion dollar investment is squandered.  All is as it should be!  Facility 2, as it is known to those in the know, is a multistory underground bunker city complete with residential areas for the super humans and base staff, food courts, malls, training centers, weapon storage, and cybernetics research.  The compound houses the pride of the US special forces:  The Emergency Super Human Strike force (ESHSF, pronounced \"Eshesef\"), super heroes dedicated to protecting the public and performing tasks too dangerous for conventional means.  Or rather, it should be housing that.  In a perfect world that is what the base would be housing.  Instead it houses a bunch of unruly brats with super powers and the human staff who are there mostly to keep them from getting bored and wandering out.  As of June 15 2022 there were ten super humans in the so called strike force, each of them finding their own ways to \"entertain\" themselves.  Now the US is stuck babysitting these uncooperative freaks as a complex web of bureaucracy and misguided patriotism keeps the base afloat.  Now then, who would you like the story to focus on?</span></div></div>",

After all you could be anywhere at any time, just waiting to pounce on your unsuspecting prey!  You were one with the night, a shadow like your namesake, intangible and unstoppable.  What exactly was it that you, the intangible and unstoppable shadow were using your deadly powers for?  Well, since it was 3:00 PM you were in the locker room, watching as the five (technically ten, as Sam was a girl at the moment and four of Maria's clones had joined them) women took their daily shower, naturally.  It's practically the first thing that crosses anyone's mind when they think of having invisibility powers, and you had made a habit of staying in the shower room after the 2:30 male shower and just watching the girls clean themselves off and chat in the nude.<br>\r\nYou as well wore nothing, having stayed in the shower room after your own seasion, adding immensely to the experience as fog from the communal shower clung to your skin, mixing with the pleasurable sweat the ran down your flesh.  Your gaze darted from one to the other as they were blissfully unaware of your intrusion, and though you had already seen and in fact felt most of them it was watching them at such a vulnerable moment that was really what got you going.<br>\r\nThe girls were already in the midst of a conversation, having just switched topics from most squeamish guard to guys, more specifically the ones with super powers.  \"I don't know, I think Lee is probably the most fun under the covers.  Just has so many options, you know?\"  Felicia said, addressing Olivia as she casually scrubbed her thighs.  This wasn't all that uncommon of a topic despite what it may seem.  Being locked in such close quarters for so long relationships were a bit of a casual cluster fuck both metaphorically and occasionally physically, with everyone kind of doing whoever whenever.  Ginny was probably the most uptight and prudish of them all and even she had experienced all of her compatriots at least once.  It was just a way to pass the time mostly, though there had been some more serious relationships from time to time.<br>\r\n\"No way!  I'd take Roy any day, those portals of his just open up a whole damn jar of possibilities!  Hell I don't think it would even be possible to try them all in a lifetime!\"  One of the Marias said while washing the back of Olivia, the other Marias nodding in agreement as they continued washing the other parts of her.  <br>\r\n\"Eh.  Options doesn't equal satisfaction in my book, sometimes being excellent at a handful of moves is better than being decent at a million.\"  Sam commented.  \"It's one of the reasons I like Brad.  No matter who's body he's in the man knows his stuff.\"  She then looked down at June.  \"Want to add something dear?\"  Sam asked.  June gurgled which Sam interpreted as a yes.  June, being the masochistic unkillable thrill seeker that she was, had made a bet earlier that day that she could stop one of the elevators with her bare hands.  By technicality she was correct, the elevator did stop, but it cleaved off everything below her head.  Though she could have just healed herself fully in a minute if not less she liked experimenting with having different amounts of her body missing so for the time being Sam had agreed to help her until she grew her body back, which currently had only regenerated down to the base of her neck.  Sam lifted June's head out of the bucket of water that she had been washing her in and June spat out a mouthful of water before voicing her opinion.<br>\r\n\"I'm on team Maria on this one, variety trumps all.  But Brad isn't bad.  What do you gals think of Garrett?\"  She asked, piquing your interest.<br>\r\nTo your disappointment you were greeted with silence, followed by Olivia vaguely saying \"He's not bad or anything, he's just a bit... small for me.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"  You yelped before you could stop yourself.  You were six inches dammit, that was average!  You quickly clasped your hands to your mouth in terror as you realized what you had done, watching as...</span></div></div>",

Did you say something Ginny?\"  Olivia asked, being the only one who had even vaguely heard you over the rushing water and sound of cleaning.  Ginny shook her head no to which Olivia shrugged.  \"Must've been imagining things.\"  She says brushing off her suspicions before changing the topic of discourse to cities they'd visit if free.  You lightly sigh in relief, you were safe.  You watched for a while longer as the girls continued their cleaning.  After ten minutes most of them got up to leave, all of them save for the female Sam who wanted to stay for a little while longer.  June's head is handed off to Ginny and the girls leave Sam and unknowingly you alone.<br>\r\nSam was about the same height when in female form, losing only one inch and still annoyingly managing to be taller than you by two inches.  Sam was actually pretty damn attractive.  You know, when she was a she instead of his usual he.  She had short hair down to her shoulders that highlighted her thinner neck and softer jawline.  She wasn't busty and her ass wasn't huge, barely pushing a B in cup size, but her waist, flat stomach, and thicker hips seemed to perfectly accentuate her other curves giving her an hourglass  figure that boosted the draw of her long and slender yet visibly strong limbs.  Her back arched nicely and when naked like this it was certainly an eye pleasing view.  Sam washed her hips and thighs, softly gyrating her hips as she did in an almost unbelievable display!  She turned around when she was done with the soap, exposing her nice front to you as a look of contemplation grew on her face.  Your jaw nearly dropped as she smiled and reached both of her hands down between her legs, sliding her fingers along the surface between her legs and her slit, and using her thumbs to massage the groomed hair just above her groin, drawing her fingers closer to the center with each passing center.  Sam then says...</span></div></div>",

Well, what are you gonna do about it?\" you demanded, back straight and arms crossed in front of you in an effort to appear taller and more imposing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving one hand in your direction Sam replies \"Oh relax stud, if I'd really wanted to hurt you I would have ratted you out to Olivia and the others. No, actually I want to help you believe it or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me?

If I didn't know better I'd think you didn't like my little gift.\" Sam replied, trying to sound innocent and failing miserably, as it's all she can do to contain her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it?! Why the hell would I like it?! You turned me into a fucking girl!\" you exclaimed, gesturing towards your new body. Now even shorter than before, coming in at a mere five feet three inches, the new you was slender and delicate for the most part, though with curves in all the right places, with flaring hips and breasts that had to be near to a C-cup. Though you were unsure what your face looked like now, you could tell it had changed as well, with fuller lips and a more delicate bone structure, and framed by flowing locks of honey blonde hair down to just below your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you seem to spend an awful lot of time and effort admiring the female body, so I just thought I'd make it easier for you.

Enjoying the show despite the predicament you're currently in, you make no move to escape as the part time girl moves closer, nor do you protest when she wraps her arms around your neck and pulls you in close, the feel of her breasts pressing against your own recently acquired set causing your nipples to harden and an unfamiliar wetness to develop in your crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Sam's body begins to change, becoming slightly taller, harder and more muscular, her breasts transforming into hard pecs and a cock and set of balls sprouting from her crotch to press against your abdomen. Uncomfortable with this new development, you try to pull away, but it's not to be, as even before the transformation Sam was both larger and stronger than you, the additional upper body strength conveyed by her shift in gender from female to male only increasing the power gap between you, allowing Sam to control you easily, gabbing a bundle of hair at the base of your skull and forcing you to your knees, while reaching down with his other hand and grabbing the base of his cock and guiding towards your waiting lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrightened and revolted by this treatment, you begin to protest. \"W-wait a minute! What are you...?\" unfortunately, that's as far as you got as Sam thrusts his hips towards you, his fair sized member sliding past your lips and deep inside your mouth before you can even think to close them. \"Suck on this you little perv!\" he then orders as he begins face fucking you, practically gagging you with his cock on every thrust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to fight at first, but the grip Sam has on your hair, as well as your own lack of physical strength makes your resistance all but meaningless, so after a short time you resign yourself to your fate and do your best to avoid chocking to death, praying that Sam will get his rocks off quickly so you can put this whole horrid experience behind you and get back to being male again. After what seems like an eternity, but was probably only a couple of minutes at best you get your wish. Sam's dick spasms as he orgasms, great globs of cum spurting out of his dick and down your throat, the tightness of Sam's hold on you forcing you to either swallow or drown due to the flow of salty bitter liquid flowing into you. Not prepared to die at the tender age of eighteen you choose the former, the thick gooey substance oozing slowly down your throat, causing you to shudder with revulsion at the mere though of what you've just done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he's satisfied that you've swallowed all of it Sam releases you, allowing you to scramble back away from him where you huddle in a corner, knees drawn up to your chest and your arms wrapped around them protectively. With eyes filled with equal parts anger, fear and revulsion over what has just occurred, you glare at your attacker, wishing more than ever before that you could claim heat ray vision as one of your powers, allowing you to reduce Sam to a cinder for what he had just done to you. \"Why?!\" you demanded. \"How the hell could you do that to me?\" you cried, struggling to contain the tears that you could feel brimming up at the corner of your eyelids as real men didn't cry, or so you think, and you still considered yourself a man, regardless of what body you were in right now or what had just been done to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To teach you a lesson.\" Sam replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lesson!? What lesson!?\" you asked incredulously, wondering what sort of lesson Sam could possibly be trying to teach you by turning you into a girl and forcing you to suck his dick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see women as nothing more than pieces of meat, objects for you to use for your own pleasure, with no regard whatsoever for their feelings or privacy. What I did was intended to teach you that women are people too and should be treated with respect, not perved on or used and then discarded.\" Sam explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever, lesson learned you fucking hypocrite! We both know you were just getting off on having someone weaker you could push around for once!\" you snarled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine, you caught me! Honestly I just thought it would be fun to haze the new guy. I hope their are no hard feelings between us?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard feelings! I'll show you hard feelings! If I didn't need you to turn back into a guy I'd fucking kill you!\" you screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If so, a few more orgasms and I may not even want to turn back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not always. Also, it's always good to have options. Here, let me show you some.\" Sam says before laying the palm of her hand against your crotch just above your pussy, causing the area to begin to emit a soft glow. Suddenly, you feel something happening as a familiar tingling sensation courses through you once more, but centered on your crotch this time rather than all over like before as slowly, the flat skin beneath Sam's hand begins to bulge out, growing and shifting, until you're left with yet another set of genitalia, male this time, located directly above your pussy.Somehow Sam's powers have transformed you into a hermaphrodite! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" you exclaimed, unsure what to make of this new development, but you don't have long to consider, as Sam goes down on you once more, her soft lips wrapping around the head of your newly restored cock, licking and sucking, supporting herself with one hand while the other busies itself with your pussy as first one, then two fingers slide into you, causing you to gasp from the unfamiliar and unexpected sensation. Despite the surprise and minor pain of Sam's actions however, the twin assault on you duel gendered form is far too intense and far too pleasurable for you to even think of complaining, simply laying back contentedly, riding the waves of bliss as you draw closer and closer to orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Sam stops. \"Hey, I was enjoying that! What did you stop for?\" you demanded petulantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's not all about you. I want to get a little something out of this too you know!\" Sam explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it for a moment. Sure Sam had basically raped you, something you were still ticked about, but she had also shown you the pleasure of being a woman, something you had enjoyed immensely, despite your expectations to the contrary. \"Alright, that seems fair. What do you want me to do?\" you inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Sam began, before sitting up, allowing you to get a good look at her crotch, which you now saw had changed in the same manner as your own, sporting a penis and testicles just above her vagina. \"The way I see it, we have two options. We can either go with the sixty nine position, or we can take turns fucking each other, your call.\" she answered.</span></div></div>",

I must say, I thought you'd be a lot harder to catch.  June and I had a whole conversation planned out to egg you on and you get caught by the first bit of bait.\"  She remarks.  Though none of the girls could see it you were now blushing.  How could you be so stupid?!<br>\r\n\"Ugh, let me go!  You'd do the same too!\"  You futilely retort, straining to break the band around your neck but knowing that it was useless.  If Olivia had someone in her grip they weren't leaving without power tools or her say so.<br>\r\n\"Perhaps.\"  Olivia muses \"Or perhaps I'd be smart enough to not get caught so easily.  I wouldn't know, I'm not a weakling like you, am I?\"  She taunts, accentuating her point by slapping you approximately where your face was and catching you on the cheek.<br>\r\nThe good thing about being invisible was the element of surprise.  Olivia had made the cocky mistake of bringing herself in so close and you took advantage of it, swinging out with your right fist into her gut and hoping to stun her enough that she'd lose concentration and the tar would loosen enough for you to escape.<br>\r\nYou didn't want to admit that punching her probably hurt you more than it did her, but Olivia was the second strongest female in the facility next to June and came in forth total with Brad and Lee edging her out.  Even without any prominently displayed abdominal muscles it still felt like you had just punches the side of a bull and it had about the same effect.  Namely it just pissed her off.  Olivia flinched slightly and gave an uncomfortable hiss, stepping back ever so slightly to get out of the range of your swings.  \"That was a mistake.\"  She simply decreed.  \"One that you're going to pay for.\"  With that more tar oozed from her hands, encasing her body (albeit scantily) in a black dominatrix outfit.  Tall boots and long black gloves covered the ends of her appendages while her privates and stomach were encased in a leather looking one piece.  The same one piece extended to her torso and up to her neck,  with holes teasingly cut out for her breasts.  \"Now then, my dear little voyeur, we're going to have some fun!\"  She announced.  \"And today we have a couple of extra special guests to assist me!\"  She added, only increasing your dread.  </span></div></div>",

So for today Sam and Felicia are going to help teach you a lesson about a woman's body!\"  She said in an overly cheerful fashion.  She turned to the shorter Felicia \"Dear, would you mind getting this started?\"  She asked playfully.<br>\r\n\"With pleasure!\"  She replied, stepping up to you.  You knew what was coming and knew that it was unavoidable but still you tried to squirm out of the was of Felicia's grip.  Being practically bolted to the wall you didn't even slow her down, her open palm pressing into the center of your chest.  you suddenly feel a jolt as your powers are robbed from you and enter the girl cackling before you, your own body now in full display in front of the other girls.  Felicia tests her new found abilities off by switching back and forth between invisibility and visible, eventually turning fully transparent and- AH!  \"Boy, someone here is excited!  I didn't know you were into getting dominated!\"  Felicia commented, moving around your erect dick with her unseen hand.  She as well as every other girl in the room knew that that was just a residual from your peep show and that you were not turned on by this... well, you kept telling yourself that anyway.  Eventually her soft hand lets go of your member and she takes a few steps back, remaining unseen as Olivia laughed.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry my little pet, you don't have to be embarrassed!  Soon enough no one will be looking at your trouser snake!  Sam?\"  She turned to the other (currently) girl \"Could you initiate phase two?\"<br>\r\nIt just hit you what was about to transpire but before you could call out in anguish a light engulfed you, your proportions shifted, and after only a few seconds you were crouched against the wall, an even shorter, smaller, and frailer female.  \"Thanks Sam, Garrett... or rather Garettina is perfect now!\"  She said, patting Sam on the head with her black gloved hand.  Now powerless Olivia modified the restraint around your neck, the tar softening to a more rubbery consistency and detaching from the wall causing you to drop to your knees.  Soon the tar wraps all the way around your neck and forms a collar with a small ring on the back.  You look up from your new female body at Olivia who is practically lapping up your fear.<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do to me?\"  You ask with your now heightened voice, panic slipping in despite your best attempt to keep it back.<br>\r\nOlivia responded \"Why, I'm going to take my new pet and...</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, that's not what you receive.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't?\" Olivia replies, her eyes narrowing dangerously. \"We'll see about that!\" she says, a line of tar shooting from her open palm and connecting with your collar. Taking hold of your leash she gives it a hard jerk, causing you to stumble over to her before tripping and falling to your knees in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owe! Not so rough!\" you complain as you make your way to your feet, using your arms in a feeble attempt to cover yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only serves to tick Olivia off more it seems, as she growls \"You <b>don't</b> give the orders here slave, I am in command here!\" A whip forms in her off hand which she lashes out with striking you hard across your bare backside, causing you to yelp in a combination pain and fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry mistress, i-it won't happen again!\" you apologize, tears welling up in your eyes, though truthfully all you really want to do is give her what for. Unfortunately, between Queen's powers, the other girls presence, and your current tiny, nearly helpless form, such a thing simply isn't in the cards right now. Better to pretend to cooperate and bide your time until a better opportunity presents itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better.\" Olivia allows, before grinning evilly and adding \"However, I don't remember giving you permission to speak. Or stand for that matter. And we certainly can't have you trying to cover yourself.\" With that, she lashes out at your with her whip once more, which acts like a tentacle, wrapping around your arms and pulling them tight together behind your back, the black tar like substance thickening and expanding, forming a set of arm binders, which then take on the hardness and consistency of steel, making it all but impossible for you to break free. Unfortunately, Queen still isn't finished, more tar encasing your feet and lower legs, forming into an extremely tall pair of needle tip high heel boots, forcing you up on your tip toes and rendering you new feminine ass all the more prominent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better.

And the good news for you is that you could come out of it unscathed!\"  Olivia announces, though knowing the sadist standing before you you highly doubted the final statement.  \"It's a game they called 'Blue Balls' and the rules are really quite simple!  Once the game starts the pack of Marias are going to be let loose on you, touching and feeling whatever part of you they please at their leisure.  If by the end of five minutes you haven't blown your load, hence the name, you metaphorically get off with only a warning.  If however you get off in a much less metaphorical way then... well...

Each girl seemed to move in clockwork unison, latching onto a different piece of you and setting to work giving you some of the best treatment you'd ever received.  One went to work kissing you passionate, holding your twisting head in position despite how hard you tried not to reciprocate.  One was doing the more nuanced work of tracing her nails up and down your abdomen, sending shivers down your back and causing every hair on you to stand on end.  One between your legs was working your cock like a professional porn star, hands, mouth, tits, and snatch all coming into play.  The fourth and final girl was working on your feet, an area you now regretted telling anyone was quite sensitive for you.<br>\r\nWith four girls on you and after just watching them previously you were already on the edge and hardly thirty seconds had passed.

Waves of cool water lightly brushed under your sand speckled feet as you sat motionless, save for your left hand which lazily swilled a glass of ice cold tropical cocktail around keeping the mixture from separating between sips.  It was just like the beaches you remembered when you were back on the surface, back living a normal life.  But it wasn't.<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes and looked around, knowing that the illusion was just that, an illusion.  You weren't on a real beach, you were in a one hundred square foot room that simulated a beach, complete with overhead lights mimicking the sun's position and heat, a ventilation system that created wind, wave generators to keep the seawater splashing, and sand from the surface.  The walls as well were painted skillfully in vibrant colors to look like this was a gated off section of an ordinary beach, but it wasn't.  It was a fake beach, built for your entertainment.  It was actually a little funny, having a fake beach an island with actual real beaches, cute in a way.<br>\r\nWith a sigh you finished off your drink before holding it aloft.  A nervous woman approached you, dressed as though she were the employee of an island resort.  She looked to be in her mid twenties, Hispanic, and rather cute now that you got a better look at her, with wide hips and a sizable bust combined with a face that if not for the nervousness would have been ravishing.  You took in a good eyeful of her, smiling as she squirmed under your gaze.  She was new here.  Not brand new, she had certainly gotten over the initial shock, but new enough that she feared you and the other supers.  When you finished eating up the sight of her you handed the emptied glass to her.  \"Another island drink thing, Candice.\"  You say, testing her a little.<br>\r\nShe takes the glass and answers \"Actually, my name isn't Candice.\"<br>\r\n\"Crying shame.\"  You answer sarcastically.  You knew her name wasn't Candice, you just had a habit of calling all of the new girls Candice and all of the new guys Larry.  With the burn out rate of the employees it was hardly worth it to learn the name of every new face around here.  The woman huffs at your attitude, stomping off to mix you a new drink.  You laid your head back and bathed in the artificial sun, allowing your mind to clear as you did.  Candice came back with your drink, but before she could hand it to you she tripped, the glass going flying and splashing over your chest.  You scrunched your eyes and rubbed the bridge of your nose in annoyance.<br>\r\nFor her part the woman you called Candice looked absolutely mortified \"Brad... I am so... so sorry!\"  She squeaked, scrambling to her feet.  \"I'll go get you something to dry off with!\"<br>\r\nYour face relaxed.  \"No, it's okay.\"  You say, concentrating on Candice.  \"I have something right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you were looking at yourself, your face in a trance like state of meditation.  You were now in Candice's female body, able to feel everything she did and hearing her own thoughts only as a faint echo in the back of your mind.  You smiled with your new full red lips, admiring the body that you had just conquered, more beautiful now from this first person perspective.  \"I'm sorry I spilled your drink on you, I'm such a ditz!\"  You say in a mocking tone while bopping your new head with your soft hands.  \"Here, let me clean it up for you!\"  You said in as sexy a voice as you could, finding it easy with vocal chords like these.  You reached down and slid your shirt up. noticing how nice the polo fabric felt sliding up your silky skin.  Once it was fully removed you bent down and began wiping the drink off of your original body, trying your best not to laugh as you put on this ridiculous display.  Once you cleaned the drink off of your original chest you turned to your hair, noting how specks of the fruity red liquid hung from your otherwise snow blond hair.  \"Ugh, that simply won't do!  Let me get that!\"  you said as Candice, reaching down and pulling your shorts off, leaving Candice only in bra and panties.  you use the shorts as a washcloth and are able to work all of the red liquid out of your hair.  \"There, good as new!\"  You said, before looking down at your nearly naked body.  \"Crap, now I don't have anything to wear!\"  You thought for a moment, rubbing your thin effeminate chin before snapping with mock realization \"Oh, I know!  I'l  just go grab some new clothes from the staff lounge!\"  You said, knowing that the staff lounge didn't carry spare clothing.  You walked Candice out of the beach room, strutting her sexily through the halls, flaunting your physique to any and every scientist, guard, janitor, mutant, and miscellaneous crew you passed.  You fondled yourself, swung your ass, and even gave a lap dance or two to the stunned people sitting around gawking at you.  When you finally reached the staff lounge, currently packed full of twenty people, you let your control of Candice go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven from this great distance and through many walls you could hear her embarrassed shriek, laughing uproariously as she wailed.  That put you in a good mood, and even more so it got you in the mood for more mind control shenanigans.  Closing your eyes again you decided to take control of...</span></div></div>",

That and the twerp seemed to have a bizarre obsession with you, always clinging to you when she had the chance and trying to talk to you all of the time.  Maybe you reminded her of someone she knew back on the surface, maybe she looked up to you as the oldest male figure, maybe she just liked YOUR male figure, you had no idea.  All you knew was that that little brat had some long overdue payback coming her way.<br>\r\nStanding up and walking back to the little service desk of the fake beach, reaching over the counter and snagging the small bag containing your gear, the only bag behind the desk at the moment.  Unzipping the bag you threw on your white polo shirt and sandals followed by your wristwatch.  It was 11:15, so you had a little more than two hours before your first of two five hour testing session of the week, plenty of time for what you had in mind.  You opened up the door and stepped out, the cooler air and sterile scent of the facility corridor smacking you in the face like a brick as you left the simulated Caribbean paradise.<br>\r\nYou made your way down the hallways, knowing exactly where Felicia would be at the moment.  You had taken your time in the base to profile all of the long term residents, learning their paterns and mannerisms.  At first you hopes to escape with these skills but when it became evident that one would have a better chance of escaping Earth's gravitational pull by jumping you just did it out of boredom, making notes of their routines and schedules.  Right about now Felicia would... bingo.<br>\r\nYou peaked into the staff arcade, an area populated by gaming systems of all descriptions, arcade machines, and novelty machines like fortune tellers.  Most of the inmates weren't allowed in on account of your disruptive tendencies (inmates had your own identical arcade near the food court) but Felicia and Sam were deemed to be harmless enough to hang out in some of the restricted areas without having the guards called on them.  Felicia wasn't particularly popular amongst the rest of you and spent a lot of her time off hanging out with the humans as she was now.  At the moment she was waiting for her turn to play Street fighter, her and her friends swapping places on loss.  Ducking into a nearby supply closet you began concentrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down, small black hands meeting your gaze.  You smiled, flexing your fingers as you got your bearing in this body.  \"Hey guys you can take my next turn or two, I'll be right back!\"  You said in a perfect match of Felicia's speech.

You feel your bodiless perspective travel back through the halls and into the staff lounge. From here, you see a still distraught looking Candice with her head in her hands. The rest of the employees still laughing or taking photos. Some of them were female employees giving their male counterparts some serious scolding. You press on and  move towards Candice's unsuspecting body and crash into the back of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and sit up straight. You feel your long black hair touch your unclothed lower back. You wipe your tear soaked palms off on your new, large breasts and backside. \"Alright, glad everyone got to see me in all my glory. We all know none of you gentlemen are even able to get inside this body.\" You hold of from laughing at the slight irony. \"Let's all get back to work before the heroes show up.\" The staff lounge soon begins to return to normalcy as you walk outside and trot to the woman's locker room. You searched Candi-Maya's memories to learn what the combination to enter was. Upon entering, you see a few employees who give you odd looks. You just smile back and find an area that was empty.  You knew how to break into locks since your youth so you find a pink padlock and open it with ease. Inside you find an extra staff uniform top and leggings, along with a pair of flip flops. You slide the t shirt over your large breasts and put on the comfortable leggings. You walk towards a full length mirror and see Maya staring back at you. The shirt was one size too small so her athletic midriff was on view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and Maya smiles back. You grab some of her hair that falls almost to her butt and bring it up to smell. \"Not the smell I would have chosen, but I always wanted black hair. This is just so long. I don't know how you girls do it. It will be interesting to say the least.\" You laugh at the sound of Maya's slight accent and melodic voice talking about issues like this. Soon Maja's reflection moved down to her skin tight leggings that cover her toned legs and wide hips.  \"So this must be how the heroines feel in there skin tight costumes. I always wanted to try these.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you leave the locker room and plan to enter the meeting with your fellow heroes with this change in perspective. </span></div></div>",

That being said you loved your own portals, and consider yourself the luckiest of the people stuck in this base.  They just offered you so many possibilities, so many things to do, so many ways to have some fun!  Right now you were in the locker room of the spa, waiting for your target.  Just as you expected you heard the door to locker room open and light footsteps approach a locker, the one that you were hiding in, Felicia's locker.<br>\r\nShe opened up the door while looking down at something on the floor, not noticing you at first.  When she finally looked up she screamed in horror, jumping back in panic.  She had only been wearing a towel, having just come out of the steam room and with her sudden jolt of movement that meager covering flew off, showing off every speck of her sleek figure.  You had opened up a portal in your neck severing your head harmlessly from your body and placed your head into Felicia's locker.  After that it was just a matter of adding some dark ketchup and giving your best dead eyed stare and voila, instant horror scene!  You were unable to hold your dead face and began corpsing like mad, laughing hysterically as Felicia recovered and fumed, doing her best to cover herself.  \"Why you little-!\"  She shouted, blood rushing to her cheeks in rage and embarrassment.  You could tell that she was about to try and grab you, sapping your powers, but before she could you made your second move.  Bursting from the locker behind her your body quickly kicked Felicia square in the perfectly sculpted ass with your shoe covered foot, knocking her flat on her chest,  and before she could stand you widened the portal around your neck while simultaneously opening up one over your bed on the other side of the facility, allowing your head to drop down onto your mattress.  Your body then opened and closed a portal under it shortly after and dropped onto your bed as well.  The weight of this catapulted your noggin into the air unexpectedly, your head smacking into the ground hard.  \"OW!\"  you shouted, walking your body shakily over to your head.  \"Note to self, drop body in first next time!\"  you comment, picking your head up off the ground, begining to wipe some of the ketchup off with a towel.  Well that was fun, now what?</span></div></div>",

You're search is fruitful, as in addition to several of the female staff members including a couple of cute interns, and a couple of the Maria's, you also spot Olivia beating the stuffing out of the heavy bag, as well as June, who's busy doing some sort of weird speed drill involving an open fire and what looks like nuts of some kind, repeatedly thrusting her hands into the fire and attempting to grab the nuts fast enough to avoid being burned. It's not going too well judging by the number of scorch marks she's got on her, but she keeps at it, her regeneration and inability to feel pain rendering the exercise, which would be deadly to anyone else, virtually harmless. with so many women to choose from, it's hard to decide. While the maria's would likely be the easiest, Queen is defiantly attractive enough to get your attention, even if her violent nature and controlling personality does make her a little bit scary. The intern are another option of course, provided they haven't been warned to stay away from you already, and then of course there's June, code name Ragdoll. While not the most attractive girl out there, she's still pretty cute, and her powers insure that no matter what happens, it's sure to be interesting, though whether that's a good thing or a bad thing can vary a lot.</span></div></div>",

The two of you have yet to be introduced, but you make it a point to learn as much about the new personnel as possible, using your portals to gain access to information that the powers that be would really rather you didn't have access to. Not being able to crack her personnel files, you don't know much about her personality, but you do know that she's highly intelligent and extraordinarily attractive standing 5'5\", with lightly tanned skin and beautiful features, complimented by her dark brown eyes and long, straight dark brown hair. possessed of an hourglass figure with long sex legs, a narrow waist and full double D-breasts, her body is just as good, making her nearly the equal of Olivia in terms of physical beauty, though without the super powers that make Olivia so dangerous, and, so far as you know, none of the hyper aggressive nature that makes her so hard to deal with.  Of course, you've no idea how either intern will react to the sort of games you like to play with your bed partners, but then, that's half the fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking things over, you decide that__________________?</span></div></div>",

That being said you had long ago mastered the art of being in multiple places at once and practiced often, to the point where you could be focusing on two entirely different things (like modifying your face and playing a  video game) with ease.

I want to know what it's like to be a guy.\"  She clarified.  You and Melissa had been good friends for a while now, the intern having always been cheerful and optimistic despite the conditions.  She was a pretty insightful person and new how to keep her cool, a necessity with such a chaotic lifestyle.  Plus she didn't look half bad either, long brown hair and a beautiful busty body marred only by a thin scar of unknown origin on her forehead that didn't detract at all from her lovely face..  What?

Just Alright?\"  Melissa asked with some confusion in her voice.<br>\r\n\"What, did you want me to say no?\"  You inquired with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"NO!\"  She said louder than she probably wished, only causing her face to further redden.  \"I mean... I just thought you'd be a little harder to persuade.\"<br>\r\n\"Melissa, people ask me about this kind of stuff so often I've seriously considered charging for it.  Boy to girl, girl to boy, boy to in between, girl to sexless, the shock value isn't really there any more.\"  You tell her.  This seems to reassure her as a weak smile slides onto her lips, and before she can say anything or change her mind you concentrate for a brief second and before your very eyes she transforms, her surprised shout getting deeper as the changes took hold.<br>\r\nMelissa's hair shortened and thickened into a more boyish mop over an angular and better pronounced face.  She had gained a few inches, now standing even to your male eye level which was about five feet and nine inches.  Her shirt, lacking the breasts it once had to hold in and placed on a wider and longer frame was now comically misproportioned,  ending above her belly button and above her wrists while still being rather baggy.  Her skirt too was now too small and tight as well, allowing a visible outline of her new parts.<br>\r\n\"A little warning next time would be great!\"  Melissa shouted, before placing a hand in front of her mouth in shock at her new masculine voice.  She spoke again, trying out her vocal chords.  \"Wow, uh, this is weird!  Cat.  Oak tree.

You currently had eight clones out, having learned to keep an internally tally on them for the sake of convenience and safety.  Eight was a little low, so right now you were looking to generate some more.  Most of your teammates didn't know the process, as you didn't like people to know which of you was the real you, it was more fun that way.  Unbeknownst to all but a select few scientists and yourself you had to be almost completely relaxed, as any stress or pain would cause new yous to come out... poorly.  Stress clones would either deteriorate far quicker than their siblings, be far more malevolent in their tricks, or would even come out incomplete, with sections of their body absent.  Once you were relaxed though you could spawn as many siblings as you liked, though you generally liked to keep that number around a dozen, more than that and it gets a bit too chaotic, less and it's too peaceful.<br>\r\nRight now you had four of your sisters around you, each doing something to work your stress away.  Being a bother all day can really take a lot out of a woman, not many people appreciated just how hard you and your twins had to work to keep everyone on their toes at all times, though it admittedly was very rewarding work.  You sat on a stool in the corner of the room as two of your sisters rubbed your feet each one pressing and pulling in just the right places, one of your sisters was massaging your shoulders, and a fourth clone with only a few minutes left on her expiration date was between your legs licking at your labia very slowly and very passionately.  You were in absolute heaven, and you'd soon be able to pop out some more clones.<br>\r\n\"Is this good?  I'm not being too rough am I?\"  The clone rubbing your back asked.<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes at her joke but took the bait anyway.  \"Yes, it's perfect.  You know exactly how I like it, it's a miracle.  It's almost as though we are perfectly in tune.\"<br>\r\nThe Maria rubbing your left foot looked up \"How about me?  I know how sensitive your feet are, am I doing okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Exactly how I like it.  Shocking.\"  You replied.  You could be such a pain in your ass sometimes.<br>\r\n\"How about this,\" the right foot clone asked just before placing her tongue at the base of your heel and running it up to the tip of your toes making you squirm with glee and laugh, \"Ou luike thish righ?\"  She slurred with a mouthful of wriggling toes.<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yes!  Y-y-you know your way around your own body!\"  You say while giggling.<br>\r\nAs if on cue the final clone broke its lip to lower lip contact and looked up at you from between your legs, eyes wide like a puppy dog's.  \"What about me?  I haven't heard you say one nice thing about me, even while I'm down on my knees for you!\"<br>\r\nYou bite your lip and she resumes her licking, her lips brushing along the periphery of your own in forceful yet soft circles.  \"Yeah, you're doing good.\"  You say with newly labored breath.  \"Really good, like this is the last thing you'll ever do!\"  You joke, finally causing one of their eyes to roll.<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's not my fault you only wanted me for a one off gag!\"  She reasoned before returning to her work.<br>\r\n\"Hmm.  Speaking of which do you know how much time you have left?  I've kind of lost count.\"  You say, knowing that all of your copies knew exactly how much time they had left.<br>\r\n\"About a minute.\"  She responded.<br>\r\n\"Then you best hurry up and finish with a bang, or rather, finish me with a bang!\"  You say.  She nods and begins diving her tongue into you as deeply as she could, nose rubbing up and down the precipice of your folds.  You began panting hard, the rest of your sisters joining in to to speed up the process.  The one behind you reached around and began fondling your breasts roughly while the other two both ran their tongues along your souls.  You could feel yourself getting closer and closer to release to release with each passing second, legs trembling and arms finding their way down between your legs to hold the Maria in place while she worked.  With a cry you climaxed, the Maria between your legs licking up every drop of your first orgasm dutifully.  Before you could have a second though you felt Maria dissolve, her body reduced to liquid as this as water before sloshing onto the floor, turning to a sand like solid and then nothing, no trace that she had ever existed.  There were now seven clones but that number was about to go up.<br>\r\nFeeling totally as ease you were ready to clone yourself, deciding on four copies and that each would last four days.  One by one the clones simply erupted from your skin, stepping out of you as if you were molting them.

You never asked to be around these idiots, you didn't want to be around these idiots, and yet... you liked these idiots?  Yes, as much as you hated to admit it your strange little cadre of freaks had grown on you since your first day, though you don't know why.  Perhaps it was because they were such interesting playthings, such fun toys for you to amuse yourself with while you thought of ways to escape.  They provided a nice distraction to the reality that this prison would be all you saw barring intervention from the powers that be.  They were better than the puny humans at least, the ones that locked you in here.  You fiddled with a wad of your tar idly as you thought, molding it into various shapes with your fingers.  You could just make it into whatever shape you wanted with your mind, but what would be the fun in that?<br>\r\nMaybe not much less than you were currently having as after a few more minutes you grow bored.  Tossing the wad of black slime away you sat up on your bed.  You were bored, it was time to remedy that.  You stood up and grinned, ready to get a playmate for the evening.  Looking down you began manipulating the tar currently on your body.  You generally used the tar as clothing, both out of convenience and out of creative challenge as you liked to change what style of clothing you were dressed in to fit the situations at a moments notice.  You had been dressed in a simple t-shirt and jeans made of the black rubber like material, but that wouldn't really be befitting for sneaking up on people and dragging them off to play with, now would it?  With a bit of concentration the material stretched and oozed around your limbs and up your face, reforming itself into a long black shirt tied off with gloves, boots, and a face concealing hood and mask.  You were dressed like a hollywood ninja, and you were ready to snag yourself a catch.  Now, who should you go for?</span></div></div>",

Even the very clear, prominent, and hand made \"If you value your life do not disturb.\"  sign on your door didn't seem to ward them away.  You didn't feel like dealing with that, so a Maria or maybe a handful of them would do nicely.  She was a brat who deserved punishing, no one would notice if one or two went missing for a while, and even if they did notice they'd be too busy enjoying the decrease insipid jokes to go looking.<br>\r\nYou began slinking around corners and peering down the halls on your way to the gym, knowing that that was a popular hang out of hers.  You peered briefly through the glass doors of the practically vacant gym, a few people pumping iron and two girls running while talking on treadmills, but no sign of any Marias.<br>\r\n\"Watcha looking at?!\"  Came a shrill and obnoxious voice from behind you, that of Maria mocking you for getting snuck up on while trying to be sneaky.  Bad move.  Without turning sections of your suit liquefy and propel themselves towards Maria,catching her hands and mouth.  Before she can react you harden the tar to that her hands are effectively locked together and she cannot speak.  You now turned, lowering your mask to show her your twisted grin.<br>\r\n\"Ah, perfect!  Just the bare bottomed bitch I was looking for!\"  You say cheerfully.  \"I was hoping we could play a game together!\"  At the mention of this Maria's eyes widen in terror and she quickly turns to run away.  She doesn't make it far.  You casually raise your hand and launch a globule of tar at her foot, the ball wrapping itself around the ankle like a shackle.  You launch another at her right ankle and it does the same.  You finish off by having the tar attract to each other, pulling her legs together and connecting them at the ankles before hardening like metal.  Maria slams chin first onto the ground and tries to inch herself away from you on her chin, her bound hands having  caught under her as she fell.  You casually strode up and hoisted her effortlessly onto your shoulder, your often under evaluated physical strength showing through.  The little rascal continued to squirm but began losing vigor as she realized the hopelessness of her situation and began submitting to her fate.  You had your catch...</span></div></div>",

Well, to you it was patting.  You imagined that from her perspective you it was probably much closer to spanking.  \"You know what?  Let's get you a playmate!\"  You decree, striding back to your room.  You set Maria down and tarred her to the floor, a bit overkill as she couldn't move anyway but hey, you could never be too careful.  \"You just sit tight here, I'll be right back.\"  You instruct her sarcastically, giving her two quick pats on the head before leaving to find yourself a second clone.<br>\r\nYou again stalked around the halls, making sure to catch as little attention as possible.  You make your way to the food court, usually empty at this time of day save for a janitor and maybe a cook or two.  Maria liked to hang out in these sorts of areas, she could isolate people more easily.  scanning the area from one of the shadier corners in the hopes of catching Maria in the midst of one of her jokes.  Sure enough you spotted one, too preoccupied with harassing a male chef to notice you.  Maria had snuck up on him, tied him to a chair, stripped him, and was currently busy writing profanities on every inch of his skin with a sharpie.<br>\r\nYou slide over the counter right up behind her, the girl completely unaware of your presence.  The chef on the other hand was looking right at you, worried eyes wondering if you were friend or foe.  Maria eventually noticed that her captive wasn't focusing his attention on her any more and traced his gaze right into you.  Before she could react you had secured her hand, feet, and mouth in tar just as you did her twin, hoisting her up onto your shoulder and walking off.  As you did so though the chef began making panicked grunts.  Turning back you saw that he shifted his gaze rapidly between his bindings and you, nonverbally begging you to help him.  You didn't want to warrant too much attention, after all if there's one thing you hated it was having your games interrupted, and freeing him could buy you some time as you could make an arrangement that he in fact never saw you and doesn't know anything about anything.  Then again he could spill the beans if a supervisor got on his case, thus leaving tied up would prolong that.  Lastly... he didn't look half bad.  Not the nicest looking guy around but he had sort of a cute innocent victim vibe going for him which you liked.</span></div></div>",

This guy though?  He was making sandwiches, probably took this job because the economy was shit and he didn't have any real world skills.  You felt sad for him which in turn made you angry at yourself for feeling sympathy for your captors.  You raise your hand and generate a black blade in your palm, slicing through his gag with a quick flick of your wrist.  \"I'll let you go, on the condition that you never saw me, I was never here, and you have no idea where this runt went.\"  You state, slapping Maria on the back.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I don't know nothing.\"  He quickly agreed.  With that you cut his hands free, dissolve the blade you had made, hand him one of his cooking knives, and leave him to do the rest.

You weren't in the mood for suppressing someone rough like June or Maria, and of course being unable to make skin to skin contact with a Felicia sort of kicked her out of the window of opportunity right away, so Ginny won by default.  Her soft demeanor allowed you to keep total control of her, and that's what you wanted right now.  Total control of someone.<br>\r\nYou slowly glided down the hallways, making your way to the girl's room on the other side of the corner.  All of the girl's rooms were concentrated into one corner of the third lowest floor, opposite the boy's corner.  As you passed down the nearly empty halls something caught your eye, something moving in the floor vent.<br>\r\nThe tar on your back shot out and latched onto the wall behind you, anchoring you and pulling you out of the way as those hours in combat training kicked in.  Felicia scrambled from the vent, still hoping to catch you and steal your power.  You were stunned, the girl was almost never this cavalier with you knowing that once you got your strength back she'd be in for a world of hurt.  Whatever, everyone makes mistakes.  This is one of hers. As Felicia got to her feet and began sprinting at you you unlatched from the wall and quickly pulled yourself up to the ceiling with tendrils of tar, the smaller girl slamming into the wall where you had been standing just a moment ago.  Before she could turn around you dropped yourself from the ceiling behind her and launched more of your viscous goo at her from your fingertips... you know what you meant.  The tar landed on her hands and bolted them to the walls, spread out at shoulder length from one another.  Desperate, Felicia kicked out to try and catch you but to no avail.  Globs of tar latched to her feet and cemented them to the ground spread out, as though she was a criminal awaiting a pat down.  Felicia cursed as she realized how screwed she was.<br>\r\n\"Bad move my dear, a bad move indeed!\"  You coo, your tar shielded hand slapping her on the ass hard.  \"You should consider yourself lucky, I'm not in the mood for you right now.\"  You say chidingly.  You are about to walk away when you decide to punish her a bit more for her insolence.  You may not be able to touch her skin, but someone else could!  With you gloved hands you take a hold of her tank top and rip it open from behind, pulling the rag off of her body and dropping it teasingly before her eyes.  Next you took a hold of her pants and slid both them and her panties down to her ankles, revealing her outstretched perfect peach.  Lastly you pointed your index finger at her back and squirted a thin stream of tar onto it, forming a quasi temporary tattoo that read \"FREE RIDES!\"  Satisfied with your handiwork you chirp \"Well, maybe you shouldn't consider yourself TOO lucky!\" before strolling down to Ginny's room.  When you arrive you creak open the soft pink door, painted on her request, and peer in to see Ginny...</span></div></div>",

Finding the sight quite erotic, you nonetheless feel the need to discipline for playing with herself without your say so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlamming the door behind you you demand \"Who gave you permission to pleasure yourself slave?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny jumps, tearing herself away from her crotch, her face bright red at having been caught in such a compromising position. \"O-Olivia, ah, I was just...\" she began, but you're in no mood for excuses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hear  it you little slut! You've violated my commands, and now, you have to be punished!\" you cried, waves of tar shooting from your fingertips, covering the younger girl head to toe in a black catsuit without a single crack, seam or crevasse,Even her eyes nose and mouth having been covered, aside from a couple of small holes for her nostrils, as it wouldn't do for your playmate to suffocate before you can make proper use of her. Frightened and confused by her sudden blindness and confinement, Ginny makes as though to remove the offending substance she's coated with, only to find herself tightly restrained, the tar causing her body to go straight and rigid, her arms pulling in tight to her sides and merging with the tar coating her torso, while her legs are pulled even further apart before stretching themselves around  the bed posts and tying themselves in knots in spite of the rubberized girls efforts to prevent it. You aren't worried about hurting her however, as Ginny's elastic limbs can easily tolerate far more than this. Having her where you want her now, you creep closer, climbing on top of the bed and mounting the bound girls face, you order \"Pleasure me slave!\" Opening up a gap in the tar over the mouth of your victim, followed by a similar opening over your crotch. Being the submissive type she is, not to mention more than a little afraid to disobey, Ginny wastes no time in obeying, licking and slurping away at you pussy, her stretchy tongue diving deep inside of you and expanding, pleasuring you better than any cock ever could, and it's not long before you orgasm, showering your lovers face with your girl juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting Ginny gently on the cheek you tell her \"Good job slave, I think you've earned yourself a reward.\" then with a small gesture and an act of will, several seams appear in the surface of the tar covering the rubber girls body, strategically placed over her pussy, breasts, and anus, as well as the previously existing space over her mouth. Sliding off of the smaller girls face, you bend down, teasing her nipples with your lips and tongue, but the small size of her breasts leaves you unsatisfied. Squeezing them roughly, you look back over your shoulder at their owner, ordering her \"Now now slave, this simply won't do! These breasts of yours are much too small, not even a decent handful! I insist you make them bigger!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes mistress!\" Ginny meekly replies, her breasts quickly expanding from an A-cup, past a B-cup, and on to a small C-cup before their growth slows to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-is that big enough mistress?\" Ginny inquires cautiously, not wanting to displease you by leaving her breasts too small, but not wanting to make them any bigger than necessary either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping your lips with a fingernail, you consider. Certainly for your current purposes, Ginny's new breasts are certainly big enough, you weren't as obsessed with size as much as most guys seem to be, you just wanted something you could grab on to. On the other hand, you'd often wondered just how big the stretchy girl could get if she tried, so you wonder if you should have her go bigger? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You spoke out without my permission, and now, well, I'm afraid you'll have to be punished!\" you said, followed by an evil laugh that would have put any movie villain to shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No mistress! Please!\" Ginny cried desperately, but that was as far as she got, as a number of long and thick tarry tentacles emerge from your suit, penetrating deep inside of the poor girls pussy, throat, and anus, while another pair wrap around her breasts, forming tiny suction cups on the end which they use to tease her nipples. meanwhile you're fairly busy yourself, having resealed your suit and causing it to extend yet more tentacles into your own private places, gently teasing yourself as Ginny writhes in a combination of pleasure and pain as she experiences far harsher treatment from the mass of tendrils invading her. Still, you know that with her ability to stretch and reshape herself, the rubber girl can tolerate far more than this, so you double the number and thickness of the tentacles, causing her struggles to grow both louder and more frantic as she orgasms over and over, her body stretched in ways no ordinary woman could ever have survived, let alone enjoyed, her stomach bulging obscenely as the mass of tentacles invading her meet in the middle before bypassing one another and wiggling out the other side. This site is all you need to push yourself over the edge, cumming once more, allowing your concentration to lapse as you do so, the tentacles falling limp, allowing Ginny to do the same, unconscious from simple sensation overload. Coming back to yourself after a moment, you cause the tentacles to withdraw and be reabsorbed, it wouldn't do for you little playmate to choke on one in her sleep after all, before crawling in bed next to the smaller girl and pulling the covers up over the two of you and falling asleep soon after, quite tired from your little ordeal. </span></div></div>",

Unconsciously, you reach for the covers, intending on drawing them closer, but for some odd reason you can't seem to feel them, nor Ginny for that matter. Surely she couldn't have gone anywhere in the condition you'd left her in? Becoming more awake by the second, you also notice that your jaw is a bit sore and that there's a funny taste in your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what's going on, you open your eyes, blinking repeatedly in an attempt to clear the sleep out of them before attempting to sit up, only to find, you can't, you're body only flopping around a bit. Deeply worried by your apparent inability to move properly, you awaken fully and begin taking in your surroundings. What you discover both angers and terrifies you, as where your arms and legs should have been, there's nothing, just smooth skin covering your hips and shoulders, without even the slightest trace that any limbs had ever been there to begin with! You try to scream, but all that emerges is a muffled moan. Has whoever did this to you taken your voice too?! No, that's not the case you soon discover, as a quick check with your lips and tongue reveals a rubber ball of some sort jammed between your teeth, one that is impossible to remove in your current condition, the ball gag being held in place by a thick leather strap tied tightly behind the back of your head. Seeing red, you attempt to summon your powers to free yourself from your predicament and exact revenge on whosoever was foolish enough to believe they could do something like this too you and get away with it, but for some reason your powers don't seem to be working either! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Felecia!\"</i> you think to yourself, suddenly remembering your last encounter with the power stealing bitch. Somehow she must have worked her way free of her bindings and decided to take her revenge on you while you were asleep. Of course, that doesn't explain your current lack of limbs, as even with your powers there's no way Felecia could have possibly done something like this. Of course, Ginny had been in here with you, and with her powers in addition to your own, Felecia very well could have done something like this, but somehow that doesn't seem right either, as you can't remember the copy cat girl ever possessing more than one set of powers at a time, so that only leaves.... No, surely not, not Ginny, she's far too much of a pushover to ever even consider such a thing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a door open nearby, you struggle to sit up, craning your neck in an attempt to get a clear view of whoever it was who had entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvil laughter fills the room before a familiar voice sneers \"Ah, so, sleeping beauty is finally awake! I was starting to wonder if you were going to sleep the entire day away.\" Felecia says, heels clacking against the floor as she steps into your line of sight, hair tied in a tight braid and dressed in a shiny black catsuit that looks eerily familiar. \"So, what do you think of my new outfit? Personally, I think it looks a lot better on me than it does you, don't you agree? she teases, doing a little twirl for you, allowing you to examine the skin tight  suit from every angle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you bitch!\" you cry, though unfortunately the ball gag your wearing renders your words totally unintelligible, nothing more than an incoherent string of guttural nonsense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, glad you agree. Anyway, in order to show my appreciation, I thought I'd give you a through makeover. What do you think, pretty hot right? I never would have been able to do it without the help of my lovely assistant Ginny.\" Felecia explained. \"Hey Ginny, hurry up and get over here so that Olivia can thank you properly!\" she ordered, waving at someone outside of your line of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, with a great show of reluctant nervousness, Ginny makes her way over to the foot of the bed, her gaze traveling up and down your much reduced form before coming to rest on you face, smiling apologetically down at you.

It had been a very long and very exhausting day of tests, the lab technicians pushing you to the very limit for  four hours on end.  You knew that they wanted to produce something of value out of what was otherwise a massive waste of time, money, and resources, but some of these tests seemed a little nonsensical.  You understood some of them, like testing out how far you could stretch yourself and how long you could hold certain extreme postures, but what would increasing the size of your butt, thinning your hips, and walking up and down hallways prove?  You didn't know, but at least now the worst part of your day was over and you could just relax.  You bent your legs up behind your back and began fiddling with the zipper on your suit, your arms being too sore to move without some severe discomfort.<br>\r\nYou managed to pull the zipper down to the small of your back and with a puff of air the seal was broken.  Normal clothes would be pretty limiting and constricting to your powers, so you had had a specially designed rubber alloy suit made for you.  It did restrict your movement somewhat and was too snug for your tastes, but it was still a huge step up from cotton or wool.  Unwilling to get up and actually pull the suit off you instead opted for the easy way out, shrinking everything below your neck to the size of a barbie doll and allowing the suits weight to slide it off of the bed and onto the floor before re-expanding your body to normal size.  Well, relatively normal.  It was the size and shape you liked and that's what mattered.  A little taller than most girls sure, not as curvy as most people liked, but it was the one that you had before you learned of your powers, your original body in a way.<br>\r\nWith a groan you wrapped your leg around a bed post and pulled yourself fully into the bed, unwrapping the leg and then using it to pull the sheets over your naked body.  You sat in silence, drifting off into what you hoped would be a good nap.</span></div></div>",

Not that you care of course. out of all the male supers, Brad is arguably the best looking, and you haven't had sex with anyone yet today, so if he decided he wants to do a bit more than just helping you take your clothes off you certainly aren't going to try and stop him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Brad's help, along with much wiggling and squirming on your part, the two of you remove your pants, and after taking a moment to position yourself properly, you shoot both legs through the fan, attempting to grasp the diary between your feet and pull it out before the blades come back around. You fail spectacularly of course, both your legs being severed cleanly just below the hip before you can even so much as grasp the book, let alone retrieve it. Turning to Brad and sighing heavily you're forced to conceded defeat. \"Looks like you win. I'll tell Ginny about her diary as soon as I can pull myself together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin regenerating your legs however, Brad places a hand on your shoulder, causing you to pause for a moment. \"There's no need for you to do that right away is there? I mean sure you lost the bet, but there's no reason we have to tell Ginny what happened right this moment. Not when there are much more pleasant things we could be doing instead.\" Brad replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning slightly, you teasingly ask \"Oh? And what sort of things might that be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSporting a grin of his own, Brad replies \"Oh, I think you know. And no more regenerating for now, you won't need arms and legs for what I have in mind for you.\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhhmm! I think I like where this is going!\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, shall we?\" Brad inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I think we shall.\" you replied, grinning from ear to ear at the thought of doing the horizontal mambo with this gorgeous hunk of man meat. </span></div></div>",

I hope you enjoy the waterworks!\"  He taunted as he walked away, leaving you staring at your unscathed hand and what little remained of Ginny's personal journal.<br>\r\n\"I... damn it.\"  You swore, dropping the fragmented bits of pink cardboard and white paper to the floor.  You were not looking forward to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while everything was rather quiet and the day passed uneventfully.  You had supper, you showered, you chatted, and you exercised for an hour.  As you were worked out though you noticed Ginny acting odd, her eyes darting about nervously and her normal reserved demeanor become all the more enclosed, barely saying a word as she just went through the motions.  As you changed into some fresh clothes you approached Ginny, getting her attention with a quick tap on the shoulder.  The younger girl gasped with surprise at even that minor action.  \"Uh, hey.\"  She said softly.<br>\r\n\"Ginny... we need to talk.  Would you mind going somewhere private?\"  You inquired hoping to avoid a scene in public.  Ginny nodded and the two of you made your way to her room, the younger girl sitting on her bed while you stood near the door to make a quick exit once the deed had been done.  You were normally a very confident and forth going person but dealing with emotional stuff always made you very uncomfortable, it was the one place you could still get hurt.  \"Ginny, I don't really know how to say this but... you know that journal of yours?

It... it wasn't really salvageable, I'm... look I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\nGinny's eyes began to water, her body quaking at your betrayal.

Are you...okay?\" you ask apprehensively, beginning to approach her. \"I-I know I broke your trust, and I'll never do it again, but I-\" With <i>that</i>, she suddenly shot up, staring straight at you with hate filled eyes. Uh oh. You made an ordinarily timid girl angry. And man, when she got angry...did she get angry! \"Like shit you broke my trust! Stealing my diary? Getting it <i>destroyed</i>?! That was like, my own personal escape from this hellhole! And you tore it to SHREDS!\" she yelled, throwing the pillow to the side as she stood straight up, beginning to walk towards you. \"I thought we were friends, June! Friends don't do this to friends!\" \"I know! I'm sorry, Ginny!\" you yelled back defensively, beginning to back away towards the door. Ginny was figuratively and literally starting to bare down upon you, as she seemed to be growing taller as she approached you. \"Sorry?! Sorry doesn't even begin to come close to make up for it! I can't believe you'd just...I mean...what does this mean for us, June? Can we even still be friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing that last part, you stopped backing away, instead staring straight into Ginny's furious eyes with intense remorse. You weren't best friends or anything, but you didn't want to cast her to the side after this incident and add her to the list of enemies. Allies helped in this place, and Ginny was a pretty damn good one! \"Y-yes! I want to stay friends! I didn't mean to shred your diary, and I know I shouldn't have taken it! It's-uh...complicated...but I don't want you to hate me! Can I do anything to make it up to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny stopped for a moment, took a deep breath and tried to simmer down. Man, has she ever been that angry before? It seemed a little out of character for her, but that diary must've been very important to her...and you were the reason it was torn to shreds. Well, okay, it was actually Brads fault, but you were the one who got it torn up! You could've easily waited and just got help, but you had to prove you could. What a stupid move! If only you had-\"Well...\" Ginny began, interrupting your train of thought as you turned to face her. She seemed noticeably more calm, but still a hint of anger in her voice; you could tell she still seriously resented you for destroying what must be a prized possession. \"You...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lee had always been a difficult quarry for your power hunts.  Not only did he constantly shift his appearance to look like one of the powerless scientists or security guards the fact that he was, in layman's terms, a living blob of clay meant he effectively had eyes on the back of his head.  His entire mass was one giant sensory organ and the only thing that limited his ability to see hear and smell EVERYTHING at maximum efficiency through every single part of him was the fact that his 'brain', for lack of a better term, wasn't that much more powerful than a human brain so much like someone trying to watch a million TVs at max volume all at once he'd have total sensory overload if he didn't tune out most of them.  Even so he'd had plenty of time to practice down here and could be looking in a couple places at once, and he could look through any part of him from his eyes to his ankles and half the time even the 'shirt' he was wearing.  He alternated between wearing actual clothes and simply shaping and coloring his skin to look like clothing.  You're pretty sure he'd never wear real clothes again if it weren't for the fact that he'd never managed to get the texture quite right so if you touched his clay clothes you could tell something was off but just looking at them you'd never suspect a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, however, after waiting behind the vent in the darkened corner of his room for well over an hour you had you chance.  All day Lee had been disguised as a slightly chubby female physician, a rosy cheeked and red haired woman with wide hips and a wider bust all wrapped up in a lab coat one size too small.  The look was just subtle enough for the other staff not to think it out of place but not subtle enough to avoid catching a few glances and turning a few heads.  As he laid in bed however, eyes closed and breath slowing, he slowly changed.  His breasts receded, his cheeks lengthened, his clothes slowly faded to the dull pink color of his natural flesh and melting back into his 'skin' until finally Lee had changed back into his natural form, a naked and slightly pudgy Asian American with short black hair both on his head and peppering the rest of his body.  Lee didn't like his natural look, and only used it when he absolutely had to or when he was in a rut and didn't have the motivation to morph.  However he needed some level of concentration if he wanted to maintain any other form, so when he was exhausted, heavily distracted, or in this case asleep he always reverted to his original state (or as close to it as he could get to it.  If he passed out while split into multiple pieces they'd return to the shape and form of whatever part of his original body they came from but remained wherever they happened to be until he regained consciousness and pulled himself together... wow, you just realized how much Lee, June, and Maria's clones seemed to get maimed around here.  It's a miracle none of the less durable members of your super squad have been killed).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing out the vent cover as quietly as possible you inch your way over to Lee's sleeping body, your heart racing as you inched your way across the room.  Every muscle in your body ached from hours of crawling around the cramped vents, sweat poured off your dark brown skin and matted your equally brown hair to your scalp, but soon it'd all be worth it.  With one final step you are at the side of Lee's bed, the young man snoring away helplessly.  \"Yoink!\"  You shout, pressing a hand to his bare chest and activating your superpower.  Lee jolts awake with a confused yelp, already sapped of his powers but not realizing it quite yet in his sleepy haze.  Stepping back you can't help but laugh maniacally.  \"Yes, yes!  YES!\"  You say, feeling the looseness in your muscles and bones as everything below the surface of your skin turns into a homogeneous slurry of organic clay in varying densities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow fully awake and fully pissed off Lee shouts \"Not cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So cool!\"  You retort, transforming your right hand into a flesh colored soccer ball and your left into a crablike pincer to demonstrate your power.  Having only stolen Lee's abilities once or twice since you got here you still hadn't learned all of his tricks.  You had a tough time changing the colors of yourself and couldn't make a lot of the more intricate shapes he could, but you were a quick learner and with a few more thefts you're sure you'd learn to do everything he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, what the hell is your problem?!  I never did anything to you!  I never bullied or picked on you like the others, why would you do that?!\"  He yelled, standing up from his bed and towering over your five foot three inch frame as he berated you.  His usual reservedness and timid nature had dissolved as he jabbed his finger into your chest accusingly, his more solid flesh and bone leaving a small dent in the more viscous clay-flesh of your left boob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that you didn't like being talked down to, both metaphorically and literally, you decide to scale yourself up a little.  Your legs stretched out, your shoulders widened, your arms grew more muscular and your hands shifted back to normal looking albeit larger hands, your boobs and butt swelled which admittedly not entirely necessary to complete the look but you did always resent being the second least endowed super-woman on the team next to Maria, and finally your cheeks and nose grew more pronounced.  In an instant you'd gone from a sixteen year old girl to a 26 year old female athlete in tightly drawn, tattered clothes that now looked down upon Lee.  You both knew that your new appearance didn't REALLY make you stronger, if anything it made you weaker since you were now less dense (conservation of mass and all that), but damn did it make you feel good.  Plus if you really wanted to hit him you could just move some mass around inside you and solidify just your fist into the consistency of a brick, so there was that.  \"Dude, you seriously need to chill out.\"  You say, your voice still higher than you'd like as you hadn't learned Lee's method of changing his voice.  \"You were going to sleep anyways, it's not like you were going to be using your powers anyway!  You'll get them back this time tomorrow, just relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just taking a nap!  I have a date tonight you ass!  We were going to meet at the Staff Bar in two hours, how am I supposed to go out looking like this?!\"  He demanded, motioning towards himself.  While Lee was certainly not a model you always thought he was way too dramatic about his standard appearance.  Sure he was a little pudgy, his his face was soft and round, his skin not tanned nor pale enough, but he wasn't ugly or anything.  He wasn't a tub of lard, his eyes were a nice shape and distance apart, and while you'd always heard the stereotype about Asians and their wangs judging by the naked man standing before you it didn't look like Lee had heard such a thing.  Sure he wasn't HUNG but he was still packing some real heat down there in his natural state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A date, seriously?  What, looking like this?\"  You concentrate for a few moments, shifting around your flesh until you were the same shape and proportions as the scientist Lee was impersonating earlier.  Your skin and hair were still brown, you didn't quite remember how the ears or chin went, and since you didn't know how to make clay clothes and were still wearing your old (now even more torn) clothes you had to make some 'estimates' as to how her anatomy looked beneath the coat but apart from that you looked just like Lee's character.  You actually think it was an improvement, your dark skin and hair complimenting the fuller figure better.  Before you could make a joke about whether Lee was dating a lesbian or a man and which would technically be less gay you noticed that he was no longer angry.  His shoulders had sagged, his head was slumped, and tears had welled up in the corners of his eyes.  He was crushed.  Seems like this date had meant a lot to him, even if it was established under completely false pretenses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou respond...</span></div></div>",

Speaking of looking at one's body, now would be the good time you are still you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, you still see that you have your average frame body, not too fat and not too skinny.You brush through your rather long and fuzzy jet black hair, and your pretty sure you are still 5 feet and 8 inches tall,plus it's only been a few hours from what you could tell, so you are sure that you are still 19 years old. Those are good signs, and they let your body ease up a little bit, but not before noticing that your in your undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Your freaking</i>...<i>heart-shaped</i>...<i>undergarments...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis will make you look really bad for the team. You shouldn't look like a clown on your first day! It'll be high school all over again, and you can't go back to being bullied, not today,not tomorrow,<b>never again!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh...excuse me,\" You started, getting her attention by making her turn her head to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any spare clothes that I can borrow? I don't think anyone wants to see me like this.\" You can feel your face getting red, not because of you in your underwear, but mainly you trying to cover your bulge in your pants from staring at her ass for a few minutes. It wasn't helping that the fact that she also has ample breasts as well.She giggled at your little attempt to be a gentlemen as an excuse for some clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" She pulled out a little box inside her lab coat she was wearing, and tossed it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just press the button, and you'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny...this gizmo looks like something you could shoot mini pizzas out of it. Nonetheless, you pressed the big red button on the gadget, and out of the slot, some sort scanner started to go over your front, and soon after came some clothes slithering out slowly. You don't know how it happened, but as soon as the clothes came falling to the ground, you wasted no time in putting them on. You have to admit...your clothes looks pretty average. It was basically a black and blue stripped hoodie jacket, and a pair of blue jeans. It was a perfect fit, nothing too lose, nothing to tight! You couldn't believe it yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing...how do you do it?\" You ask, in complete awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's complicated, but we do have a lot more where that came from,\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I'll show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly she grabbed your hand and guided you where she wanted you to go...and instantly a swift chop broke the grip! It was very quick, and the chop was a bit off-target, and it hit your wrist causing some pain...definite pain, but it broke it nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Handz off, bimbo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAw crap...she got out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Your power got out!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" You squeaked, knowing who did the chop, and what was about to happen next. You turn towards your...power...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, it is hard to believe it yourself, but your power is entitled to someone who is bonded to you, mentally and physically. This 'butt buddy' goes by the name of Lyra. She isn't a human, she is some sort of mind snake that can appear out of thin air, usually in everyone's simultaneous blind spot. Her power is that she can sense the thoughts of those within a certain radius around you and can instantly transmit warning signals, usually in the form of a headache. She is also...pretty cartoonish in appearance. She is a mix between human and snake, but her most dominant features come from the snake side, especially the fact that she has no hands or feet, just legs and arms, but is still able to walk and pick up things normally. She has a pear figure, just like Cecile, only...much more bigger emphasis on her breasts,hips, and thighs. You're sure that she is at least a D-cup in size, and her butt sticks out noticeably as well,both of which are being hugged very tightly in her brown bateau dress,along with her tail that is long enough to be dragged across the ground. Combine that with her 6 feet and 6 inch tall orange figure, fangs sticking out of her mouth nearly all the time,and her head crest that appear to give her a second pair of eyes, and you got a Medusa on your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Lyra's face was in close vicinity with Cecile's, and well as their breasts pushing against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got zum nerve, doing zat to 'em.\" Lyra said. Her Russian accent was always monotone, so you are pretty sure Cecile can't tell if she is being mad at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\" Cecile asked, unsure of what is happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyra, stop!\" You quickly say, which made both of them turn to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyra, this is Cecile.Cecile...Lyra.She will be helping us get comfy in our own home.She will not harm us, as long as you don't hurt her,okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra didn't seem really please with this new adjustment. You can tell by the way she walked back to your side, her hips swinging in a mad fashion, almost tauntingly at Cecile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cecile, Lyra here is my power...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!?\" You really couldn't respond to her properly, she was already examining Lyra before anyone knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating...an genetic being capable of materializing from out of thin air.\" Cecile was writing down notes as she was talking.Lyra was doesn't look happy at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off voman, before I svat you vith my tail!\" She threatened, which Cecile complied, still jotting down notes. Before you could say anything, Cecile grabbed your hand again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to see something, if that's okay with you.\" She asks.You quickly nod, as she hurriedly escorted you to where she was going.Lyra was following behind the both of you, and making a gesture towards her, while moving her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm vathcin her...</i>it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was she taking you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were walking for what seemed like minutes, continuously questioning where is she taking you in your head. You weren't questioning because your legs were getting tired, you were doing so for the safety of this Cecile girl.Looking at Lyra, you can see that she was getting impatient, to the point of polishing her fangs with her stubby arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit, Lyra is not the person to have a casual chat with.She's a very assertive girl, if she wants something she will get it no matter what. She also has anger issues, and is very quick to jump to things, so she has started fights more times than you can count. The worst part is that she can disappear on her own as well as appear out of thin air, so you were the one to take the blame for the fights, and you couldn't just say \"My pet snake woman did it\" without someone looking at you like a psycho.She has made it up though...through sexual means...so you and Lyra are considered  friend with benefits. It's complicated, and you know it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, voman! Vhere are ve even going?\" Lyra asked. Cecile just turned to you, obviously wanting a translation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wants to know where are we going.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm taking you and your friend to meet the other super humans. We need you to be comfortable with the others, as not to promote unwanted aggro.\" Cecile said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo you, it makes sense. You didn't want to have others think you were some secret super villain and try to execute you in your sleep. You're not sure if that makes sense with Lyra, she seems to have a more aggressive look on her face as Cecile said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time has pass, you have entered some sort of food court,complete with tables accessorized with a large umbrella and at least four chairs. This makes you a bit uncomfortable, as it reminded you of the food court you go to.Knowing the fact that this is the new food court you may go to for lord know how long is what disturbed you the most.Well...you suppose you can adjust nicely after a few hours here,especially with the smell of greasy fast foods in the air. Lyra loves greasy foods, she likes the way it makes her fangs slippery, almost like she took a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Hey! Vat in the hell is going on here!?*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh look there's Lyra...inside your head. Yeah, even though she isn't present, she can still talk to you in your mind, so really there is no escape from her. You tried, but she is always there with you, mainly because she is soulfully tied with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Hey, Lyra, why are you in there? A little shy, are we?*\" You joked in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Oh hardy-har-har...if I vasn't sharing the same body vith you, I kick you right in the--*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here, Jake.\" You heard. Turning to the sound, you see that Cecile is signaling you to come closer to a table filled with males of all kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my lord...this is it! This is your big chance to make an astonishing first impression...but how can you do that with Lyra around. Speaking of which, you can't really focus with Lyra jumping around in your brain...metaphorically, of course. It has caused you to say some inappropriate things in the past, most of which has caused you to look stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Lyra, if you can keep quiet during my first meeting, I promise to give you a treat when it's over.*\" You said in your head.You know she can't resist treats...mainly one's that can't be healthy for a regular human body. As a matter of fact, you've gotten a strong feeling that you're going to regret it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Make it 6 cheeseburger, 5 cases of french fries, 3 large sodas...*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did you tell just yourself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo newbie! What are you staring at!?\" One of the males said. You snapped out of your trance of excitement and quickly approached the table, which is just littered with fast foods of all kinds. Hamburgers, french fries, soft drinks, the simple works. You were about to dig in, but you didn't want to accidentally steal one of the guys french fries. Cecile, and one of the males, did a small giggle as your stomached rumbled, aching to have some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good ahead, sir. It's on the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even say thanks to him before you stole a seat and started munching on a cheeseburger. How rude!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, these are our male super humans, and Mr.Lionel.\" Cecile said. Mr. Lionel tipped off his policeman-like hat. He's the nice guy, you get that. You also notice that he was siting in the center <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men, the honors...\" Cecile said, this time taking a seat next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The newbie can go suck it.How's that for honors?\" The young males said. Some of the other males almost laughed out their munched up food in their mouths. You were used to stuff like that, since it is easier to pick on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow!\" Cecile roared out, as she slammed one of her fists on the table. It was with enough force that caused the table to shake, which seemed to startle everyone. All the males, except Mr.Lionel, has lowered their food, and swallowed what was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...\" Shadow sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\nAfter a while, you managed to introduce yourself to the other guys, and they all introduced themselves, as well as describing their power for you, and giving their real names and nicknames. Lyra has not made a single peep ever since the meeting started, and you have been receiving little jokes and comments that were passive aggressive towards you. You can imagine how furious Lyra is, and how far she could attempt to throw all their skulls. Like you said...anger issues. You've also acquired a new nickname, which is 'newbie'. You don't know what a newbie is, but it does give you a sense that you are beginning to bond with your new buddies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's your power, newbie?\" Brad said. You got a little shiver down your spine, since you didn't know how to put it more complex than the situation is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my power is that I have a secret weapon concealed in my brain...or body, or whatever. I can be able to summon her at will, but she can also come out on her own, if she wants to.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is this, 'secret weapon'?\" Lee asked.Again, a small shiver. You thought you were able to leave it at that, but you didn't want to leave a mysterious impression on yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...uh...it's a snake...a big one...with woman like features--\" You stopped to notice that Brad,Garrett, and Roy just busted out laughing. You thought they would have gotten hard-on's due to their personality, but you guess you can't judge a book by its cover. Lee and Mr.Lionel seemed eager to hear more, but you had your attention on the other guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you guys think it's so funny, then why don't you guys show me your powers!\" You yelled in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't,\"Roy said, trying to hold his laughs in.\"Mr.King-Of-The-Ring here has some sort of jamming device that stops all of our powers from working for about a 8 mile radius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's why Lyra can't come out and attempt to crush and smother everyone with her ass and boobs, or possibly use her non-venomous fangs to puncture a vital organ. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we're sitting ducks around this guy.\"Brad added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or should we say...brain dead snakes?\"Garrett added, causing another burst of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Darn it...you've been marked as a clown...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\nAfter that one little lunch, Cecile has guided you to your apartment room. Strange, you always thought that super heroes get to have their own decked out lair. You know, jet cars, jet packs, jet boots, jet--...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Guess, you can't have it all.</i> During the trip, you did have trouble carrying the promised treats for Lyra, so Cecile have you an average sized lime-green backpack to help you. Surprisingly enough, it was able to carry everything with ease.Also surprising, the whole day just turned into night just like in the real world, even though you know the lights are flourescent and are being controlled by somebody. Cecile has explained that they use the outside world's weather patterns, day and night times, and even the summer and winter 1 hour time changes, to keep the super beings from getting tired of seeing the same old time everyday. Plus, it helps everyone fall asleep to their natural biological clocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking inside your apartment room, you can see that it has the basics, four grey walls, a bed on the left wall, with a small desk and lamp, and a TV on the right, with a large window on the wall opposite of the door. When your took your first step inside, you and Cecile were instantly shoved aside by Lyra, who quickly jumped onto the bed, ruining the perfectly good sheets. She nearly takes up the whole bed with her large body, and her tail, which was slightly curving into her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she alright?\" Cecile whispered to you, possibly to not make her more upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll be fine, I'll handle her.\" You assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. You'll be meeting the girls tomorrow, and make sure she's happy. We don't want her going ballistic on the girls tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...what!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Lionel is the only one with a working jammer at the moment, and he has to go to quick meeting tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Cecile took her leave, which left you and and Lyra alone together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was laying down, facing you, with her head rested on the pillow. She didn't say anything, you didn't say anything, you simply tossed her your bag, and she started to cram some of the fast food into her mouth...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"<b>*VAKE UP, DAMN YOU!*</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly jumped out of bed, out of fear that you were being attacked by an unknown entity...or at least being the victim of a prank. After a loud thump on the ground, you sat on your butt and quickly scanned the room. Nothing out of the ordinary...looks like someone got impatient with your sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Ugh...finally! Do you know how long I have been vating for you to get up!?*\" Lyra asked, obviously annoyed at the constant late awakenings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Lyra, you scared me! I thought something life threatening was happening.*\" You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just replied with a slight scoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just rolled your eyes. For some reason, she can't leave your head when you are asleep, and she doesn't sleep at all, so she is left with several hours of free time and she uses it to play with herself, such as role playing as a monster in some epic battle. You know this, because she has dragged you into these adventures. She has her own little world in your head, which is pretty neat seeing as she can alter reality inside your head, including changing you into a size of a mouse. But again,changes in your head are only imaginary, so the effects can wear off as soon as you enter back into reality, but it feels so real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were changing clothes you asked, \"*So what's the occasion?*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Vat do you mean 'Vat's Ze occasion? You vere too slow waking up, as always!*\" Like said before, Lyra doesn't need sleep as she is some sort of mystic being. Getting woken up by her is not unlike her, but it does get annoying. You've already explained why a person needs to sleep at least 7-8 hours, but she either forgot or just ignored what you told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just simply rolled your eyes again, as you slipped on your backpack, and headed out the door. As you did, you did hear hear some rustling coming from your backpack, and you quickly unzipped it, seeing that there were a few still wrapped cheeseburgers in your backpack. Funny, Lyra always finishes what she started...even in the case of throwing up what she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Aw...Big bad snake couldn't handle the food.\" You mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Pfft...I vouldn't vipe my butt vith zis crap. It actually makes me crave your mom's cooking.*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small laugh, images of your mother's 'Beef stew supreme' were appearing your brain. Honestly, she wasn't that great, but she was fairly decent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Plus, it's making my stomach upset.<i><b>URRRRPPP...</b></i>You didn't hear zat!*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time has passed, you have introduced yourself to the girls at the same fast food restaurant, and simliar to the boys they laughed at your remark of your friend Lyra.Except Olivia...she didn't seem to take interest in you at all.Ginny seems to be the only one who believes you are telling the truth,due to her look on her face, which is a good sign that there is some sanity in this place. Lyra refused to come out, because her stomach was still upset from the food. You wonder what was in it that made her sick, you had at least 3 by now and you feel fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnywho, Lyra seems okay with the girls, despite the fact that they are a force to be reckoned with. Immortality, cloning, gender switching, and even able to steal someone's power, all of which are scary...to you of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was picking at your skin and clothes, thinking she can bring out Lyra by doing so. It's been going on for at least 3 minutes, and she's starting to get annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...when can we meet 'Lyra'?\" She asked, pulling on your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slap to her hand, you said \"It's not really easy, she comes out when she feels like it.I can summon her, but she's not really well right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange how a possible immortal being got stuck to be with you.\" June said. You couldn't tell if she was questioning it, or just insulting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's a problem with me around,\" Felicia stated.\"In fact, I think I can drag her out now, if you give me your hand.\" She reached out a hand towards you, which you shook yours to tell her no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*You better not freaking touch her!Ever!*\" Lyra screamed in your head. It made you cringe when she did, you didn't expect her to do that.Also, your smart enough to know that you will lose her when you do.However, it seems more like a relief rather than a curse to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later, copy cat.\" You say, purposely trying to piss off Lyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I get to see her, when she comes out?\"Ginny asked. For some reason, it sounds like her voice can be easily broken with a slight gust of wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, if she's alright with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna see her too! She sounds like an interesting subject to test on.\" Sam added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Yeah...no. I'm not going out zere vith zem.*\" Lyra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an eyebrow you thought, \"You do know I can call you out here at any time, right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's true. You've been letting Lyra enter and exit your brain as she pleased for years, because you were a naturally nice person. You can block her from entering and exiting your head, and that has come in handy at some points in time. You can't do it while your asleep, so you probably have to sleep with an eye open for her...like a snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*You vouldn't...<i><b>URRP!</b></i> You vouldn't dare!*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She says it's cool,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You heard her growl at you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no apparent target you were talking to, you simple say, \"Just come over to my apartment later, and we could have some fun together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam clapped her hands together with joy, June nodded, Ginny blushed. Felicia seemed eager to steal her away from you, Olivia feel asleep at this point, and Maria won't stop picking at your skin with six hands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Please!\" You demanded.Maria, and her two clones continuously pinched and poked you. You sighed as a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short summoning, you were currently trying keep Lyra from cracking your skull open with her bare hands. Her scales were tickling you as she had you in a headlock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh...okay, just let me go!Hahahah!\" You pleaded, in between bursts of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not...until...I...get...back...inside!\" She said, trying to jam her fists into your skull. It's actually pretty easy to keep her out of her head, all you have to do is eat something opposite of what she would eat...in this case a banana. Next thing you know, she blocked out of you head for the next 3 hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly slip out of Lyra's headlock, and she faces you...hissing with her forked tongue at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh you done it now boy...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could react to her next move, she already talked you to the floor and has gotten you into a full body mount, with her tail wrapped around both your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vy do you torture me so much!?\" She said, grabbing your head with both of her hands and staring into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could do anything else, the door opened behind Lyra. She instantly tried to cover her butt with her hands. You couldn't see anything, just Lyra's womanly parts, which seemed larger from where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry! Did I come in at a bad time?\" It sounds like Ginny was at the door. You took this time to push Lyra off of you and stand firm and straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're not. You're just on ti--\" Lyra had taken advantage of your focus, and swiped your legs with her tail, causing you to fall flat on your bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a mean glare to Lyra and she returned the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay,\" Ginny asked.\"That was a pretty mean fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. Please, have a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny did as told and took a seat in front of you.She looks so graceful and cute...the way she is sitting. Lyra took a seat behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for having me over. Lyra looks a lot like you said.She is a little...big isn't she?\" Ginny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...guess I forgot to mention that. Anyways,putty, you can change the size of anything, right?\" She blushes as you said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct. Do you want me to change something about me?\" She's flushing her eyelashes at you. Is there something in her eyes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not about me, about her.\" You corrected. Lyra growled behind your back, showing signs that she doesn't want to be here. You really wanted to see Ginny's special power, as it sounds that a lot of fun can come out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless somebody doesn't want to have fun tonight.\" You pulled a banana out of your backpack, and threatened to eat it in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra, with a dissatisfied sigh, crawled her way in between you and and Ginny. She sat crossed legs and was sitting erect, her high height towering both you and Ginny. You decided to move to the side, you wanted to see what she could do. Ginny looks questionably at Lyra, inspecting her limbs and body structure. You're pretty sure she looked into Lyra's scaly cleavage, probably thinking that it is an infinite hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...a bit...different, but I can work with this,\" Ginny cracked her knuckles in preparation.\"So, what do you like me to change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra looks questionably at you...and mix of question and anger, and upon seeing her face you responded, \"I would like for you...to...\"</span></div></div>",

Here you are, the rising star of your high school football teams offensive line and future hall of famer (in your own mind at least), and now these government stooges are here trying to drag you off to who knows where for who knows what nefarious purpose just because you happen to have super powers, specifically the ability to grow or shrink any creature or object or parts thereof, and/or increasing or decreasing it's mass and density virtually at will so long as you can see it and it's within fifty yards or so. The only catch being that the total mass of objects around you has to remain constant, meaning that if you shrink one thing, something else has to grow, or if you make one object more dense, some other object in your vicinity looses mass as a result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me get this straight. You're here from the government, wanting to make me part of some secret super powered hit squad, and you think I'm just going to go with you willingly?! Boy did you bozo's pick the wrong guy!\" you replied in response to the information the man in black had just given you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Alvarez, please be reasonable, your country needs you. It's a well documented fact that the other major world powers are developing their own super soldier programs, and we need the aid of individuals like you to help counter the threat.\" The agent explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry bud, but I've learned in no uncertain terms that you never trust the government. This so called task force is probably just a way to keep people like me in line and out of sight so nobody realizes super powers are real. Besides, I have a life of my own to deal with, one that I happen to like, and if you think I'm going to cooperate and let you drag me off to whatever deep dark hole you're wanting to stick me in you've got another thing coming!\" you replied, attempting to shut the door in their faces, only to be stopped by the foot of one of the agents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, the agent says \"I didn't want to do it like this kid, but you're coming with us whether you like it or not!\" The agent makes a grab for you, which you narrowly evade, dashing back inside the apartment you share with your grandfather, your parents having perished during a plane crash several years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot intending to go down without a fight, you begin drawing mass to you, increasing your size, as well as your density, and consequently your resistance to unarmed strikes and bullets. Quickly you swell past seven feet, eight feet, nine feet, ten, your head brushing the ceiling even as the floor creaks beneath your weight, as you must be well over two tons by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, the agents freeze for a moment as they weigh their options. Not wanting to give them the time needed to come up with a plan, you attack, your huge heavy fist slamming hard against... the wall, brink and plaster crumbling beneath your blow as the agent you'd been aiming at dodges nimbly aside. Howling in pain and clutching at your injured hand you turn and begin searching for your target, only to feel indescribable agony as the other agent shoves a taser into your back and pulls the trigger, sending several thousand volts shooting through your body. Any normal person likely would have dropped at this point, but your increased size and mass provides you with some measure of protection, allowing you to withstand the electrical assault, though you drop anyway, hurling yourself backwards in an attempt to crush your attacker. Having expected something similar however, the agent is already in motion, and is out from beneath you and out of striking range before you can fully recover. Of course, that's not enough to save him, as you activate your powers once more, focusing on the agent this time, causing him to shrink, the extra mass transferring back into the doll sized furniture you'd drawn your size and mass from earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can shrink him more than a foot or so however, you feel something small impact with your chest, followed by a loud bang as white smoke starts to fill your vision, causing you to loose sight of your target. Deciding that this smoke screen is just what you need to make your escape, you attempt to regain your feet, only to stumble, as sudden wave of dizziness washing over you. You try to shake it off, but it's no good, there's something in the smoke that's screwing with your balance and making you tired. Even in your current state, it doesn't take you look to come to the correct conclusion, you've been drugged! Unfortunately, there's nothing you can do about it at this point, and before you can get more than a few steps, your eye lids close and consciousness leaves you, your body slamming to the floor with a thunderous crash that shakes the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gas begins to dissipate, agents number one looks at his partner, both their faces mostly hidden behind gas masks and says \"I tell you number two, I'm getting too old for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it number one, I would have ended up as an inch high private eye if you hadn't had that gas grenade on you!\" number two replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, but even so, it was a close one. I think when we get back I'll put in a transfer to something safer, like bomb disposal!\" Agent one says with a laugh. \"Now lets get a clean up crew in here, and tell them to bring a crane, I don't know if we'll be able to move this big lug otherwise.\" he says, gesturing towards your comatose form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two agents make the necessary arrangements, and before long your on a sub en route to the secret government base known simply as Facility 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week latter, after extensive testing by the facilities  medical personnel, you're finally allowed to awaken, the first sight to greet you being________________?</span></div></div>",

You have a thick Irish accent as you only moved to the States last year. You're fairly flat chested and borderline anorexic. From a young age you've been exceptionally good at reading people, always seeming to know what they wanted and what there motives were even before they said it.  Most just attributed it to you being an exceptionally sharp kid, but when you were thirteen you learned the true reason.  Without meaning to you suddenly delved into someones thoughts in the middle of your party, the experience temporarily driving you mad.  Over time though you learned to control your power, reading people like a book.  It wasn't until you were fifteen though that you learned the full extent of your abilities, and how you could implant thoughts just as well as you could extract them.  Your father, a drunkard, was in the middle of an intoxicated rage and was in the midst of assaulting your mother when you accidentally implanted a simple two word thought into his head, his alcohol addled mind making him even more susceptible to your inception.  \"Kill yourself.\" <br>\r\nTraumatized, you fled to the US, using your powers to blow threw security and secure herself citizenship in record time.  This of course attracted the attention of the government, who quickly deciphered your abilities and captured you just like the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince your arrival you've attempted to escape 3 times, the first of which was shortly after you arrived, but every time Mr. Lionel stops you, he one of the only people on site, other than Dr. Cecile that is able to resist your implants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing considered too dangerous you've spent the better half of your time in the facility in isolation and you have yet to meet another super human as they fear you could make them act out worse than what they usually do.

But no, instead she insists on the same slow, slow, methodical and inefficient methods she and the other base researchers have been using ever since the project began! Sure your own methods contained some small element of risk, but then, no truly great advancement in human history has ever been made without being prepared to make sacrifices and take a risk or two. How dare they question your calculations, your judgement, your insight? You were the genius, not them! That was the whole point of the government recruiting you for this project in the first place! They should be taking orders from you, not the other way around! Instead, you were forced to bow to the senile old cows authority. in public that is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivately however, your work continues, though slowly, due primarily to the need for absolute secrecy, a difficult thing to come by in a high security government installation, even for a mind of your caliber, as well as the difficulty involved in acquiring DNA samples from the various supers for testing. Despite these difficulties however, the serum is now complete and ready for testing. When it works, and you know it will, your vast intellect can allow for no other possibility, you'll be able to exult in the adulation and the envy of your peers in the scientific community, not to mention live large off of the fat government contracts sure to come your way after such a stunning success. Who knows, you may even get a Nobel prize out of the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's only one final step left to take. All you need do is inject yourself with the serum, and wait for the effects to manifest themselves, and all your dreams will become a reality. Plus, you'll have super powers, the combined sum of all the test subjects abilities all at your fingertips, transforming you into easily one of the most powerful individuals on the planet! That is,<b>if</b> your theory's and calculations are correct you remind yourself, and for the briefest of moments you hesitate, allowing the tiniest shreds of doubt to creep into your psyche as you wonder if the old bats approach may have some small amount of merit, that perhaps more testing should be done before initiating human trials, particularly with you yourself as your sole test subject. Quickly you discount such thoughts however, your usual incredible self confidence, some might even refer to it as arrogance, in your own abilities reasserting itself, and without another thought you jab yourself with the injection device and press the plunger home, forcing the glowing crimson liquid into your blood stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a few moments you begin to notice the effects, your skin tingling as a general felling of what you can only describe as looseness spreads throughout your body. It won't be long now you suspect, idly wondering what it will be like to exercise your new powers, what it will feel like to change shape for the very first time, to travel from one corner of the earth to another in the bling of an eye, to invade the body and mind of another and bend them to your will. You soon discover that something's not right however. You've begun to feel dizzy, faint, your blood pressure rising rapidly as your heart rate nearly doubles. Then, the seizures start, your body thrashing around violently out of control, smashing beakers and test tubes filled with chemical compounds, many of them dangerous, their contents spilling onto you and mixing even as the shattered glass slices into your forearms. Thrashing wildly, damaging and knocking over lab equipment, you fall to the floor in a twitching pile, continuing to spasm while foaming at the mouth. Your vision becomes cloudy as your eyes glaze over, and then.... nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Squinting against the light you slowly open your eyes and attempt to look around, but for some reason, you can't! Did you manage to injure yourself during your seizure, resulting in paralysis, or was your inability to move caused by something else? Horrified at the very idea of being unable to move for the rest of your life, you desperately hope that it's something else. Restraints of drugs perhaps. Desiring to find out your condition as quickly as possible, you carefully begin taking stock of yourself, immediately noticing several things. The first is that you're definitely not paralyzed, as you can still feel your body, even move parts of it it feels like, but for some reason it doesn't seem to do you any good! That's more than a little puzzling, as the second thing you realize is that you don't feel any sort of restraints. You do feel cold however, the cold air of the infirmary blowing unimpeded over your bare skin, as well as more than a little odd, as though your body weren't quite the same as the one you remembered. Nor can you come up with any sort of explanation for the truly odd sensation of having a breeze blow across what you're certain should be the <i>inside</i> of your body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing footsteps heading your direction, you decide to put aside your self examination for the moment and concentrate of gaining answers from the medical staff instead. Licking your dry lips, you call out \"Hello? I-\" Only to freeze in shock. The voice coming out of your mouth isn't yours! Your own voice was always a bit high and sort of whiney. Your new voice however, while still clearly that of a woman, is deeper, throatier, more sensual, loaded with lust and sexual promise, a bedroom voice, a lovers voice, the kind of voice that could cause any man to gain an erection just from the sound of it, and cause female porn stars to turn green with envy. It's more than a little strange, and kind of disturbing, but it's just one of many bits of unexplained weirdness you've discovered in the few minutes since you've woken up, so you resolve to ignore it for the moment, focusing on getting some answers instead. Once again, you call out \"Hello? Whoever's there, could you please help me out and tell me what's happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That question young lady, has a very interesting and alarming explanation, one I'm not entirely sure you're ready to hear. Not until I run a few more tests at least.\" The familiar voice of Dr. Oakman, the chief medical officer for the facility says as he steps into view, revealing his stocky six foot frame, with it's aged weather tanned countenance, dark eyes, short grey hair, busy eyebrows and equally bushy mustache. You pay little attention to his appearance however, being well used to it. Instead, not intending to be deterred so easily, you plead with him, using your new sexy voice to best advantage in the hopes of persuading him to reveal the knowledge you so desperately crave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please doc, I have to know what's wrong, the suspense is killing me!\" As you do so, you notice the doctor visibly flush, and you aren't sure, but you think you might have seen his eyes glaze over for just a moment, his fingers twitching as he takes a half step towards you before catching himself. Shaking his head as though to clear it of some sort of unwanted influence, Dr. Oakman replies \"Yes well, after the sort of stupid stunt you pulled Ms. O'Hare, being left in suspense is the least of what you deserve. However, as my patient, I suppose you have a right to know your own condition, particularly since I've yet to find a firm medical reason to withhold it from you. Be aware though that the explanation you've requested is not a simple one, and will almost certainly raise more questions than answers. However, before I begin, tell me, just how much can you remember of the events leading up to your unfortunate... em, <i>accident?\"</i> The doctor inquires with just the slightest hint of sarcasm, your flush of shame and embarrassment over your apparent failure telling him everything he needs to know. \"Ah, so you do remember. Good, that will make things easier.\" Dr. Oakman continues. \"It seems that the serum you injected yourself with during your ill advised and unauthorized experiment was not entirely stable, or safe. It caused your body to go into convulsions which most likely would have resulted in your death had it not been for the addition of the other random compounded entering your bloodstream after being spilled onto your self inflicted injuries. Somehow, we believe that the random compound created acted as a stabilizing agent and mutagen, allowing you to survive, though given your condition when we first found you we believed you to be dead at first, for reasons that will become apparent shortly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me!\" you ordered impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising one hand with the palm open and facing toward you, doctor Oakman replies \"Patience, I'm getting to it. As I said, in addition to quite possibly saving your life, the chemicals, combined with your own unstable serum acted as a mutagen, causing your body to transform in ways that quite frankly, before beginning work on the super project I never would have believed possible. Ways that... Well, perhaps it's better if I simply show you, you'd never believe me otherwise.\" reaching over to the side and coming up with a hand mirror which he uses to show you your reflection. What you saw was... Well, it certainly wasn't what you were expecting. Instead of your normal face, looking back at you was a perfected version of it. Easily super model material, your new face is flawless, with slightly tanned skin with just the slightest hint of blush, delicate bone structure, small slightly upturned nose, full pouty red lips, long dark eyelashes half concealing sparkling green eyes, all of it framed by, not your normal messy curls, but instead a long shimmering mass of perfectly permed locks, as though the girl the face belongs to had just stepped out of a top beauty salon. The problem is, that's all that you can see. It's just your head, there's nothing attached to it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- What the fuck?! T-this can't be! I-I'm just a head!\" you exclaimed, unable to believe what you're seeing. No, that's not entirely accurate. You can believe it, you just don't want to! This is horrible, far worse than your worst case scenarios! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll, you're half right. Let me show you the rest.\" Dr. Oakman said, before reaching down, gathering up a bundle of your hair and lifting you up, revealing a body spread out below you. It's your body you quickly realize, or at least parts of it, as literally every joint has been separated from every other, as well as a few places that don't even have joints. Both arms are separated from your body, being further divided at the elbow and wrist, with your fingers separated from your hands, and divided into their own individual components. Your legs are in similar shape, being separated at the hips, knee, ankle, and with the toes removed and separated into their individual components. That part you understood, as a person can live without arms or legs. Your head, neck and torso however... that was something else, and shouldn't technically be possible, but it was true nonetheless, your head having been separated from your neck, with your neck similarly separated from your torso, with your chest separated from your stomach, stomach from waist, and each breast removed and placed beside your torso. In fact, unbelievably, even your womanhood appears to have been removed from your crotch, looking like a sticker as it rests on the bed just below your hips. You use the word separated rather than severed to describe your detached body parts because they clearly aren't. Severed that is, with each individual part having the detached surfaces covered with a layer of smooth, unmarked skin and tissue that appears little different than that covering the rest of your body. It's an unbelievable sight to be sure, your body having transformed in a manner similar to that of your voice and face, every part of you now tanned and toned, with basketball sized breasts, wide hips, full sexy ass, and a ridiculously narrow waist. All in all, you look more like some sort of fantasy sex bomb made flesh than a living breathing woman. Despite how sexy your body has become however, the fact that it's in pieces would terrify most people. You however aren't most people. Calmly you inquire \"Can they be reattached?\" After all,  Clay can reattach their severed bits and Roy's portals leave the separated parts completely unharmed, and you'd used some of both their DNA in your serum, so who's to say that you couldn't as well? The fact that you were still alive even though you were in pieces making such an idea seem all the more likely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing in embarrassment, Dr. Oakman replies \"Uh, reattached? We, ah, we haven't actually tried yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as I would have expected from an idiot like you!\" you thought, just barely managing to resist the urge to say it out loud. You did have some sense of self preservation after all. You were in no position to antagonize the good doctor right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hurry up and try it then! I certainly don't want to be stuck like this for the rest of my life!\" you say instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Dr. Oakman replies.</span></div></div>",

It was the power become the average out of all people in a 200m radius. This included everything from gender, hair length and color, skin complexion, eye color, build, age, intelligence, strength and skills. Why would they put someone like you in Facility 2? Well if you were in a room with highly skilled hackers, you'd become one. Put you in a room with special forces you'd excel at that too. In fact if they put you anywhere with people with specialized training that's what you became. You were too dangerous for the outside world and extremely useful in here, in fact you were so useful you were one of the only super humans allowed out in the field. You hated your powers though, as it made you lose who you once were, you couldn't even remember yourself anymore and your power never deactivated. In fact you kept all changes while you were isolated until someone else came along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still remember your first day you discovered the power, you were on a field trip with your high school when they activated. Unfortunately for you the majority of the people on the bus happened to be girls, so imagine yours and everyone else's surprise when you turned into a Caucasian, girl with short brown hair and brown eyes, with a medium build. It wasn't very pleasant. What was worse was when you got off the bus and a seniors tour passed by, making you become a middle aged woman. That was also the day you were reported and sent off to Facility 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince being here you've made 2 friends, Sam and Lee. Sam because she's willing to change the genders of either herself or other allowing you to be a male once more and Lee because he doesn't mind you having his likeness, so you often visit him privately so you can become him. You've also made an enemy in Maria as her clones count towards the average so you often find yourself becoming her, something neither of you like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday started out like any other as you....</span></div></div>",

Amber Blaine( Codename: Balloon) is here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The local \"Queen Bee\" at her school, and then her college, Amber would probably be just another popular girl in the crowd. That was until her powers activated at a local nightclub. Causing the agency to notice her  and decide on acquiring their newest asset.Which was difficult, seeing as she was the size of the building and was getting ever so slowly bigger. Thankfully the agency, somehow, shrunk her back down and contained her. Now she is being transported to the Facility to be housed, a new weapon for the government. And a particularly annoying nuisance for the guards,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Powers: Amber can inflate herself, or a part of herself, with air. No known size limit has been reached, but her largest seen so far was that of an average nightclub.While inflated, Amber is both incredibly flexible and completely invulnerable, tanking even artillery shells with ease. Combined with her flight ability and her protection against most environments, Amber is a tough opponent.  Only a few things stop her from being extremely dangerous to others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0First is her inexperience controlling herself, she has only recently received her powers.Many accidents have already happened just on the travel alone. No control over her own ability makes it difficult for her to even be considered a threat. Second, she isn't used to fighting, nor any form of direct combat. Any guard in the facility could easily beat her in a square fight. Third, her powers don't lend itself to offensive tactics. You can't do much as a big balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Personality:<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amber is an stereotypical \"Alpha Female\" of a school. Snotty, whiny, and plain vapid, Amber didn't suspect she would be a super. If she did, she sure as hell wouldn't want her powers. Blowing up into a balloon, uncontrollably mind you, isn't appealing to everyone. Especially when one is an \"amazingly beautiful\" girl, like Amber. Amber is also riding on the dream that her family could get her out. Which they do care, but they can't seem to find her and are worried senseless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Appearance: Stock Blonde girl.

And if you didn't survive well... best not think about that.<br>\r\nYour previous job was pretty soul crushing office work in a tiny cubicle in the department of some trivial public service so obscure that you yourself couldn't even say what it was that you did for the government, so you suppose that this was a step up from that.  Or maybe a lateral step.  When offered a position in a quote \"Top secret facility, dealing with the security of the nation\" you thought the heavens themselves had split to give you the opportunity of your meager little lifetime, you had to accept!

As you were daydreaming in the facilities library, a place that only you entered with any regularity, someone had snuck up on you and smacked you in the back of the head, causing you to face plant into the magazine that you had been glancing through.  With a weary sigh you turn around and see (le gasp!) Maria.  Or more likely one of Maria's many clones that run around the base stirring up trouble like gremlins.  Maria was now just standing behind you with a sickeningly sweet grin with her hands clasped behind her back, not even attempting to hide her completely naked chest and exposed privates just as all of the Maria's never attempted to.  \"Ugh, what do you want?\"  You say with exasperation, praying to every deity you could name that she was just going to pester you momentarily and leave.<br>\r\n\"Me?\"  The Maria asked with grating innocence while bringing a hand defensively to her chest as though insulted by your insinuation.  \"I don't want anything from you!  My sister on the other hand...\"  she trailed off.<br>\r\nYour eyes widened as you looked down and caught sight of another Maria crouched beside you, having just taken your radio off of your belt.  You tried to grab her but she was too quick, sprinting away with it while slapping her bare ass with her free hand tauntingly.  Now you wish you could just let her take it, let this whole thing end here, give up and just let the troll win now, but you knew that if you didn't get your radio back it would be coming out of your paycheck, so with a tired groan you go sprinting after the Maria.<br>\r\nWho are you?</span></div></div>",

You limp to a phone and call security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Doctor Carl Von Hellman,\" you say breathlessly. \"One of the specimens, Maria, has stolen my radio. I want it back!

The second is that the specimens are a nightmare to work with, always breaking out of containment, always introducing ugly variables to your pure science. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub the stub of your left arm.

Learning to extract, control or copy the ability - or at least devise some means of defense against it - are of paramount importance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe difficulty is in studying him. Unlike Clay or Ragdoll, a live vivisection is out of the question due to the problems of dying. For a long time you played with the idea of dissecting something else, a disposable animal that would get past the ethic's board, while Trickster's mind inhabited it. Such an experiment would tell you a great deal about the nature of the link joining the two minds. Alas, the moment the host body is anaesthetised or experiences pain Trickser pulls out, flitting back to his true body like an elastic band snapping back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one day you made a breakthrough. You discovered that the Trickster's mind control could not penetrate a Faraday cage. A simple electromagnetic field was enough to block his mind from entering in to another body. Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly, it also stopped him from escaping. The electromagnetic field held him prisoner, trapped in his host body. Finally you had a captive test subject!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wander to your laboratory and spend the rest of the day preparing for the experiment. Around lunchtime, he arrives, escorted by two guards.

It's a little exotic but I have every confidence in you. If you'll just direct your attention to the cage at the far end of the lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns to look. There stands a large metal cage large enough for a man to stand comfortably inside. Unknown to him, wired into the bars of the cage is a battery, though it is currently switched off.

Maybe it was just because you happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.  You suppose it no longer mattered, what mattered was getting your radio back.

Maria finished off her game by bringing your radio to her mouth and saying in her best impression of a gruff soldier \"Mission control: target neutralized.

She then strode off, cackling to herself as you were left helplessly dangling.<br>\r\nYou don't know how long it was before someone found you.  You had tried several times to bring yourself down but had no sharp objects to cut the rope, nor the dexterity to untie the knot.

It was then that you realized what was going on.  \"GET OUT OF MY HEAD!\"  You screamed internally, but you yourself could hardly hear your cries.  It was a faint echo at best, and you've never seen anyone break from Brad's control through will power.  You simple watch in horror as Brad walks your body back out into the main hallway and into the staff bar.

Now normally I wouldn't bat an eye at another one of the dregs sitting by there lonesome, but you... well, you aren't any old dreg, now are you?  Miss...\" Brad trailed off, seating himself without ever having the woman give her consent, asserting an air of confidence that was visibly off putting to the woman.<br>\r\n\"Harper.  Ms. Harper.\"  She replied curtly, taking a sip of her nondescript martini while averting her gaze.  She wasn't having any of Brad's shtick.<br>\r\n\"Harper, pretty name.  Do you have another one?\"  Brad asked jokingly before ordering himself a copy of Ms. Harper's drink.<br>\r\n\"Not one that concerns you, no.  That's classified.\"  She replied mysteriously.<br>\r\nBrad laughed in response, studying her for the most uncomfortable minute of your life before slyly retorting.  \"Classified, huh?  Let me guess...  DARPA?  Bio enhancement specialist?  Here to see if you can develop usable cybernetics and upgrade the freaks with bionic enhancements to improve there performance?\"<br>\r\nMs. Harper nearly spat out her drink, only keeping it in with the tips of her fingers.  She swallowed hard and drew breath before incredulously asking \"How... how did you get that?\"  Brad had been right.<br>\r\n\"Well the lab coat tells me your a scientist of some kind, that much is obvious.  Your name and demeanor had me leaning CIA but the fact that you didn't attempt to smash my nose in when I bothered you lead me to think that you weren't trained in combat, or at least not extensively so, so I defaulted DARPA.  As for the bio enhancement specialist well...\" Brad trailed off, lifting one of Ms. Harper's hands up much to her confusion.  He rubbed the back of the hand, and you felt what he felt.  Scars, callouses, and burns.  \"These aren't the sort of hands you get while sitting behind a glass screen with a pencil taking notes.  These are the hands of a working woman, and since we don't do explosives testings down here cybernetics was my next best guess.  Plus, weapon testers don't generally keep themselves up like you do.\"  He finished, kissing the back of her hand.  It tasted rather nice, as though she had just recently bathed.  Christ, you knew Brad was the first person to be brought into the program and had done a lot of time people watching, but this was just insane!  He really has one hell of a detective sense to him.<br>\r\nThis had all shaken Ms. Harper to the core, someone reading her like that.  She suddenly grew rather self conscious, as though Brad could hear her every thought (which he couldn't, at least no test has shown him to be able to).  \"My hands... you noticed them quickly.  Do you not like them?\"  She asked defensively.<br>\r\nBrad laughed at the question, playing her like a flute.  \"What would ever give you that impression?  I love them!  I like it when a woman is willing to get down and dirty.  It makes her so much more lively, you know?\"<br>\r\nMs. Harper tried and failed to hide a smile, taking another sip of her drink before asking \"You know I don't ever remember catching your name.  Mind telling me what it is?\"<br>\r\n\"That's classified.\"  Brad joked.  Ms. Harper laughed, knowing that an orderly wouldn't need any sort of formality like that.  When prompted again Brad told her \"Larry, my name is Larry.\"  Son of bitch he gave you his stupid nickname!  You were Dan, Dan damn it!<br>\r\n\"Oh stop it with the jokes, I'm serious!\"  Ms. Harper told him, aware of Brad's nomenclature.<br>\r\n\"I am too.  I'm Larry, convenient right?\"  He said, his poker face winning her over.  She laughed but accepted the name as yours.  Brad and his new buddy talked for the next half an hour, discussing everything from their expectations and experiences so far in facility 2 to soccer.  After both had had enough drinks for you to start feeling tipsy Brad says \"Listen, my second shift is about to start, would you mind picking this up later?  Perhaps at eight, at the employee theater?\"<br>\r\nMs. Harper nodded \"Alright, sounds like a plan!  Don't get killed before our date Larry!\"  She teased, punching you on the arm a little too hard for your own comfort.  Brad agreed and walked your body back to the hall where he had found you, his own body still in the exact position he had left it.  For a moment he stood there, then sud-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled to stand as you suddenly regained control of your body, the bizarre feeling of not being in control of your actions leaving you.  You turned to Brad, who was smiling rather smugly.  \"WHAT.  THE HELL.  WAS THAT?!\"  You demand, unable to comprehend what had just transpired.<br>\r\n\"I set you up with a fine date with a nice young lady.  Why, would you've preferred a man?  I would've guessed by the way that you were chasing Maria's sweet little ass down that you were into the cute gals.\"  He mocked, looking at his fingernails in a show of disinterest.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got that much.  What I meant was why would you do that?\"  You clarified.  He had every opportunity to screw you over, yet he didn't.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I can be a generous god when I feel like it.  I just don't normally feel like it.\"  He casually rebutted.<br>\r\n\"Okay.  Thanks, I guess.  So what happens at the date?\"  You ask.<br>\r\nBrad laughs and responds...</span></div></div>",

You swore that if you didn't know it any better they were the telepaths of Facility 2 and not Brad, as they seemed to have an entire conversation without uttering a syllable, simply twitching various parts of their faces occasionally and gazing at each other.  Dr Cecile broke the silence as she turned to you.  \"We'll consider your proposal.  I admit, Washington has been riding my ass over our budget and it might do us some good to get more than test data out of our subjects.  You can tell your boss he'll hear from us shortly.  Mr Lionel will escort you out of the premises and back to your boat.\"<br>\r\nDr Cecile rose and turned towards the door on the opposite end of the room curtly, not even giving you a handshake goodbye as she briskly strode out of the room, leaving you alone with the chief of security.  \"Alright, follow me.\"  He instructed, standing up and stepping past you.  You did as you were instructed, securing the briefcase back onto your wrist as you did so.  You weren't particularly surprised that they hadn't accepted the offer immediately.  You'd been told that your company wasn't the first to approach them and that Cecile was very protective of what she considered her children, not wanting any harm to come of them despite their continued delinquency.  What surprised you more was her showing interest.  While you knew she'd at least considered the idea before the way she straight up told you that she'd consider it rather than feigning disinterest to play hardball showed that either she was more desperate than you thought or that she was more polite than you'd bee informed.  Either way there was no use in calling her back in here and pressing her to action, the notoriously firm woman had dismissed you so the most you could do now is play the waiting game.<br>\r\nYou had been so wrapped up in thoughts of business that it took you far to realize something was wrong.  \"Hey, this isn't the same path I came here from.\"  You state, looking around the unfamiliar halls.  A loud thud echoes along the metal walls.  Looking down you see that the suitcase you'd been handcuffed to had just slipped from your grip and had hit the floor, the cuff's chain having been cut cleanly through the midpoint and Mr Lionel holding an intensely fine blade.  You didn't even notice when he'd started cutting.  Before you could react a flurry of blows sends you sprawling to the floor, your eyes staring straight up at the blank expression of the chief of security as your eyelids fluttered shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you noticed upon awakening was that you weren't handcuffed.  You weren't tied up or secured to anything, though you suppose that that made sense.  You were a mile below the a secluded island in hands down the most impervious and secured bunker ever built that also just so happened to be filled with armed guards and super humans, escape was clearly not an option.  The second thing you noticed was Mr Lionel, now dressed in much more casual attire than before.  Rather than sporting his dress uniform the man was now humbly garbed in a t-shirt and jeans, though you weren't sure whether that was supposed to comfort or intimidate you.  Perhaps both.  You knew what was going on.  They'd kidnapped you, and were about to interrogate you, though what they intended to gain from it you didn't know.  Not allowing your captor to get the first word in you say \"Do you think you scare me?  Do you think your little theatrics back their intimidate me?  Well let me tell you, when my boss figures out something has happened to me he'll have his entire legal team on your ass.  You can't just hold a law abiding citizen hostage, it's unconstitutional!\"<br>\r\nHe didn't speak at first, simply observing you as he considered your words.  \"Do you know how long you've been out?\"  He asked.  This caught you off guard.  \"It's been three days.  We've had enough time to check your DNA, run your files, and figure out the last forty places you had dinner 'Mr Smith'.  If your boss was gonna do something I'm pretty sure he would've raised his hand by now.  He hasn't, though.  And something tells me he's not going to raise a fuss over his missing lapdog, because if he tries to bring the law down on us we can swing it right back around and try him and his whole board of executives with treason, breaching of government security, and espionage.  The files you brought with you show that you've got an informant in the base, a mole who's actively compromising the security of a government institute.  So you can either tell me right now everything you know and we can consider letting you off with a sizable fine, or you can spend the rest of your life rotting away in a prison that doesn't officially exist until you unofficially die.\"<br>\r\nYou didn't say anything.  You couldn't tell whether or not he was bluffing.  Surely it couldn't have been that long, you'd only been out for an hour or so... right?  Either way Mr Lionel took your silence as an answer.  \"You know, since you were so interested why don't I bring one of them in here, they can give you a little... demonstration.  Why don't we bring in...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">In 2018 the government of the United States of America has established what it refers to as the \"Emergency super human strike force\", a team of super powered humans designed to do battle with threats that are too large for conventional special forces units, too dangerous for standard military, or too volatile for official US governmental intervention.  Persons proven to have super human capabilities were rounded up and indoctrinated into the program, and given training and equipment designed to boost the effectiveness of their powers and their functionality as a unit.<br>\r\nThe year is now 2022, and the program has run into some... snags, in the sense that the program has yet to churn out even a single usable operative.  As it turns out, kidnapping people and forcing them into the military isn't exactly conducive to morale and obedience, so now the US has a stockpile of super humans who just sort of... hang out.  They refuse to be useful, are too powerful to defeat without massive casualties, and have had too much money sunk into them to just \"dispose of\", so now tax payer dollars are hard at work keeping these super powered schlubs alive, entertained, and securely held in an underground facility (simply known as \"facility 2\") on an otherwise uninhabited island in the middle of the Caribbean.<br>\r\n<u><b>CHARACTERS</b></u><br>\r\n<u>Dr.  Cecile:</u>  A woman in her early forties who is the current chief of research and training in facility 2.  The best in modern medice has kept her looking as youthful as she did when she was twenty, though a rather sedentary lifestyle leaves her out of shape.  She is five feet and four inches tall and has fair complexion.  She has a round bespectacled head topped with short black hair which always has a blue bow in it.  Cecile has a pear shaped body and wider hips, though her frame does draw attention to her rather impressively sized chest.  Cecile is a calm and level headed individual who is almost like a mother to the people under her supervision, though she is known to have a rage like none other when pushed too far, and has the tools and authority at her disposal to make whoever insights her wrath pay dearly.<br>\r\n<u>Mr.  Lionel:</u>  A man in his mid forties who runs security and safety in facility two.  Little is known about Lionel, and little needs to be known to figure out that he became head of security for good reason. Standing in at 6'2 and built like a tank Lionel knows a wide array of fighting styles and can absolutely devastate opponents both armed and barehanded.  More than one super human has tried to pick a fight with him only to end up face down on the floor in seconds.  Despite his hardened nature he is known to be light in character and has a wide sense of humor.<br>\r\n<u>Maria (codename: Mirror)</u>-  Just over five feet tall with a petite figure and long blond hair reaching down to the small of her back.  One of the first super humans to be brought into the program and one of the most troublesome, twenty two year old Maria causes as much mischief as she can get away with.  Maria has the power to clone herself, with each clone having a mind of its own.  Maria can clone herself as many times as she likes and is able to set a timer on each clone before it dissolves lasting from one minute to one week, but only the original can make clones.  It is unknown which Maria currently running about the facility IS the original as she likes to keep a dozen or so around at any given time.  Of special note is that Maria cannot clone her own clothing, so she and all of her copies tend to run around in their birthday suits.<br>\r\n<u>Garrett (codename: Shadow)</u>-  A fresh recruit just out of boyhood, the eighteen year old Garrett is often mistaken for a teen two years younger.  Only five feet and seven inches with a lean build, Garrett is nonetheless a very bold person with a big mouth and a short temper, making his power somewhat dubious.  Garret is able to turn himself and anything in direct contact with his skin invisible for as long as his concentration holds.  Garrett tends to stalk people around and get himself into trouble with his quick fuse, but is generally liked by his fellow freaks.  Generally.<br>\r\n<u>Olivia (codename: Queen)</u>-  Olivia, twenty six, is a woman of average height with far greater than average physique and beauty.  Long jet black hair, a face seemingly sculpted by gods, and a curvaceous body to die for hide a very powerful person not to be trifled with, both in spirit and in ability.  Olivia is able to generate and control a rubbery material known as \"tar\" that sticks to anything it touches and can be hardened like metal in the blink of an eye.  Tar is nearly unbreakable in its hardened state, and Queen uses it to restrain and constrict people at will using tar, releasing them only when she sees fit.  Olivia generally keeps to herself or with Brad, the only person she considers her equal.<br>\r\n<u>Brad (codename: Trickster)</u>-  Twenty five and having been in the program almost since day one, Brad is a cocky and somewhat cynical person.  Exactly six feet tall, rather boxy and muscular in build, and blessed with snow blonde hair and tanned skin Brad is considered quite attractive to the opposite sex and select members of the same sex.  Brad has the power to take over anyone's mind from distances of up to four hundred feet, and can control them for as long as he wishes.  This power does have its drawbacks though, as Brad cannot move his actual body while controlling someone else, and if his original body is subjected to increased stimuli or if he loses focus he will also lose control of whoever he was commanding.  Lastly while he may control a person he will not immediately adopt their mannerisms or speaking patterns, and may be given away by acting suspiciously, though he has had enough time to study the other inmates to impersonate them all near flawlessly.<br>\r\n<u>Ginny (codename: putty)</u>-  Seventeen and moderately new to the program Ginny has a preferred height of five feet and eight inches, and likes to be thin and dainty.  Ginny has an angular face complimented by straight hazel hair and soft blue eyes.  Ginny has the power to grow, stretch, shrink, and retract any part of or the entirety of her body, as well as any organic matter that she has skin to skin contact with.  Ginny is a meek and rather quiet girl, constantly being bossed around for both her freshness and her submissiveness.  She is known even to change her shape and proportions to satisfy her peers, though she reverts back to her desired dimensions whenever she is able.<br>\r\n<u>Roy (codename: hopper)</u>- Having been with the program for two years the nineteen year old Roy is still just as immature and childish as he was at seventeen when he first discovered his powers and was brought in.  While standing at an average five feet and ten inches and having no particularly prominent fat or muscles on his brown haired and completely average Caucasian body Roy is considered one of the more powerful of the subjects.  Roy is capable of opening and closing portals from an atom thick to the size of Manhattan anywhere that he can imagine, only able to be held in the base with an explosive hidden in his brain.  While his power has near limitless tactical and strategic possibilities Roy generally uses it to be a dick.  He enjoyed opening portals in other people adjacent to one another to split them into pieces harmlessly, only allowing the portals and by extension the parts to reconnect when he's bored.<br>\r\n<u>June (codename: ragdoll)</u>- A twenty year old woman with tanned skin and short cut dirty blond hair June has the build of a professional athlete and is naturally the tallest of the girls at an inch below six feet tall.  June is essentially immortal, and all tests to date have found no ways to cause her permanent damage.  This is due to her regenerative abilities, which allow her to body to repair any and all damage regardless of severity.  June is able to internally control her own healing rate, and can heal wounds in thirty seconds at its quickest and twelve hours at the longest.  This ability, in conjunction with June's inability to feel pain has made her a natural thrill seeker willing to perform even the stupidest or most dangerous of acts free of actual consequence.<br>\r\n<u>Lee (codename: clay)</u>- A little overweight and not particularly handsome in his natural form twenty one year old Lee can best be described as distant.  His body is composed entirely of a clay like substance that he can change the texture, density, shape, and consistency of at will, making him capable of morphing into anyone he can think of and many inanimate objects.  Lee tends to change his appearance daily, either into the appearance of someone else in the facility, celebrities, or unique people of his own choosing although he reverts back to his standard self if tired or completely asleep.  Lee likes to take on different roles and enjoys a good game.<br>\r\n<u>Sam (codename: switch)</u>- Androgynous and of technically no definable gender the teenager Sam was almost not taken in due to the... nature of her power.  Sam can change the gender of anyone at will, including his own which she does regularly (though it often goes unnoticed).  Sam can choose the severity of the change, ranging from a simple genital conversion to complete chemical and physical rewrites of someone's DNA and can even make in between modification or change someones gender to none.  Apart from providing modest distractions there isn't really much tactical value in her power, so Sam has been trained extensively in hand to hand combat to make up for his shortcomings in that field, able to effectively target nerves and pressure points to incapacitate targets.<br>\r\n<u>Felicia (codename: copy cat)</u>- This short, sleek, ebony woman is the youngest and newest of the recruits, only sixteen and having been put into the facility a mere two months ago.  Felicia is conniving and subtle, preferring mind games and power plays unlike Maria's more more zany pranks.  Felicia has the ability to take on the powers of whichever super human she last touched, and keeps their power for twenty four hours or until someone else is touched.  There are two primary catches to this.  First, while she has the power the original owner loses it (save for June, who remains immortal but can no longer regenrate).  Second, the more she uses the power she has taken the quicker it returns to the original owner, meaning that Felicia must be careful not to leave herself vulnerable.<br>\r\n<b>Newly added Characters:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Jake Monroe</u> - sporting jetblack hair, slightly shorter than average height, and with an average build Jake Monroe is the newest starry eyed inductee that has just been entered into the program.  Jake has the power to mentally generate a construct that physically manifests in the form of an anthropomorphic snake woman known as \"Lyra\".  Lyra possesses limbs like a human and a rather curvy figure but is clad in orange scales and is of sizeable height (6'6\") making her rather distinct from a true person.  Lyra has a somewhat defensive personality toward  her master though he does not have total control over her and she tends to act without his consent.<br>\r\n<u>Jason Alvarez</u>-  Eighteen years old and previously the star if his high school football team, the muscular and tanned Jason had some rather bright prospects in life.  All of this changed however when the government caught wind of his power and conscripted him into the program.  Embittered and resentful of his capture Jason is rather abrasive and cold.  Jason has the ability to transfer mass from place to place within fifty feet of himself, essentially allowing himself to proportionately grow and shrink anything within range while obeying the conservation of matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>RULES</b></u><br>\r\n1.  Try to use all options available to you<br>\r\n2.  I may edit chapters for grammar, spelling, or continuity, but will always inform you via PM of my doing so.<br>\r\n3.  Try not to end the story.  You can end it, I'd just prefer that you avoid it.<br>\r\n4.  Just have fun, and please, get creative!<br>\r\n5.  Smut is encouraged but not required.<br>\r\nI will be awarding points for every chapter added.  250 points by default and 100 for every 1000 characters.  So please don't be shy, add!</td>",
