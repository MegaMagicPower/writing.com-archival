How she was able to increase food amount's was by using her own Jutsu known as Goddess's touch which allowed her to change the size of anything to any size. If it were used on a human, they would be able to breath anywhere with little worry for air and not worry about aging either but the one who would use it would have to give up the life they know and take on the Role of Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Several years and being chased down for the power of the Goddess's Touch Jutsu, Kaede had placed her power into two Separate Rings and locked them away into Two small boxes. Once she had down that, Kaede throw the boxes into the Sea and they were lost at Sea since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow whoever finds the one of the rings or both will be able to use the Goddess's touch Jutsu and obtain all information about it's effect. However, this is a story that very few had heard of and the existence of the two rings have become but mere rumor's to those who have heard of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur tale takes place as someone finds the box with one of the rings but the question is, who and how shall they find it and how will they use it's power?</span></div></div>",

She had recently failed a mission that was supposed to be an easy one, and had removed herself from the village to contain her rage. As she paced around the Hidden Leaf Forest, her anger transitioned partly to self-doubt and regret over such things as not being able to keep Sasuke from leaving Squad Seven, which only intensified her anguish. <br>\r\n\"...why?\" she asked herself through gritted teeth, her eyes welling up with tears, \"why am I so weak? Why am I always the useless member of my team? Why?!\" With that, her anger exploded and she gripped the sides of a large tree, ripping it completely out of the ground and throwing it behind her. <br>\r\n\"GRRR! I'm so strong! But somehow I'm so powerless! CHAAAAAA!\" Her shouting was followed by the destruction of several more trees in the vicinity, which she snapped like twigs in her arms.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of rampaging, her body began to fatigue and she sat down, sobbing and punching the ground in frustration. Her peripheral vision then caught sight of a small river outside of the clearing she created, which had been revealed when she destroyed the trees blocking it from view. She approached it and sipped some water from it with her cupped hands, looking at her distraught reflection in the current. And that's when she saw it.<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's that?\" Sakura questioned aloud as her eyes locked onto the shiny object submerged in the river. She grabbed it and identified it as a small box with golden trim and a large gem on the lid. She marveled at its beauty for a few seconds before she decided to open it. Inside, untouched by the water, was a gorgeous ring. Made of what looked like sliver, it housed a scarlet gem in the middle which gleamed the brightest of all. <br>\r\n\"Wow...it's amazing!\" the kunoichi exclaimed, removing the piece of jewelry and examining it closer. Almost immediately after her eyes completely locked onto the gem, she heard a faint female voice in her head:<br>\r\n\"You have been chosen...bear this ring as your own...\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Sakura yelped, looking around in vain for the source of the voice.<br>\r\n\"Do not be afraid, my daughter,\" the voice continued, its smooth, gentle voice soothing Sakura's emotions, \"you have been chosen to become the single most powerful being in existence, the heir to a woman who could make even the mighty Sage of the Six Paths grovel before her feet. You...are a goddess...\"<br>\r\n\"M-me?\" Sakura stuttered, unable to completely believe what she was hearing.<br>\r\n\"I will be your guide in taming this world. You may call me Kaede. Now, are you ready?\"</span></div></div>",

Almost immediately, it felt extremely comfortable there, like it always belonged there. <br>\r\n\"Now, let's begin,\" Kaede exclaimed happily. As if on cue, Sakura felt INSANE amounts of chakra flow through her, filling her with intense sensations of power and pleasure. She moaned loudly and stood up from the riverbed, raising her arms towards the sky in ecstasy. Once the feelings subsided, one thought seemed to pop into Sakura's head: the sight of her as an ultra-supreme goddess titan, standing thousands of miles above her helpless peers and teachers of the Leaf Village, pointing down, laughing and taunting them with her massive feet like the insects they were to her. <br>\r\n\"Grow...\" she whispered, and the chakra within her surged once more. The gem on the ring glowed with a crimson light as the jutsu was activated. Within seconds, Sakura began to rise, growing upward like a sprouting tree.<br>\r\nHow big does she grow (for now)? </span></div></div>",

Her muscles expanded slightly; not to obnoxious levels, but enough to appear mighty and still feminine. Her breasts and butt expanded as well, but again, only a little bit. All the while, her height grew to a little over eight feet until the pulsations stopped, <br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Sakura exclaimed, marveling at her new, flawless form, which was straining against her clothing and causing it to tear in some places when she moved.<br>\r\n\"Hmm...why so small, my child?\" Kaede asked.<br>\r\n\"I wanna enjoy my ascension. Each and every inch,\" Sakura replied with a sneer. She then walked towards a nearby tree that was still standing and smacked it effortlessly. The bark splintered on contact, and the tree simply split at the middle almost perfectly, falling down with a crash.<br>\r\n\"Mmm! I LOVE THIS!\" the amazon shouted happily, her arms spread. She then remembered Naruto and the others back at the village, and focused on Naruto. Since he came back from training with Jiraiya, he had been strong, far stronger than even Sakura had gotten through training with Lady Tsunade. As these thoughts ran through her head, Sakura clenched her fist in anger and stormed off towards the village, eager to show the humans her new feminine power.<br>\r\nWho does she go to first?</span></div></div>",

There were few words spoken from Choji or Naruto that were not muffled from there being half-chewed food in their mouths, constantly causing Shikamaru to sigh or facepalm. <br>\r\nOnce their meal was finished, Choji badgered Shikamaru into paying the tab, which he reluctantly did. With that, Naruto said goodbye to his friends and began making his way back towards his house. <br>\r\n\"That hit the spot. Better get ready for training,\" he thought aloud as he casually jogged through the main street of the Leaf Village. Within a few minutes, the blond ninja reached his abode, opened the door and stepped inside. That's when he turned on the lights to an amazing sight.<br>\r\n\"Hmm...hey there, little man,\" Sakura cooed. She was reclined on his bed, her legs folded up to disguise her new height a little.<br>\r\nNaruto was speechless; his mouth agape, all he could do was stammer and marvel at his teammate's new muscular, toned frame and perfect figures. <br>\r\nThe amazonian kunoichi laughed and sat up quickly, grabbing Naruto by the arm and pulled him further into the room. She then rose to her proud 8ft in height and stood like a stone wall between him and the door, blocking his escape. <br>\r\n\"You like what you see Naruto?\" she asked with a giggle, flexing her powerful thighs. <br>\r\n\"S-Sakura...w-what happened to you?\" Naruto squeaked, now that he could see the size difference between them.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I grew...a little bit. But this is just the beginning,\" Sakura replied, striking several poses to show off her body, \"but for now, I just need one thing from you, Naruto: come look at this ring for me.\" With that, the amazon held out her hand and revealed the shiny piece of jewelry to Naruto, who was taken back by its glow. <br>\r\n\"...kiss it...\" Sakura suddenly ordered, stepping closer so Naruto could reach it.<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" Naruto stuttered, breaking out of his trance, \"what the hell are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n\"Kiss my ring. Show your obedience,\" Sakura reiterated with the utmost seriousness.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Naruto asked in disbelief, \"who do you think you are?!\"<br>\r\nThe pink-haired girl walked a little closer to emphasize how much taller she was then stomped her foot on the floor, which cracked easily and was followed by the entire house shaking. \"I am a goddess and you are a mere man. Now KISS IT!\" she demanded, glaring down at her former friend. Naruto hesitated, then decided there was no harm in playing along, so he puckered up and kissed the glowing gem on the ring...</span></div></div>",

So, like every day, the Godaime Hokage had to deal with an huge pile of papers to fill out by the day.<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... what a bore...\" she sighed apathetically as she stamped a paper.<br>\r\nYes, she recognized that those office stuffs were of crucial importance for her country, but this didn't make them any less boring. She was one of the Leggendary Sannin, not a bureaucrat.<br>\r\n<i>I suppose I need just a little break... </i> She thought, and, running her hands through her blonde hair, she yawned a bit and put the stamp on the table. Then she stood and walked slowly to the window, with the aim of admiring her beloved country.<br>\r\nIt was a very sunny day, so her view was certainly rather beautiful, although apparently trite and uninteresting: she spent a few minutes to contemplate the innocent crowds of people below her.<br>\r\nThe children, the young chunin, the merchant... every inhabitant of her village, civilian or ninja, was precious beyond measure to her.<br>\r\n<i>My people look so tiny from this height... so defenseless... and there are so many dangers in the world...</i><br>\r\nHer thoughts flew to the Akatsuki and Oto: those two were the greatest superpowers of evil in the continent, and, according to her reliable reports, very much actives. Tsunade had been always a terrible gambler, but that time she was sure that if she had betted that both of the organizations were planning something, she would have won a lot of money.<br>\r\nThe blonde took a look at her hands: despite her very youthful appearance, she knew that her beauty was just an illusion maintained for her gambling issues with creditors, but most for her vanity's sake. In truth, she felt very old and tired inside, and probably feared that the day she would have withdrawn because of her own weakness was near. Was she capable of fighting and healing as she was younger? At least in her own mind, the answer was \"no\".<br>\r\n<i>My body has come to the terminus: this is undeniable. I am already in my fifties, and, with all the usages of the Creation Rebirth Technique, I feel that my  body is chronologically even older. I don't believe I could ever improve with training alone. Aahhhh... Dam nit! </i><br>\r\nShe became so angry that she had to control herself in order to not strike the floor with her mighty strength. However, Tsunade knew that she could not afford to lose her control, especially in that difficult period. With new vigor induced by anger, she sat on the chair again and returned to her daily mansions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome papers after, she heard a knock at the door and a familiar voice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She immediately entered in the office.<br>\r\n\"Shizune, so it's you...\" said the blonde.<br>\r\n\"Yes, Tsunade-sama\". The secretary answered. Then she carefully pulled some documents from her purse and placed them on the desk.<br>\r\n\"Those are the reports of the last mission of Team 7. It was a complete success, although Naruto had almost his team discovered... however, he still defeated the target and brought him to justice\".<br>\r\nThe blonde sighed has she heard the notice, not at all surprised.<br>\r\n\"Naruto... that guy has always been troublesome and reckless. He almost borders in idiocy... but he certainly doesn't lack of good heart and intentions. Mmm....\" she sighed again \" Is there anything else?\"<br>\r\nAs she heard these words, Shizune remembered a very important thing. She thumped her heard with the palm of her hand, then she put the other in her bag.<br>\r\n\"I have a present for you, Tsunade- sama... it's by a certain Burakku\". She pulled out of the bag a black wooden box, finely decorated in gold and placed hem near the papers.<br>\r\nThe Hokage took the object with an and examined very closely. She didn't know anything about this Burakku, so she found the fact that he gave her such a precious box very suspicious.<br>\r\n\"I know what you're thinking, Tsunade sama, but we have already analyzed the box through the Byakugan and all the other means: we haven't found anything dangerous in this gift\". Said the faithful secretary, knowing her master suspicions.<br>\r\n\" Mmmm...\" the blonde muttered, not very convinced. \"This affair is probably far more complicated that we can imagine at first glance... have you opened the box already?\"<br>\r\n\"No, Burakku explicitly said that you and only you should open it. He said that you are the only person who possesses the key... I don't know anything else about this matter. Sorry, Tsunade- sama\".<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Shizune. I'll try to understand everything by myself. You can go now\".<br>\r\nThe brunette bowed down to her master a little, then she left the room. Remained alone, the blonde look at the precious container one more. She was a bit scared of eventual bad surprises, but even quite... excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't know...</i> she thought. <i>May I open this box? It may be a trap... but Shizune didn't find anything during her analysis. Well, I have decided: I'll open it, regardless of everything.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scraped with her index the lock of the mysterious present. As it was under the effect of some magic, it released by himself and let the box opened.<br>\r\nThe situation was getting really strange, but Tsunade was completely won by curiosity, so she couldn't resist seeing more.<br>\r\nNow I'll finally see this mysterious present... she thought as she put her hand in the box. She soon found a strange black-colored ring alongside a cartouche.<br>\r\nThe blonde immediately unrolled the cartouche and started to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dear Godaime Hokage, you will probably wondering why I have sent you such a strange gift, since we don't know each other. Well, this is just an half truth: in fact, I know you quite well. Still, do not worry, because I am not an enemy of yours. Believe me or not, I have actually sent you the source of power that you need in order to defeat evil. Yes: even if this ring has gone undetected by your sensor, it still could give you a power that you would never have imagined before. You would know everything about it in the very moment you will wear it. I know that I've left the ring in the right hands, but I still recommend you to be always vigilant: Evil is very strong, and it may even copy your means. Most Importantly, I beg you to never forget the strong and dedicated woman who you are, because with great powers comes great responsibility, but it might arrive insanity too. Do not abuse of it. Never.<br>\r\nGoodbye\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"></div>Burakku<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade dint' know if she had to be glad of feared, but certainly she was really shocked: this Barukku had gave her a ring which he claimed it had mystic powers of sort, and she really didn't know what to about the whole situation.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nGreat source of power? That sounds pretty interesting, and it happened in the best moment possible. But I can't trust this guy so much: If he were a quack or just a stupid prankster? But that ring went unseen trough the Byakugan, so that ring may be truly \"magic\" or have other abilities. Well, there is only a way to discover it: wearing this ring.

The woman blew a frustrated sigh through pursed lips as her impatience bristled and she swept her concerns aside, her eyes gleaming with a sly light that always gave her enemies pause and made her allies uneasy. Her mind made up she quickly slid her right ring finger through the metal ring, letting it settle as she raised to appraise it. After several seconds passed with no noticeable change Tsunade let out a large gasp of air that she didn't realise she had been holding in. She chuckled, shaking her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Well, it's a fake. Harmless, I suppose, but a fake regardless.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bored eyes settled on the pile of paperwork on her desk and she made to resume the mundane work when a voice that was not her own cut through her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Ah, my child. I am glad that you are the one to inherit my power. Your heart sings true to me.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sat bolt upright and narrowed her eyes as she re-examined the ring, noticing the small red gem sat into the black band was now glowing with a faint inner light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" The woman asked aloud, tensing in her chair as she prepared herself to tear the ring off at the first sign of danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Calm yourself,'</i> the voice answered soothingly and Tsunade found herself starting to relax in spite of her concerns. <i>'You are about to find out all you need to know...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately the fifth Hokage was assailed with visions and alien memories of a faint and distant past, of the powerful woman known as Kaede and the power that she possessed. All the secrets of the Goddess' Touch jutsu. How she had poured her essence into two rings and cast them into the ocean to be delivered by the whims of fate to new inheritors. The volume of information was great and the older woman had to concentrate to not let it overwhelm her, both of her hands tightly gripping the edge of her desk to keep herself anchored. After a short time the visions ended and Tsunade was left with her head bowed, panting heavily, her large breasts heaving against her robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Now you know what you have been chosen to inherit,'</i> Kaede continued, for Tsunade knew that the disembodied voice in her mind had to be that of the oldest Sage. <i>'Let's begin your ascension.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade felt for a moment that she should protest, ask for more time to process the incredible visions that had poured through her mind, demand to know why she in particular should be worthy. But as before she silenced her doubts. Of course she was worthy! In her youth she had felt that Jiraiya and Orochimaru had always been that little bit further ahead, a lead that she had never been able to close. Always relegated to a medical role despite her incredible chakra control, seen as little more than a medic, a doctor. Now she had the opportunity to gain more power than anyone in history and she could protect Konoha like she always wanted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes,\" she stammered aloud and she felt the warm acknowledgement of Kaede's essence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately an incredible amount of chakra began pouring into her body from the ring, making the Hokage once again sit bolt upright, her eyes snapping wide open and her mouth opening in a strangled groan. It was more than any one person could ever hope to have in their lifetime and it kept coming, sweat beading and then pouring down her bare skin. The blue diamond on her forehead swelled in size as decades worth of chakra was immediately stored until the top point reached her hairline and the bottom point sat between her eyes, the technique quickly reaching the maximum energy it could contain. Tsunade's hands, clutching the edge of the desk, closed into fists with no effort, shattering and splintering the wood as she unconsciously channelled the vast amounts of energy into her muscles to gain more strength than she had had thought possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh my,\" she managed to groan as the chakra kept coming and started to shape subconscious desires into reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteam started to rise from her skin as the chakra started to fuel the healing of age itself, the now young woman grunting as she felt every cell in her body rejuvenate to bring her biological age down to what her illusion normally portrayed. She let the genjutsu lapse as it was no longer necessary to maintain and breathed a sigh of contentment as the constant drain, as small as it had been, was now relieved. It felt like an enormous weight had been lifted from her shoulders as the ravages of age and her own jutsu were completely reversed and Tsunade stood, raising her arms to the ceiling as the last of the incredible amounts of chakra poured into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such incredible power!\" The Hokage said with a grin, flexing and unflexing her hands as she stood at her window, sweat gleaming on her bare skin as it continued to trickle down her face, neck and chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Yes, and it is all yours to do with as you see fit. It can be used for great things...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade's cheeks flushed a deep red as she looked down at her cleavage and, with barely a thought, watched her already large breasts start to swell even larger. She groaned with pleasure as her nipples tented the grey robe and felt the garment slowly lose ground against her chest, gradually sliding further and further apart as her cleavage grew longer and deeper, her mounds desperately fighting for more room and bulging outwards. The swelling stopped just as they were about to pop out completely, Tsunade cupping them and sighing happily as she felt their new weight, giggling like a young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Or, yes, personal things,</i> Kaede continued, wryly. It was meant as a gentle scolding but there were was a distinct tone of mirth.</span></div></div>",
