So he decided to sit down and just eat a couple of things. He took a bite out a muffin his taste buds admiring the sweet taste enter his mouth.

Which was expected since he seemed like the geeky type that didn't do much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Sam looked at Lance. Who was the opposite of Peter. Lance's belly was firm and hard, or Sam would guess. Lance seemed to to keep his shape since he still seemed he still had muscle with his fat, giving him a more beefy form than just downright fat. Sam would still his his arms were still muscular just now had more beef to them thanks to bulking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim mostly just had a big pot belly. The rest of his body had gained some fat as well but it mostly clung to his gut. Sam assumed that was because of out of four of them Jim was the heavy eater, always eating to his fill before he was going to pop. His guy just assuming its overstuffed form as it digested his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Sam saw Hector's body, While he had a modest belly compared to his friends, his moobs were massive and didn't sag. Sam didn't even notice Hector's chest when Hector had his shirt one. Sam kinda blushed seeing how perky and supple Hector's moobs were. Sam just kinda wanted to squeeze them to see how soft they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHector noticed Sam looking at his chest, making him blush a little, \"Well big guy like what you see?\" Hector asked flirting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm I mean, I've never seen a chest that bog on a guy before\" Sam said with a nervous laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, now why don't we....\" Hector said</span></div></div>",

At first he was confused why his vision was obscured but as his vision cleared he saw Hector's black hair with his red highlights brushing up against his neck. Sam had forgotten that he had slept with Hector that night and he was recollecting everything that happened the previous night. How he felt Hector;s soft chest and his chubby belly and how Hector whispered to him about how Sam would look like him soon. Sam smiled just thinking about it, it had been a while since he had many sort of romantic feelings for someone, let alone another guy. He was looking forward to getting fatter with Hector, he was already picturing himself and Hector feeding each other as they added more weight unto their heavy frames. It was then that Sam's stomach let out a loud growl of hunger. Hector stirred, the noise nudging him to wake up. Hector slowly opened his eyes and shifted his body to face Sam. He gave a soft smile to Sam and then a quick peck on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like someone is hungry\" Hector said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam blushed. \"Yeah, guess we should get something to eat\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHector slide out of bed grabbing his cell phone and began rapidly typing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ordering food of course, having UberEats deliver\" Hector said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds kinda expansive, I'm guessing were gonna split the bill\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah don't worry about it I've got cash to burn\" Hector said, After some more rapid typing he put the phone down and went back to bed snuggling with Sam. \"Now all we have to do is wait\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long till Sam started exploring Hector's body again, feeling Hector's moobs giving them a shake and squeeze every so often something Hector admired. Slowly going down to his belly having his hands move across  Hector's soft skin  and giving it a jiggle. It wasn't long till there was a knock at the door and Hector got up again to answer it, after an exchange with the delivery guy Sam saw Hector bring in a couple bags that were filled to the brim with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude you expect us to eat that much!\" Sam said shocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHector smirked \"Hey we are going boys after all, now come on help me get everything set up. Both of them headed over to the table laying tons of the breakfast food that Hector got on top of it. Sam plopped down waiting to dig in. It was then Hector seated himself on Sam's lap, Sam felt Hector's weight slightly crushing him but nothing that he couldn't handle. Hector then slowly grabbed a breakfast sandwich raised close to Sam's face who instinctively bite into it.Hector pressed himself closer into Sam's body his soft moobs mushed against Sam's slightly muscular pecs.

All they know the people disappear at an old summer camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Impala pulled up to an old gate of the summer camp in the middle of the night. \u201cAlright Sam, what do we have here?\u201d Dean asked as he got out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much,\u201d Sam replied getting out of the car with a laptop in his hands, \u201cIt was a popular summer camp for kids ages 10 to 15.

He was in a small room with four bunk beds. The only other person in the room was his brother. He got out of bed to wake Dean up. \u201cDean wake up!\u201d Sam shouted shaking Dean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam, what the hell?!\u201d Dean groggily said as he woke up and saw his brother. \u201cAnd what the hell are you wearing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked down to see he was in a white t-shirt with a compass on his shirt and red shorts. It was like he was a camper at a summer camp. Dean got out of bed and he was dressed the same. \u201cWhat happened to us? Why are we dressed like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sam said, \u201cI don\u2019t see our stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon a trumpet was playing and they heard someone saying that the two campers are to come to the\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
