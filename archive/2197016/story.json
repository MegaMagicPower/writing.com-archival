Ruby was playing tug of war with Zwei, Blake was reading her \"love novel\" and Yang was taking an hour long shower, no doubt spending more then half that time shampooing and conditioning her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you would think from looking at Weiss's teammates that she would envy them for their bust sizes compared to her own seemingly modest chest. All of them were very well developed for their age with Blake being a firm D-cup, Yang being an enormous H-cup, even Ruby was a surprising E-cup.(must be from all the milk she drinks) And you would be right though not for the reason that you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew that was an awesome shower.\" Yang strutted into the room with a towel wrapped around her hair but the rest of her gorgeous body was laid bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Yang must you be so brazen?\" Weiss said annoyed by the brawlers lack of modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh relax prude-queen it's just us girls.\" Yang responded without a care. \"Speaking of girls\" a sultry smirk crossed her face as she cupped her wonderous bosom \"my bra has been getting tight around mine lately. I think I'm due for another upgrade soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow really Yang?! Your still growing?!\" Ruby said in awe at her sister amazing growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" Yang proudly stated. She then looked up at Weiss with a teasing smirk \"Bet you wish you had this half this much boobage huh Weiss?\" she even gave her breasts a teasing shake for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss look down at the glorious sight of Yang's funbags with a twinge of envy, but shook it off with a humph as turn attention back to textbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Yang I think you tease her enough.\" Blake scolded. Yang playful held her hands up in surrender as she decided Blake was right and went back to getting dressed for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Later that night.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss waited till she was sure that the others were asleep before she crawled out of bed and went into the bathroom. She was always careful to make sure nobody knew her secret. She always got up earlier then the others to get dressed and ready, her sleepwear covered her fully(but was still stylish and adorable) and every night would make the proper adjustments to make sure nobody noticed. What is her secret you may ask? Well..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh* This getting harder and harder everyday.\" Weiss said tiredly as she removed her pajamas to reveal her modest B-cups..or so it would seem. She pressed her bellybutton only to reveal that it was an actual button that deactivated a specially designed camouflaged vest that not only suited as added protection but as the barrier that kept her true size at bay. It hugged her slim curves nicely and had breast cavities to give the illusion of being actual breasts. She the pressed the button again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CA-CHINK* *MOAN*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vest released and fell to the ground in light thud and Weiss's real breasts were freed. How big was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigger then her whole team combined!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo how many times she saw them Weiss could not believe that these gargantuan udders were real, let alone belonged to her. They were perfectly round, super soft and each almost the size of beach balls. Ever since she was 11 years old her breasts were always getting bigger. By the time she was 12 she had already surpassed both her mother and sister in cup size. (D and E respectfully) And by the time she was 14 she was almost twice Yang's current size. And no matter what her family did, diets, exercises even a reduction surgery when she was 15 she just kept getting bigger. So her father pulled every string he could to develop ways in which to hide her ever growing bosom. Luckily there was a breakthrough and her first vest was made. It was flexible, durable, comfortable and had specially designed camouflage system that mimicked her skin tone and feel perfectly. But like every other bra she tried on she quickly grew out of it. The vest she had now the the third model made..and was getting to harder to put it back on everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do wish I had your \"boobage\" Yang. Because then I would at least not be a freak.\" she said with sorrow as a tear fell down her eye as she stared into the mirror as she looked at her ever increasing burden. She swore that she could actually see them growing right before her very eyes. \"Will they ever stop?\" she asked to herself for what was likely the millionth time. But she summoned up her resolve and then said with much determination \"It doesn't matter how big they get. I will not let anything stop me from becoming a huntress! Especially not my own breasts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she cleaned herself up as quietly as she could, put her vest back on, activated the camouflage and went to bed. But not before she prayed that her vest would hold until her new one came in after the test this week.</span></div></div>",

Flipping through one of her favorite tomes;the cat-girl's mind was enamored in its pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BONZAI!\" A certain sweet-voiced girl yelled. Blake only had a few moments to look up,her eyes widening to the size of dinner plates. Quickly, she dodged out of the way of a rubber ball,which was swiftly followed by a certain chunky dog. They both crashed into her bed,and like a \"wreck everything machine,\"pulled up her blankets and pillows. Blake crumpled into a pile on the dorm room's floor, turning her head, Blake saw the youngest member of her team outside of the room. On her face was a wide-eyed expression of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Blake! Zwei's  ball just slipped outta my hand!\" Ruby proclaimed, rushing into the room to pick up the dog. Upon doing, Blake and Ruby watched as a thin line of drool poured from Zwei's mouth down onto Blake's sheets. Blake's head immediately shot Ruby a direct glare,which the girl only replied with a sheepish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll..wash all of that for you Blake.\" Ruby stated, the cat-girl rolled her eyes and stalked off from the room. Which left the scythe wielder holding her drooling pooch,who was still over Blake's bed.<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">===</div><br>\r\nSitting on a bench, Blake moved her head left to right. She saw nothing quite out of the ordinary and sighed in relief. Twiddling her fingers for a few moments, Blake flicked her book back towards the page she left on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WATCH OUT\" The lovely deep,but feminine, voice of another member of Rwby called out. Blake again looked up from her book, and like before, she dodged just in time to avoid a large ball that would've smacked her right in the face. She swirled her head to glare at the half-sister of Ruby, Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Blake! Guess I didn't know my own strength.\" Yang stated, smiling with a doofus grin on her face. The busty blonde walked forward and grabbed onto the exercise ball. She lifted it into the air and casually brought it with her. Blake's ear drooped, and the Faunus decided another locale would be a good place to travel towards.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\nShe traveled politely along the edge of the forest, the one right next to Beacon Academy. She wasn't unarmed though, having quickly running back toward her dorm to arm herself. Gamboul Shroud was holstered at the moment,but Blake was ready to take it out at a moment's notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes immediately caught a small flicker of something heading straight for her. Raising Gamboul Shroud upwards, Blake cut the thing with precision. She regretted that action almost instantly, as her field of view was consumed by the mystical element of dust.But its colorization was something that Blake had never encountered before,being a mixture of green and orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AcK...what is this?\" Blake yelled, A slight fragrance filled the air and made Blake's nose twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where did it. Ah, Blake, what happened?\" The last of team Rwby proclaimed. The heiress of ice, Weiss called from behind the treeline, in her arms were various vials of dust,which she was cradling like a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss walked past the treeline and was upon her friend in an instant. \"I am so sorry, I was testing out some new dust I got from my home. One of the new dust I was trying had a little more...<i>force</i> in it than I imagined. It launched the briefcase carrying it, and all my dust vials flew out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know what this is?\" Blake said, pointing out her now coated body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say, seeing as you've obliterated the vial. But with that being said, lets clean you off.\" Weiss answered, she reached forward, but Blake waved her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got this, i'll tell Ruby to come help you once I get back to the dorms.\" Blake responded, standing up, she wiped herself down. Marching back to the dorms, both girls were unaware of the consequences of what had just happened.</span></div></div>",

Blake rolled her eyes, going over to her bed,she laid herself down. Shuffling around for a bit until she found what she was searching for.Picking out her favorite book,she began to read it. Unfortunately, a specter of boy was right beside her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Yin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A book; something that contains paper with words written on them.\" Blake answered. Yin rolled his eyes in turn, sitting down on the floor of them room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Well, I'm going to get a drink. Want anything?\" Blake waved Ying off, watching out of the corner of her eye as the boy left her alone.

She got up and twisted her body left and right. Finding nothing,she was about to lay herself down.

Try not to break anything, all right.\" Blake excused herself before she could hear a reply.

Yin thought taking the scroll with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his negative emotion sense ability, he got to the bathroom where he pictured blake would be and cracked the door to see the stalls. He saw the pair of legs he was looking for. Ignoring everything else, he slide Blake's scroll over to her feet at the stall and quietly closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went back to the room and pulled his scroll out and messaged to blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you are worried about something and I thought I could help and not make it worse so I got you your scroll if you need my help.\" He sent her before leaving it on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She will get me when she is ready.' Yin thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the kitchen, he got stuff to make something to get ruby to him and also to kill time as blake was busy. He noticed ruby had the things to make cookies, but he got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A literal cookie cake.' He thought before he got started making the batter for the cookie cake. He was made sure to not make a mess in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took 30 minutes for him to form the batter and add some yeast to it so it could rise a bit. He pulled three cake pans from his scroll for the cake and the batter was enough for all of them. Setting the oven for the time after the heat was set, he cleaned his hands and the slight mess. He made himself a pastrami sandwich so he would have something to munch on as he was waiting for the cake to bake. He cracked the window open a 1/4 of the way so the room could air out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was carefully of the time and checking on the cake every so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wish summer was here so I can make her some cookies.'

He still love her cookies and wants to return the favor)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the timer chimes off, he opened the oven by a crack to let the heat out and turned the oven off.  He took a plate out for the cake and stacked it like a normal 3 layer cake. He noticed it was wider than normal, but less than a wedding cake and half as tall as one. He filled the middle of the cakes with frozen cookie dough and put chocolate chip ice cream as icing before storing it in their freezer. He cleaned the cake pans and any part of the baking mess he missed before and he set the timer again for the cake to chill in the freezer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'One ruby lure made and waiting to be used.' He thought with a smile. He sent a text to his best friend about made a surprise for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey my cookie crusader, I have made you something in your own kitchen. If Weiss asks, I cleaned any and all messes. I might find someone more deserving of the gift if you take any longer. Also it's a new form of your great love of food.\"</i> He sent her. He meant it as a tease and to encourage her to show up faster. The way that the timer should be done when his friend shows up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We'll see she gets here in time.'</span></div></div>",

Picking up the note Weiss began to read the note silently in her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is from that 'Yin-boy' isn't it?\" Weiss proclaimed causing Ruby to stare up at the heiress.

If you were there, you'd probably never notice the Cat-girl roaming the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a shadow, Blake Belladonna made no noise. She stuck to the treeline, invisible to all who weren't strictly looking for her. She liked exploring the forest in her free time. It seemed like every time she came, she discovered something new, and this time was no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped hopping from tree to tree, her ears rotating on top of her head. She heard something faint, some sort of low humming. It was fading in and out, but it came back every minute or so. Blake cautiously headed towards it's source, readying Gambit Shroud in case she needed to defend herself from any Grimm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she came across some sort of ruins. Mold grew within the cracks of the few remaining stone walls, and there was no ceiling to speak of. Just a wide open stone floor. There was a large, circular main section, with 8-10 smaller rooms branching out in various directions. There was a fair bit of mostly rotten wooden furniture still standing. Bookshelves, bedframes and the like. Blake's attention, however, was mostly drawn to some sort of blue crystal that ran within the cracks if the stone floor. It was glowing, almost as if it pulsing with some sort of energy. Blake had never seen anything like it, but she had seen weirder in her time at Beacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started exploring the ruins, slowly. Running her fingers along the moldy wood of the bookcases, hoping to find some sort of book that wasn't withered by time. She made her way to the main chamber, following the blue crystals in the floor, and found a large monolith of the crystal as the centerpiece, pulsing with the same energy. She figured out that it was the source of the humming sound that led her here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was entranced by it, slowly moving closer. All caution had left her mind, being replaced only by wonder. She stuck her hand out, blue electricity sparking in the gap between her hand and the large crystal. It didn't hurt enough to bring her out of her trance though, as Blake's hand made contact with the gem. Her hand rubbed against it as she circled around, admiring it's strange beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snaps out of the weird trance after a while, and looks around. She had no idea how long she was there, but it couldn't have been too long as it was still light out, but she still worried if she was gone for just a bit too long. She left the ruins, making a mental note to return at some point, and headed back towards Beacon, pleased with today's adventure,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlissfully unaware of the effects that crystal had on her.</span></div></div>",

Hoping from tree to tree, she was happy with her discovery. Maybe she would tell the other girls about the ruins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally got to the edge if the forest, but that's when she felt a slight uncomfortableness in her clothes. She shimmied in her right blouse, thinking it just got ruffled during her travel back. She started heading back towards the campus of Beacon, when she noticed her clothes were still uncomfortable. She shimmied again, readjusting her shorts and leggings, trying to get them to not stick as much. No matter what she did though, they still felt uncomfortable. They kept sticking to her, as if they were somehow tighter. She chalked it up to her sweat. It was a hot, and she did just get back from about an hour long expedition in the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still blissfully unaware of her still growing posterior, and new DD-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally got inside the building, her cloths got so bad that she decided to just head to one of the bathrooms to readjust. When she got there, she looked into the mirror, and thought she was hallucinating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe always had an ample bust, which she was secretly proud of, but she definitely wasn't THIS well-endowed. She touched her bust, and noticed that they did seem to spill out of her hands more than they used to. She couldn't believe it at all, this couldn't be real. She definitely has to be hallucinating. She DID just get back from the hot woods, and didn't have any water. Yea, that had to be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hope in this excuse was completely shattered by the sounds of snapping threads. Hesitantly, she slowly turned around, so she could see her backside in the mirror, and to her horror, she noticed it stuck out 2-3 inches more than what she was used to. In fact...it was still growing! Right before her eyes, her own ass was growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sent into a full on panic from this. What could have caused this? When will it stop? WILL it even stop?! She had to do something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss! She had to know something! She was one of the smartest schools in Beacon, and was always messing around with dust!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake bolted down the halls, heading towards team RWBY's dorm. It was definitely much harder to run now, due to the extra weight on her chest, and the fact that her thighs now rubbed against each other with each step. She finally made it back to her dorm, and...</span></div></div>",

A minute or two passed before Yang opened her eyes,looking around the room, the girl saw it was currently unoccupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Stepping inside, Yang searched around for clues as to where her friends, and sister,were. Scratching her chin, Yang spotted a piece of paper taped onto her bed. Reaching over to it,she grabbed it with a little more force than she hoped for, crumpling a part of it. She shrugged,and the blonde heroine began to read the paper's contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Hello</span> <i>Dear, Yang. </i><br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"><i>I'm going out with Blake to go get her some new pants.

Yang strained her eyes trying to make sense of it, but it was ultimately too unreadable for the girl to actually process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Frowning, Yang placed her package down onto one of the beds. Laying herself flat onto another one, the blonde sighed out loud. Even though it had already been five days since the \"incident\", the guilt Yang felt was still fresh in her mind. Doing that to Blake wasn't someone a friend would do, hell, it even caused the faunus not to speak with her for two days straight! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Swinging her feet up and down, Yang turned her head as she saw something in her peripheral. Getting up, she walked over to one of the desks and grabbed a hold of a strange container.Normally she would've left well enough alone, but something about it made it quite appealing to her. She just couldn't resist its luster for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What is this?\" Yang spoke aloud. Inspecting it closer, the blonde yelped in shock as a <i>very</i> surprising sting traveled through her body. She dropped the container,which fell onto the floor with a loud crash. Yang winced in response, that quickly turned into a coughing fit. The blonde paced towards the window and opened it up. Whatever was in the container was pulled out by a strong gale, but not before giving Yang another blast in the face.The stinging of the heroine's eyes, caused her to fall down on the ground to avoid more of the strange contents. Finishing with one last cough, the blonde stared at the container she dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. What. Was. That?\" She proclaimed fiercely.</span></div></div>",

Being the Deputy Headmistress of Beacon was very demanding job. On top of training the future generation of Remnant's protectors, which were super powered teenagers with weapons that could wield the forces of nature, she had to deal with teenage boys staring at her with lust and teenage girls staring at her with envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlynda was perfectly aware that she was beautiful, that's not narcissism on her part it just a fact. In her prime at 27 years old standing at 6'5 feet tall with long silky blond hair tied in bun with a curl hanging down the right side of her gorgeous face, bright green eyes covered by thin ovular glasses, a perfect hourglass figure, long thick legs attached to wide child baring hips and of course the main attraction her gigantic breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact calling her breasts gigantic was an understatement, her custom made blouse was stretched almost to the breaking point trying to contain her behemoth bosom. With a bust as wide as she was tall (196cm) it was a miracle that she could walk let alone fight the creatures of grimm. Luckily for her she had the godsend semblance of telekinesis. Which on top of being a powerful and versatile weapon/defense it also made the perfect one size fits all bra. Something that really came in handy when she was a student herself and she was outgrowing bras all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even though she could fight hordes of grimm single handedly it was tiring having to do so while holding breasts each weighing 60 pounds all day. So it felt good to lay them on her deck while sipping her tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh* If boys in Team CRDL try to cop a feel with me during sparing again I'll feed them to a pack of Beowolfs.\" she said with frustration at her most troublesome students. [It's honestly a wonder how they were accepted into Beacon to begin with.] she thought to herself in honest puzzlement. While they were competent fighters they were also rude, intolerant bullies that didn't know how to keep their hands to themselves. No matter how many times she threw them into the walls they just didn't seem to understand your not suppose to try and grope you teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ping*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer scroll alerted her of a new message. She looked at and a warm smile crossed her face as she saw it was from her lover. {I'll meet you in your office in 10 minutes. Love you.}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe happily replied {I can't wait.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now I know what your thinking. How and why would Glynda Goodwitch even think about being together with one of her own students, let alone Jaune Arc of all people?! Well that is a bit of a long story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all began 12 years ago when a young Glynda was training not only to become a Huntress but also a Teacher. It was a life long passion of hers to not only defend the innocent but also make sure that the next generation was prepared to keep up the never ending battle against evil. She was already well on her way to becoming one of the best new guardians of Remnant, but if she wanted to become a teacher she would need to know how to deal with children. She need to know how get them to respect her and help them to understand that she had their best interests at heart. And the best way to do that was to interact with them, so that's why she decided that the first step towards realizing her dream was to become a babysitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watch over many different children of all ages from dozens of families and almost all of them loved her.(there is always one or two spoiled brats that just never listen) But her most favorite family was the Arc clan. Not only were the parents (Julius and Olivia Arc) wonderful people, they also had 8 wonderful children.(7 girls 1 boy) And her favorite of the bunch was the middle child, the Arc's 5 year old only son Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was shy around her at first and very socially awkward, but once he warmed up to her he was the sweetest and most thoughtful boy she had ever met. And if she were to be honest he was very cute too.(especially when his older sisters braided his hair and made him wear a dress) Plus he really admired her for her skills and dream to becoming a Huntress/Teacher. He told her that he wanted to become a Huntsman himself and wanted her to teach him what she knew. She was reluctant at first but then he said..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dream is to become a teacher right? So why not start now with me? I promise to be your best student!\" he said with the brightest, most eager smile on his face. How could she say no to that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so for the next 2 years Glynda taught Jaune not only the basics of combat but also helped tutor him in his school work. He excelled in his academics, but his talent when it came to fighting was lacking to say the least. He just couldn't ever seem to get even the simplest of techniques. But Jaune refuse to give up and disappoint his teacher, so he kept practicing each technique for weeks, even months on end until he got them right. And whenever he did he would look at her with that same bright smile on his when he first convinced her to train him. And every time he did she would feel a swell of pride in her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if there was one thing that sealed the deal in making Jaune her favorite person it was one day when she was 16 and her shoulders were killing her. Her breasts were J-cups (105cm) at the time and she hadn't yet thought of using her semblance as a bra so their weight and ever increasing size was a constant issue. To top it all off they were getting so big that it was becoming almost impossible for her to fight properly and many of her peers ridiculed her for having a quote \"body better suited for porn then fighting monsters\". And if she were to be honest she was beginning to believe they were right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glynda are you alright?\" asked a concerned Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlynda snapped out of her melancholy to face her pupil with a soft smile \"It's just my shoulders acting up again Jaune.\" she told half the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to massage them for you?\" he asked eager to help his teacher/sitter. Her smile deepened, he really did give the best massages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat on the couch and opened the top buttons of her blouse to expose her shoulders so Jaune could better work his magic fingers, but this also exposed more of her vast cleavage to the young man. Glynda was in heaven as Jaune relived weeks of pent up stress, but she noticed that he wasn't being as thorough as he usually is. She looked at him from the corner of her I and noticed that his face was cherry red and not focused on his task. In fact he was trying to look anywhere else but her. She immediately knew that he was trying to not peak at her breasts, and while it did make her happy that he was trying not to be a pervert it also brought up all her buried insecurities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaune be honest with me. Do you think I can be a Huntress, let alone a Teacher with breasts like these?\" she asked desperately. Jaune was taken aback from the question but after seeing the desperate look on her face he was determined to restore her resolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you be so sure?\" she asked with growing despair \"My breasts just keep getting bigger and nobody takes me seriously because of this ridiculous body of mine. I quickly outgrow any bras that could fit me and custom made bras are so expensive that all my lien will be spent on those instead of dust or other necessities. And even if I gave up on becoming a Huntress and focused on becoming a Teacher no student would pay attention to my lessons and only pay attention to my chest!\" Tears started to stream down her face \"Maybe should I just give-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT GIVING UP!!\" Jaune roared with surprising authority. \"Your talent and skill is more then a match for most Hunters already! And I have no doubt you will only get stronger! Your semblance is something that most people could only dream of having, in fact you don't even need to wear a bra at all you could just use that instead! And if any future students you will have only focus on your chest then they don't even deserve to be Hunters let alone your students! If you can teach a hopeless case like me you can teach anyone! You will be the best Huntress/Teacher Remnant has ever seen! No ifs, ands or buts about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlynda was stunned by Jaune's speech and was flattered beyond belief by his faith in her abilities. Then something he said echoed in her mind for a minute, using her telekinesis as a bra? Could that even work? [Only one way to find out.] she thought with a tinge of hope. And so she called upon the power of her soul and shaped it into the form of an invisible bra that fit her breasts perfectly. After standing up and doing a few jumps up and down she noticed that her breasts only gave the slightest of bounces. She preformed some kicks, punches, cartwheels, flips and more. All the while making sure to keep her telekinetic bra in place. But no matter what she did her breasts never got in the way or threatened to slap her in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked.\" she said in awe \"IT WORKED!!\" she squealed with pure joy as she subconsciously pick up Jaune and buried his face into her bosom in a tight, warm embrace. \"THANK YOU JAUNE!!\" she cried tears of pure happiness as spinned around with glee know that there was nothing stopping her from fulfilling her dream. But when she didn't her a response from Jaune she snapped out of her glee and saw that he was passed out with a nose bleed and a dopey grin on his face \"Jaune!\" she cried in worry. But Jaune was fine, his puberty just started early is all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so with her new \"technique\" Glynda proceeded to excel in her training once again all thanks to her first and favorite student. But then came the time that she was hoping for and dreading. Her acceptance into Beacon Academy. She had worked her entire life for this day but now that it was here she almost didn't want to go. While it would mean that she was one step closer to her dream it also meant that she probably won't get to see Jaune ever again. She even told him such when she paid the Arc one last visit before she set off the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her fears were put to rest when Jaune told her with complete confidence \"We will see each other again. In fact I will see you at Beacon in 10 years when your it's best Teacher. I'm going to use everything you taught me to keep getting stronger until I'm ready to be accepted into Beacon too. I will learn under you again Glynda and I will be you best student again. That's a promise and an Arc never breaks a promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlynda's heart soared at his heartfelt words and she knew he meant every word. She leaned down to give him a kiss on the forehead and said with a warm smile \"I'll be waiting for you, my darling little knight.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"center\"><b>Backstory</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet Scarlatina was a faunus student at become academy. On the outside, she seemed as normal as she always was. Shy, introverted, but friendly and bubbly when you get to know her. However, an accident on a mission a while back changed her drastically. Team CVFY was on a mission tracking down the crime boss Capeon, and they were led into an abandoned dust mine. Unbeknownst to them, Capeon knew he was being followed, and set up a trap to catch his pursuers and allow him to make an escape. It worked phenomenally, causing 2 of the members of team CVFY to be trapped under a large amount of dust crystals. Those being Fox, and Velvet, both being knocked unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Velvet awoke, she was in the infirmary back at Beacon. The rest of her team explained what happened to her, and about a recent change that happened to her body. Apparently the kind of dust that fell on her somehow wildly altered her anatomy, and one of the science processers at Beacon studied her while she was unconscious for a week. Somehow the dust caused her skin to take on an elastic form. It was significantly shinier, and stretchier. Her internal structure was also changed, with her now, somehow, being devoid of any internals below her neck. It was like she was just a velvet shaped balloon that gained sentience, rather than the real Velvet. The dust also only affected her for whatever reason, with Fox being unchanged by the dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet, being somewhat of a nerd, was completely invested in her changes. She wanted to study her new form and find out all she could from the dusts effects. Everyone else was taken aback, as they were expecting Velvet to be more embarrassed by her current circumstances, but they just chalked it up to her being a bookworm. However, there was another, more personal and secret reason Velvet liked the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple years ago, Velvet was bored and scrolling through her scroll on the internet. She happened to stumble upon some weird videos, where she found a new interest. Inflation. She can't explain exactly why, but she was infatuated more and more by the idea as she went further down the proverbial Rabbit Hole. She always wondered what it would actually feel like to be inflated, however the idea was completely impossible...until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------------------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Velvet! You've been studying your condition for a week now with barely any progress! Just please come to the mall with us.\" Coco Adel, Velvets female teammate and, although she'd never admit it, slight crush, was asking Velvet to join her team to the store so they could do shopping. She was irked that she couldn't go with another girl for weeks now, with Velvet being unconscious, and then fully immersed in her research.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Coco, but I'm <i>Really</i> close to a breakthrough I feel!\" Coco heavily sighed at this response. Velvet, feeling slightly guilty, quickly added, \"I'll go with you next week, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoco rolled her eyes, still annoyed, but now less so. \"Fine. But you better keep that promise.\" She pointed at Velvet, before turning and heading out the door, Fox and Yatsuhashi following close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet waited a few minutes to make sure they weren't comic back, before rushing into the bathroom and locking the door behind her. She almost couldn't keep herself from squeeaing with excitement. She had waited an entire week for a chance to be alone, and now she had a solid few hours to herself. She quickly undressed, haphazardly throwing her cloths into the corner of the room, and pulled out a hose she hid under the towels in one of the drawers. She attached one end of the hose to the faucet of the bath, and held the other end in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet was blushing like mad, with almost her entire face being a deep shade of maroon. She couldn't believe this was actually happening. Something she could only dream about for years, and now she was about to do it. She was about to inflate herself like a water balloon. Velvet decided that it wasn't a smart idea to use her mouth, as she still had her gag reflex, so the only other place to try would be rear. She slowly reached behind, and inserted the hose. It was definitely a weird feeling for her. She didn't hate it, but she didn't enjoy it either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was done, she stepped into the tub, her heart rate rising every second that passes. She laid down and made herself comfortable. She sat there for a few seconds to prepare herself, and she finally reached forward, and turned the bath knob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, she felt how cold the water rushing into her was, causing her to yelp from being unprepared. After a few seconds, she got accustomed to it, and laid back, ready to enjoy every moment of the next couple minutes of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't notice anything for the first 20 seconds or so, but eventually she felt a slight pressure building in her gut. Slowly, she witnessed it start to rise at a steady pace. She laughed slightly, partly out of joy, and partly out of nervousness. She didn't feel much aside for a slight discomfort of the pressure, but as her stomach grew centimeter after centimeter, she slowly started noticing how good the whole ordeal felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to love the feeling of being inflated slowly. And laid back enjoying herself. After another minute or so, she noticed the pressure building in other places of her. As her stomach grew to the size of a woman reaching her third trimester of pregnancy, she noticed that she was sat just a tiny bit higher than usual, as her ass started expanding as well. Soon after, her thighs joined the mix, slowly closing the gap between her legs. Velvet enjoyed every second of her curves expanding, sending her pleasure higher the more they rose. She was naturally a very petite girl, but you wouldn't be able to tell that if you looked at her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, she reached the point of looking like she was pregnant with twins, and her rump would have stretched out any pair of panties she had to their max. At this point, she started to feel the same pressure building in her chest, as her breasts started to expand as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Velvet was never flat by any stretch of the imagination, she never really had much of a bust, and she didn't really care for having one either. She was perfectly content with her C-cups. However now, as felt the immense waves of pleasure from their expansion, she couldn't help but want them to become even bigger than Yang's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleasure of of her breasts expanding was much greater than any of her other assets. For what reason, she didn't know. Nor did she even care. She just wanted them to keep growing. Fed up with the relatively slow intake of water, she reached forward, a now more difficult task due to her still inflating belly, and turned up the water pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet immediately felt the effects of the renewed flow rate. The pleasure increased immensely, as her curves started growing at thrice the rate as they were before. Within a minute her breasts had quickly reached Blake's size, and she now looked as if she swallowed a small boarbatusk. Her thighs and butt would now rip out of any pair of pants she owned. She was in complete euphoria, and even started caressing a few of her growing curves, immensely enjoying the entire situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever it was at this moment that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>Brring! Brring!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet was startled out of her euphoric trance by the jarring noise that echoed off the bathroom tiles. Her sudden movements causing all of her filled curves to go wildly jiggling and sloshing, forcing her entire body weight back and fourth within the tub. When she was finally stable again, she looked over to the counter to see her scroll ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet stretched over as much as she could to try and grab it, but alas it was out of her reach. Thinking quickly, she reached up with one of her now very thick legs, and kicked off the bathtub flow. Praising her own problem solving skills for a second, even though it was a very simple solution, she got back to the task of getting to her scroll, and attempted to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her, liquids, in large volumes, tend to be very, very.....heavy. and she was currently filled with a few gallons of water spread without her new body. It took a few attempts before she was able to muster enough strength to finally wrench herself out of the tub and onto the side, her massive gut almost pulling her onto the floor. Panting, she managed to stand up, which was honestly leagues easier since she was already in a sitting position, and got over to scroll just in time to...miss the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet was upset to expend all that effort, only to end up failing, but decided she should just accept the loss and move on. It was probably just a wrong number anyways. The only person that she gets any real calls from is-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Brring! Bring!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Velvet was startled by her scroll ringing, stumbling due to the rapidly shifting liquid, and just barely managing to keep her from falling on her inflated butt. She looked down at her scroll to see that it was, indeed, Coco calling her. Quickly, she answered the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coco! Hey! What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, you do actually still exist. I was worried there for a second.\" Her teammate poked fun at her for missing a call. \"Are you ok? You sound like your breathing a little heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea! Yea, I'm fine. I just...had to rush to catch this call. Anyways, what'd you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, a little pushy to get straight to the point, huh? You always were impatient when it came to any sort of experiment. Anyway, I saw this cute little skit that you'd just absolutely adore. It's on sale and I wanted to know if you'd want it. Here, I'll send a picture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet, wanting to just get the call over with, quickly interjected with, \"No, no, that's fine. I-I'm sure that if you think it's good, then it's good. You are the fashionista on our team after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, how sweet. Alright, I'll get it for you. BTDubs, what's with the echo? Are you in the bathroom or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, yea! I'm just running a few quick experiments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of experiments could you do in the bathroom? Unless you're making yourself into a water balloon or something.\" Coco chuckled at what she thought was just a made up scenario, but instead was exactly, 100 percent what Velvet was doing, and this caused her to turn completely red within record time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-u-uhh I, I-I\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kidding Velvet, calm down. Didn't expect you to get so flustered over that. Although, that would be interesting to see.\" There was a large period of awkward silence before Coco spoke again. \"Anyway, can't wait for you to see this dress. We'll probably be back within another hour or two. See ya then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Click.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet could do nothing but stand there, completely red faced, wishing that the whole conversation never actually happened. After a few minutes, she finally sat her scroll back on the counter, took a few breaths, and calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It was only a joke Velvet. It's Coco. You know her, she makes weird jokes all the time. This is nothing new.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing that she was standing up still, Velvet took this time to admire her large body in a new perspective. The weight was immense, and it was a wonder she was still able to stand. She rubbed her large, round belly, loving the feeling of her stretched skin. One of her hands slowly traced up to her breasts. She assumed she was, at least, F-Cup now, and she loved the size. She squeezed and kneeded them, her eyes rolling back in her head, and then went downwards. She could only feel her thighs and ass, since her stomach obstructed her view of anything below it. Her thighs were thick, and constantly rubbed against each other no matter how she stood. She admired just how far her fingers could sink into them. Her butt was much past what anyone would normally define as curvy, and raised her up an inch or so when she finally gave in and say down of the toilet, giving her knees a much needed rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Velvet sat there and admired her curves, she decided that...</span></div></div>",

She absolutely loved the feeling of being filled up, so she was far from done. She stood back up to get back in the tub, but as she did, she got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving herself out of the tub was a process, and the Toilet she was currently sitting on was right next to the bath, so she could actually just sit here instead of laying back down in the tub. It'd be much easier to get up if she needed to, and, again, she'd like to experience this from different angles. So she leaned over, and turned the flow back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately she felt the water rushing back into her. Slowly but surely her skin started stretching again. She loved this feeling so much. It was something she never thought was possible outside of her imagination, but god was she glad it was happening now. She rubbed her belly as it slowly grew, feeling like she could almost fall asleep like this. Just enjoying her skin stretching. Maybe she would dream about it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, she lost track of time. Her stomach had almost doubled in size, now looking like she had eaten for her whole team for a week. There was no empty space between her thighs as they squished up against each other, yet even still flowed over the sides of the toilet seat. She was sitting 3-4 inches higher now thanks to her booty, each cheek nearing the size of a beach ball. Each of her breasts were bigger than her head, and blocked a decent amount of her view, partially thanks to her ginormous belly holding them higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping back into reality, she had realised her new size. Panicking, her hand shot towards the bath, with her arm now looking like a tube of paper towels. She cut off the flow, but unfortunately, her sudden movements pulled her over, and caused her to fall off the toilet. She yelped, falling flat on her face. Or, atleast she would, were it not for her body catching her before she even had the chance to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet grunted to get up, but found that now her body was much, much too heavy and large. All the water in her body was still sloshing about, causing her body to juggle and sway wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no...</i> Velvet thought to herself, <i>What did I get myself into? A water balloon of a human trapped on the floor of her bathroom. Atleast it feels good. Not to worry though, Coco still has a while before she returns. I'm sure I can think of a way to remedy this before-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she heard the door to her dorm open. Her face turned white as all the blood drained from her face. She then heard someone call her name. It was-</span></div></div>",
