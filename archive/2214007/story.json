Startled, you spun around- not expecting to seea tall blonde, blue eyed girl wearing hotpants and a stripped t shirt<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAka, your friend Taylor.<br>\r\n\"Morning... wait, what are you doing here?\" You asked, eyeing your cereal suspiciously. Taylor was a good friend but would always go overboard with her pranks, you were finally getting used to them though which seemed to make her pout. Pointing the box of cereal at her, you opened the box, springing out a fake snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor dodged it with a small grin,<br>\r\n\"Damn! You are getting good at this! I'm going to have to up the anti!\" She laughed, hopping over happily. <br>\r\n\"Please don't, your last big prank almost made me pass out\" You looked a little annoyed, pouring out your cereal. Taylor grinned, a sigh flooded from your mouth as you dumped your cereal in the bin, \"What was in the cereal...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor swung her arms harmlessly \"Uh- might of been like... some ghost pepper\" She innocently spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was always like this, it used to get to you but her odd pranks actually started to make life interesting and she always secretly had your back. As shown by her putting the emergency milk on the counter. You actually managed to avoid her pranks for the past two months, she was like an open book to you and you were confident that you could avoid her pranks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you made what would be the worst idea you've ever made. You bet that you could go a week avoiding her pranks and you were about to win. Obviously there were some rules, she couldn't just run over and toss water over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few days went pretty well. Taylor was too calm for her standards only ocasionally trying to prank you with a whoopie cushion or drink that you refused to take. It was almost friday and you could already taste the victory over your friend. Taylor helped your family to organize the flea market that would be running om the weekend. You of course had an eye over taylor not  wanting to get pranked. After a little while your sister approached you holding a bottle of coke im both hands. \"You want one bro?\" She said stretching her right arm out towards you. You looked towards taylor as she glanced over to you two and smirked. \"No thank you sis i will rather drink my water\" you replied as you reached out for your cup of fresh cold water. You couldnt taste any suspicious liquid in it so you thought you were safe. You went back into your room as you suddenly broke down in your room. After you woke up you were...</span></div></div>",

She was standing weird, right above you so you could saw under her rock shes wearing. You felt very uncomfortable but you couldnt look somewhere else. \"Hm my bro surely doesn't need everything that is in here\" she said as she started taking things from your room. She took things that were very close to you like your console, your favorite shirt and more. You tried to yell that she should stop, but she doesn't hear you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the box was full she was about to leave but then she looked straight at you. Only now you realised how small you actually were. Her hand grabbed you as you got put into the box. She made her way to her car as she puts her stuff she would in it and drove off. You started to panic as you didnt know what the hell is happening. After what seems to be hours your sister arrived at the flea market. She already had her area ready to go. She took the items on the table. She put you in a bowel with the label \"1$\" above it and moved on. You looked around seeing multiple socks, underwear and bras in them. Slowly you noticed whats going on.\"am i...socks?\" You thought to yourself as suddenly a person stood next to you</span></div></div>",

You went down seeing your sister carrying old things from her around. \"Good morning sis! Today is our flea market dont forget to ask your friends if they can spare some stuff alright?\" <br>\r\n\"Sure sis i was already planning on going to alex today. I still gotta pay him back for the prank he did on me\" you responded as you left the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came up with a masterplan. You bought a transforming liquid from the store and with it the antidote. Your plan is it to mix it with a drink and give it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you arrived at alex you hugged him like always. He had black hair and was dressed like an eboy. <br>\r\n\"Im a bit thirsty could i have something to drink please\" you asked politely. Alex filled two cups with water. He puts them on the table and then he suddenly got a call. He walked away for a bit and it was the perfect timing to drop the liquid into his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he came back your phone started to ring. You also walked away only for the person to hang up again. Meanwhile alex switched the drinks as he was predicting a prank already. When you came back you started to drink your water till it was empty. \"So alex you found some stuff my sis could sell?\" You asked him. He went away and came back with a bag full with a couple of old clothes and brand new shoes. \"I bought them online but they were too small so i cant use them\" you grabbed the bag and said \"make sure to visit ou flea market maybe you can find something u like\" as you left the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrived home you didnt feel very well. You put the stuff on the table in the living room and suddenly you passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself laying on the floor as you turned into.</span></div></div>",
