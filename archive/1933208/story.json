Being an explorer he was blessed with the opportunity to see far and wide and find marvelous artifacts. Today was one of those days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glimpse of gold caught his eye and he stopped, turning to look in it's direction. There, lying in a clutter of grass was a small gold trinket. Curious the explorer walked over, his boots making light stepping sounds on the soft earth. The item looked unfamiliar and had a strange raven-like symbol on the front. Ezreal's curiosity got the better of him and he picked up, examining the object in his gloved hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a bright flash of light and the blond explorer found himself falling, as if a strong force had knocked him backwards. With a thud he landed on the ground, the amulet flying into the air. Before he could yell for help another bright flash blinded him and he found himself blacking out, his vision became blurry. Helplessly he mumbled a feeble cry before he was out cold. </span></div></div>",

His surroundings seemed unfamiliar, These ferns, why was there so many of them? Standing up he looked around. No wait, his surroundings were both familiar and yet somehow...distant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears of experience in the wilds led him to conclude what had happened quickly. He had shrunk, and right there in the middle of the woods no doubt. The ferns around him weren't ferns, they were blades of grass! As the explorer looked around, he estimated he was no more than a few inches tall, maybe four or five at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amulet that he had been examining earlier was nowhere to be found. The situation wasn't distressful to Ezreal - no, he was an explorer of Piltover. Something as...little...as this could be easily overcome. All he needed was some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trouble was, standing there, all tiny and shrunken in the grass wasn't exactly an ideal spot. To make matters worse, he was miles away from any civilization and had, as usual, neglected to tell anyone where he was going. His best bet was to hope someone, or something would come along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying his glove he was slightly dismayed to see it fizzle. Seemed like whatever source of magic he had before didn't apply when he was this size. He was going to have to figure something out quickly, or risk the sun setting and being out here in the dark.</span></div></div>",

Despite being barely the height of a blade of grass, he wasn't completely defenseless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, he had the summoner spell teleport. Despite being nowhere near the fields of justice he had brought the spell along anyway, just in case anything weird happened. Go figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing a sigh of relief the tiny explorer looked around one last time. Everything was so different from his new perspective. For one he felt like he was surrounded by a cornfield or something and off to the distance he could make out what was the clear blue sky and odd blurry green and brown shapes that he assumed were the \"real\" trees. No matter. He had faced more dangerous situations than this before! He was Ezreal! Grandmaster explorer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first, he was going to have to get some help. Quickly he pressed the familiar purple button on his glove and he was instantly surrounded by a glow of light. Ezreal wasn't sure exactly where he had programmed the teleport to go - if he had programmed it at all. Either way, he couldn't stay out here in the wild. A bird might mistake him for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ezreal felt like he was going to faint. It was so overpowering his eyes were watery and he found himself dizzy. Struggling, the tiny explorer tried to regain his senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his vision returned to him, the tiny blond looked around. Strange, this wasn't a familiar setting. Long white walls were abundant and he could see a tiled ceiling far far above his head. But then again, at his tiny size everything was unfamiliar. At least wherever he was, he was alone. There was no other sounds other than a soft dripping of the water from afar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, dripping water? Ezreal scanned his surroundings again and focused on a large white object seemingly attached to the wall. Hold on..he knew what that was. It was a sink! Just massively above his head. That's where the water was leaking from probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat meant he was in the institutes bathroom. No wonder the smell was so disgusting. Rubbing his eyes the tiny explorer looked at his immediate left and right. Just where in the bathroom was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sudden horror that engulfed his mind when Ezreal realized he was actually inside one of the bathroom's urinals was overwhelming. Frantically the tiny shrunken explorer looked around at the crystal white walls which surrounded him and then looked down at the massive manhole underneath his feet. It was so sick, he wanted to throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps approaching and Ezreal froze. He had assumed the bathroom was empty but it looked like it wouldn't remain that way for long. He could try to get help, but not while he was stuck in the urinal. That was just embarrassing. But the edges were so high, he couldn't figure out how he was going to crawl out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the Noxian assassin Talon was making his way into the bathroom. His dark cloak floated behind him as the man excused himself from the Institute of War temporarily to relieve himself. Casually he entered the room, pleased to find it empty and made his way to the urinal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did Ezreal could do nothing but look up in horror as the massive, god-like figure of Talon approached him, completely unaware that he was stuck inside the urinal. The dark haired man was humming a low tune and seemed to be distracted with something on the wall. A mirror perhaps. Ezreal tried to yell, but all that came out was squeaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he heard a zipping sound and looked up, mouth open as Talon unzipped his pants and pulled out his massive, soft dick. The giant man's body shadowed the urinal completely as he leaned in, his eyes not looking where he was aiming. Before Ezreal could gape any more a stream of hot, yellow fluid came pouring down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a waterfall. Talon held his dick with his hands and began peeing, splashing the urinal left and right. The tiny explorer inside had no luck as the hot liquid sprayed down, hitting him like rain. It seemed disgusting and he shielded his eyes, coughing and gagging at the scent. His entire body was wet from Talon's piss and he tried his best not to drink any of it - with failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe torrent seemed endless and soon Ezreal was hunching over, letting Talon's piss hit his back as he gasped for air. Then, as if his prayers were answered the stream stopped. Coughing the tiny explorer looked up, his clothes and hair soaked with the assassin's urine.</span></div></div>",

It seemed he was so tall that it was hard just to see a strand of his hair. Slowly, he moved his hand and tucked his massive dick back into its cage. With the other, he reached out to Ezreal and grabbed him. His hand was so big that he could fit inside his grasp just as easily as a mouse could. It was warm and he could feel the pulse of the giant in it. But it was pitch black. However, this was soon procured for wheb Ezreal positioned himslef, he could just see out the bottom of the slit between the middle and ring finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand was moving. The ground appeared only a blur for how far away Ezreal was. But then, the face of Talon could be seen. The hand opened and there he was. Ezreal sat on the palm of this massive hand and starred back into the eyes of his new master. With a grin, Talon closed his hand again, but this time around Ezreal's body so that his head protruded out the top just a little. He moved slowly down the front of Talon, his head being dragged down the Bulging muscles. First the pectoral muscles down the middle of the two and kept on going. Now he was getting dangerously low. Talons dick was now in sight as he was crammed down into the underware, his face being smushed up against his dick and his body curved around to under his massive sweaty balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light disappeared, all that was visible was a dismal amount if light that seeped through his cloths. It was now he realised just where he was. The giant legs moved and like clockwork Ezreal was rubbed aginst the half hard dick of Talon. There was little room their and thw smell of Talons must and the urine from before mixed to create a smell so utterly protuse, it made him feel sick. From time to time in his walking, Talon grabbed at his crotch, smushing Ezreal into diffrent positions against the cock. He slowly sank down so that Talons big firm balls where pressed against his face; the sweat oozed out abd before long he was wet with sweat and urine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEzreal decidee the only way to make Talon stop was pleasure his needs. He repositioned himslef so that he was pressed against the dick and held it in his hands. He pressed himself on the top of it and proceeded to grind himself back and forth, lubricated by the sweat from thw balls and the sweat on the dick. Talon was growing hard and so was Ezreal. He rubbed abd rubbed and turned himself around so that he could rub his face all over the dick's massive bell end. He licked and drooled and soon, he could feel how close talon was. He himself was close too, with all the pheromones and musk, and feel he could go any moment. Talons balls tightened and the spasoms of climax started and started Ezreals as well. A great eruption of hot sticky white liquid erupted from the dick, splashing around talon which lubricated him enough so slid down the dick, his face buried under the massive balls so hard against the crotch and so swollen from the excitement. Ezreal also climaxed but not nearly as much as his master. He was now stuck in a wet and sticky mess and feared that if Talon sat down, e would be crushed beneath his balls or perhaps drown from all the cum that had soaked into the underware. </span></div></div>",

Opening his eyes Ezreal was surprised to be greeted by complete darkness. How strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he couldn't see, the explorer felt a sense of claustrophobia. Wherever he was it was a small enclosed space. Reaching out he was dismayed to feel nothing. Where was he? Had the teleport function messed up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh wait, right! He had his glove! Eagerly the explorer turned on his glove, emitting a bright beam of blue light to his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he looked around he was in a state of utter shock. He area which enclosed him was a strange, semi transparent thick wall. It surrounded him in a circular way and the tiny explorer seemed to be trapped inside the dome. Curiously he walked up to a wall and pressed on it. Strange, it wasn't solid, but rather a strange soft plastic feeling. And the smell...there was a strange rubbery smell around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around the blond noticed what looked to be an entrance or exit of some sorts. Two sides of the weird plastic was pressed together in what seemed like held an opening. Walking up Ezreal examined the area. The plastic was too hard for him to push aside but he was sure there was a hole here, just covered up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly an idea struck him. And it was horrifying. The teleport device had malfunctioned. He hadn't teleported to somewhere safe. No..Ezreal spun around. The plastic. He realized what it was. There wasn't walls around him. The small enclosed space he was in wasn't some box. It was...it was a fuck toy. A flesh light. The entrance...oh my god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny explorer felt like he would hurl. How, how did he end up in something like this. It was disgusting. He couldn't breathe. He needed to get out. Fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if someone heard his thoughts, there was a rapid shaking motion, like an earthquake. Ezreal yelled as he fell over, stumbling against the soft squishy plastic. Oh no. What was going on? He thought he could hear a voice. Fuck. No. Shit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone was going to use the toy with him inside.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't get out in time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Lucian was eagerly pulling his thick cock out of his pants. After a long day on the fields of justice, the gunslinger was ready to relax and have a night off. With one hand he stroked himself and the other was lifting up his fleshlight and aiming the entrance over the tip of his head. He had no idea that Ezreal was trapped inside. All he wanted to do was get off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entrance was soft and squishy and Lucian moaned when he began slipping his cock inside, the head first penetrating the hole before pushing the rest of it in. The fleshlight was turned almost upside down as Lucian entered and inside Ezreal was screaming, his glove light having gone out when he tumbled. The next thing he knew a warm, massive monster had entered the premise and was coming straight for him. Fumbling the tiny explorer found himself falling against the warm cockhead, feeling the sticky precum which was leaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucian shivered when Ezreal fell. Oh man fuck, this was such a good feeling. With force he shoved the toy down on his massive erection. The fleshlight squeezed his cock tightly and firmly and there was a strange stimulating bump within it. Lucian began moaning as he started thrusting into it, both his hands holding the fleshlight in place as his hips rocked back and forth. Inside Ezreal was screaming as he was smashed repeatedly by the massive gigantic organ. Lucian's dick was so big that it took up all the space inside and he had nowhere to go other than being pressed against the monster and the sticky, squishy walls. It was torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEzreal was afraid. His tiny body tried to fight off the incoming dick but it was no use. Lucian was fucking the toy too hard and he couldn't do anything at his tiny size. Ezreal closed his eyes instead. Oh god no. He was going to drown in here. Lucian was going to smash his body to pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucian trembled and let out a big grunt as his hips quickened, thrusting his dick into the toy faster and faster, unknowingly slamming it against Ezreal's tiny body each time. Ezreal was weeping and he couldn't fight back. He prayed his bones stayed intact. He knew what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more desperate friction seeking, Lucian pushed hard into the toy and felt himself filled with heat. With a loud moan the gunslinger came, hot sticky cum gushing out of his pulsating dick and filling the flesh light. Ripples of his cum leaked out as well, sliding down his giant black snake and dripping onto the ground. With his knees buckling and his body trembling Lucian rode out his orgasm as long as he could, repeatedly fucking the fleshlight, using his own cum as lube. Once, twice he came at least three times as his hot seed engulfed the toy completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping for air he fell back against his bed, the fleshlight still on his dick. Shit! That was so good, he had never had an orgasm like that before. Leaving the fleshlight on Lucian began dozing off to sleep, unaware of the tiny explorer that was trapped inside, flooded and choking on his cream. </span></div></div>",

First off, the room smelled like wood and hay and his surroundings were a mix of oak colors and brown things. In front of him was, a bed? The tiny explorer could be sure, but he thought it might have been since he could see white linen sheets layered above the giant stand. Wait a minute. He knew where this was. Sure he had never been in here but, yeah. This was definitely it. The high noon room, a room the institute designated for one special marksman when he had on his High Noon persona. But that meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted by a massive thud. Turning around the tiny Ezreal was shocked to see a gigantic cowboy boot slam down to his right, the leather footwear longer than his body and only a few inches away from where he was standing. The boot was curved towards the front and the ankle went all the way up, clasped together by buckles. Ezreal's eyes widened. Holy shit! This was Jhin's boot, and it alone was longer than his body. The tiny explorer could only stare momentarily, but like last time he was brought back by yet another massive thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around he saw what he expected. Jhin's other boot was in front of him, this time instead of flat on the ground, Jhin had it resting on it's heel, so the dark leathery bottom was high in the air. Ezreal once again was mesmerized, staring in awe at the massive figure, bigger than me was. The heel of the boot was on the ground but the rest of it was raised above his head. Had Ezreal been a bit more to his right and the boot had slammed down then-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explorer shook his head. This was no time to be thinking about this. Instead he dared himself to look directly up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowboy was staring back at him. His yellow googles focused on the shrunken explorer, his titanic body sitting on the bed, resting on his leather gloves. Ezreal felt like he was looking at a god, and from where he was, had to tilt his head all the way back just to see Jhin's cold, expressionless face, most of which was covered by his bandanna anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assassin marksman was looking down at the tiny man, trapped between his two boots. </span></div></div>",

The blond looked up, staring at the dark leather bottom, the large heel and the tip which curved above so high that Ezreal couldn't even see. Why couldn't be move? That was wrong with him. His brain told him to shift, blink to the side to avoid the impending danger, but something about seeing the huge boot above him, bigger than he was made him mesmerized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above Jhin was smirking, hovering his foot over the shrunken explorer for longer than needed. He lowered it slowly, so that Ezreal could get the whole show. Inside his High Noon pants his cock throbbed and grew multiple sizes and the cowboy couldn't hold back, quickly undoing his large round belt buckle and pulling his thick 7 inch cock out of his pants, stroking it as he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow Ezreal was finally able to get a grip. Seeing the massive boot start to descend the tiny explorer ran backwards, falling not once but twice as he tried to escape. First the heel of the boot hit the ground, just a few inches away from where Ezreal was. Then the boot started to descend, as if it was slowly flattening something underneath it. Ezreal could only half crawl half run as he escaped but it was no use. With sudden force Jhin slammed the boot down, pinned and instantly crushing Ezreal's legs midway. The tiny explorer screamed in pain as the rest of the boot was lowered, the curved tip high enough that it missed his vital organs. Now he was trapped underneath the massive boot with the heat of Jhin's foot radiating through the leather bottom. The smell of cowhide filled his nostrils and he screamed at the pain, his leg bones reduced to bits and pieces. His head was peeking out from the tip of the shoe and he could see everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above the giant was stroking his massive cock, rubbing his hands up and down the veiny monster, enjoying the immense power he got from crushing something so insignificant. Moaning and panting Jhin worked his dick with his leather gloves, going faster and faster, getting off from the screams he heard below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with a loud grunt he leaned forward, smashing the toe of his bot down, instantly crushing the tiny Ezreal underneath into a smear of red. At the same time he came, ribbons of sticky white shooting from his cock, landing on his cowboy boots and coating them with seed. He came multiple times, moaning and swearing as he did, aiming his head at his feet. Sticky strand splattered onto the dark leather and dripped off the edges, mixing with the red that remained from Ezreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a massive moan Jhin let go of his cock, squeezing the last drop onto the surface of his boot. Fuck that was hot.</span></div></div>",

He knew that some artifacts should have been left alone, but this was ridiculous. Something that small had been capable of taking him out for more than a few seconds. Either he wasn't as buff as he thought he was or he was dealing with powerful magic. Either way, Ezreal decided to call it a day. Pulling himself up off the ground he scanned the grass around him. The amulet was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResisting the urge to hunt further, he gave into his paranoia of being knocked out again and being found by ravaging Noxians. Even an expert like him knew when it was time to stop, head back, and maybe call up Heimer in the academy to see if they had heard of something similar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing himself off, Ezreal noticed something was a just bit off. For one, things weren't level with his line of sight like usual. A bush nearby that had been up to his waist seemed to only come up to his upper thigh. The explorer knew he didn't any vision problems so the only explanation was landing on the ground had hit him in the head a little too hard. Things didn't just get smaller, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up he saw that the Sun was towards east. He'd follow that back to the institute. Jayce was probably wondering where he was. Leaving the patchy, grassy area behind, he began walking, absentmindedly staring at the foliage around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings really did seem smaller.</span></div></div>",

He had his pets-the his voidlings, his magical orb, his portal device, his crystal glass and nothing seemed to ever fit right. The balance was always off. Even though it had been over a year since his induction into the League of Legends, he still had not fully come to terms with his accommodations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently the prophet sat down on his purple carpet and began to meditate. It was common practice for him on days he wasn't needed on the fields of justice. Meditation calmed him and helped distract from...the less savory things in life. Mainly he was speaking of that annoying Ezreal, who for some reason could never quite get enough of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes into things, a loud banging noise came from outside. Annoyed but unshaken the prophet merely dismissed it as another one of Garen's \"accidents\". However the noises continued to grow louder and louder and he soon found himself unable to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngrily Malzahar opened the door leading to the outside world and glared at whatever was in the hallway. As soon as he did a bright beam of yellow light struck him, knocking the prophet backwards. His vision became blurry and he soon found himself losing consciousness. No!

Leaning against the wall for support he told himself to breathe slowly. Whatever the light was it hadn't harmed him physically. Or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when it started. At first it was just a tingling feeling but it quickly grew into a strange sensation. Malzahar looked down at his purple pants and realized, all of a sudden that they felt oddly tight. The same could be said for his purple vest and scarf. His dark blue eyes peered down at his own body. Impossible! He looked...bigger? Yes! His chest muscles seemingly had suddenly become more defined. Although his clothes felt tighter they too had seemed to adjust to his new size. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could think Malzahar was hit by a sudden growth spurt. He first fell backwards, landing on the ground. As he pulled himself to a sitting position his legs suddenly shot outwards, both his feet hitting the walls across from him. The sudden pain caused him to swear and he pulled his scarf down. \"Shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll parts of his body seemed to be expanding rapidly. His arms were forced down as they grew, his muscles expanding as well as they became bigger and bigger. His legs had pushed past the hallway and were now pushing against separate entrances. His chest expanded and his back was forced against the wall as his head shot upwards at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalzahar couldn't control it. Suddenly his feet smashed through the doors, shooting out as they continued to expand. His arms followed suit, and smashed through the walls on either end of the hallway. His body expanded as well and he ducked but couldn't stop his head from smashing through the ceiling. Pieces of his purple clothing ripped around his expanding body and debris was falling all around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growing cloud of dust made it impossible to see and Malzahar closed his eyes as he continued to grow, his massive feet smashing through the walls of the building and his arms smashing through the exterior walls until they were outside. His head continued to go upwards rapidly, breaking through the second and third floors. Even his crotch had grown, breaking into the main hall as it continued to fill up space. Malzahar made an effort to yell, \"EVERYBODY OUT NOW!\" but he couldn't be sure if he was too late.</span></div></div>",

For someone of his status, to be zapped down by a silly laser. Ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalzahar rubbed his head and his eyes. Did things seem different? As he regained his senses he looked around. Had the beam transported him to somewhere else? His surroundings were unfamiliar. Where was his room? Where was the hallway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prophet leaned back against a solid surface. No wait....the hallway hadn't gone anywhere. Frantically Malzahar looked around. There was the door, there was the ceiling only...it was so far away. Scanning around he saw what was the gigantic form of a desk and a crest on the wall, miles above his head. He hadn't been transported somewhere, he had been shrunk! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd worst of all, he was left out in the hallway, only a few possibly inches tall with nobody around to call for help. His own powers were limited and at his size Malzahar doubted the void could even detect his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit...\" Leave to him to get himself situations like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his attention was diverted. Wait, could it be! Footsteps! Malzahar scrambled to his feet. The loud echos in the hallway sent vibrations through his body and he looked from side to side. Someone was coming. Thank Icathia. He could get some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the vibrations got louder and louder, Malzahar soon realized a problem. The loud sound of boots or shoes hitting the ground from not too far away were both a blessing and a trap. How could he, at this size get a giant regular person to notice him? Much less, avoid stepping on him like some pathetic little bug. But at the moment the tiny prophet had no time to think, because a large figure suddenly came into view. Malzahar looked forwards at the approaching giant and did his best to make out who it was.</span></div></div>",

The wanderer's sandals smacked the floor with force as he walked, his glance far from where he was stepping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Yasuo was a quite a bit away to Malzahar, the tiny shrunken prophet acted quickly.

Taking a deep breath he proceeded to make his way to the middle of the hallway and stood, well, floated his ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YASUO DOWN HERE!\" Malzahar waved his arms frantically as he watched the giant swordsman approach, his gigantic figure increasing as he did, his massive legs propelling the ronin forward.

It was a gigantic black boot, the kind you'd see in the army or on the troops. Malzahar could do nothing but stare at the sheer size of the footwear in front of him, the black laces dominating the front side, a thick ring of rubber coating the bottom and a shiny well polished toe inches from his face. Lying on the ground Malzahar found that the front toe of the boot just barely skimmed under his head in height. The thing must have been massive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere weren't many champions who wore this type of footwear. Looking up Malzahar followed a line of green camouflage, all the way up until his neck was pressed back almost painfully to see the massive face of Prince Jarvan, clean shaven with a goatee and dark rimmed sunglasses. The Prince was wearing his commando uniform, no doubt to appear on the fields soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time Malzahar had spent gaping at the giant of a man before him, a dark looming shadow began to form over his body. Upon realizing this the tiny prophet gasped as he watched in shock as Jarvan lifted his other leg high into the air, his camouflaged pants rising upwards carrying his other massive army boot as the Prince took his next step. For a moment the tiny shrunken prophet on the ground could only look up, speechless as the gigantic boot soared into the sky. He stared at the clean but ridged undersole, a pattern of black rubber that formed a shadow bigger than himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then like slow motion, the boot began to ascent. Malzahar's eyes opened wide. Jarvan's army boot was going to land right where he was. If he didn't move soon, he would be crushed underneath the giant's massive weight like a puny bug. Worst of all, Jarvan wouldn't even have known what he had did.  </span></div></div>",

He legs were the first to be crushed, the bones snapping like splinters of wood.

The strange thing was, the marksman stood completely still and Fate couldn't help but feel something was wrong. Especially with the grin on the other man's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the gold card stopped dead in the air and disappeared.

Come out here and face me like a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hardly got to complete the sentence though as a projectile came flying towards him, making his eyes water and his throat itch. Dammit!

Graves had always seemed to have a death wish out for him, even here on the fields. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as it turned out, nothing happened. As the smoke cleared Fate found himself alone. Graves had disappeared without a trace. Quickly the card master looked around. Why disengage? Fate had no backup, he was completely helpless and yet, Graves was nowhere to be seen. For that matter, neither was Yasuo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot easily fooled, Fate decided to looked around carefully, in case this was all just an elaborate trap. Taking a few careful steps, he walked towards the river bush where he assumed Yasuo had been not too long ago. In his hand he had another set of cards ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did however, Fate heard a strange sound. He stopped and looked around puzzled. Was someone calling out to him? Was it his team?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, he spotted something on the ground. Or rather, a bug maybe. Looking closer the card master's eyes widened. It was no bug. There, on the ground beside a small rock a few feet away was a tiny miniature version of Graves, waving his arms up at him, shouting. To Fate, Graves looked no bigger than an insect. An insect that would tower in the presence of a giant human like himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate grinned. So, lady luck had indeed been on his side.</span></div></div>",

The roles had been reserved. It was his time to call the shots.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe power was intoxicating. For a while Fate just stood still, with Graves frantically moving about in his shadow. The power, the idea that he could control another human being like this, decide his fate, his life...it was all so wonderful. As Fate thought about it more and more he could feel himself starting to harden. The idea was messing with his head and also his hormones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly the card master took a few steps forward until he was standing right in front of his shrunken foe, his body a massive titan compared to Graves. The outlaw had frozen in place upon seeing the giant Twisted Fate approach him, scared and helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his cowboy boots on either side of Graves' tiny body Fate slowly began fumbling with his belt, one hand reaching down to undo the it while his boots trapped Graves in place.

The cowboy's eyes were semi closed as he jerked it, partially looking at the tiny target spot on the ground and partially lost in fantasies in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Fate began to breathe irregularly as his cock stiffened even more. The red bulbous head forced downwards between his boots at the shrunken man. Instinctively he began to trust his hips back and forth, having his cock slide in and out of his hands. His jeans were now loosely around his waist, the front zipper completely open to make space for his dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began to speed up Fate opened his eyes fully and locked them once more at his target.

Imagine what he could do to Graves at his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fate's breathing became rapid his hands began furiously pumping aiming his head once again. Moaning the card master could barely keep his eyes open but he tried, furiously jerking himself in front of the tiny Graves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a load grunt he felt his orgasm come, his hands gripping his cock tightly as he came, streams of creamy white splattering onto the ground, on his boots and all over the tiny Graves. Fate's eyes closed shut as he rode out his orgasm, thrust again and again, releasing more and more semen as he did, completely making a mess of sticky white between his boots. He could no longer properly see Graves when he tried to sneak a peak halfway. All he could see was puddles and strands of his own ejaculate, decorating his boots and the ground between them. He figured Graves must have been covered with his jizz completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning and panting Fate reached the end of his climax, his massive cock beginning to soften in his hands. He looked down once more but didn't move his feet, enjoying the sight of what he had made. He spotted Graves finally, covered in his seed and struggling under sticky mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fu-ah-fuck. If I could do this every night...\"</span></div></div>",

For the last hour he had been preparing himself mentally for this...now it was time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation Talon threw the pill in his mouth and swallowed. What happened next was a mix of many things. First his vision became blurry, his senses became distorted. The next came the rapid sense of falling, as if the ground underneath him suddenly gave away. Within mere seconds his body shrank, the walls and doors around him growing to rapid, titanic heights. Luckily his clothing followed, leaving no trace that the assassin had ever been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the effects wore off, he rubbed his eyes and looked around. Wow! The pill actually worked. He was standing in the hallways of the institute which, plain as it was, still seemed like an endless void of walls and wooden doors at his tiny size. It took him a moment to take it all in and the tiny man leaned against a wall, peering around at the now unfamiliar place. There was a few things he noted right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, the cracks underneath the doors were small enough for him to lie down and slip under. Secondly, he had timed it just right so that most of the champions where in their rooms, signing off for the night in preparation for tomorrow's battles. Lastly, there was some oddly amplified sounds coming around the corner, the sound of boots striking the stone floor. And it wasn't just one, Talon guessed there was a least two people. That was no surprise, there was bound to be someone walking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking himself to make sure everything survived the shrinking (it did), Talon planned out his moves.

Lucky for him him the \"pig\" had provided him a means of getting up there. Yasuo's left leg had slipped off the bed and was now hanging off, inches from the ground. Talon avoided looking at the giant dirty foot as he jumped upwards, grabbing the edges of Yasuo's pants and began climbing, using the seams and creases to pull himself up. As he climbed he wondered what exactly he would do once he got to the top. The world was a different place to him at this size and Yasuo's massive body was like a whole new land. Besides, Talon doubted the drunken ronin would be waking up any time too, so the possibilities were endless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Talon was somewhat dismayed to find that he had only made it a little more than halfway up the leg.

As Talon pulled himself to a sitting position he viewed the vast expanse that was the sleeping Yasuo, his eyes landing on the tantalizing bulge around the ronin's crotch. He guy was always bragging about handing his sake, his sword and most importantly his women but was Yasuo really as gifted as he claimed to be? Talon felt a tinge of lust as he thought about it. Looking around he could see that the giant was still sleeping, both by the weird faces he was making and the constant ear shattering snoring. Although Talon was briefly distracted by the washboard abs that lay ahead of the bulge, he soon got his priorities in order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into Yasuo's pants wasn't hard, literally. The tiny assassin made his way across the massive leg and crawled underneath the blue fabric, finding himself suddenly encased by a dimly light atmosphere. Hugging the giant's leg Talon began to crawl upwards, fighting the mass of leg hairs and the constant weight of the fabric on his back. From the outside it looked like there was a mouse or something, crawling in Yasuo's pants in a form of a tiny bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Talon began to get heated and he took it as a sign that he was close. It was fairly dark inside Yasuo's pants but the fabric let in enough light to see where he was going. As Talon kept going he could notice a particular smell, a mix of sweat and manliness that often accompanied the most private parts of a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he had hit the jackpot. Crawling forward Talon found himself bumping into something. Pulling himself upwards against a loose part of fabric he stared at the massive cock that he had hit his head on. It seemed Yasuo liked to wear nothing underneath - a blessing in this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while the tiny assassin stared at the resting monster. It was a thick dark shape and very long, radiating heat. Talon was shocked at first, unable to comprehend the mere size of Yasuo's dick, especially in comparison to his tiny body.</span></div></div>",

At the first sound Talon had froze but when the snoring picked up again, he continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon began pressing his body against the shaft, grinding his own hips into the massive dick as he began rubbing himself all over. Pretty soon Yasuo's cock began to throb and harden, slowly inching up and creating a circus tent in his pants. Talon didn't stop, filled with lust he began to aggressively rub the massive erection up and down with his hands and the monster of a dick rose, like a monster searching for relief and an opening to escape the trapped fabric. The tent was forcing the head downwards slightly as if it was hunting for Talon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moan of pleasure that rocked through the giant's body and Talon picked up the pace, crawling and clinging onto Yasuo's cock. The monster was still rising, pressing painfully against the top of Yasuo's pants.

Yasuo's hand was moving in his sleep!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's right hand had moved down to his crotch and was stroking his member through the fabric of his pants. Inside Talon felt a sudden force press the giant cock down and he scrambled out of the way, falling backwards until he was facing the head of Yasuo's dick. Up above he could see the outline of the Ronin's hand, stroking himself in his sleep as Yasuo began babbling and moaning during his sexual dream. Talon's eyes widened as with just a few strokes, the organ got bigger and reached it's full, throbbing height, creating a massive tent that was so big, he could had stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, he was a little scared but also very turned on. He watched as Yasuo worked himself before pressing his dick downwards, despite the firm thick stance it had before. Talon's eyes widened. The cockhead became lower and lower and the moans outside became erratic and loud. Yasuo was aiming right for him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth dropped when Yasuo unexpectedly came in his sleep. The first volley smashed into Talon's tiny body, the head of the cock shooting right at him and coating him in the warm sticky substance. The second wave missed him directly but splattered around Yasuo's pants, forming wet sticky spots in the fabric. Talon was blinded by the ronin's cum and he found himself staggering as a third stream came, hitting his face directly, much of the oozy substance entering his mouth. He couldn't comprehend how much Yasuo came. It was like getting a full body facial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the giant's moans, grunts and instinctive buckling had sent Talon tumbling sideways, soaking in spunk. There was a sticky strand that connected him and the tip of Yasuo's bulbous red head which was only now starting to deflate. Talon tried his best to get the giant's cum out of his eyes but the entire area was soaked in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And now there they were, lying on a chair not too far from where he was standing. Yasuo's High Noon outfit mostly was simple, pleats, pants, a leather jacket, a cowboy hat he was sure belonged to Fate and a pair of brown cowboy boots with steel plating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing it made Talon light up like a little kid.

Most of it including the red cape lay in a bundle on the chair but the boots were on the ground, one standing upright and the other laying on its side.

For a while he stood still and admired the design; the rough leather exterior with extra layers for protection. Behind each one was a large sharp looking spur, each in the shape of a hexagonal star. Reaching out he touched the standing boot. The front toe went all the way up to his waist and he ran his hand over the surface, feeling the texture and running his fingers along the silver lining that decorated each layer.

The feeling was even further amplified by just how massive Pantheon's figure was, even tho he was still quite a bit off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Talon watched the two men exchanged a final blow and congratulated each other on the day's work. Now was his chance! All he had to do was go over and get Pantheon's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was distracted once again by another scene. Looking to his left he was surprised to find Braum, the massive barbarian that was the League's newest champion. Someone his size...it would surely be a challenge for the tiny Talon! Braum was a bit far though, swinging his massive shield left and right in an open field. Talon would have to risk running through it to each the other man.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No, what better way to prove the strength of Noxus than by besting the Artisan of War himself? Talon dashed over towards the two giants who were finishing up, what would have taken him seconds at his normal height took a full minute in his new diminutive form! Reaching Pantheon who was topless and wearing just his helmet, shorts and sandals, Talon cleared his throat and yelled at the top of his voice,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I Talon, the Blade's Shadow challenge you to a duel!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Pantheon didn't even look down, and before Talon could repeat himself, a deafening boom sounded as Xin spoke; Talon could only make out some of the words that filled his very being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">\"BET... COULDN'T... BEAT... PUSHUPS\"!</font><br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nShaken by the sheer power the volume gave the titan, Talon gave a hesitant step back before hearing terrifyingly loud laughter from Pantheon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">\"HA HA HA... CHALLENGE... ACCEPTED!\"</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the gigantic mass of Pantheon came falling down to where Talon stood, letting out a scream Talon flung himself to the ground and desperately raised his arms, hoping to stop the approaching wall of muscle, only to see it stop at well above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">\"READY... GO!\"</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice rumbled from all around Talon as Pantheon suddenly lowered himself just inches from Talon, only to raise up again. This terrifying ordeal continued as Talon realised what was going on; Pantheon and Xin were having a push-up contest! If Pantheon lost then this monstrosity of rising flesh would crush him to paste! Talon tried to stand up to escape from underneath Pantheon only to be knocked to the ground as Pantheon lowered himself to the ground again. There was no way he would escape in time! Talon was never a man of faith, but he prayed to any deity for Pantheon to win this contest as Pantheon's stance got lower and lower as he got more tired. Now he could feel Pantheon's abs gently press into him whenever he lowered himself, and Talon felt the sweat coat him as it dripped from its owner's pores. Just as Talon felt the abs began to crush him, a massive <b>THUD</b> sounded to his right and the body above him gave out a hearty laugh. Pantheon rose back to his titanic height and Talon gasped for fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">\"CLOSE... PERHAPS... TIME\"</font><br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nSuddenly Pantheon feet twisted to Talon's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">I'M... OFF... SHOWERS!\"</font><br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nSuddenly a massive <b>BANG</b> sounded as Pantheon rose a sandled foot and slammed it to the ground, he had taken a step towards Talon. The massive <b>BOOM</b> sent dirt flying into the air, along with Talon who let out a yell as he rose into the air. He gasped as he landed on hard surface it was oddly... warm? Looking up he saw a massive tanned pillar disappear into a strange black material. Suddenly he and whatever he was on flew into the air at high speed before falling back down, with a cry of horror Talon realised he was in between the toes of Pantheon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell was musky, and reminded Talon of the scent of a changing room, the smell of sweat. The flesh he was trapped in was horribly moist, that and the massive speeds he found himself going at made him want to vomit. He began pounding on the skin, trying to alert Pantheon to his presence. Strength of Noxus be damned, he wanted to shower for hours and forget this ever happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot stopped again, but was this just Pantheon stepping forward with his other foot, or did he finally get Pantheon's attention?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Pantheon once again raised his foot, Talon realised that Pantheon hadn't noticed him; he was simply too small, too puny for Pantheon to notice. Exhausted from his ordeal, Talon stopped struggling and resigned himself for now. He would have to wait for Pantheon to stop moving. As his nauseating ride continued, Talon looked over his captor. At his new size, Talon saw details he would never see normally, the dead skin coating the feet, the beads of sweat leaking from the skin, the dirt accumulated after a day of heavy exercise, if he was scientifically-minded he would be fascinated, instead it just reminded him of how weak he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scenery changed as Talon noticed white tiles and a steamy atmosphere. He immediately recognised it as the Men\u2019s Changing Room, and along with Pantheon\u2019s previous mention of \u201cShower\", Talon realised he might not have so much time after all. Suddenly Talon was flying much higher and his world shook as the foot came to a rest. Looking down he saw the brown of the wooden Changing Room benches, Pantheon was taking his sandals off. Leaping at the chance, Talon struggled against his foot captor, and pulling against the thick strands of sweat he crawled off the foot and onto the bench. He was exhausted from the effort but he was off just in time as the sandled foot lowered back to the ground. Gasping for breath, Talon didn't notice the now bare foot hovering over him as Pantheon moved to remove his other sandal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even time to gasp, Pantheon\u2019s foot slammed down onto Talon. The thick, calloused feet took his breath away as the pressure suddenly increased tenfold. Pantheon was crushing the life out of him. With his arms pressed to his sides, Talon began thrashing as best as he could, struggling to breathe as Pantheon unknowingly crushed him under tons of cheesy, sweaty foot flesh. With no other choice, Talon took a deep breath and nearly vomited as the pungent aroma overwhelmed him. As if to taunt him, Pantheon's foot twitched slightly, and as Pantheon removed his other boot, he twisted his other foot slightly. While only a short distance for Pantheon, for his tiny prisoner his world shifted as the pressure became unbearable. With the strong swivel force, Talon could hear a <b>POP</b> and cried out in pain as his shoulder dislocated. He could tell that his body would be badly bruised by tomorrow, that is if he even made it to tomorrow. With that sobering thought, Talon hissed in pain as the foot lifted off him, looking up to see Pantheon looming over him, looking like a deity imposing judgement on a subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising that this was his chance to notify Pantheon, Talon tried to leap up, but found himself stuck to the bench, held down by sweat which stuck him to the bench, further efforts to rise left him groaning in agony as he provoked his shoulder injury. Glancing up he saw the still looming giant suddenly move, the sheer size difference causing Pantheon to appear slow and sluggish, as the skyscraper sized titan moved above him. Talon watched as Pantheon hooked his thumbs (which were car sized to him) into his shorts and gasped as Pantheon slid the black shorts off, leaving only a pair of tight briefs on. Talon knew what was coming next, and couldn't muster up the heart to call for help anymore. What would Pantheon think if he noticed Talon now? That he was a massive pervert and creep? What if he just squished Talon in disgust? Hell he had almost done in a mere minute ago, completely unintentionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a massive shadow covered Talon, and he let out a scream as Pantheon almost crushed him again, Talon was reaching forward to attach the shorts to a hook, his brief-covered package almost making contact with Talon as he shuddered, that bulge was the size of a small town to him. A faint smell of musk lingered as Pantheon leaned back. Realising what was coming next, Talon tried to look away, but found himself unable to look away as Pantheon removed the final barrier to his manhood. As the briefs slid down, Pantheon's beast was freed, and Talon watched as it flopped down, swinging like a pendulum as Pantheon took off his briefs. It was at least 5 inches and this was flaccid! Pantheon's dirty jokes about his second deadly \"Spear\" haunted him, this beast was thicker and longer than Pantheon's favourite combat spear at his new perspective. Underneath the \"Spear\" lay two truck sized spheres, covered by a thick scrotum, as Pantheon's low hanging ball-sack swung in time with his dick. As Pantheon leaned forward again to hook his briefs up, the beast swung towards Talon like a dragon, just barely skimming Talon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pantheon turned around, Talon leaned back as far as possible, getting ready for Pantheon to leave for the showers; but to his shock Pantheon simply stood there with his ass facing him, the shaven muscular globes looming over him, and to Talon's horror he saw the two globes lower in slow motion, approaching him as Pantheon lowered himself onto the bench. Knowing how useless any attempt to contact Pantheon would be, Talon simply grimaced and took a deep breath, he had come this far, he would not die now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps fortunately, the two ass-cheeks just barely missed Talon, instead he looked up to see a massive scrotum fall upon him, mushing him into it as Pantheon adjusted himself for comfort. The soft skin of the scrotum enveloped Talon, as the hot, sweaty flesh covered him in the universal scent of musk. It was almost pitch black, with only dim glimpses of light reaching Talon. He could hear a distant <b>THUD THUD THUD</b> which was unmistakably the sound of Pantheon's strong heartbeat. A new noise emerged, as he could hear the muffled sound of voices, the only thing he could make out was Pantheon's godly voice emerging from all around him, the pitch was simply too low for him to make out any of the words. Whoever Pantheon was talking to, Talon prayed he would finish soon, he was quickly running out of breath and unlike the foot there was little air for him down here. However as half a minute passed, Talon gasped and involuntarily opened his mouth to breathe, but instead he found his mouth full with the disgusting scrotum flesh covered in musky sweat. Convulsing he struggled to breathe, but no air could enter his jammed mouth. Talon's convulsions slowed as he began to suffocate, his vision turning black as he realised that this would be his grave. But just before he could breathe, his world shook as Pantheon stood, with more power displayed than an earthquake, Talon's world was one of <b>BANGS</b> and confusion. Opening his eyes, he saw...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Opening his eyes, all Talon could see was the tanned flesh of Pantheon\u2019s scrotum. With immense pressure removed from his fragile body, Talon pulled his head away from the sticky embrace of the sweat covering Pantheon\u2019s balls and gasped for air. Colour returned to his vision as oxygen filled his lungs, Talon could feel his heart pounding as he tried to recover. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was the oxygen deprivation, but it felt as if the world was getting bigger! Strands of pubic hair were going from house sized to virtual cliffs, even worse Talon could see things that he couldn\u2019t before! Small holes formed underneath him, they seemed to be oozing liquid of some kind, even with his lackluster biology knowledge Talon realised he was staring at sweat pores, but this made no sense! The potion should have shrunk him to 4 inches exactly, Darius made sure of that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what Darius did not account for was the massively increased heart-rate giving the potion an even more potent effect, to Talon\u2019s horror he dwindled further and further in size, barely visible sweat pores transformed into golf ball sized holes. What felt like hours was only a couple of seconds as Talon finally stopped dwindling in size and looked to see those previously miniscule pores had now transformed into plate sized holes. He couldn\u2019t be any larger than half a millimeter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a world-shaking THUD, Pantheon took his first step towards the showers. What was a short, uneventful walk for Pantheon was a scene for Talon that would not be out of place in the apocalypse. At his small size all of Pantheon\u2019s movements seemed slow and drawn out, whenever Pantheon\u2019s feet hit the ground a shockwave of energy rippled up through the leg, unnoticeable to anyone but Talon. The constant movement of Pantheon caused a light sway of his balls, a very slight movement; but to Pantheon\u2019s tiny prisoner the movements reminded him of an intense thrill ride. The massive g-forces pressing on his body made it seem as if Pantheon\u2019s balls were trying to take him back again and smother him against them, Talon knew it was ridiculous to personify an inanimate body part but the sheer power and dominance it displayed over him made it difficult not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Talon was just a couple of swings away from vomiting he came to an abrupt stop. Pantheon had arrived at the showers. Talon realised that if he was stuck to Pantheon while he showered, he would be placing himself in mortal danger; he had already dodged death no less than five times today, he did not want to make that six. Talon had one last resort, he still had a dagger in his pocket, the one he had planned to use to duel Pantheon with. Talon face contorted into a gritted smile, it seemed he would draw blood against Pantheon after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon unsheathed his dagger, the plan was to stab Pantheon and force him to examine his balls, yes this would undoubtedly be one of the most humiliating experiences of Talon\u2019s life and he would never be able to look Pantheon in the eyes again, but anything was better than being drowned to death while Pantheon took a relaxing shower! Adjusting the dagger, Talon calculated where the thinnest layer of skin around him would be, one sharp stab would be enough to get this God\u2019s\u2014 Talon almost choked as he realised what he just thought, this ended now, with a cry Talon slammed the dagger into the skin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his hands suddenly stopped several inches short of where they should be, Talon looked at his blade. Not only had he failed to penetrate the layer of skin in the slightest, but when he lifted his dagger he saw the edge of the blade was warped and bent. This couldn\u2019t be happening, this was one of his finest blades, he had practically spent all of the previous night sharpening this and preparing himself for the duel. With broken desperation, Talon took his now useless blade and hit the flesh over and over again, surely even a god-like figure like Pantheon had to feel this, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPantheon could not wait for his shower, following his spar with Xin Zhao and subsequent victory over him in their little push-up contest his body was practically soaked with the sweat from a day of hard work. Entering the shower he was pleased to find it empty, today was a day off for most champions, and most of his fellow champions chose to spend it off the Institute, which would explain the almost ghost-town atmosphere of what was typically a very packed room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pantheon dropped a sponge onto the shower floor and grabbed a soap bar to begin lathering, he felt the faintest of itches on his ball. It was so small he simply absent-mindedly lowered a hand to give the area a small itch, more of a rub really. With the sensation gone, Pantheon with one turn of a knob turned on the shower, and lost himself in the relaxing sensation of the shower as he hummed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive shadow draped over Talon. By the Gods, he had done it, Pantheon was investigating the feeling, he was saved! As Talon turned to see his salvation approaching, he was unnerved to see a massive obelisk of flesh fast approaching. At his small-size this mere finger transformed into a skyscraper of encroaching doom. Talon tried to calm himself, Pantheon was just here to pick him off and take him to safety, right? But suddenly he watched as the skyscraper lowered and the house-sized nail dug into the sweaty flesh of Pantheon\u2019s balls. Unlike with his dagger the flesh gave way under it and at Talon\u2019s miniscule size he could see layers of dead skin flake off as it was ripped away by the sheer power of Pantheon\u2019s digit. This same digit was slowly approaching him, leaving a trail of destruction in its path as it destroyed the dead skin to allow new skin to flourish beneath. A simple process, one that is carried out thousands of time a day on everyone\u2019s body. But this same process threatened to kill Talon right now, if he didn\u2019t get out of the way, he\u2019d join the flakes of dead skin falling from Pantheon\u2019s balls, forgotten and discarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe digit was simply too wide for Talon to ever run out of its way, and there was no way he was going to outrun it. Even at his slow perception of time the approaching steamroller of a finger was simply too massive to even conceive avoiding it. With only one option left, Talon struggled against the last remnants of sweat binding him to musky scrotum of Pantheon. As the God of Destruction that was Pantheon\u2019s nail came closer his struggles became more and more desperate, until the slightest shift of Pantheon\u2019s ball allowed the last strand of sweat to break, leaving Talon to begin free-falling towards the ground.<br>\r\nAs Talon began his descent, he looked around for anything to land on. All he could see for miles was the hard tile of the shower floor, where landing would turn him into a tiny, bloody stain right before he was washed away with the flow from the showers. All around him the titanic God Pantheon finished itching, and Talon looked on in horror as Pantheon\u2019s slow movements continued as he grabbed two massive objects in his hands, which just seconds ago had threatened to end his existence. A meteor appeared, falling from the sky onto the ground, it was a yellow object that seemed to contain many holes in it. Talon was reminded of the sweat pores he saw on Pantheon, but these holes were much larger and Talon could probably live in a single one of the holes. Talon realised what he was staring at, an ordinary sponge that Pantheon carelessly dropped to the floor. With 30 seconds till he hit the floor, Talon knew what he had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngling himself towards the mountain sized cleaning instrument, Talon closed his eyes five seconds before landing and braced himself. He felt himself slam into the sponge and thanked the Gods that he had relentlessly practiced how to handle falls before. He felt all the air leave his body as he ended his fall face first in the sponge. Looking up he opened his eyes to find himself lying in one of the many holes in the sponge. All around him walls that were 10ft high made of light spongy material surrounded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to get out of this sponge right now, before Pantheon inevitably began to scrub himself down.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Talon tried to scramble up the walls of the sponge, he was a master assassin, he had climbed tougher walls before, this was nothing! But four feet up he put too much weight on his dislocated arm and groaned in pain as he lost his grip, letting out a yelp as he fell off the wall and back into the sponge surface. As he landed on the floor a sharp pain struck his foot and he looked at it to find he had twisted his ankle. He was in no condition to climb!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon was never one to panic, his \u201ccareer\u201d if one could call it that often lead him to spend most of his times behind enemy lines, where a single mistake could lead to him being captured and tortured. Over time he steeled himself, strength is power in Noxus after all and Talon was the strongest person he knew. But now as he looked up to see this immense being - this God standing at full height he knew that any delusions he had of him having any control over this situation was gone. This God, who was so tall that Pantheon couldn\u2019t even see his helmet as it was simply too high, would decide his fate, and would do so without even knowing of Talon\u2019s existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a single flex of his muscles, the Deity turned on the shower. A massive <b>BOOM </b>sounded as oceans of water poured out of the single shower head. Talon watched as the God wet the soap bar and by lifting his foot up, the shower began. Talon saw the soap bar be rubbed forward and backwards through Pantheon\u2019s toes, a lather forming up as the friction increased. Talon watched as Pantheon\u2019s muscles flexed, biceps curled as the soap bar was rubbed across his body, abs flexed as Pantheon reached around and pecs were on display as Pantheon leaned to gain leverage. The very definition of masculinity loomed over him, and Talon could not help but be reminded of various dancers, putting on a show for their audience, but this was no dance. Talon was just some speck, something less than a bug that gazed upon this omnipotent being who could crush him and not care in the slightest. Even now the specks of dirt Pantheon washed off him had more value than Talon, at least Pantheon acknowledged their existence and took steps to remove them, Talon would likely die to Pantheon and never be found. Perhaps his speck of a body would stay stuck on Pantheon until his next shower, before it was washed away and sunk into the sewers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon knew he should be trying to escape but at this point with a dislocated shoulder and twisted ankle, he knew any further attempts would only hurt him further, better to bide his time. Talon realised at this point there was no point in trying to contact Pantheon, he was simply too small and Pantheon would never notice a miniscule being such as him. No, better to escape and find somewhere safe to hide until the potions effects wore off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a <b>SLAM </b>Talon regained his focus and looked up to see the soap bar had been dropped onto the floor. Looking back to the God, Talon saw Pantheon staring directly at him! Hope blossomed in his chest, and as Pantheon\u2019s hand reached down making a direct course for him. Never had Pantheon looked more like a God than now, crouched down with muscles flexed, water running down his bare chest highlighting his contours and tanned skin, his very \u201cmasculinity\u201d looming over this tiny speck, with Pantheon\u2019s very \u201cspear\u201d now being skyscraper sized to the millimeter Talon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Pantheon\u2019s hand did not move to pick up Talon. Darkness covered Talon as Pantheon\u2019s hand grasped all around him. Suddenly he felt himself lifted upwards at great speed. For Talon miles of distance were covered in a mere three seconds as Pantheon lifted the sponge up. It was at this point Talon realised that Pantheon had not seen him, but had seen merely the sponge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Talon was swimming, as Pantheon held the sponge under the shower head, Talon was completely soaked and struggled to breathe as literally a sea\u2019s worth of ocean from his perspective was dumped all around him. After a terrifying ten seconds Talon was pulled away and he gasped for breath. Out of nowhere the walls closed in, and Talon felt an agonising burst of pressure forced onto him. Had it not been for the fact he was surrounded by soft walls that contained many air pockets he would have been a small stain on the inside of the sponge. As Pantheon squeezed excess water out of the sponge Talon struggled to tell which way was up as the sponge was twisted and turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again a rapid movement occured and Talon was flung downwards (at least where he thought down was), opening his eyes Talon saw an approaching wall of flesh, it took him seconds to recognise the surface of Pantheon\u2019s sole, his previous captor and a being with immense power that had nearly killed him twice. With suds and lather covering it, Talon realised his position far too late to even let out a scream as he was pressed into the musky flesh of Pantheon\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon lets out a yelp as the sponge with him on is roughly rubbed into the foot, Talon is scrubbed between the toes, small pieces of lint that are full-sized people to Talon are smushed and washed away by the sponge. Talon can\u2019t help but shudder, just over ten minutes ago he was exactly where the lint was now, it could have been him being crushed and washed away. Rough patches of calluses cover parts of Pantheon\u2019s feet, showing just how much use his feet had seen. The sponge was rubbed very attentively onto these parts, and as far back as Talon tried to lean rough patches of skin scratched him, giving him scratches from where direct contact was made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Pantheon was done with the feet, he moved onto the legs. Once again Talon was dunked under the shower head, but by then he had expected it and emerged unscathed except for a few splutters. Talon was scrubbed all over Pantheon\u2019s calves and knees, feeling the sheer mass of muscle he was rubbed onto, Pantheon moved his legs to get a better angle and Talon could feel the muscle contort around him, the warm flesh almost embracing him as they shifted. When Talon was scrubbed against the Deity\u2019s inner thighs, he could immediately smell a strong, potent smell which he had already encountered far too often today, musk was wiped off from Pantheon\u2019s body and instead coated Talon. Unbeknownst to Pantheon, he was marking Talon with his musk, designating him as his property. As Talon was moved upwards, he looked on in horror as he approached Pantheon\u2019s most sensitive body part and the very statement of his masculinity, Pantheon\u2019s spear flew towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sponge was delicately wiped along Pantheon\u2019s dick, if the scent of musk was strong before it was overwhelming now, Talon could barely breathe due to the extremely strong odor. Talon was forced to press against the appendage, shuddering as it made contact with him. He couldn\u2019t help but compare this massive serpent to that Baron Nashor, though at his current size Pantheons \u201cSpear\u201d was triple the size of the Baron and unlike on the Rift, if this monster killed him there would be no second chances. Talon could feel Pantheon\u2019s thumb right behind him and he let out a shout as the head of the beast approached, he shuddered as he was pressed right into the slit, a horrible slime that Talon could only guess the contents of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gentle ministrations on the head caused blood to rush to the area, Talon gasped as the beast seemingly rose as if from a deep sleep, looking for the tiny speck that dared disturb it. Luckily the sponge pulled away and after another dunk that washed off whatever the slime that coated Talon was, Talon was sent towards the abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sponge moved upwards, and Talon was faced with the mighty pecs of Pantheon. The sheer size of the slabs of muscles shocked Talon and as he was pressed deep into them he felt the firmness of the muscle that threatened to squish him between them. The nipples were taut from the water, and as Talon was pressed into them he desperately tried to struggle back into the sponge but as his hand was pressed against the hard nipple an audible <b>CRACK </b>could be heard as Talon\u2019s hand snapped against the pressure. Talon let out a cry of agony as he clutched his broken hand, he couldn\u2019t take this anymore, \u201cMight of Noxus\u201d be damned he wanted out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the sponge made its final stop. Looking ahead all Talon could make out was a forest of hair was rapidly approaching, steeling himself for the final test of endurance, the forest of hair grabbed Talon within its vines. Talon felt himself tugged from the sponge as the strands of hair stuck to him, sweat forming new bonds as it tied him to his new prison. The sponge continued to soak the armpit, causing Talon\u2019s world to shake as the armpits were wiped \u201cclean\u201d. Looking forward Talon was horrified to see the sponge leave without him, he was trapped in these pits! The aroma of sweat was by no means gone and he founded himself coated in the pungent smell. Suddenly the world began to get dark and Talon looks up to see Pantheon\u2019s underarm rapidly approaching. Talon lets out a scream that is cut off as the arm lowers sealing Talon in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon can\u2019t breathe, the pressure is intense, the sweat is practically drowning him. In desperation he bites down, his mouth fills with sweat and he chokes, being forced to swallow it down. Suddenly light returns to Talon\u2019s world and he opens his eyes to see his previous doombringers return, the giant flesh obelisks that are Pantheon\u2019s fingers. Combing through the armpits they seem to be searching for something, realising this might be his salvation, Talon struggles to free himself from the hairs, but their grip is like iron. The fingers push through the hairs, like a machete through tall grass as the fingers move his way...</span></div></div>",

The sheer strength of the finger easily pulled Talon off the hairs, like a hot knife through butter. Once again massive g-forces leave Talon reeling, stuck to the finger. Eyes scrunched shut, Talon gasped for breath. Opening his eyes, Talon was faced with a terrifying sight, two red orbs, hidden in a pitch black opening within a mask, staring directly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cWHAT THE\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</b></font><br>\r\nA voice, emerged from the heavens as Pantheon murmured underneath his breath. Talon\u2019s eyes widened, as the winds from Pantheon\u2019s speech buffered against him. He was saved, Talon had never been happier in his life, his voice quivered, but he yelled as loud as he could: \u201cPantheon thank God! It\u2019s Talon, I know this is weird but please hear me out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly the two red eyes seemed to shrink, and a chill went down Talon\u2019s back as Pantheon seemed to glare at him, suddenly a booming voice emerged as Pantheon\u2019s voice raised to a normal volume for the Deity:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cDISGUSTING LITTLE PEST, YOUR KIND ARE PRIVILEGED TO DIE AT MY FEET\u201d<br>\r\n</b></font><br>\r\nTalon shrieked in agony as his eardrums burst, it was too loud, he fell to his knees writhing in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cLET'S TEST YOUR \u201cMETAL\u201d LITTLE INSECT!\u201d<br>\r\n</b></font><br>\r\nTalon had finally been tormented enough, he broke down into sobs and desperately tried to contact Pantheon, \u201cPantheon please! You have to see it\u2019s me! I was going to duel you and prove my strength, please see me!\u201d. Pantheon merely walked to the changing room, not caring for the whiplash the tiny Talon was undergoing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Talon flew down as Pantheon\u2019s finger lowered to the ground level, just ahead he could see a very familiar sight, two sandals with a strong scent of sweat emanating from them. This was, surely Pantheon wasn\u2019t\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cHERE\u2019S A CHALLENGE, SURVIVE FOR FIVE MINUTES AND YOU\u2019RE FREE TO GO!\u201d<br>\r\n</b></font><br>\r\nTalon was flying as Pantheon pushed the supposed \u201cinsect\u201d into the sandal\u2019s toe post, the sheer pressure the fingers exerted on him was unbearable and if he survived this he\u2019d be left with heavy bruising\u2026 if\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cGOOD LUCK LITTLE VERMIN!\u201d<br>\r\n</b></font><br>\r\nPantheon gave a short laugh then shoved his feet into the sandals, not a single care given for the tiny insect inside. Talon was at least somewhat protected in the toe post, but with his face up position he stared at the approaching foot, and though he tried to move he found he could not, with horror he realised that Pantheon had stuck him to the sandal with sweat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot stopped just short of his feet, with only a centimeter between Pantheon\u2019s toe arch and Talon\u2019s lower body, Talon thanked the Gods for their mercy. Without a warning Pantheon began walking and to Talon\u2019s horror the sheer force of Pantheon\u2019s steps caused Talon to slowly side down, down to the crusher that was Pantheon\u2019s foot. Talon desperately struggled he looked up trying to see if Pantheon was looking at him but Pantheon was completely focused on something else and his helmet was distant and blurry from its great height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened when he was four minutes in, he slid one micrometer too far and Talon screamed in pain as his feet disappeared under Pantheon\u2019s foot, and when the foot rose to take another step Talon saw what remained, two bloody layers of gore, he would never walk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next step took his legs, those same legs that Talon jumped over walls with, gone under Pantheon\u2019s feet with bloody shreds remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes passed and Talon was sobbing in pain, he had won, but with nothing below his waist intact. Any second now Pantheon would stop. But he didn\u2019t. Talon was confused, Pantheon had promised!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a tiny insect was the last thing on Pantheon\u2019s mind right now, he had more pressing concerns, like the fact the sun was particularly bright today which irritated his eyes. Walking to his room Pantheon completely forget about that disgusting little bug, and why shouldn\u2019t he? Who would care about some pathetic vermin? He was doing the world a favour by getting rid of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon could laugh, all of this just to prove his \u201cNoxian might\u201d and for what? Talon never did complete that thought, as just before he could he slipped down again leaving his body fully under Pantheon's foot. The foot slammed down, the first thing to break was his ribs as they cracked and pierced his inner organs. Then his upper body was pressed into a single layer of flesh, joining the bloody remains of his lower half. Blood seeped and coated the area between Pantheon's toes. The last thing to go was Talon\u2019s head, which had a brief moment to recognise his death, before it was squished under foot. The last thing Talon would ever see would be the sweaty sole of Pantheon as he unknowingly put the tiny Talon out of his misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo evidence would be left behind, Talon\u2019s remains would be lost among the lint covering Pantheon's feet and the bloodstains on Pantheon\u2019s toes washed away within the hour as fresh sweat droplets cleaned up any gore on the foot..</span></div></div>",

Memory told him the room belonged to Ezreal, who on weekends like this usually lounged around with his TPA outfit on instead of his formal battle gear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way across the hallway was easy, since well, nobody was around at this hour. If Talon had been caught out at this size, who knows what might happen. Dangerous giants roamed his world now and one wrong step could mean the end of him. Luckily being a trained assassin mean he could avoid most dangers, but he still had to be on his guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he did reach Ezreal's room, another obstacle stood in his path. The large wooden door leading into the explorer's place was closed and Talon was far, far, far from being able to reach the handle. Inspecting underneath he was dismayed to find that the bottom bit of the door had only enough room to fit maybe a toothpick in. The room seemed to be sealed shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing his ears against the door, Talon heard that sound again. It sounded sort of like a rusty screw or spring. Who knows what was going on in there! Talon was determined to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around he was pleased to see a small crack in the wall just to his right. It seemed like the institute's building was a lot older than he thought. The crack wasn't quite big enough for him to walk through, but he could see the light that shone out from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering his strength and then with all his force Talon slammed his body at the crack, hoping to break it just a bit more to get through. His first few attempts proved futile, as being barely more than a few inches tall meant he was too weak to do much. However with his fifth attempt the wall gave in and he crashed through the wall, finding it hollow on the inside before tumbling through, rolling forward as he did. Quickly the assassin stabilized himself, landing on his feet first. Success! He was inside! Quickly as the small dust cloud that he had created disappeared he looked around around at his new surroundings. </span></div></div>",

Coming out of the mouse-like hole he had created in the wall Talon was immediately greeted by the gigantic form of Ezreal's sneaker crashing down inches from where he was. The giant shoe was nearly twice the size of his body and the impact it made with the ground sent him flying backwards, hitting the wall roughly. Pulling himself up he could see that the danger wasn't over yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny assassin watched in horror as the giant sneaker with the Tpa logo raise up over him, forming a dark shadow over his body. Looking up he could see the underside of the shoe, the zigzag pattern looming over him. Frantically he looked around. Shit, it couldn't end like this! Crushed underneath Ezreal's feet without anyone knowing. Luckily for him though the shadow shifted and once again Talon was knocked backwards as the giant sneaker smashed down in front of him. He caught a glimpse of it as it did. The shoes looked brand new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping for air he pressed himself against the wall. That was too close for comfort.

His eyes widened however when he saw Ezreal bend over slightly, one hand reaching out. Instinctively he began to run but it was no use. Ezreal snatched the shrunken man up, grabbing him around his body before lifting him closer to his face. Talon's vision was a blue of blue, white and red, the colors of Ezreal's tpa jacket and pants before it was replaced by the explorer's giant grinning face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey! Don't struggle.\" Ezreal's tone was cocky and he watched almost gleefully as the tiny Talon wriggled this way and that, trying to break out of the grip Ezreal had on him. Before Talon had been so scary on the fields. But now, it was Ezreal who had the upper hand. Literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. You thought you could sneak in here undetected?

Soon Talon found himself completely covered in the sticky warm goo, some of it getting in his mouth, making him gasp unfavorably for air.

The Artisan of War didn't care. When he was on the fields he was a blood thirsty warrior, cutting down the heads of his enemies with no remorse. However outside of the fields, he was something else. He was a baker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot many people knew about his \"other life\". Most people just assumed he lived in a marble palace with a big hole on the ground he could kick people into. Secretly though, he had been exchanging recipes with Morgana and Caitlyn and had a private workshop in the back of his studio for baking goods. Of course, not everything he made tasted good, or was even edible really but if he wanted someone to eat it, they would eat it. Nobody could say no to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, he was dressed differently. Of course, he still had his helmet on - that was the number one rule but he had swapped out his breastplate and greaves for a baker's apron. Underneath he wasn't...exactly wearing anything else but it didn't matter. The oven was hot and standing around it meant it better not to wear too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time he experimenting with something new. Mega Ultra Tasty cookies, a recipe he had borrowed from Caitlyn who got it from Lulu. As he used his oven mitt to pull the baking tray out of the wood burning oven, he was extremely pleased with the results. Cute, pink chewy looking cookies on a platter. Absolutely scrumptious. Parthenon couldn't wait to share them with everyone! </span></div></div>",

When he was a young child he remember his master speaking of such a potion, of it's powers and dangers. After some research with the dark sovereign Syndra, Zed had come to conclude the \"poison\" was actually a brew made by the elders of Ionia to give anyone immense power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecifically it was a size potion. The user of it would grow to titanic heights, towering over buildings and human beings. It was the perfect revenge on Ionia and all those who had wronged him in his past. Unfortunately the liquid was in a heavily secluded cave deep within the Ionian monastery. Zed had dressed in white to avoid detection but it still had been a difficult journey, having been nearly spotted by both Irelia and a visiting Xin Zhao. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, it was his. The power, the immense power that came with being a giant, all within his grasp. Too long had he been looked down upon, shunned by his home by his choices in the dark arts. But now they would pay, with fear and with blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninja slowly removed the vial and looked at the dark red liquid. Without a second thought he pulled down his mask, uncorked the potion and poured it down his throat. Quickly afterwards he bounded out of the cave, shifting left and right with his shadows. If he was going to grow into a giant, he wanted all of Ionia to see. </span></div></div>",

Perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the afternoon sun rose high into the sky the ninja soon noticed a warm feeling in his stomach. It was like a bubbling fire, something inside him waiting to burst out. He could feel warmth spreading through his veins, as if mixing itself with his body, transforming it for the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he noticed was his feet. Looking down Zed silently watched himself, his feet, including the ninja tabi on them were growing larger, expanding in volume at a sturdy pace. His hands too, were growing. Zed closed his eyes and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the warmth turned into a sharp pain and it shot throughout him.Zed grunted slightly but maintained his composure. He wanted to appear like a god as he grew until he was literally a titan to the people of Ionia. He wanted them to see his transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, Zed was was standing at ten feet tall. His feet now on either end of the small narrow path that lead into the cave. Preparing himself he held a pose, his arms flexed at his sides, his face upwards at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Ionia people had begun to notice him. The first was a little boy, who pulled eagerly at his mother's sleeve, pointing at the white figure in front of the cave high above the city. Soon many more had noticed as well and had stopped to stare. None could make out what exactly the white was but curiosity got the better of them and most stood still to watch as the figure in the distance slowly seemingly expanded in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Zed's growth was becoming more and more rapid. He could feel his body getting massive but refused to move, even when the ground underneath him began to creak and crack. No matter. He wanted everyone to see. He wanted them to know what was about to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point the people of Ionia had come to realize something was wrong. Many began to panic and scream as people recognized the exiled ninja as he grew bigger and bigger. Some could only watch in horror as Zed's massive shape filled up, looking bigger and bigger. The village elders had gathered in a circle in the courtyard. Nobody was sure exactly what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Zed felt his transformation stop. Opening his eyes he found himself looking at a completely different world. He could see miles ahead of him. Looking down he was pleased and overjoyed to see a small, miniature play city not too far off, - what he assumed must have been Ionia. The village was small by his comparison. Probably one of his footsteps covered entire houses. Looking around him he found the forest that once surrounded the region only went up to his knees. Zed guessed he was 50, maybe sixty feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no point in waiting. Creating small earthquakes as he went, Zed headed for the city. He was going to have some fun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After years of training as a master of stealth, Shen was able to concentrate and focus on accepting what had happened. He had shrunk to the tiny size of a doll, and his nemesis Zed was now towering over him, thousands of times bigger. He had to act ask. There was one advantage of being small, and that, being very very small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked away from Zed's piercing gaze and estimated his route. As soon as he did, he sprinted, making a mad dash for the edge of the bed. Above him he could hear Zed make a surprised sound as he somersaulted off the edge, landing on his hands and feet on the cold bare floor. Knowing every second was precious Shen didn't bother to look up to see what Zed was doing and instead bolted for the shadowy edges of the wall where he was to make his escape into the outside world and seek help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Zed wasn't as easy as he had thought. The other ninja had his eyes locked on Shen up until the very point he landed on the ground. It was no matter to him. All he wanted was to make Shen pay for everything that had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking quickly to the exit, Zed shut the door firmly, encasing the room in an eerie darkness with only slivers of moonlight shining through the window. Calmly the giant stood still and spoke. \"So...you want to run. Then let us play a game. See if you can avoid me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Zed furiously stomped the ground with his black SKT boots, sending shock-waves through the ground. For Shen, it felt like an earthquake and he was immediately thrown off his balance. Watching he horror he saw Zed begin to walk around, stepping hard on the ground with the purpose of crushing him under his shoes. It would take all the skill he had to get out of this one alive.</span></div></div>",

You know, Zac, Lulu, Cho, they rely on health to get bigger. Well I'm managed to harness the technology into a single device. See?\" Jayce pulled out a small blue button from the pocket of his suit jacket. \"It can change the size of anything in a matter of seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" The hooded summoner glanced over the device. \"This is revolutionary! What are you planning to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJayce smirked and looked around at the party. Piltover's City Hall was famous for inviting special guests to it's debonair events and Jayce usually took it as a chance to show off his new inventions.

The defender tried to giggle it, careful not to damage the expensive debonair suit he was wearing. Unforuntately the door seemed to have the will of the ancients because it wasn't until he almost had to slam against the door that it finally opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately as he did, his device went flying out of his pockets and as he opened the door, it went and landed on the floor upside down, activating the button that was on it's face. Instantly a ultraviolet light engulfed the room and Jayce shielded his eyes. Within mere moments the light was gone. and the room dimmed once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit...\" Jayce looked down at the device, lying in pieces on the floor beside his feet. The stupid thing had smashed itself into little pieces. At least it didn't hit anybody right? Jayce quickly scanned the room. It looked empty enough, probably a guest house, with fancy curtains and a cream covered cover over a queen sized bed. Nearby was a nightstand, a tall mirror and a closet. The mayor probably kept rooms like these in case a guest wanted to stay over. Seemed like nobody wanted to. Go figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJayce sighed and ran his hand through his hair. It was no big deal. He had other copies of the device back in his workshop. He should probably get something to carry the pieces together though, and his pocket was not an option. Maybe the room had something. The mayor probably wouldn't mind if he just looked around, right? </span></div></div>",

Not to mention everyone else in Ionia was going. Today, like most days he had snuck out to hide in one of the guest rooms, tempering his flute and occasionally lying on the bed. He was clean today since Varus had forced him in a bathtub earlier so nobody would even notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been facing away from the door when Jayce burst in, checking a photograph on the nightstand. Before he could react however, Yasuo was blinded by the light that seemingly appeared out of nowhere. He thought he heard Jayce say something but couldn't see clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he knew, he was standing on the floor, the world around him dark and unrecognizable. Looking to his left he saw that would have been the leg stand of the wooden nightstand, except his head barely went up more than a few inches from the floor. It didn't take the wanderer long to figure out what had happened. Jayce had shrunk him. Or, whatever had happened in that light show did. He was surprised how fast he came to the conclusion. Probably had something to do with him seeing it all on the fields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as that realization came, another did as well. Moments before Jayce had burst into the room. Yasuo blinked and slowly turned away from the nightstand to face the giant intruder. What he saw made him go speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere standing at the door was the titantic figure of the Piltovian defender, decked out in his usual debonair uniform. The light from the hallway shone from behind him, casting a giant eerie shadow that fell on the tiny swordsman. As Yasuo looked upwards he saw what seemed like a statue, fifty or sixty times his own height, looking confused into the room. The light embodied him making Jayce glow slightly from the edges. The sight was startling and horrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked onward, Jayce began moving and Yasuo quickly fell backwards. He watched as Jayce lifted his feet and walked forward a single step before two giant black and white dress shoes landed with a thud on either side of him. Yasuo couldn't take his eyes off of the giant, even now as he was \"trapped\" between Jayce's mammoth shoes. Looking to one side he could see his own reflection in the shiny black leather. The shoe itself was longer than he was and probably half his height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Yasuo was faced with two towering legs, black pants that went upwards until he could see the outline of Jayce's white coat. The other man apparently hadn't noticed him and Yasuo saw his eyes went forwards to something behind him. Turning around he saw what looked like, at his size, a broken UFO in pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's got to be something...\" Yasuo turned back at Jayce who was muttering to himself, the defender's toned body like a mountain in front of him. He had to get the giant's attention, fast. </span></div></div>",

Before he could react Jayce moved again, this time taking yet another step. It was then Yasuo realized something was wrong. Hurriedly he scrambled, trying his best to pull himself up as the gigantic defender raised his left foot, the massive dress shoe going up, high into the air. As the shadow over him grew darker and darker Yasuo saw that he wouldn't make it. The shoe was too big, he was too small. It was coming down too fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead he turned around, falling onto his back, his eyes instead looking upwards at the bottom of Jayce's dress shoe. It was a hard dark material with a groove in between the space in front and the heel. Yasuo also noted it was very clean, probably because Jayce was generally a well kept man. From where he was Jayce's toes would be right where is head was when it came down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swordsman prepared himself, raising both hands upwards in desperation as the dress shoe came down on him, pressing him into the soft carpeting. The heavy weight spread out over his body and he let out a groan as both his hands were forced backwards by sheer force. The smell of leather quickly invaded his nostrils as he struggled against the massive dress shoe. It must have been very hot inside the piece of footwear because Yasuo could feel the heat of Jayce's foot through the bottom. His entire face had been pushed sideways, the bottom of the shoe pressing down on his cheek. If it hadn't been for the carpeting, Yasuo was sure Jayce would have crushed him completely, unknowingly ending his life under his massive foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him Jayce had stopped and his shoe remained on the tiny swordsman, pinning his body down onto the floor. Yasuo could feel pain all over his body, but he would rather this than being dead. He tried to move but it was impossible. It was up to Jayce to set him free and Jayce didn't even know what he was doing.</span></div></div>",

Scanning the room told Jayce nothing and he wasn't able to feel anything out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where can I find a bag...\" The defender scratched his chin and leaned forward ever so slightly, peering forward. Underneath Jayce's gigantic dress shoe Yasuo felt the weight on top of him shift and suddenly increase as Jayce put more force on his foot than before. Gasping for air the wanderer tried to move his body but everything was pinned down solid. He felt the heat radiating from the shoe increase and so did the weight. Shit, no. It couldn't end like this. It couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it would. Yasuo bit down on his jaw as he felt the weight on him increase again, this time pushing in so far into the carpeting that he felt the solid ground underneath. This was it. He knew it. Nothing was there to cushion the force of a giant stepping on him. The only thing he could do was close his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJayce pressed forward again and Yasuo felt his vision go blank. The weight of the dress shoe was too much for him to handle and he felt his body giving in. The massive black and white shoe compressed him further and further down until he lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe defender of tomorrow stabilized himself and shifted all his weight on one foot, crushing the tiny Yasuo underneath. He thought he heard a crunching sound but dismissed it as his massive foot smushed the tiny man into the ground, the bottom of his dress shoe pressing down on the swordsman's body until it was no more than a bloody stain in the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll just ask Ezreal if he has something.\" Jayce pulled his suit jacket tightly together and raised his foot to walk out of the room, completely oblivious to what had happened and how easily and carelessly he had taken Yasuo's life.</span></div></div>",

Quickly the tiny swordsman scrambled to his feet and picked a direction, right, and started printing. Building momentum he jumped from the ground at Jayce's shoe, a familiar technique he had used many times on the fields. It seemed like his skills had carried over from being shrunk because he flew quickly and his target was dead on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a rough grunt he landed belly first onto Jayce's dress shoe, smacking onto it with great pain. The leather surface was no cushion that was for sure. Frantically Yasuo pulled his legs up, sitting and panting on top of Jayce's giant shoe. Thank god the inventor was such a slow thinker. Who knows what would have happened had he moved and Yauso missed. The swordsman shuddered. He didn't want to think about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPositioning himself on the white part of the shoe, Yasuo secured himself down by grabbing on to the metal buttons on either side of him, hugging the shoe that was just slightly bigger in width than his hold. Looking around he saw the room in a whole new light. Everything was so big, including the giant man he was currently hitching a ride on. Making sure he was safely on top of the dress shoe one more time, Yasuo waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon Jayce set in motion again and the swordsman clutched on tightly as the foot was raised into the air and brought down, swinging him like a roller coaster. Jayce was going too fast for Yasuo to see properly and he was too busy to look anyway, focusing on hanging onto the shoe for his life. He thought he could feel the warmth of Jayce's foot through the shoe, so at least that was comforting. He'd have to wait for the giant to stop though, before he could do anything else, and hopefully keep the contents of his stomach in as well.</span></div></div>",

Immediately afterwards a strong wind began blowing his hair and jacket back. Someone had left the window open inside! It seemed like Janna herself was sending gales because it was nothing like anything Jayce had ever experienced indoors before. Urgently he shielded his face and began making his way over to the window, two white silk curtains flying into him left and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did, he heard a loud smashing sound, like something had been knocked over. At that moment Jayce was too distracted by the gale force winds blowing in his face to notice the sound and that included the moment when a purple violet light momentarily engulfed his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much struggle the Piltovian inventor slammed the window shut, ceasing the tornado like status that the room was in earlier.

Fearing for the worst Jayce prepared to go out and ask for help, maybe Heimer or someone from the academy was here at the gala. As he did though, he noticed something strange.

But that meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization dawned on Jayce and he stopped in his tracks. The ray must have been him and was now making him grow. A uncontrolled growing effect, one that was unpredictable in it's rapid activity.

It was probably a good idea, considering Jayce knew exactly what was going to happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inventor fell to his knees as he began expanding, all his body parts suddenly growing with force.

He wasn't sure what was going on physically - the change was painful, like an energy inside him that needed to explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jayce fell backwards and thrust out his legs, now suddenly expanding forward with rapid speed, each one increasing in length and width, his massive feet leading the charge as they grew, pushing aside tables and furniture as they grew. His back was arched and his head began to shoot higher and higher into the air as the ceiling came closer and closer to the top of his head. His arms expanded from his sides, sitting and knocking several fleeing guests down. All the while Jayce was helpless, the pain overtaking him, making his vision blurry. But from the sounds that he could hear, he knew it was not good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his feet hit something and Jayce realized his legs had expanded to the end of the room, now each pressing forcefully against the wall as they expanded. His body was filling the area and now his head too was pressing against a wall - the ceiling - and threatened to burst through. He tried to reach out with his hands but he found himself trapped, each hand on either side pressing against two other sets of walls. Around him tables were overturn, people were still frantically fleeing and who knows if any had been unfortunate enough to have been trapped under the growing inventor.

As the cold evening air hit his face, he felt oddly relaxed. The moon was bright and the city of Piltover was decorated by bright lights, illuminating it in a warm glow. For a moment Jayce felt peaceful. And then he remembered the situation he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaggering the now giant inventor pulled himself up, unable to avoid stepping and breaking pieces of the destroyed building around. His growth had stopped for now and as he stood up, he found that the remains of the building barely went up to his shins - and it had been a three story mansion. From around the rubble he could hear what seemed to be screaming and yelling, but from his height it was hard to pay attention. The inventor was lost, standing the ruins of the gala event, at the height of probably at least one hundred feet, possibly more. As he looked around, he wasn't sure what to do. He was a giant and he had no idea where his invention was. What a predicament. </span></div></div>",

However as he stood there, a massive giant looming over buildings and infrastructure, he began to have different thoughts. This was a once in a lifetime situation and who knows, maybe it wasn't even real. Yeah, maybe it was just a dream. And if it was a dream, Jayce could do whatever he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTesting things out the inventor lifted up his right foot slowly into the air, as if preparing to take a step. However instead of moving forward he brought his foot back down at the exact same location, his shoe crushing the remains of the building underneath. As he did he could hear the twisting and grinding of metal underneath him as the last remaining parts of the gala event was crumbled underneath his foot. It felt kind of good, like he was playing a game. He was the giant and the city as an ant colony or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJayce grinned. Casually he raised his other foot and brought it down in front of him on the streets, the giant dress shoe crushing two cars underneath him. The satisfying sound of compressed metal filled his ears and he found that he enjoyed it much more. Soon his other foot was raised up as well, this time high above the ground and he positioned it over a small shack. Bring him foot down slowly, the shadow of his foot covered the shack until it was no more, reduced to mere rubble under his massive powerful foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJayce grinned down at the people, who was watching him in horror. Oh yeah. He could get used to this.</span></div></div>",

The giant defender turned his gaze onto the Piltover Academy of Science, a massive multistory building that housed the greatest discoveries and minds of modern day. Jayce himself was a member of the Academy, but at his current size, he was thinking of something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth, it had twisted his mind. What used to be thoughts of honor, duty and justice was now replaced by a dark hungering to fulfill his own needs. If Jayce had been it his right mind he might have noted it down as a side effect of the ray, but clearly he wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChucking he lifted his foot up from the shack, leaving behind a pile of dust and broken wood, and began walking casually towards the academy, his massive shiny dress shoes crushing anything in his path. On the ground citizens of Piltover screamed in horror as the titan carelessly made his way across entire streets, demolishing anything in his path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man who was fleeing from the giant was knocked off his feet by the vibrations caused by the giant and found himself sprawled down on the ground beside an overturned cart. Another man, an attendee of the evening's former gala wasn't as lucky and found himself underneath Jayce's massive dress shoe as it was lifted up into the air and brought down on his body, crushing him instantly into a mess of blood and skin. The massive dress shoes continued on as Jayce had his eyes set on the Academy, ending countless lives and destroying building after building. Pandemonium was erupting and the citizens fled in any direction they could to escape death under the giant defender's soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Jayce was unaware, or he simply didn't care as he made his way through the city. What he had in mind was something much more sinister and the bulge in his suit pants were a clear indication of that was to come. When he reached the Academy with it's shiny glass windows and beautiful, simple rectangular structure, the city of Piltover was in ruins with alarms sounding, people screaming and crying, but Jayce wasn't focused on the destruction he had caused. No...Checking himself in the reflection of the building the giant grinned. Handsome, and horny. The building would be his next target.</span></div></div>",

The shrinking button shrinks things and the growing button grows things! Just go around, test it a bit and reverse anything you do by hitting the opposite button. Report back to me in a week or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" Yasuo didn't look convinced but he took the contraption anyway. \"Alright then hero.

Of course, he would reverse the effects. It was only for a test, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYasuo looked back at Ezreal.

As soon as he did a bright yellow beam shot out from the device and struck the blond explorer who was no more than 20 feet away.

Coughing slightly the wanderer rubbed his eyes and peered into where he had aimed. What saw him excited him to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, at the foot of the wall was a doll like figure, frantically looking around like a trapped mouse or cornered rat. It had worked! Yasuo guessed Ezreal couldn't have been more than a few inches, 3 or four at the most. The shrunken explorer hadn't noticed him yet and instead looked like he was going to have a panic attack.
