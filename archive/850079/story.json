And then when I wouldn't do anymore than that, he got mad and started yelling at me. It scared me real bad.\" Caroline's voice had become whiney in her effort to reach the sympathetic ear of the lady of the house. \"He told me that he would beat me and maybe even kill me if I didn't... umm....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, dear, you don't need to go into details. I understand.\" Lady Withenstrop stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but when I yelled... he.... he.... grabbed me! He flung me to the ground and wanted to have his wicked way with me!\" Caroline got caught up in her story. No one ever accused her of being sharp. \"I fought him off, I did. He came after me again, and that is when he grabbed me again. He pushed me down, and wanted to kick me, I could tell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You poor thing. What a tragedy! And to be treated so in my own house. We will definitely make it right, my dear. Tell me, when you fought him off, is that when your dress was torn?\" She prompted the maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes! He ripped it almost clean off, he did! And you know what else? He hit me again and again! It was awful!\" Caroline was picturing the money she would be getting to keep her mouth shut about this little incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hit you? Oh, my. Where?\" Lady Withenstrop asked sharply. She was tired of this game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\" Caroline parrotted dumbly. \"Uhhh... well....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, if he hit you, you would definitely know where. I know, just show me the marks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marks?\" Caroline couldn't think fast enough to keep up with the lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, marks. The bruises. A man that big would leave bruises on anyone he decided to beat.\" Lady Withenstrop narrowed her eyes at the maid. \"He did hit you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh....\" Caroline stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I thought. Barnaby,\" Lady Withentrop turned to the butler. \"Be so kind as to remove this scum from my house. I do not employ liars. If she made up the part about my son hitting her, then she made the entire story up. Remove her at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Withenstrop turned and dismissed the matter from her mind. Edmund glared at Caroline, glad to see she had not caused a scandal as she was trying to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarnaby put his hand on Caroline's arm to drag her away.....</span></div></div>",

Peter had eighteen years now and was taller than Edmund. His face no longer showed a mark, his features were well defined, and he was heavier in muscle. The glasses he so hated as a child made him look sophisticated and intelligent.

She was expected to like pretty things and babies, and, of course, the husband her parents would eventually choose for her \u2013 nothing more. She, however, liked books and verbal sparring and, as she once confided in Peter, the occasional pretty thing. She had no intention of letting something as cumbersome as marriage fetter her freedom.

Emily was in a beautiful sapphire colored dress so dangerously low cut it was sure the catch the attention of every man in the room, and maybe a few women too. The few pounds of fat that had stayed with her since childhood had disappeared and a womanly shape had emerged. She was speaking excitedly with two other women, somewhat crowded together in a corner.

How can he keep me here if I am, indeed, his daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane thought for a moment, realising that leaving her post in the sacking room would result in fierce punishment but agreed.  The question was now where to find Mr. Trystell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that at noon, Mr. Trystell often walks his dog, Sabre,\" said Dorothea, \"so if he has done that we will need to escape the workhouse its self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but doesn't he sometimes have a lunch time nap?  That would involve us going upstairs to the living quarters,\"  suggested Jane.</span></div></div>",
