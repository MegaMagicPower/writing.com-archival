In this story, J.D didn't break up at the rehearsal dinner, and instead are enjoying a 'growing' relationship.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D and Elliot were in a cab on the way back to Elliot's place after Turk and Carla's wedding reception. J.D leaned back in the chair, popping the button on his tuxedo trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoof,\" he sighed, \"I think I overdid it at that buffet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot smiled and snuggled up next to him, patting his small belly, \"I think it's kinda cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began to make out, and only stopped when the cab driver cleared his throat and informed them<br>\r\nthat they had arrived at their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing a few crumpled bills at the driver, the lovestruck pair stumbled up to Elliot's apartment, a small but well furnished one bedroomed flat, with an ensuite bathroom and full kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Elliot freshened up, J.D stripped out of his suit and lay on the bed in his boxers. He prodded his bloated belly and made a mental note to watch what he ate. Despite what she had said, he doubted Elliot would appreciate if he porked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll thoughts of weight gain were knocked from his mind by the reappearance of Elliot, wearing a lacy black thong... and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, J.D woke up and found...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite only being dressed in his black boxer shorts, he made his way out to the kitchen and was surprised to find Elliot standing at the stove, cooking up a packet of bacon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning J.D.\" she said perkily. She was fully dressed, and had clearly been up for a while. J.D sat down at the table, which was already loaded with pancakes, sausages and scrambled eggs, as well as some hash browns and a pitcher of orange juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you cook all of this?\" he asked in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" she replied, sliding the cooked bacon on to a plate, \"why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I just never really thought of you as 'domestic'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our maid used to teach me how to cook on Saturday mornings, during my parents' passive-aggressive squash match.\" Elliot explained as she carried the bacon over to the table, \"She taught me so much... Until my mother fired her for 'enabling my trip to tubby town'.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D stifled a laugh at his girlfriend's dysfunctional homelife, and instead raised an eyebrow at the sheer amount of food. \"Why did you cook so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot shrugged, \"I dunno, you don't have to eat it all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D reached for a plate, but Elliot stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed him a bright green pill and a small glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this for?\" he asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a vitamin pill.\" she explained, sitting down, \"You're supposed to take it with meals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D shrugged and gulped down the pill. Almost immediately he felt a powerful hunger, and began loading up his plate with big piles of eggs, bacon and potatoes. Elliot smiled and pushed a stack of buttery pancakes towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, and J.D sat back, completely stuffed. He had eaten almost everything on the table, as well as the entire jug of OJ, and it showed. His belly bulged out over his pants, rigid with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oogh,\" he groaned, before letting out a burp, \"I am so full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at Elliot, who was smiling at him over a mug of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" he said, looking at her clean plate, \"didn't you have any?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot stood up, fanning a napkin to his greasy lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm not really a big breakfast person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you go get ready for work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" exclaimed J.D, looking at the clock. Moving as fast as his stuffed belly would let him, he got dressed and left for work, leaving a happy Elliot to clean up the dishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>J.D drove to work in his and Turk's 'vintage' car, moaning and burping all the while, trying to make his bloated belly go down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I eat so much?\" he thought, pulling his car into the parking lot, \"Elliot must think I'm a complete pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis last thought set off an elaborate fantasy where Elliot, dressed as a farmer, filled a trough with food for a hugely obese J.D, who when he bent down to eat, had a curly tail poking out from his trousers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he shook himself back to reality, he had somehow made it to the locker room. Checking to see that no one was around, he changed into a large pair of blue scrubs, and even put on his lab coat, trying to hide his small gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D soon forgot about his overeating, as he began his normal day of work. Visiting patients, making diagnoses, annoying Dr. Cox, avoiding the Janitor... It was just another routine day at Sacred Heart.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact the first time he broke routine was at lunchtime. Normally he would have lunch with Turk, but since he was away, J.D had arranged to meet Elliot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Carla,\" he grumbled, \"Insisting they go on honeymoon 'alone'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe indulged in a brief fantasy, where Turk and Carla were sitting on the beach, bored without their best friend J.D there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked into the cafeteria to find Elliot already there, sitting next to the window eating a salad. He kissed her on the cheek and told her he was just going to get his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need.\" Elliot replied, \"I already got you some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured at the tray opposite her, which was absolutely loaded with food. There were two huge cheeseburgers, sitting in a sea of french fries, onion rings and potato chips, as well as a large bottle of soda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D was staggered by the amount of food, but didn't want to seem rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks.\" he replied sitting down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know you like cheeseburgers, so...\" Elliot shrugged, sensing his confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at his plate, not really sure where to begin. He was still pretty full from breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wait.\" said Elliot, sliding over a napkin from her side of the table, followed by a bottle of water. Right in the center of the napkin was another little green pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like, a two-a-day vitamin?\" Elliot explained, \"Twice as many vitamins as the one-a-day kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D knocked back the pill with a swig of water, and almost immediately found his appetite returning. He grabbed a burger and took an impressive bite, followed by another, and another. In no time at all he demolished the burger, before starting on the sides, grabbing an indiscriminate handful and cramming it in his mouth. He was lucky it was a slow time for the cafeteria, so no one was there to witness his gluttonous display, aside from Elliot, who didn't seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tore into the second burger, dripping ketchup right down his top. As he finished off the sides and chugged the soda, Elliot went to get dessert, apple pie with whipped cream. She gave him the larger slice, and quickly declared herself full after one tiny bite of hers, which she then fed to the seemingly insatiable J.D.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact it took two slices of the other dessert option (a creamy chocolate cake) before J.D sat back, finally full. His stomach was huge, even bigger than at breakfast, poking out from under his stained top. He groaned as Elliot popped the final crumb of cake in his mouth, before she kissed him on the forehead and told him she had to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat there for ten minutes, unable to move. He only struggled to his feet when his pager went off, reminding him he was at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening, J.D decides to go...   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That afternoon, J.D passed as much work as he could off on his interns before retiring to the on-call room, where he planned to sleep off his massive meal. Finding the quietest corner he could, he slipped beneath the sheets and massaged his bloated belly until he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up a few hours later he was surprised to find Elliot sitting at the end of the bed, with two cups of coffee\u00a0and\u00a0a bag of donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good morning sleepyhead!\" she said cheerily, as J.D sat up, feeling groggy.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought you a little snack.\"\u00a0she continued, handing him a coffee and shaking the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sipped his coffee and began to make excuses, \"Thanks, Elliot but...\", but it felt like the caffeine had awoken his appetite as well as perking him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached into the bag and grabbed a pastry, covered in thick pink frosting. He took a large bite, and as the jelly dripped down his chin Elliot couldn't help but smile.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do tonight?\" Elliot asked, as J.D took a second donut from the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" J.D hesitated. He was embarrassed about pigging out in front of Elliot, but he couldn't seem to help it when she was around.\u00a0\u00a0Still, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... What?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I thought I'd just hang out at home tonight.\" he said finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Cool.\" Elliot replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, J.D took a third donut before offering the bag to Elliot. She smiled and declined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I can't eat carbs after five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D shrugged and finished off the remaining donuts himself. When he had licked the last crumb from his fingers Elliot leaned over and planted a kiss on his sugar stained lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled her closer and they began to make out. As they fell back on to the bed, J.D slipped his hands down on to Elliot's butt, and was surprised to find her hands rubbing his swollen belly. Before he could really consider this, however, Elliot's pager went off and she had to dash out, leaving him confused and alone.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" he wondered, \"She must have been trying to feel how big it was. I have kind of been overdoing it lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted up his shirt and took a look for himself. It had gone down since lunch, but it was still fairly noticeable. He poked it, feeling the rigidness from the food, although there was a slight layer of flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his watch beeped, informing him his shift was over and, finally he could go home.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D's drive home was fairly uneventful. He'd been tempted to stop at a drive-thru, as the donuts hadn't quite filled him up, but one look down at his straining pants buttons convinced him it wasn't a good idea. By the time he got back to the apartment he shared with Carla and Turk, it was a little after seven o'clock. With his friends away on their honeymoon, he was looking forward to having the place to himself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Calming down, he looked up to see a bemused Elliot staring at him from the couch, a magazine in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's much better?\" she asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know,\" J.D replied, standing up, \"The floor. It's much better. Than other floors. It's, uh, sturdy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot snorted derisively and turned back to her magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" J.D began, self-consciously pulling his shirt down over his stomach and his open pants, \"So, uh, what are you doing here?\" he asked, trying to sound casual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot didn't even look up from the article she was reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you just wanted to hang out here tonight.\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D was stuck. He had meant he wanted to hang out alone, but it wasn't like he could just kick her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" he said, finally. \"I'll just, uh, go get changed.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hm.\" Elliot murmured, as he made for his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D threw his clothes into the laundry hamper and grabbed a t-shirt from his dresser, along with some trousers. He was just pulling on some fresh socks when he heard the door opening, and then closing a few seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that?\" he asked, half-hoping Elliot might have left suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the pizza guy!\" Elliot replied.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D frowned. He had been planning on skipping dinner, maybe going for a jog. On the other hand, pizza sounded pretty good right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" he called, hurrying out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot and J.D sat down in front of the T.V with their pizza.\u00a0J.D had a beer from the fridge while Elliot was drinking diet soda. It was fairly large pizza, a little greasy, but with plenty of cheese, topped with ham and mushroom, J.D's favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey found some Brady Bunch re-runs and ate in relative silence, laughing at the corny jokes. J.D carefully limited himself, only eating as much as Elliot ate, so he was disappointed when she stopped eating after two slices. He frowned and leaned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably for the best.\" he thought, glancing at his small potbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed. \"Are you finished?\" Elliot asked, realizing he hadn't taken another slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah.\" J.D replied, \"I'm kinda full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot snorted, \"Don't be such a wimp! I've seen you finish an entire pizza by yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I...\" he began, but Elliot interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" she said, handing him a slice, \"Waste not, want not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" she smiled, sensing his hesitance, \"how about for every slice you eat... I'll remove an item of clothing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caught his attention. He looked at her to see if she was serious. She smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" he said, as he held the slice, \"I have already eaten two slices...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot grinned and, kicking off her shoes, reached down and pulled off, with great ceremony, her white cotton socks, revealing her dainty manicured toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your move big boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes later and J.D was just finishing his fourth slice. He \u00a0had already gotten her to remove her sweater, leaving her in a tight white tank top and her blue jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe popped the last piece of crust in his mouth and chewed, before swallowing and showing his empty mouth to Elliot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah.\" he murmured, sticking out his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Elliot said, standing up after a careful inspection, \"Shirt or pants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shirt. No, pants!\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make up your mind!\" she scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her top up over her head, revealing her perky breasts nestled in a\u00a0lacy red bra. She shook her hair out and threw the garment across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought occurred to J.D.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is underwear one item, or..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just worry about finishing the next slice, cowboy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D was a little worried. His appetite, after being a nuisance all day, seemed to have abandoned him, and now he was just adding pizza to the massive amount of food he'd already eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got halfway through the slice without much trouble, but when he hit a particularly large pocket of grease he thought he might throw up.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on J.D.\" Elliot sighed seductively, fiddling with her belt, \"These pants are so tight, I just want to take them off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was more concerned with his own pants. His stuffed stomach was pushing hard against his waistband, cutting into him painfully. Somehow, he managed to finish his slice without it popping off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops.\" Elliot said, pretending to be surprised as she undid her belt and her jeans slid down, revealing her toned legs and small bottom, with matching red panties. She stepped out of her jeans and picked up the last slice, handing it to J.D.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned, burping to make some room, and tore into the pizza, deciding it would be easier if he did if fast. He crammed pretty much the entire thing into his mouth, grease dripping down his chin, until finally, with a belch, he was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot applauded him and, grabbing his arm, led her bloated boyfriend to the bedroom, for his 'prize'.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Elliot rolled off him, the stuffed and drowsy J.D made a promise to himself to get up early tomorrow and go for a jog. This new gut wasn't going to get rid of itself, and he'd have to work extra hard to work off that pizza. His alarm was already set, so everything would be fine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when J.D woke up the next morning, it wasn't at the crack of dawn like he'd planned, rather the stroke of ten o'clock. He groaned as he looked at the clock. How had he slept through the alarm? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe all that food put me in a deeper coma than I thought,\" he reasoned, reaching out a hand and feeling Elliot's side of the bed was empty. \"Ok, I have work at twelve, with Elliot gone I can still skip breakfast, go for a quick run and then shower at the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the toilet flushed, and J.D realised he wasn't alone after all. Elliot emerged from the bathroom, dressed in track pants and a sweat-stained tank-top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning sleepyhead!\" she said cheerily. \"You looked so peaceful, so I snuck out for a quick run. Plus, I figured you could use the rest after last nights 'exertions'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as J.D could remember, he had just lay on his back, trying not to puke while Elliot gyrated on top of him. But this was still salvageable, a light breakfast with Elliot and he could use the gym at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And continuing my run as best girlfriend ever...\" Elliot smiled, walking to the bedroom door and opening it, \"I picked up breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D smiled, but inside he was fearing the worst, and after getting dressed and a quick trip to the bathroom, his fears were confirmed. A brown bag with the familiar golden arches was sitting on the counter, next to a large pink box of donuts. Beside them was a glass of water, and a small green pill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D grabbed the pill and swallowed it down, (\"At least I'll have one healthy thing this morning.\" he thought.), looking over at Elliot, who was sitting on the couch with a box salad and an Egg McMuffin. J.D peeked inside the bag and saw three, no four more McMuffins, along with two large fries and two McGriddles. Salty, greasy food usually turned J.D's stomach this early in the morning... but suddenly his stomach was growling, and his mouth watering. Before he knew it, he had reached into the bag and grabbed two McMuffins, unwrapping them clumsily with one hand, grabbing a handful of fries with the other and cramming them into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next fifteen minutes, J.D demolished the entire bag of fast food, oblivious to everything else, even Elliot stripping off and heading for the shower, leaving her clothes strewn around the living room. When she returned, she found J.D sitting on the couch, his small potbelly swollen large with food, laying heavily on his lap, stretching his t-shirt. Elliot brought over the donuts and turned on the TV, leaving the box open on the coffee table. |Over the next forty minutes, J.D found his way to eating eleven of the frosted pastries, leaving one lightly shrunken pink one for Elliot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it was time to head for the hospital, and a bloated J.D let Elliot drive, while he dozed in the passenger seat. Once he got to the locker room, the combination of loose scrubs and labcoat again made him feel better, and he even got a candy bar from the vending machine on his way to his first patient's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that bad,\" he thought munching on a particularly crunchy piece of nougat, \"You were just hungry, everyone deserves a day or two of gluttony once in a while. And Elliot doesn't seem to mind, judging by last night.\" He smiled and drifted off, thinking about how sexy she had looked in those black lacy panties. And subconsciously, about how delicious and cheesy that pizza had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Florence!\" the sharp bark of Doctor Cox interrupted his inner monologue, and knocked all thoughts of dieting out of his head. By lunch, he was hungry again and eager for more food, and Elliot was waiting for him with a smile and a little green pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the next two weeks, J.D alternated between worrying about his weight and stuffing his face with food. With Turk and Carla away, Elliot basically moved in, and like before, he found he just couldn't control his appetite when she was around. He would come home from the hospital tired and hungry, to find Elliot had thoughtfully ordered some takeout for dinner, and had also picked up something sweet for dessert. He would go to bed stuffed, and when he woke up, found breakfast waiting for him, Elliot having gotten up early. Work would be a brief respite, but as the days passed, he found himself slotting coins into the vending machines, or sneaking muffins from the nurses' station. Soon he was eating larger and larger portions, and his weight kept creeping up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut J.D reassured himself with the fact that Elliot hadn't even seemed to notice. Even on Thursday, when they went to the cinema and J.D ate an entire extra-large buttery popcorn, two hotdogs, nachos and a box of Milk Duds, as well as most of Elliot's Twizzlers. She even suggested going to an Chinese Buffet after the movie was over. And she didn't say anything during their picnic on Sunday, when J.D polished off almost an entire roast chicken, a dozen egg salad sandwiches and one and a half apple pies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like he was trying to be unhealthy. He had upped his vitamin intake, and he always meant to go running, but Elliot always reminded him of plans they had made together, or was 'suddenly in the mood'. Even on Wednesday, two days before Turk and Carla's return, he had finally had the chance to go running, but he could only find one of his trainers. And when he was looking for the other one under the bed, he found a large box of fudge that must have gotten misplaced down there last Christmas... Two hours later he had finished off the fudge, and was telling himself he really needed to work out now. Then Elliot arrived home with some Mexican food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D kissed his way down Elliot's neck as she writhed beneath him, down on to her bare breast, pausing momentarily to suck on her nipple. He continued down, over her flat stomach, while his hands gently tugged down her white lacy underwear. Finally, he reached it, and took his first taste. It was sweet as chocolate. And then suddenly it <i>was</i> chocolate. Elliot's white skin was now a milky chocolate brown, from the top of her head to the tips of her toes. As he licked and licked, J.D found that she was delicious, the best thing he'd ever tasted. Elliot moaned in ecstasy, her fingers curling into the bed sheets and leaving chocolate stains behind. J.D couldn't restrain himself any longer and took a bite. Elliot didn't seem to mind, in fact she only moaned louder. J.D chewed and swallowed, taking another, even larger bite. He worked his way up her stomach, licking out her belly button, gnawing on her nipples, taking a love bite out of her neck, then kissing her lips, and feeling them melt beneath his...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J.D, wake up, Turk and Carla's flight lands in an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D's eyes snapped open, and he saw Elliot looking down at him, already dressed in a white summer dress. He rubbed his eyes and got up clumsily, the last vestiges of his dream still clouding his head, as he looked for his clothes. As he dressed, his added poundage was fairly evident. As he bent over to grab some socks, his butt bulged outwards and his boxers rode down, revealing his butt-crack. His chest was a lot flabbier, and could easily be called man boobs, which jiggled slightly as he struggled to pull his pants up over his rounding buttocks. The biggest change was his stomach. Once flat, he now possessed a large belly, about the size of a basketball. He pulled on a t-shirt, and it only fell to slightly below his belly button, leaving a small lower portion of his stomach exposed. He pulled at it, almost subconsciously, but it only rode straight back up. He bent over (difficult with his new gut) and slipped on his shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked out into the living room and sat on the couch. He heard the jingling of keys, and saw Elliot standing by the door, waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No breakfast?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot smiled and put on her sunglasses. \"We'll get something on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carla, over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had arrived at the airport, and after waiting twenty minutes in the arrivals area, just as J.D was beginning to look around for something to eat, Elliot spotted their friends pushing a luggage trolley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turk!\" J.D cried out, running to hug his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J.D!\" he heard in reply, as he was pulled into a bear hug. A massive bear hug. A much bigger bear hug than he remembered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stepped back, he saw he wasn't the only one who had put on a little weight. Turk was sporting a belly, about half the size of J.D's, and his face was a little chubbier too. As he leaned over to hug Elliot hello, J.D saw that Turk's ass had taken most of the extra pounds, and his shorts were so tight it was easy to see that each butt cheek was about the size of a volleyball. J.D was chubby, leaning towards fat, with a big belly, while Turk was kind of bigger all over, with an emphasis on ass.  While the two friends took each other in, there was a kind of awkward pause. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot and Carla did their best to fill it. \"How was the honeymoon?\" Elliot began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it was amazing, the beach, the room, the scenery, everything was beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother little bit of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot played her ace. \"And the food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis snapped both Turk and J.D out of it. \"Man, the food was amazing, I'm talking shrimp and steak every night!\" Turk said exuberantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, and dessert?\" J.D asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two words man,\" Turk grinned, \"Dessert cart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awkwardness forgotten, the two friends chatted away for five minutes straight about the meals they had eaten over the past two weeks. Suddenly, food was just another thing they had in common.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla interrupted them. \"Elliot and I are going to get some coffee, maybe you boys want to get some food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk had eaten two dinners, half of Carla's and a giant Toblerone on the flight, and J.D had made Elliot stop for cheeseburgers on the way, but talking about food was enough to get their motors running and their mouths watering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a KFC in the food court.\" Elliot suggested, and like that they were gone. Carla and Elliot laughed, and taking the trolley, went to get a coffee and 'catch up.'</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well Mrs. Espinosa,\" Elliot smiled, handing her friend a coffee and sitting down opposite her, \"I must say, that is some damn fine work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla grinned, taking a sip, \"You didn't do too badly yourself Ms. Reid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see the way their bellies were bouncing off of each other when they hugged?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D and Turk would be shocked, but this was the reason that Elliot and Carla had finally bonded. Their icy relationship had thawed when they caught each other checking out a chunky intern's butt. Soon they were confiding in each other, sharing fantasies and preferences. They had both dreamed of fattening someone up, but had agreed that they would wait until they were in a committed relationship. With Carla and Turk's wedding, and J.D and Elliot getting back together, they had finally decided it was time to put their plans into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J.D looks like he swallowed a basketball.\" Carla laughed, \"It's hard to believe he was so skinny just two weeks ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, those pills are something else.\" Elliot said, picking at a muffin she'd gotten for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I slipped two into Turk's champagne, and I swear he ate about six slices of wedding cake. Bust the button right off his tuxedo pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told J.D they were vitamins, he's been taking two a day ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla's eyes gleamed. \"That's genius. I had to sneak them to him in his drinks. Aside from that, it was easy. Breakfast buffets, 24 hour room service, he was popping out of his swim trunks by Friday. Luckily there was a nudist beach 5 minutes away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot licked her lips. \"Man I would have killed to see that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, I had my camera. It was hilarious, seeing all these perky breasts and tight abs, and then Turk's flabby ass bobbing around in the waves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laughed, before Carla continued. \"Still, even when he was stuffing his face with his eighth plate of seafood, if I stopped eating, he'd suddenly get all concerned and self-conscious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I know, J.D was the same. I probably eaten twice as much as I would normally over the last two weeks. I've had to go running every morning just to keep the weight off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't so lucky,\" Carla grimaced, lifting up her tank top and showing off a small potbelly, \"And my ass is even bigger. Nowhere to work out at out resort. In fairness, that's partly why I chose it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want, I'll be working out again tomorrow.\" Elliot offered, sipping her latte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might just have to.\" Carla smiled, \"As long as Turk can't come with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hide one of his running shoes, he'll be too lazy to look for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat in happy silence for a few minutes. Then Elliot frowned. \"You don't think they suspect do you? Now they're together, won't they notice what's happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D and Turk sat in KFC, both having gone for a Family-sized bucket of Original Recipe with Coleslaw. Each was about halfway through, grease and crumbs staining their faces and hands. J.D's stomach was crammed awkwardly against the table, while Turk was perched uncomfortably, balancing his massive butt on a single vinyl chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a look of realization crossed J.D's face. \"Turk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk looked up, he's cheeks bulging with chicken. \"Whuh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just realized something,\" J.D paused to sip his soda, \"We've got free refills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey high-fived and went back to eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it.\" Carla shrugged. \"Do you think we should tell them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot bit her lip. \"I don't know. It's so cute when J.D tries to suck in his gut, or stands on the scales looking all confused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla nodded. \"Turk insists the laundry service was shrinking his clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot finished the last of her muffin, \"Then let's just keep them in the dark, for now at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla smiled and got up, heading for the door. Her thong was clearly visible through her stretched cotton shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot gasped. \"Wow, your ass <i>is</i> bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Carla laughed, waggling her butt a little and slapping it. \"Turk seems to like it anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got back from the airport and both couples retired to their respective bedrooms. After two hours, both guys emerged, tired but hungry. Carla ordered some pizzas while Elliot made up a few bowls of snacks to tide them over. Four large pizzas and three dozen hot wings disappeared within an hour and a half. Turk and J.D were stuffed to the gills, while even Elliot and Carla were feeling over full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk and J.D lay slumped asleep on the couch, big bellies in full view as their shirts had ridden up. Turk's bulging stomach was dwarfed by J.D's pale beach ball, but both were equally swollen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla and Elliot sat up at the breakfast bar, nursing glasses of wine and rubbing their slightly swollen stomachs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I really need to start working out.\" Carla moaned, letting out a little burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot nodded. \"It'll be great, you'll see. I started getting a real runner's high. I'm thinking about starting some weight training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla sighed. \"Still, it's kind of nice letting go a little. I can understand why the guys like it so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot patted her stomach. \"Hmmmm... Maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nOver the next two months...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the next two months, the Elliot and Carla continued to fatten J.D and Turk up as much as they could, and enjoyed every second of it. A few days after the honeymoon, Elliot officially moved in to their apartment, bringing with her a double-wide refrigerator that she kept filled with snacks and various other goodies. Carla also did her part, making food easily accessible everywhere in the apartment, bowls of nuts and candy on the coffee table, bags of chips and chocolates in the bedrooms, and a hefty stack of takeaway menus next to the phone. She even kept snacks in the car, and made sure the guys always had plenty of change for the vending machines at the hospital. The final piece was the box of 'vitamins' that they left out on the counter, and reminded the guys to take with every meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaced with this coordinated barrage of food, Turk and J.D couldn't help but gain weight, and they both ballooned at an near unbelievable rate. They outgrew their clothes, the numbers on the scale shot up, even furniture began to creak underneath them. But with Carla and Elliot reassuring them, they both relaxed into a state that was part denial, part subconscious acceptance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boys got fatter and fatter, the girls decided to get fitter. While they had toyed with the idea of gaining for a while, but after seeing Turk and J.D gasping for breath after chasing an ice-cream truck twenty feet,  they decided it wasn't for them. Instead they resolved to start working out, getting up early to go running, and still getting back in time to cook a hearty and extremely fattening breakfast before work. At lunch they would usually have a salad and make sure their men had plenty to eat before heading down to the gym. At first they just used the treadmills and Exercycles, but as the excess pounds melted away and they began to experience a natural runner's high, they began to explore the other aspects of the gym. The cross-trainers, the rowing machines, and eventually the weights benches. Soon they found the numbers on the scales were creeping back up, but as muscle instead of fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the summer, all the inhabitants of the apartment were fully ensconced in their new lifestyles. While Turk and J.D had gone from chubby to fat to practically obese, Carla and Elliot had become total gym bunnies, with the hard bodies to match. The girl's would get up, leaving their men to sleep off last night's big meal, and go running, alternating between jogging, running and sprinting, interspersed with breaks for push-ups and sit-ups. When they got back, they would start preparing breakfast, pancakes, bacon, eggs, pork links and plenty of donuts. The smell of frying was usually enough to bring Turk and J.D stumbling to the breakfast table, where they would proceed to stuff themselves with anything they could get their hands on. Carla and Elliot would join them after their showers, wolfing down plenty of protein rich food. When the time came to head to work, Carla or Elliot would drive, J.D and Turk having found it increasingly difficult to squeeze into the drivers seat, preferring to lounge in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter working through the morning, the foursome would meet for lunch. Their table was usually crowded with numerous trays of food, even though Elliot and Carla would increasingly restrict themselves to protein shakes and energy bars. They would go their separate ways, Turk and J.D heading for the on-call room to sleep and massage their swollen stomachs while Carla and Elliot would hit the gym, lifting weights and spotting for each other. At the end of the day, they would head home, one of the girl's driving the guys while the other jogged the five miles back to the apartment. Once the boys were on the couch with plenty of snacks in easy reach, Carla and Elliot would head out for their serious workout. They had joined the local gym, and took full advantage, primarily using the weight room, lifting and lifting for as long as they could, constantly switching up which muscles they were working out. They were usually incredibly tired and sore when they got home, but they felt it was worth it. Then they would decide what to order for dinner, as it was too much effort cooking enough food to sate their collective appetite. It varied between Chinese food, burgers and fried chicken, but pizza was the general favorite, and most night's they would order five or six large pizzas, the lion's share going to J.D and Turk. They would all have a few beers, usually finishing a twelve pack between them, before each woman would lead her man to the bedroom. After a few minutes of creaking bed springs and moaning, the apartment would fall silent, until Elliot's alarm started buzzing at 5 the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was mid morning on Saturday, just as August was turning into September. It was one of those rare days when all four of J.D, Turk, Carla and Elliot had the day off, and so they had been particularly indulgent the previous night, eating and drinking into the late hours of the morning, J.D and Turk competing to see who could eat the most while Elliot and Carla cheered them on. the apartment was quiet, until the silence was broken by the clink of the fridge closing. J.D emerged from the kitchenette, wearing only a skimpy pair of briefs and carrying with him a large mixing bowl filled with Froot Loops and milk. He was unrecognizable as the skinny man from a few months ago. His legs were now encased in a layer of blubber that thickened the further up you went. His arms were now soft and pillowy, while his face sported a double chin and round chubby cheeks. His midsection was the most impressive. From groin to neck he was almost completely spherical, his massive belly sticking out in front of him and sagging downwards only slightly. His back was also flabby, and his butt bulged outwards, straining the thin material of his tighty-whiteys. His chest had gone from pigeon to flabby to a pair of impressive manboobs, that probably would have fit comfortably into one of Carla's bras. He lumbered over to the couch and sat down heavily, his stomach sitting in his lap and actually reaching as far as his knees, before picking up the remote, which Elliot had tied to the armrest after the third time it had gone missing only to turn up under one of the guys' various rolls of fat. The area between the couch and the TV was a mess of Chinese food containers, pizza boxes and various other packages and wrappers, no one really caring enough to clean them up. As J.D began slurping down his cereal, he heard a key turn in the lock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Carla, back from a mid-morning jog as evidenced by her running attire, her long curly hair tied back in a ponytail. If J.D was unrecognizable, Carla would cause at least a double take. The months of training and working out had turned her from an average woman into a Latina She-hulk. Her legs were toned but thick, each thigh the size of a small tree trunk. They ran up to her ass, which was even larger than it had been before, thanks to a regimen of squats and sessions on the exercise bike. It stuck out shelf-like behind her, firm instead of flabby, toned instead of jiggly, and pushed against her shorts as she bent down to take off her shoes. She turned off the iPod nano that was strapped around her well-muscled bicep and gave J.D a casual greeting. Her breasts jiggled as she removed her sweaty running top, revealing a tight black sports bra. Beneath her breasts, her stomach was toned and flat. \"Man, it is hot out there!\" she said, reaching back to let down her hair. J.D mumbled his agreement though a mouthful of chewed-up cereal. It was hot, in fact a heat wave warning was in effect. Unfortunately the money they had been saving for an air-conditioner had been blown on a second-hand weights set and mini fridges for each bedroom. The only solution was to strip down and try to avoid moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla went to the bathroom and found it locked. She pounded on the door, the thin wood almost cracking under her new strength. \"Turk! Hurry up, I drank like three bottles of Gatorade in the last hour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me baby,\" Turk's muffled voice could be heard saying, \"You do not want to come in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla groaned, squeezing her legs together. \"J.D, is your bathroom free?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D swallowed a wad of cereal. \"I think Elliot's showering in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla grimaced. \"Well, she's just going to have to make do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carla hobbled quickly to the other bathroom, J.D turned his focus once again to the TV, and his cereal. Half a minute later, the bathroom door swung open and he heard the sound of the air-freshener being sprayed liberally. After another few seconds, Turk appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike J.D, Turk was a changed person from the athletic young man he had once been. And, like J.D, his response to the hot weather  had been to avoid getting dressed. He was wearing only a string vest and  a pair of baggy blue boxer shorts. Well they would have been baggy, on the old Turk. As it was, the new Turk's massive butt-cheeks were stretching out the boxers obscenely, the blue material covering only a small portion of his giant butt. His thighs were as thick around as his entire midsection used to be, and it was impossible to tell where his calves ended and his ankles began. Through his thin  vest his respectably sized gut could be seen, while his chest was only slightly flabby compared to J.D's. His face had rounded out, and his double chin had been joined by a third. He sat down on the far side of J.D, scratching his belly. The couch wasn't big enough for the both of them, J.D took up and entire cushion while Turk's ass took up one and a half, but since neither of them could fit in the other chairs, it was better to squish in together  than  have to stand. Turk scratched his ass as he reached for a pack of Twinkies that had fallen from the coffee table, grunting as he exerted himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn episode of 'Full House' was just ending as J.D slugged down the last of his milk and Turk crammed the last two Twinkies into his mouth. Both were considering what to eat next when they heard footsteps approaching. Suddenly two large bags of M&amp;Ms landed on their stomachs. They turned their heads to see a smiling Elliot, dressed in a white tank top and jean shorts, her long blonde hair still wet from the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you guys might be hungry.\" She said. Turk tore open his bag and murmured a thank you as Elliot leaned in to plant a kiss on J.D's chubby cheek. Both were scarfing down the candy-coated chocolates as Elliot walked to the kitchen. Like Carla, the effects of her rigorous workout were clearly evident. Gone was the skinny, soft girl from Connecticut, replaced with a woman of almost Amazonian proportions. Her legs weren't as thick as Carla's, but they were equally muscular, her calves and thighs toned and defined. Her butt was a little bigger, but beneath the denim were buns of steel. Her stomach wasn't just toned like Carla's, but a perfect six-pack, and as she walked she drummed her fingers on her rock hard abs. Her boobs were pressing against her bra, due to the recent growth in her pecs. As she yawned and stretched, it was easy to see the muscles rippling across her toned back. Her arms were incredibly muscular, even more so than her legs, her biceps and triceps bulging and threatening to rip the sleeves of her blouses. She had discovered, after a drunken dare from Turk, that she could now rip phone books in half with ease.  She opened the fridge and bent down, and after moving a few milk bottles aside, turned around with a look of annoyance on her face. \"Which one of you drank my protein shakes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D let out a guilty burp, rubbing his giant belly. \"Sorry Elliot, we were all out of chocolate milk, and all those tacos last night made me thirsty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot sighed and grabbed three ripe bananas from the fruit bowl instead, sitting down at the breakfast bar and peeling them, eating each one in three bites. Carla then returned from the bathroom. She changed her clothes, wearing a light green summer dress that couldn't disguise the muscular physique beneath. She also carried the fan from J.D and Elliot's room, and set it up next to the couch, providing the sweaty Turk and J.D with a modicum of relief from the sweltering heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Elliot said, finishing off her final banana and reaching for a protein bar, \"What to you want to do today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too hot to do anything.\" Turk moaned through a mouthful of chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D murmured his agreement, he was already sweating just sitting here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla rolled her eyes. \"Fine, well Elliot and I are going to go to the mall. The groceries are getting delivered around 1, so try to get dressed before then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot swallowed the last of her protein bar. \"And please, actually put them away before you start eating them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than once they had returned home to find the guys had simply dragged the bags over to the couch and unloaded them straight into their greedy mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, see you later Papi.\" Carla smiled, blowing a kiss. Elliot was more demonstrative leaning over the back of the couch and kissing J.D on his chocolate-stained mouth. He pulled her in for a harder kiss, running his pudgy fingers through her hair while she groped at his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Break it up you two.\" Carla grinned, pulling Elliot away by the back of her shorts. Before they left, the girls returned from the kitchen with a gallon of ice-cream and two spoons, setting them on the coffee-table to defrost a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door had barely closed behind them when J.D reached for the ice-cream and Turk grabbed the remote, switching the channel to the VCR, and turning on one of Elliot's abandoned work-out tapes. The gyrating and girlish grunts were a pleasant background white noise while the guys ate. After a few minutes, J.D felt the familiar sensation of his hard member poking at the bottom of his pendulous belly. He squeezed a hand underneath and began to lazily play with himself, while shoveling ice-cream into his mouth with the other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the life, he thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a rattle of curtain rings, Carla emerged from the dressing room stall, wearing only lacy black underpants and matching bra. She posed, arching her back and flexing her arms, her muscles bulging tautly beneath her cocoa coloured skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice.\" Elliot nodded, who was sitting on a low chair, sipping on her protein laced smoothie. She was surrounded by bags and boxes, half filled with xxxl clothes for the guys, the other half with protein powder and workout gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so too.\" Carla smiled, admiring her muscular buns in the full length mirror. She ran her hands up her thick thighs, over her flat stomach and up on to her breasts, hefting them appreciatively. \"Maybe you should get one of these bras for JD.\" she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you buy Turk the matching thong.\" Elliot fired back. They both laughed at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you ten bucks we could get them to wear them.\" Carla grinned, returning to the stall to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I had a spare ten bucks to bet...\" Elliot sighed, draining the last of her smoothie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. Money was getting tight around the apartment, partially due to Turk and JD severely reducing the number of shifts they were working at the hospital, but mostly because of all the new expenses. Their food budget was, obviously, through the roof, closely followed by the clothes budget. Added to that was the fact that the guys had started taking taxis everywhere, rather than walking. Adding her and Carla's gym memberships, workout gear and supplements, and the fact that Elliot had just spent her last three dollars on that smoothie, it looked like they would have to rein in their spending somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should call that guy.\" Elliot mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla's head appeared around the curtain. \"Are you joking? That guy was a creep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were referring to the guy who had approached them in the fitness store. He had handed them both cards and told them he was photographer. He said they would be perfect for some ad campaigns he was working on. Carla had been skeptical, and told him to buzz off, but Elliot had held on to the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that guy wants to do is take done pictures of you in your underwear, and then you'll never hear from him again.\" Carla continued, emerging from the dressing room, carrying the bundle of lingerie to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're  right.\" Elliot sighed, as the assistant scanned the barcodes and took Carla's credit card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla snorted. \"I know I'm right, let me tell you, when I was in nursing school...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, ma'am?\" the assistant said, glancing nervously at the buff Latina and her muscular friend. \"Your account is, uh, overdrawn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla apologised and opened her purse, but found it was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot couldn't help but smile. \"Maybe we should call him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the apartment, Turk belched loud and long, his flabby cheeks wobbling. The day had cooled down a little, prompting his decision to get dressed, squeezing himself into some xxl cargo shorts (that he had to leave unbuttoned) and a large t-shirt he had won at 'Gary's Pig Out Grill\". He let the empty bag of cheese curls fall from his fingers and scratched his belly, smearing orange crumbs over his stretched t-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJD emerged from the bedroom, dressed in a similarly slovenly manner in a pair of fraying track pants, and a matching, stained t-shirt, that rode up over the swell of his beach ball stomach. He had packed the groceries away by himself, half to please Elliot, half to nab any really good stuff for himself. He had just stashed two bags of chips, a six-pack of soda and a box of chips in his bedside drawer. Just in case he needed a midnight snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk heaved himself up off the couch, with a groan of effort. He might be pretty full, but he didn't want JD to eat all the good stuff before he got some. He waddled into the kitchen, followed by JD, and soon they were both gorging competitively, rifling through cupboards and ripping open bags and boxes, struggling to squeeze past each others corpulent forms. Both guys were stuffed, but both wanted to get what they saw as their 'fair share' of the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, JD is such a pig.\" Turk thought, trying to squeeze a third donut into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as he sucked down a canister of whipped cream, JD was lost in a fantasy, where he was an almost skeletal figure next to his greedy, blimp like friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was pulled out of this fantasy when a vice-like grip closed around his arms, dragging him out of the kitchen and bundling him on to the floor. He looked up and saw Elliot looking down at him sneeringly. \"I think that's enough for now.\" Next his vision was filled with Carla badonkadonk as she stepped over him and grabbed her husband by the back of his shorts, pitching him out of the kitchen where he landed squarely on JD's belly, knocking the wind out of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth men lay in a squirming, blubbery heap, moaning and groaning. Carla and Elliot sighed, acting disappointed, but of course turned on by their partner's gluttonous antics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot couldn't help herself and jumped into the pile, resulting in another round of groans. She loved the feeling of her hard body against the soft, jiggly flesh. Carla joined in too, and soon the foursome was wrestling on the ground, Turk and JD trying to right themselves while Carla and Elliot giggled and squeezed. They were all sweating, only partially from the heat. The guys tired much sooner than the girls, but thankfully before too long Carla decided enough was enough and hauled Turk to his feet, dragging him in the direction of the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, huh, should we, hoo, follow their example?\" JD panted, his bosoms heaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot heard the bedroom door slam close and looked around. \"Why bother? She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat astride him, grinding her crotch into his lower belly, and whipped her top off. JD groaned appreciatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn.\" she said, authoritatively, grasping the neck of his shirt. With one quick motion she ripped through the cheap material, exposing JD's pale stomach and bouncing man boobs. As she motorboated him, his chubby fingers pawed at her bra strap eagerly. She licked his chest, sucking on his nipple, before sitting back up and unbuttoning her jean shorts. JD reached underneath his love handles, awkwardly trying to peel down his pants. Elliot reached beneath her legs and once again simply tore through the garment, leaving him completely naked except for his straining underpants. He was rock hard, and entered her easily. Her powerful legs planted, Elliot began thrusting, moaning as he slipped deeper inside her. The wooden floor was cool against his buttocks, and JD used his flabby arms to brace himself against the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot pumped away, massaging his swollen gut for what felt like an hour, reaching an intensity that was almost painful. Finally, she let out a piercing shout piercing shout and clenched her legs, giving JD his own, ecstatic release. JD was absolutely spent, almost catatonic, but Elliot simply stood up, seemingly none the worse for wear. She wiped herself with some kitchen towel and redid her buttons. She heard a door open and glanced over to see Carla emerging, totally nude, and just catching a glimpse of Turk's mammoth ass hanging off the side of the bed. She smiled and stretched, removing a small kink from her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor boys,\" Carla said, \"They just can't keep up, can they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot nodded knowingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>J.D. awoke, as was usual, to the sound of his stomach rumbling. Still half asleep, he instinctively reached for the bedside table, searching for a snack that would tide him over until he could get to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure there are still some Kit Kats in the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were suddenly interrupted by the realisation that his arm was stuck. Opening his eyes and tilting his head back, he saw that he was in fact handcuffed to the bedpost. Images from last night flashed through his mind, Elliot luring him to the bedroom, the jingle of the handcuffs, and then suddenly food, food, and more food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his head confirmed that his left arm was similarly bound, and though he couldn't see over the mound that was his stomach, from some experimental wiggling he could tell that while his left leg seemed to have broken free at some point during the night, Elliot's bra was still tightly securing his right ankle to the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of impotent struggling that did nothing but tire him out and cause the bed frame to creak ominously, J.D. allowed his head to fall back against the pillow. From the angle of the sun streaming through the window, it was approaching noon, and he was wondering if there was anyone home to help him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door creaked, and he froze. He prayed it wasn't Magda, the Polish maid Carla had hired to clean the apartment twice a week. He didn't think she'd react well to his current predicament, spread-eagled on the bed, buck naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice spoke, and to his relief, it was Elliot's. She sounded like she was on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... To take a few photos... Hang on a second Carla. J.D.?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't sure why he did it, but he didn't answer. Elliot sat down on the bed, the edge sagging beneath her bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, he's still asleep.\" she said, squeezing his little toe between her muscular fingers. \"Frickin' hell, even his feet are getting fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D. frowned, though thankfully Elliot couldn't see his face. Sure, he'd gotten a little chubby...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which,\" Elliot continued, \"Could you pick up a few more refills of Fettrex? The guys have been munching on them like they're Skittles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla said something that made Elliot snort with laughter. \"I know, I've started giving him them with everything too. Last night he asked for some indigestion tablets, and ten minutes later he was pigging out again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D.'s mind was reeling. What was she talking about? The little green pills? But they were vitamins, he'd been taking them since...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, gotta go. I'll see you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hung up and immediately turned and began shaking J.D. By his meaty shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pantomimed waking up, acting surprised to see her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. She was wearing her light blue scrubs, probably a size smaller then she needed, as she didn't like to hide her physique beneath the baggy material. As she stood up he caught a glimpse of her washboard abs beneath her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you out of here and get you some food, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly untied the bra from around his ankle, but when it came to the handcuffs she paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I left the keys on the night stand.\" she mused aloud. They must have gotten knocked off during the night, and were now buried somewhere in the debris of food wrappers and discarded clothes covering the bedroom floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned. \"This could take a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D's stomach gurgled impatiently, and he blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I hear you.\" Elliot grinned. Taking hold of the chain with both hands, Elliot began to pull in either direction, and with a brief grunt, snapped the thin metal links. She leaned over J.D., her perky breasts brushing his face, and quickly gave the other set of cuffs the same treatment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D sighed with relief, sitting up, the cuffs still dangling around his wrists as Elliot helped him to his feet. She placed her hands on his Buddha belly and rubbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you sorted out shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D really wanted to ask her about the Fettrex, but on the other hand, there was no point arguing on an empty stomach. He would confront her after breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's hand slid down and grabbed his member, which had sprung to attention at the mention of food. \"And then maybe we'll deal with this?\" she asked coquettishly, giving it an almost painful squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it could wait a little while longer, J.D. thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What was that name again?\" Turk asked for the twentieth time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D. almost dropped the phone in frustration. \"It's Fettrex, Turk, Fettrex!\" he yelled as he opened the door to Carla and Turk's bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One t or two?\" he asked, causing J.D. to groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Turk, just try both.\" J.D. said finally. Turk was currently in a research space at Sacred Heart, trying to find out about the little green pills, while J.D. snooped around at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to begin with the dresser, setting the phone down on top of it and enabling the loudspeaker. He pulled open the top drawer, but it just full of clothes that Turk could no longer fit into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the phone, he heard a belch and the clacking of computer keys as Turk finally got to work. \"There's a Wikipedia page for Fettrex with two ts, but its only two sentences long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do the two sentences say?\" J.D. asked impatiently, shunting the drawer back in place and opening the next one. More outgrown clothes, Carla's this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, are you the one taking time from his lunch in a dusty computer lab with little kiddy chairs?\" Turk shot back. His massive ass had been too big for the chairs, forcing him to balance each cheek on a separate one. \"It just says who developed it and the registration number.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try the registration number in the hospital database.\" J.D suggested, his arms already aching from the exertion as he pulled open the drawer. It held some more clothes, but also a hidden box of cookies, which he quickly devoured, as Turk clicked and typed with one hand, holding a giant hoagie in the other. The next drawer down held Carla's lacy underthings, so he spent a few minutes pawing through that before hitting the mother lode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the final drawer, bending down awkwardly over his belly and tits, underneath a layer of bedsheets, he found what he was looking for. There was a leather horsewhip, a few pairs of handcuffs, a large dildo, even a ball gag, but what really caught J.D.'s attention was an old Polaroid camera, with a purple photo album sitting underneath. He lifted it up and opened it to the front page. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started out pretty normally, just a few shots of Turk, some of them with Carla, some without. At the hospital, in the apartment, just an average photo album. It got interesting about four pages in. A whole page was dedicated to wedding photos, one of Turk and Carla feeding each other wedding cake, the other a professionally done wedding portrait, with Turk and Carla smiling blissfully in front of the reception hall. 'The beginning of a beautiful relationship' was the caption Carla had written below the first one, while the second just had an arrow drawn in with red Sharpie, leading to a circle around Turk's stomach, which seemed to be sticking out a little beneath his cummerbund. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next were clearly from the honeymoon, some posed, other candid. Some were quite explicit, but J.D. hardly batted an eye. Living in close quarters over the summer had exposed all four of them to situations that had at first been embarrassing, but soon became run of the mill. In all the photos, special attention seemed to be being paid to Turk's belly, which increased in size with every picture. Soon the weight gain became obvious all over his body, especially in one shot of him running into the surf, totally nude, butt cheeks caught in mid-jiggle. One picture simply showed Turk's swim trunks lying on a tiled floor, a large rip clearly visible right down the middle. 'Only five days in!' read the hastily scribbled caption. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the honeymoon pictures ended, and J.D. was treated to some shots of himself alongside Turk. In some he was smiling for the camera, in others he was eating, cheeks bulging with food. One showed both him and Turk squashed together on the couch, clearly in food comas judging by the amount of debris littering the coffee table. In this one Carla had squeezed in between them, almost disappearing beneath their mounds of flesh. He supposed Elliot must have been holding the camera. This was confirmed when he turned the page and saw they had switch places, Elliot cuddling up between their bloated bellies, nibbling on his ear lobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most recent picture showed Turk lying face down on his bed, his giant ass pointed straight at the camera. The book was about three quarters full, but their will still plenty of blank pages to be filled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D. could hardly believe it, and sat down on Turk and Carla's bed, placing a hand on his beach ball belly. Turk's voice suddenly broke in over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it! Fettrex, an appetite enhancement and weight gain stimulation drug, used to treat anorexia and malnourishment. The hospital started ordering it in last spring, and has reordered about a crate every month.\" Turk took another bite of sandwich as a reward. \"What's this about anyway?\" he asked, through a mouthful of turkey and ham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D. gulped, reaching for a bag of chips next to the bed stand. That sealed it. Carla and Elliot had been fattening them up!</span></div></div>",

Arriving at the address he had given them, they shared a glance when he pointed them down to the basement, but what they found was a professional looking studio, complete with a make-up chair and a small hospitality area. Reassured, they stripped down to their bikinis and fixed their hair and make-up in the vanity mirror, before stepping in front of the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were a little reserved at first, the muscle-bound pair soon loosened up, enjoying showing off their sculpted bodies. They posed, flexing and tensing, twisting and turning to show off every bulging muscle, as the camera whirred and flashed. After a while the photographer asked for individual shots, and Carla went first, while Elliot stood behind the camera, shouting more and more outrageous suggestions for poses, which Carla reciprocated when it was Elliot's turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final flash and a few rapid clicks, the photographer told Elliot they were finished. She stepped down and gratefully accepted the bottle of water Carla handed her, chugging half of it in one gulp. After a brief chat with the photographer about the pictures, Carla brought up the issue of money. Instantly the photographer pulled two envelopes out if his pocket and handed them over, telling them their was a hundred dollars in each, and that their would probably be more once he submitted these photos to the agencies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Carla and Elliot were pretty satisfied with a hundred dollars for 'work' that had taken under an hour. They got redressed and headed back out to their car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Carla said as she sat into the driver's seat, \"I guess you were right about that guy not just being a creep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot nodded, still feeling a little giddy with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still,\" Carla continued, \"I suppose other supermodels don't go straight from the shoot to pick up dinner for their less -than-super husbands and boyfriends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey drove to a fast-food place quite near the apartment, where the two muscular women ordering enough food for ten people no longer drew that much attention from the staff. After ordering three dozen cheeseburgers and twenty orders of fries, and stopping at a bodega to pick up a few pallets of beer and a couple of gallons of ice-cream, they made their way back to the apartment. As they stood in the elevator surrounded by their purchases, Carla did the math. This meal had already accounted for over half of the money they had just earned. Elliot frowned as they arrived at their floor, hoisting up the heavy bags easily. It seemed modelling wasn't going to be the easy a solution to their money problems that she had hoped for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the apartment, they found Turk sprawled on the couch. He had returned from work, but hadn't bothered to change out of his straining scrubs, the minor exertions of his day obviously having exhausted the small reserves of energy he had. He looked like he was asleep, but the smell of burgers quickly caused his eyes to snap open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food!\" He yelled happily, wiping some sleep drool from his chin. This brought a crash from the bedroom, and the sound of lumbering footsteps as JD appeared in the hallway, still dressed only a pair of boxer shorts. Elliot tutted theatrically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JD, did you not get dressed at all today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" He mumbled, staring fixedly at the bag of food in his girlfriend's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot sighed, like a long-suffering but indulgent mother. \"Go get dressed, then maybe you can have some burgers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that, she leaned over and emptied them out on to the coffee table. Turk dug in with a gleeful yell, and JD instinctively took a step towards the food, but Carla stride forward and blocked his way, shaking her head with mock sadness. JD opened his mouth to speak, but thought better of it, instead turning around and hurrying to the bedroom, his big belly bouncing of the doorframe in his haste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla and Elliot laughed, turning to watch as Turk tried to take full advantage by eating as fast as he possibly could. After cramming two orders of fries in his mouth and washing them down with a beer, he seemed to remember something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was the shoot?\" He asked, through a mouthful of beef and cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla smiled, dabbing some sauce from his chin with a napkin. \"It was actually really fun, plus we got paid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk swallowed. \"He didn't try anything, did he? Because I can go down there and kick his ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla doubted her husband could get off the couch without help, but it was still sweet. \"Thanks papi, but no, he was a perfect gentlemen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJD finally emerged, having squeezed himself into a pair of scrubs pants and pulled one of Elliot's gym t-shirts over his head, which just about covered his jiggling man breasts. He sat down next to Turk, the couch creaking and squeaking in protest, and almost choked as he shoved three burgers into his mouth at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching for a few more minutes and taking two burgers and an order of fries for themselves, Carla and Elliot left them to it, the initial feeding frenzy having slowed into a methodical binge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they left, JD watched them go. He still hadn't told Turk the significance of their earlier investigation, because he still didn't know what he was going to do about it. He grabbed another handful of fries, glancing down at his enormously fattened body. Even if he wanted revenge, what could he do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The silver scoop dropped alongside the couch, and a huge empty tub of cookie dough ice cream rolled lazily down his manboobs and across the long shelf of his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough bleary eyes JD watched for a moment as the tub teetered on the edge of his massive gut, before apparently considering the jump to dangerous and rolling back to bump gently against his man boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted and burped again. Stuffed with a dozen burgers and numerous packs of fries, a gallon of beer and a gallon of ice cream, his stomach was almost impossibly full and round, pinning him to the sofa and bulging so far forward that even a tumbling ice-cream tub lacked the momentum to make it off the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWedged next to him, Turk was snoring soundly. In his desire to cram down as many burgers as possible before JD joined the meal, Turk had eaten too fast and worn himself out, falling asleep after eight burgers and four packs of fries, leaving his buddy with a larger share of the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had suited JD just fine. He'd eaten the huge amount that constituted his fill, and then had a hefty second helping to boot. He looked at his enormous gut, heaving up and down before him, packed and straining beyond capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coo-ee!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJD lifted his sleepy eyes over the summit of his stomach to see Elliot grinning, leaning against the doorframe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get enough to eat baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Buh-hurp!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot smirked. \"Just as I thought.\" She sauntered into the room, and gave her boyfriend a kiss on the cheek. Then, standing up, she flicked the empty ice cream tub off his swollen belly and set down a saucer in its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what gives!\" grunted JD, feeling the cold china touch his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for your vitamins!\" Elliot patted the underside of her boyfriend's heaving dome of a belly and nodded at the saucer. \"After a big meal like that, I thought'd you'd need an extra large dose. They help with digestion too.\" She leaned forward, and reached her arms wide to plac a hand on either side of JD's massive belly, rubbing his flanks softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And from how tight your tummy feels, I'd say you've got a loooot of digestin' to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elliot coninued to rub, JD looked down grogily at the saucer, on which sat four small green pills. In his food-dazed state and with the pleasant sensation of his girlfriend's fingers massagin his gut, he was struggling to think straight. But just as he was about to scarf the pills, he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFettrex!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFingers paused above the plate, JD glanced up to see Elliot looking down at him with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?</span></div></div>",

But just as he was about to knock them off his stomach and call out Elliot about the whole scheme, a thought suddenly struck him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd spent so much time thinking how to get revenge at the girls that he'd never considered <i>why</i> they'd been trying to fatten him and Turk up in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere could only be one reason, really, and Eliot's hands on his gut had confirmed it: the girls were fattening them up because they <i>wanted</i> then fat: they liked their men fat. It was pretty obvious now he thought about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe million dollar question was, how could he and Turk work it to their advantage, and get their revenge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of silent thought, he looked up at Elliot with a smile. \"You're right babe!\" he said, swipomg the pills from the plate and shoved them into his mouth, swallowing hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact,\" he added, stifling another burp, \"I think I could use a couple more.\" JD put a hand to his vast gut. \"I feel a little woozy in here already - don't think that twelfth burger's agreeing with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot hesitated. JD had eaten a huge amount, even by his greedy standards. She'd given him the pills with the hope that in an hour or so he'd be ready to put a serious dent in the big chocolate cake out in the kitchen. If he had a bigger dose, he might try to eat the entire thing - which would be a whole lot on top of what he'd devoured already. She looked at JD's gigantic pulsating orb of a belly, stuffed ot the max with a greedy feast of burgers, fries and ice cream. Could he really take that much more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, the thought of her boyfriend gorging himself to even greater extremes was quite a turn on. And...well, she didn't want him to get suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments she made up her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing sweetie,\" Elliot smiled, turning to head for the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she departed, JD grinned, linking his hands behind his head. His plan was in motion. For too long the girls had been playing him and Turk for fools. So they wanted their men fat, did they? Fine. He'd show them fat; and damn wel make them work for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJD leaned back, accepting the second round of pills from a slightly nervous looking Elliot, who'd already returned from the kitchen. The best part of his plan was that he and Turk would get to keep eating like kings - better even! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at his own genius, he closed his eyes for a little nap, his majestic belly beginning to gurgle noisily as the Fettrex worked its magic.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>GLEEEUURRRRP MUNCH BAAAH-HUUURRRP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBouncing off the doorframe, Elliot staggered into the kitchen. Panting hard she rested both palms heavily on the table and looked across the room towards the oven. A wide, muscular ass clad in fine lycra jogging bottoms blocked her view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How<i> oof wheeze</i> long now?\" she puffed, brushing a strand of blonde hair from her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CRUNCH SLUUURRRP GULP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla's reply was drowned out by the raucous sound of gluttonous gorging, pounding through the apparently paper-thin wall from living room, where the men in their lives were engaged in a frenzied, fetterex-fuelled feast of fried chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon <i>hufff</i> Carla!\" Elliot called, taking advantage of a rare lull in the sounds of consumption and the crackle of greasy paper, as the boys no doubt tossed aside empty family buckets and began to hastily unwrap zinger towers. \"Those burgers won't hold them much longer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Even if there are ten each</i>, she added quietly to herself, dropping her firm, athletic haunches into a chair for respite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the gutteral racket of eating soon resumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>GOBBLE UUURRFF SLURRPP MUNCH</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, just, urf, a couple more minutes.\" Carla slammed the oven door shut and rose to her feet, padding over to take the char next to Elliot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments, the two young doctors sat slumped in the kitchen chairs, listening to what could best be described as an awful, cacophonous rock concert of gluttony coming from the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuelled by huge doses of fetterex, JD and Turk's already gargantuan appetites had for the past month been at maximum overdrive, but today was beyond anything Elliot and Carla had experienced. It had begun pretty much as normal, the girls heading out for their hour-long dawnbreak run, returning just in time to cook a vast six course breakfast including mounds of bacon, egg and sausage, and stacks of pancakes and waffles that almost touched the ceiling. The smell was enough to rouse their lethargic lovers - but, as had become the norm recently, not enough to entice the hefty guys out of the sack. So, Elliot and Carla had once again served their mountainous men a colossal breakfast in bed, by the end of which even the reinforced steel frames were creaking in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result had been pretty predictable: indigestion, and urgent requests for those magic green pills to ease their gurgling overfed tummies. A matter of minutes after the fetterex had been gulped down, the guys had been ravenous once again. Thus breakfast was been closely followed by an epic brunch of burgers, donuts and eclairs, which the girls picked up during their mid-morning jog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscussing how to prodouce an affordable dinner as they returned from their Saturday afternoon gym session, Elliott and Carla were shocked by the sight of a Dominos delivery boy, totting a leaning tower of pizzas towards their front door, JD and Turk having apparently been too hungry to wait for lunch, despite their enormous brunch. As the girls showered, the guys comsumed four sixteen-inch meat feast pizzas each at competitive speed while lounging on the couches (Elliot had recently had to buy a second sofa, so they could have one each) bellies rising towards the ceiling as they stuffed down greasy slices in quick succession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet despite leaving the guys with a tableful of chocolates and bonbons to snack on when they went for their 6pm photo shoot (obviously they told JD and Turk they were going back to the gym for an extra workout), Elliot and Carla had been utterly gobsmacked to return, just over an hour ago to the smelll and sight of an entire battery farm's worth of fried chicken takout covering the coffee table and a good part of the floor as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>GLUURRP UUMMPH MUNCH CRUNCH SLURRP  Ping!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot was startled out of her thoughts by a ping which she initially mistook for another button popping off one of the guys shirts in the living room. Just as she was cursing JD for ruining another shirt, she realised it was the oven - and remembered that the guys were wearing t-shirts anyway: t-shirts that had already ridden up all the way to their \"pecs\" thanks to the sheer amount their huge wobbling stomachs had expanded over a day of near-constant gorging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carla got up to attend to the pies, Elliot sighed. It was pretty obvious what had happened. The guys had taken more pills when they'd gone to the gym, probably after getting stomachache from all those sweets and choccies they'd left out, and the extra fetterex had rekindled their colossal hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing back her blonde hair, the athletic medic frowned. It was a trend that was happening more and more: JD and Turk requesting more fetterex to \"improve their health\" or ease their indigestion, with the result that they were clamouring for more and more food more and more frequently. And as much as it was a major turn on for both her and Carla, it had left the household finances almost as ridiculously stretched as JD and Turk's gigantic balloon-like stomachs. The girls had maxed out the number of photoshoots they did and took as many shifts at the hospital as they could manage shifts (picking up a slack left by the boys, who lacked the energy to do more than a couple a week). Constantly tired, and with less time to work out, Elliot and Carla had to cut down their gym attendance significantly - though the workout they got from running around after their increasingly lazy and demanding mates went some way to making up for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was the part that annoyed Elliot the most. Previously, she and Carla had been fully in control, thanks to their superior strength: setting meal times, denying the guys extra helpings until they'd got dressed, forcing them to get out of bed for breakfast and so on. Since the boys had gone on their fetterex health kick, however, there had been a subtle shift of power. Despite being ridiculously fat and impossibly lazy, JD and Turk - or at least their stomachs - seemed, somehow, to rule the roost. Again, the fetterex was to blame. Taking so much of it, the guys were constantly beset by terrible hunger pangs, had were always whinging like overgrown babies for more food, clutching and stroking their bulbous bellies and groaning in dismay in a way that made the girls weak at the knees to the point that, overwhelmed with lust, they always gave in to their demands - serving breakfast in bed, rushing out for pastries to satisfy a sudden craving, baking apple pies like dutiful housewives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot shook her head. This had to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what could she do? JD was such a hypercondriac. After months of plying him with the little green pills, if she turned round now and said there were bad side effects for taking too many, he'd surely panic and look them up. Substituting a placebo would be too obvious: the pills were a very distinctive shape. And there was no way she could confess the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dismayed doctor sighed. She was caught between a rock and a hard place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe of course had no idea that it was all intentional on the guys part: that JD had found out her plan to fatten them, and that he and Turk were purposefully taking more pills to make the girls work like slaves -  at home and at work - to keep their voraceous men contentedly fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the pots and pans dangling above Elliot's head began to tremble and clang, as two long gargantuan belches sounded from the living room, almost causing the walls to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two worn-out women looked at one another. That was their cue. Hauling herself up from the chair, she accepted the vast apple pie that Carla handed her. The thing was monstrous, around ten inches high and sixteen in circumferences, loaded with enough sugar and cream to sink a battleship, and pulsating with heat despite being left to stand to cool for five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin another five, it would be just another flabby bulge on JD's spherical belly or beachball sized ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot sighed. Right now, she just hoped it would be enough to send him into a food coma. A glance at Carla confirmed that she was having similar thoughts about Turk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, the pie-totting pair trotted towards the living room, where their lovers, and their stomachs, awaited.</span></div></div>",

When Elliot moved in she took a spare bedroom and convert into her office and walked in closet.

Shouldn\u2019t your family have called you instead?\u201d said Carla as she held Elliot in a comforting hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI cut all contact with my mom and my dad. During my childhood my mom was a bit abusive so I do not keep in touch wither since college. My dad supported me into <br>\r\ngoing into medicine but not the field I wanted so he cut off paying for college and I had to get a job. After that I cut off all connection with him and my brother are so-so as some keep in contact while other don\u2019t call me. The only family member I really love was my great aunt Charlotte. When home was becoming too much I went to my great aunt Charlotte. She married this very wealthy southerner man and they couple became my loving parent like figure. I remember she and I would cook up southern food dishes in her kitchen and playing hide and seek in her large house. \u201csaid Elliot as she slowly stopped crying and smiled from all the good memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell when is the funeral?\u201d asked Carla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext week.

Soon his entire plate was licked clean and he moved on the his steak sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow Turk!\" Carla exclaimed, who had not even half finished her snacks, \"This is a long flight, you can slow down, and anyway we have dinner reservations when we arrive.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is a long flight. I won't be full by the end. Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk finished eating his steak meal and his belly was bloated to the max. He loosened his seat belt and went to sleep. He hadn't slept all night because of the early departure. Carla fell asleep to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane ride went pretty fast after they fell asleep and when they woke up there were only three hours left. Turk ordered some snacks and finished the remained of the trip watching the end of the in flight movie. When they landed in Figi it was around 6 at night. The two got their luggage and checked into their villa for their two week honeymoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Our reservations are a 8 so we only have 45 minutes.\" Carla said.<br>\r\n\"Yup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk jumped on the bed while Carla went off to shower. Turk sat on the bed and watched t.v. Carla finished her shower and got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look beautiful.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Turk, now you better get ready or else we'll be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk showered and got dressed and off they went to dinner at Ohana Restaurant. When they got there the dining room was dimly lit by candle light and each table was separated by a loose translucent sheet. The tables were covered in rose petals and there was a bottle of champagne cooling for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How gorgeous,\" Carla whispered to Turk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat down and ordered. Carla got the Lemon Grass and pan-seered Mahi-Mahi. Turk got the all you can eat seafood medley and the side of fries and onion strings. Their food came and Turk dug in. He finished his first plate of seafood and sent out for the next. While he was waiting he chowed down on the fries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry much?\" Carla asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, plus we're paying for this so we might as well eat it all.\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, its already paid for...this is an all expense paid trip.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's what I meant. Eat up.\"<br>\r\n\"Anyway what do you want to do tomorrow? I was thinking we go spend the day at the beach.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah that sounds awesome. The view from our villa was amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk continued taking advantage of his all expense paid trip...getting three more plates of seafood. He felt his shorts getting tighter and undid his belt and unbuttoned. He didn't care it was pretty dark in the restaurant and it was pretty private. Turk was relieved by the release of his bloated belly. It fell onto his lap and stretched the elastic band on his underwear. His belly was pushing up against his silk button up but it felt strangely good. The waitress returned and noticed Turk's belly predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will their be any dessert for our stuffed guests? or are you too full?\"<br>\r\nTurk quickly added that he would have the, \"Tiramisu, Chocolate Eclair, and the Island Fruit Cheesecake.\"<br>\r\n\"Looks like you found one with quite an appetite on him,\" the waitress said to Carla.<br>\r\n\"I know, he's not usually such a food vacuum, but its our honeymoon and its an all expense paid trip.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh we get that all the time, but it can do some real damage to the waistline...I've seen it happen.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...but its only two weeks...what's the worst that could happen?\"<br>\r\n\"Anyway can I get you anything for dessert..he seems pretty set over there.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure I'll just have a slice of the Raspberry Summer Sensation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the desserts were coming Carla moved closer to Turk and saw his bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at my big tubby hubby,\" Carla remarked as she patted his belly.<br>\r\n\"I love you Carla.\"<br>\r\n\"I love you too Turk.\" Carla began to rub his belly as she rested her head on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDessert finally came and Turk ate his Tiramisu and eclair with ease. His stomach has gone down and the rubbing felt so good. He struggled to finish the cheesecake, but Carla fed him the cheesecake and the rest of her cake. Turks belly was very big and Carla rubbed it again. Turk loved the sensation of his tight skin and expanded belly being rubbed and caress. Finally they finished dinner and Carla and Turk got up to leave. Turk had forgotten that he had undone his pants and sucked it in to close the button, and do up the belt. He then let his belly out and it pushed against his shorts again. They made their way back to the villa and settled done for the night. Carla went into the bathroom and \"freshened-up\". while she was in there, Turk undid his belt again and his belly again filled out and Turk took his shorts off and his shirt as well. He laid on the bed in his underwear with his plump belly sticking out. Carla emerged in sexy negligee. She jumped on the bed and laid atop Turk. Her hands worked their way over Turks body and felt his meaty thighs and made their way to his firm filled belly with a soft layer of fat, she stayed at his belly for a while caressing it with her hands and then kissing it. Her hands were like magic and made Turk very excited. Carla felt his softened pecs and then they finished their night making love and Turk fell asleep the happiest he could ever remember.</span></div></div>",

Here get you swimsuit on.\"<br>\r\nShe tossed him the swimsuit, it was from last season and looked a little small.<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll just get it on at the beach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey packed up and started down to the beach, but not before Turk scarfed down a plate of pancakes, two bagels, and a bowl of fruit. Turk threw on his button up shirt and off they went. When they got to the beach Carla set up their spot with towels, lounge chairs and an umbrella. Turk went to the changing room and put on his swim suit. It was little tight. The elastic was all the way out and his little layer of fat pushed out over the waistband. Turk walked out and over to Carla. Carla poked at his belly fat,<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone's suit is a little snug.\"<br>\r\n\"Well I did put on a little weight over the wedding planning because I picked up extra hospital shifts to help pay for the honeymoon.\"<br>\r\n\"And the way you ate late night certain didn't do anything to help.\"<br>\r\n\"So I haven't been able to get to the gym in a couple months...its only a little weight and I could lose it fast.\"</span></div></div>",

He ordered lunch from the cabana boy. Turk ate one club sandwich, two orders of pasta, one loaf of bread, a cup of soup, and a medley of desserts. Carla sat on the beach and feed he growing husband. Turk sat on the lounge chair with his ever expanding gut. Carla continued to feed Turk even when he slowed his pace she rubbed his gut and forced more food down. Turk kept eating all day. His belly was so full and he had undone the strings of his swimsuit long ago. His belly stretched full and round. His button up hardly buttoned, but it held until Turk and Carla were able to make it to their villa. Turk slowly made his way to the bedroom and changed clothes. Carla followed and helped; she grabbed Turk around his expansive gut and began to undo his button up. Turk's belly pressed on his swimsuit. Turk removed his swimsuit and pulled up a fresh pair of underwear. The underwear was small and he could feel it stretch around his thickened thighs and softly caress his fatten ass. His meaty bubble butt filled the underwear to their limit, and the only pants that fit were his elastic sweatpants. He then put on his under armor gym shirt. The spandex showed his thick softened pecs and huge filled belly. Carla ran her hands over the cool spandex and began to feed Turk again.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the next two weeks, the love struck pair fell into a delightful routine. They would wake up early, and eagerly head down to the dining room, where Carla would do her best to transfer the entire breakfast buffet into Turk's stomach. Waffles, bacon, bagels, scrambled eggs... everything. When service ended, Carla would grab a few boxes of pastries and lead her bloated husband back to their suite for an extended sex and stuffing session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround noon, when Turk could eat no more, Carla would head to the beach or into town, leaving him a little time to rest and recuperate. He would laze around and watch TV, usually massaging his stuffed gut and snacking on sweets from the minibar, dressed only in a pair of tight boxer shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Carla returned, usually around two and always with some sort of fattening treat, they would get ready for the beach. Carla loved rubbing sun cream into Turk's softening body, especially his rounded potbelly. Turk enjoyed it as well, and became so aroused that the application was always interrupted by an impromptu lovemaking session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they got to the beach, and Turk had squeezed into a swimsuit that was rapidly becoming indecent, most of the heat was gone from the day. That didn't prevent Carla from insisting that Turk 'cool down' with an array of ice-creams, ice pops and ice cold sodas. No sooner had the growing surgeon finished one delicacy then another was being pressed upon him by his doting wife, who was constantly darting back and forth between their parasol and the concession stand.  She would sometimes feed him herself, shoving the thick ice-cream into his mouth with girlish glee. For Turk, it was like being in heaven. Sun, sex, plenty of food and a smoking hot wife who loved to watch him grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching the sunset from the comfort of their deckchairs, they would head back to the hotel and shower (together), before heading out for dinner. Turk would wear his loosest shirt, loving the feeling as it got tighter and tighter as he ate. Wherever they went to eat, he would always order enough for three people, while Carla made sure to order food that she knew Turk would love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would eat until he was stuffed, and then Carla would feed him the rest, ignoring his moans of protest. By the time they staggered back to their room, Turk would be looking about  nine months pregnant, and would collapse heavily on to the bed. Carla would delicately remove his straining clothes and rub his swollen belly, giggling as it gurgled, before straddling her chubby hubby and making love into the small hours of the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this excess had a price, of course, and the effects were soon to be seen on the once athletic young man's frame. Eating all day, every day had meant he gained weight at an unbelievable rate. His belly bulged outwards magnificently, hanging over the waistband of his pants, with doughy love handles forming on either side. His butt expanded, stretching the seat of his underwear until the curve of his butt cheeks was clearly visible through the thin material. His legs had also gained, and even the legs of his swim trunks cut into his chunky thighs. <br>\r\nBy the fourth day of the honeymoon, he had had to buy new shorts, and on the seventh day he burst his way out of his only remaining shirt, a fact that drove Carla wild. She had put on a little weight herself, as watching Turk eat made her hungry as well as horny. It was a modest gain, a small pot belly and a little extra jiggle in her step, and it paled in comparison to Turk\u2019s, who had moved way past potbelly and was well into beer gut territory. By the final morning of the trip, Turk was fat, Carla was chubby, and they had both never been happier.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sun was splitting the stones, but a light breeze kept it from becoming too hot. The only sound was the gentle lapping of the waves.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristopher Turk, M.D, was oblivious to all this however, as he was currently passed out on a king size bed, the sheets crumpled and stained, his meaty ass sticking up in the air in a rather undignified manner. He was clad only in a pair of navy blue boxers, which were stretched to their limit. He sighed happily in his sleep.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the idyllic silence was broken.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Turk! Turk! Wake up!\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese final two words were punctuated with a sharp slap on the butt, which was sufficient to rouse the dozing doctor from his slumber. He rolled over with a moan, feeling the food shift inside his massive belly, and glared at Carla.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do that for?\" he asked, brushing some crumbs of his flabby chest. They had just enjoyed another late morning stuffing, and Carla usually allowed him to sleep it off. Usually. \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday she was adamant that he get up.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're leaving tomorrow Papi,\" she explained, \"and you need something to wear on the plane. I doubt you'll get away with an open shirt and pants you can't even buckle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you do it by yourself?\" he whined, scratching his wide rear.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla sat down on the bed and rubbed her husband's belly.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you come, I'll let you watch while I try on underwear...\" she purred seductively.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk was unconvinced, but Carla still had an ace up her sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus,\" she continued, \"There's an all-you-can-eat special today at...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Turk didn't need to hear any more. With a surprising burst of speed, he was out of bed and out the door. \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla laughed and called after him.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you get dressed first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed, Carla helping to pull Turk's shorts up over his chubby thighs, and stretching his largest t-shirt down over his stomach, the lovestruck took a shuttle bus into town. Turk's bulging belly garnered a few stares and whispers, but before too long he found himself standing in a bright and vibrant market square.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an almost carnival atmosphere, and as he took in the sights he regretted having spent most of the trip never leaving the resort. Partly because of the missed cultural experience, but mostly because the plaza was packed with food! Stalls selling fish, chicken, and various curries, as well as various cakes and puddings. The air was permeated with a mixture of spices, turmeric, cumin, coriander... Turk's mouth was watering visibly as he tried to decide what to have first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he made a move towards a particularly fragrant curry stand, he found himself being restrained. Looking back, he saw that Carla had grabbed the waistband of his shorts, giving him a slight wedgie.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh. Shopping first, then food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk was shocked. \"But, I thought you liked me, you know...\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed at his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Papi,\" she smiled, her hand slipping down to squeeze his right butt cheek, \"of course I do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezed a little harder, causing her husband to wince. \u00a0\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't mean that I'm not still in charge.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought marriage was supposed to be about compromise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla began to laugh, long and loud, and walked away.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk took one last longing look at the food, his stomach rumbling, before stomping off petulantly. \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, try this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForty minutes later and Turk was feeling hungrier then ever. This had to be the longest period of the honeymoon he'd gone without food.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while he was in a hurry, Carla was taking her sweet time. \u00a0She wandered through the small, cramped clothes shop, pausing occasionally to pick out a few items, holding them up against Turk's torso and frowning as she considered how they would look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk's stomach let out another growl of hunger, and he impatiently checked his watch.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please baby!\" he complained, \"I'm starving here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I doubt you're going to waste away.\" Carla quipped, patting his hefty gut. \"Now, go try these on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk groaned and, taking the clothes, headed for the dressing room, a small wooden cubicle separated from the rest of the shop by a tattered curtain.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped inside and removed his sweaty t-shirt, letting it fall to the ground. He tried on the clothes Carla had given him and was delighted to find they fit him, and were nice and loose around his stomach, a pleasant contrast to his constrictive shorts. \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're good to go baby,\" Turk called, \"They fit great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see.\" Carla replied, opening the curtain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked him up and down, and nodded.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk smiled gleefully.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we can go get lunch now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla shook her head.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think we should get you some new shorts before you bust out of those ones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla tutted and closed the curtain again.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling aggrieved, Turk bent down to pick up his discarded shirt.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u00a0felt\u00a0a\u00a0sudden\u00a0coolness\u00a0as his straining pants ripped off him, right along the seams, revealing his snug boxers and wobbling butt cheeks. \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...\" Turk sighed, enjoying the feeling of freedom, and rubbing the places where the waistband had cut into his chubby hips.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla's arm appeared, brandishing a pair of large billowing shorts.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks sweetness!\" Turk cried.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rain battered the windows of the terminal as the passengers of flight 136-B from Fiji filtered through the gate. There was a general pall of dismay hanging over the crowd, the driving rain having washed away any lingering feelings of relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That flight really flew by, didn't it?\" Carla grinned, putting down her bag and stretching broadly, her dark green sundress rippling as she shook the stiffness out of her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk, wearing a baggy blue t-shirt and a pair of snug brown cargo shorts, didn't reply. While his wife had settled down and slept for most of the nine hour flight, he just hadn't been able to get comfortable. For one, his rounder butt had become just a little too big for the seat, while the seatbelt had cut painfully into his larger belly. The in-flight movie had been awful and the kid sitting behind him had kicked his seat the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that would have been bearable if minor turbulence hadn't interrupted the dinner service just before it reached him, meaning he'd had to survive on the small packets of roasted peanuts they'd been given just before take-off. As a result, he had a powerful gnawing in his gut, and he was just about to suggest they get some food when he heard Carla cry out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot!\" she moaned, rifling through her handbag, \"I must have left my sunglasses on the plane! Wait here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She stuffed the bag into his hands and hurried off in the direction of the gate. He glanced down and saw a small bundle of crumpled dollar bills peeking out from the open purse. Looking up again, he couldn't help but notice a fast-food outlet, just beyond the baggage carousel...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla returned, shades in hand, to find her husband brandishing a bag of burgers, of which he had already helped himself to two, and was now starting on a third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got you a chicken sandwich,\" he said, through a mouthful of hamburger, sauce dripping down his chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla just looked on slightly bemused, until she noticed the discarded handbag lying by his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turk,\" she began, in a severe tone, \"Tell me you didn't just spend our cab money on burgers.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter opening their luggage and searching through the contents (which Turk used as an excuse to break open one of the giant Toblerones from the duty-free), they managed to cobble together enough change to pay for the bus which, after waiting in the pouring rain for more than twenty minutes, they caught. After a jolting, joyless bus ride they finally arrived at their apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The door burst open, and Carla and Turk trudged in, water dripping from their clothes, lugging their suitcases behind them. As soon as the bags were dropped and the door was closed, Carla announced her intention to have a hot shower. Turk simply leaned against the kitchen counter, trying to catch his breath. The journey up the three flights of stairs had been a lot harder than he remembered, even without the two large suitcases. He only stirred when Carla asked him to take off all his clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now?\" he asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Carla rolled her eyes. \"For the laundry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk complied, pulling off his shirt and handing it to her, before popping the button on his water-logged shorts, which dropped soggily around his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nearly nude Turk then followed his wife into the bedroom, but as she continued on into the bathroom he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror and stopped, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was huge! He almost didn't recognise the fat man staring back at him. He pushed out his belly, large and round, sticking out a good five inches over his straining black boxer shorts. Turning slightly he saw that his ass had grown into a meaty bubble butt, that jiggled slightly as he scratched it. His gain was noticeable in other places too, a softening of the pecs, a thickening of the thighs. He was shocked. He knew he had been putting on weight, of course he did, but... Fiji had felt like a fantasy, a dream, and now he was waking up to harsh reality. He poked his midsection, feeling its softness, until he noticed Carla standing in the doorway, watching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She had removed her sodden sundress, and now wore only her white cotton panties and matching bra, still slightly damp from the rain. She had put on a little weight as well, and now sported a small potbelly, but it was nothing, nothing compared to how big he had become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis insecurity got the better of him. \"Do you think I...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...am looking very sexy?\" she interrupted playfully, \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Turk was unconvinced. \"But am I getting...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...sexier and sexier every day?\" she interrupted again, walking over and placing a hand on his stomach, \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Turk frowned, \"But do I need to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"...take a shower? Definitely yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She laughed and gave him a peck on the cheek, their bellies squishing together, before turning around and heading back into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk took another look in the mirror, rubbing his big belly. If Carla liked it, and he was enjoying it, what was the harm if he put on a few pounds?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His thoughts were interrupted by the hiss of running water. Carla poked her head around the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you coming or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Turk smiled and hurried after her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a pleasantly cramped shower, Carla and Turk had even more fun towelling each other off. While Carla dried her hair, Turk decided to wait in the bedroom. Carla came out of the bathroom to find him laying on top of the covers, completely naked, his stomach sticking up in the air like a great round dome. Unfortunately, he was fast asleep. Jet lag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When he woke up, seven solid hours later, he found a blanket draped over him, and a hastily written note on the bedside table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Sleepyhead! Gone to have breakfast with Elliot, home around noon. xxx\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast?\" He murmured sleepily, scratching his butt. He glanced at the clock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"10:43?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk had always had trouble with time difference, and not sleeping on the plane had thrown his internal clock off even more. He thought they had arrived home in the morning time, but apparently not. Shrugging it off, he lay back on the bed for a few minutes, quietly content. He had almost fallen back to sleep when his stomach let out a low rumble, reminding him that there was a refrigerator just down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling himself out of bed, Turk ambled down to the kitchen, oblivious to his state of undress. He had gotten used to nudity on his honeymoon, where clothing was usually unnecessary. And it wasn't like any of his clothes would fit him anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The refrigerator door swung open with a clank, and he was pleased to see it had been kept reasonably well stocked in their absence. He decided to have a snack. Of course, a snack meant coming away with an armful of food, balanced on his bulging belly. He wandered over to the couch, dumping his goodies on the coffee table before turning on the TV. As an infomercial blared out the benefits of a certain brand of cleaning powder, he inspected his haul. Two bottles of beer, half a loaf of Wonder bread, some baloney, a pack of cheese slices, an unopened jar of mayonnaise, a bag of chips and, for dessert, a six-pack of butterscotch pudding with \"Property of Sacred Heart\" stamped on the top. He grinned, cracked open a beer and began making the first of many sandwiches.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Turk chugged the last of the beer and let out a large belch. He had finished everything, meaning he was sated, if in no way full. He wondered when Carla would be home, and if she would be bringing any food with her. He could really go for some KFC, he decided, a large bucket of crispy chicken with gravy and coleslaw. He started to salivate a little, and to his surprise, felt something poking at his belly. He lifted up his slightly sagging gut, and saw that he was rock hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" he murmured. It seemed his mind had made an unconscious link between food and sex, no doubt as a result of Carla's habit of feeding him with one hand and pleasuring him with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to get dressed, as it was a lot colder than in Fiji, too cold to be sitting around naked. He found a pair of boxers that could squeeze over his bulging butt cheeks, as well as some old track pants and a scrubs top he had stolen from the hospital. It didn't quite fit, riding up over his belly slightly, but it would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rechecked the kitchen and found a bag if candy bars he had somehow missed the first time, and it was while he was eating these that Carla arrived home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was lying on the couch, drooling over the advertisements (one for Victoria's Secret and another for the new McDonald's burger) when he heard the key in the lock. Carla came in with two big grocery bags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papi! I'm home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk pulled himself up of the couch and embraced his wife, while surreptitiously trying to peek into the bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're hungry.\" Carla told him, unpacking the shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk's face fell as he saw the food. Yoghurt? Celery? Salmon?<br>\r\nSurely she didn't expect him to survive on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Elliot appeared in the doorway, struggling under the weight of four bags, each one packed to the brim with, from what he could see, plenty of candy and junk food, pastries, meat, frozen pizzas and more. Turk grinned widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Carla,\" Elliot panted, out of breath, \"There was too much for one trip. I had to leave the other four bags by the elevator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk's smile felt like it would split his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nAfter helping unpack the rest of the groceries, filling every cupboard and drawer with delicious goodies, Turk and Elliot sat down on the couch and caught up while Carla prepared some lunch. Turk guessed Carla must have told Elliot about his new weight gain, because she didn't even mention it, although he did catch her staring at his belly every so often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything had been pretty much business as usual at Sacred Heart, according to her. They had pretty much run out of things to talk about, and it seemed like Elliot couldn't help herself anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turk,\" she began, \"I've got to know, how do you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted by Carla crying, \"Food's ready, come and get it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk was already there, filling his plate with a large helping of lasagna and half a loaf of garlic bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot and Carla followed his example and soon all three were enjoying the meal, talking and laughing. Turk had another two beers from the fridge while Carla and Elliot split a bottle of white wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk put away about half of the dish, along with an entire loaf of garlic bread and some salad, and soon his stomach was feeling warm and full. Possibly following his example, both Carla and Elliot ate more than they normally would, a quarter each as well as salad and garlic bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all sat back contentedly, Elliot surprised at how much she'd eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I see how you managed to get so fat.\" she said, sipping her wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla and Turk stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in a bad way!\" she blushed, spluttering slightly, realizing she had once again put her foot in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk and Carla laughed, and Carla leaned over to rub his bulging belly, \"I just hope you saved room for dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I reckon I can squeeze some in,\" he smiled, winking at Elliot, who blushed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they had all had their fill of dessert (a chocolate pie), Elliot, her stomach looking a little bloated, said her goodbyes and left the newlyweds alone once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk sighed happily and sat down on the couch, the springs creaking beneath him. He reached for the remote, but heard Carla clear her throat and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh,\" she scolded, wagging her finger. \"There's still a whole pie that we haven't even touched yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached behind the counter and picked up a pie identical to the one they had just finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured towards the bedroom and smiled evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk licked his lips, feeling himself get hard. It seemed the honeymoon was far from over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was completely naked, his food stained clothes lying on a heap at the foot of the bed. He had eaten more than he ever had before,and it showed. His stomach was the size of a beachball, packed with meat, vegetables and various desserts. Carla had stuffed him and stuffed him and stuffed him, until\u00a0he physically had to stop her. It seemed she denied him food for so long just to really give him an appetite.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had worked. He had eaten like a man possessed, and he felt an odd sexual thrill from just how stuffed he was.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could mull this over further, Carla appeared, dressed only in a skimpy neglig\u00e9e, with matching silk bra and panties.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Turk breathed, immediately feeling himself harden. \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night.\" she grinned \"Let's make it count!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly moved above his prone form, before relaxing down on to his pudgy body, her own small belly lying on to of his mountainous one. He moaned, but she stifled his protests with a kiss. Suddenly, she rolled over, using her momentum to pull Turk on top of her. She stopped massaging his bloated midsection for a moment, pausing to slip off her panties and, after a brief pause to lift up his sagging paunch, grabbed his throbbing cock and guided it inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to thrust rhythmically, pounding his flabby hips against hers. \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so close...\" Carla moaned, squirming as she dug her fingernails into Turk's meaty ass. She loved the feeling of his massive gut pressing down on her, almost crushing her. She was wracked with pleasure as she imagined her husband growing fatter and fatter, and his belly getting rounder and rounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk on the other hand, was less exuberant. In fact he was exhausted. Sweat beaded on his brow as he thrust one more time, before collapsing.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, Carla couldn't breath, suffocating beneath the full weight of his flabby frame, before she managed to push him off. \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turk, what's wrong?\" she asked, sounding concerned.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm sorry baby...\" he panted, lying back, a sheen of perspiration on his bulging belly. \"I know... I know you were close... But I'm just too fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange look crossed her face.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too fat... For sex?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly moaned, and before Turk knew it, she had thrust her fingers inside her slick gash and was masturbating furiously. He could hear her talking under her breath as she jerked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too fat... For sex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, she orgasmed, shaking visibly as erotic pleasure coursed through her body. She groaned happily before lying back on the bed.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it Papi, I'm good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up, pulling on a pair of previously discarded panties and Turk's t-shirt.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's go get you some room service.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk watched her walk out of the bedroom, bemused.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took one last deep breath and stood up awkwardly.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah...\" he murmured.

Drawing to a halt she turned, a look of mild annoyance furrowing her brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight that greeted her transformed her frown into a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, in the middle of her departure lounge, stood or rather stooped her new husband - face staring at the shiny floor, hands on his knees, shoulders moving as he panted heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla removed the passports from her mouth. \"Can't slow down papi,\" she said matter-of-factly. \"They're already boarding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Turk righted himself, resting a hand on the sweat patch at the apex of his pregnant-looking belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't <i>uurrf</i> run after <i>huff huff</i> breakfast,\" he moaned, resuming his feeble waddle towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was you who insisted on finishing all those pancakes,\" replied Carla sweetly. Re-positioning the passports between her teeth she gripped the luggage again and turned towards their boarding gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her mildly chiding tone, Carla had to admit, at least to herself, that Turk wasn't <i>totally</i> to blame for his current predicament. It had been the couple's last morning at the buffet and she'd been determined to make it count. After getting her chubby and still quite sleepy husband comfortably seated in a booth, she'd set to work, ferrying overloaded plates of breakfast goodies from the serving counters to their table at such a speed that no matter how quickly Turk gobbled up the food he was constantly half-hidden behind stacks of bacon, sausage, toast, eggs, waffles and pancakes. They were both so engrossed in it that they'd lost track of how late it was getting. By the time Carla had helped extricate her incredibly bloated husband from the booth they had barely an hour before the flight was due to take off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Last call, Mr and Mrs Turk. Flight 107. Last call.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all of Carla's cajoling, but they got there in the nick of time. The strict looking female steward eyed Turk's t-shirt as though he might be trying to smuggle a medicine ball aboard, but soon they found themselves on the plane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWheezing like an elephant that had just run a marathon, Turk collapsed into his seat with a thump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, these planes\" he grumbled, trying to get his wide ass comfortable while simultaneously tugging at the seatbelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax,\" soothed Carla, watching his difficulties with glee. Allowing herself a wicked grin she leaned out into to the aisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh miss... miss!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red pencil-skirted flight attendant walked over with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla nodded casually towards her squirming husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we may need a seatbelt extender over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk blushed crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think they'll say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Diligently squeezing a tube of chocolate sauce onto his fudge brownie, Turk barely acknowledged his wife's question. He frowned in concentration as he pushed his thumbs along the cannister as if it were a near-empty tube of toothpaste, causing sauce to drip slowly but thickly down the sides of the generously sized dessert and pool up in the plate. He felt like he'd been cheated. The equivalent strawberry tube for his cheesecake hadn't been nearly so full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp sensation at the side of his belly jolted the cannister upwards, a blog of chocolate sauce flying onto the back of the seat in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! - <i>buurp!</i> - Watch it!\" he groused, shuffling in his seat, his belly rubbing against the armrests. This flight was uncomfortable enough without his wife poking him in the sides. To avoid any further incursions he tried to recall what she'd said. \"What do I think who'll say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla smiled. \"Elliot and JD, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About <i>mmph</i> what?\" asked Turk through lips stained with sauce. His cheeks bulged obliviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About <i>This!</i>\" she said. Smiling delightedly as she smoothed her fingers gently over Turk's indulgently swollen belly. Cramped into the small plane seat it looked and felt particularly portly this morning, pushing out well into his plump legs, and Carla was thrilled to see the shorts they'd bought yesterday looking tight already. It was probably just because Turk was sitting down, of course, causing his meaty thighs to bulge, but she couldn't help wondering if all that breakfast had had an effect too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention the three bags of peanuts, two cokes and two three-course lunches he'd devoured since boarding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnexing another slice of cake, Turk shrugged. \"Everyone gains a little weight on honeymoon.\" He nodded casually towards her. \"You've put on some too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla could only laugh. \"I suppose so papi,\" she said, placing a hand on her very slightly curved abdomen. It was true, she'd probably picked up five or six honeymoon pounds herself. With Turk eating around the clock it was hard to avoid it. They were constantly surrounded by food and some of it inevitably managed to find its way into her own stomach - despite Turk's admirable efforts to eat up every crumb himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping up this trend, he took advantage of her daydreaming to skewer the slice of cheesecake on her plate and transfer it to his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk shrugged. \"Just tryin' to help you keep the pounds off. Pass me that tube of strawberry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComplying with a chuckle, Carla took another opportunity to admire the belly into which this third dessert would soon be descending. She hadn't been too surprised when Turk had agreed to put on a few pounds, but she'd never quite expected him to go for it with such... gusto. If she'd acquired five or six new pounds, Turk must've packed on what - six, seven times that much? More? He'd really thrown himself into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Then again,</i> thought Carla, watching him shovel another big piece of cheesecake between his lips,<i> what husband wouldn't, given free reign to stuff his face? Men loved to eat.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Turk was licking his plate after his third dessert, the seatbelt lights pinged on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i> the tannoy crackled to life. <i>this is your captain speaking. We're about to enter an area of mild turbulence. We ask you to remain seated and buckle up.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClipping her own belt together, Carla turns to her husband with a smile. \"Buckle up baby.\" She smirked. Adding, under her voice: \"If you can.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carla dropped the subject of Turk's weight and the pair settled down for their day at the beach. First they simply sat in their loungers, soaking up the sun. Carla read her book while Turk lay back, scoping out the topless sunbathers under the cover of his sunglasses. A little later, as the sun rose even higher in the sky, they decided to go for a swim to cool off, frolicking in the surf, exchanging salty kisses in the clear blue water. At one point a large wave almost pulled Turk's shorts down, revealing the very top of his rounding butt cheeks. Carla laughed until a even bigger wave knocked her off her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decided to dry off with a walk along the white sandy beach, staying in the shade of the palm trees. They came across an ice cream stand, Carla picking out an orange flavoured popsicle while Turk went for a large ice cream sandwich. By the time they had got to the pier Turk had devoured his frozen treat and decided to pick up another on the way back, much to Carla's bemusement. She decided not to say anything. They were on vacation after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another few hours on the beach, Turk's stomach was growling and even Carla was feeling a little peckish. They decide to head back to the resort for a snack before dinner. As they walked hand in hand along a rough path, they noticed a gathering of people over by a small beach restaurant. They wandered over saw a large, handmade sign hanging from pole, in front of about six rows of chairs facing towards a raised table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Suva Stuff-off.\" Carla read. \"Daily eating contests with fabulous CASH prizes. Half-price entry for honeymooners.\" She snorted, turning to Turk, \"What kind of person would do that on their honeymoon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise he wasn't there, and she looked around with a groan to see him shaking hands with a heavy-set native and handing him some money. She hurried over as Turk headed for the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turk, what are you doing?\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk looked surprised. \"Baby, it's all I can eat cheeseburgers for like, five bucks, plus if I win I get a prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're on an all-expenses paid trip, so you could have just...\" Carla's logic was interrupted by the announcement for all competitors to take the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish me luck?\" Turk asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla sighed and smiled \"Go get them papi.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he went to take his place, Carla went to sit in the second row, feeling embarrassed as the rest of the seats filled with spectators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk meanwhile sat on his stool in front of the table, going through his game plan. He was eager to win, as well as stuff his face. As the restaurant owner went through the rules, Turk checked out his competition. There were four other entrants, most of them pretty heavy. Two big Fijian guys sat next to each other, chatting in their language, while on the other side of them a stout Australian was soaking up the support from his friends in the crowd. Sitting next to him was the only female competitor, a chubby blonde from Germany, who Turk thought looked kind of like Elliot, if Elliot put on about a hundred pounds. She was wearing a pretty skimpy bikini for a woman her size, showing off a lot of pale white cleavage. She noticed him looking and he blushed and turned away, murmuring 'good luck'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs two women brought out three massive platters of cheese burgers, Turk looked for Carla in the crowd and waved. She waved half-heartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Turk knew it, the announcer yelled go, and suddenly every person in the crowd was yelling and cheering as the competitors set to it. Turk reached for a burger and had it snatched from under him by the German, throwing him off pace. He quickly grabbed another and dug in, taking a massive bite of the burger, cheese and grease and meat filling his cheeks as he chewed and swallowed quickly. He shoved it down in three bites and reached for another, seeing the other competitors were already on their third. He had to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven and a half burgers later and Turk was feeling the strain. The Australian had already dropped out after almost choking to death on a pickle, leaving only four left. Turk's stomach was incredibly swollen, his face covered in a mixture of ketchup and cheese. He could feel the solid mass of food pushing his belly out, his swimsuit cutting into him. He hurriedly adjusted himself, and found a little extra room to finish off his ninth burger and reach for a tenth. As he did so he saw one of the Fijians collapse off his chair, and knew it was down to three of them. The other Fijian was like a wild animal, cramming them down as fast as he could, whereas the German was more efficient, eating each burger with a minimum of fuss. Turk was a burger of the pace, but as he crammed down another bite, he knew he could win this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Third.\" Carla said disparagingly, \"You make an absolute pig of yourself in front of the entire resort and you can only manage third?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk groaned and belched, walking as Carla supported him under one arm. He had just been moving on to his eleventh burger when he suddenly felt dizzy, and before he knew it he had fallen backwards and landed flat on the sand, his now huge stomach sticking up in the air like a blimp. As the crowd laughed and cheered, Carla hurried to help him up, her cheeks crimson with embarrassment. They had left quietly as the German woman celebrated her victory, twenty burgers to the Fijian's 19, by chugging a bottle of beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were now on the path back to their room, Turk clutching his swollen stomach with both hands and moaning, his button up shirt flapping open, while Carla fumed. They finally arrived at their suite  and Turk immediately collapsed on to the bed, letting out a sigh of relief. Carla crossed her arms and sighed. \"You better get ready, we're going to dinner in forty minutes, and I want to walk around the lagoon first, and watch the sunset.\" She left to go have have a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk groaned. He wanted nothing more than to lie in bed and have Carla rub his belly, not walk around some stupid lagoon. He could tell Carla was annoyed with him though, and if he knew if he wanted to have sex tonight he had better toe the line. Plus, he reasoned, the walk would help him build up an appetite for dinner. He belched and struggled to sit up, finding it almost impossible. He decided to give it another few minutes, and lay back, rubbing his belly and closing his eyes, the gentle lapping of the waves lulling him to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Turk dozed for 15 minutes until  a freshly-showered Carla woke him, jabbing his turgid belly painfully. As she got dressed, he stumbled to the bathroom, shrugging off his button up before peeling off his overly snug swimsuit and letting it slap wetly against the tiled floor. He stepped under the the shower and immediately felt refreshed, the hot water streaming over his body and relieving the little aches and pains. He soaped up his swollen belly, massaging it in an attempt to aid the digestion off his massive meal. He rinsed off and stepped out of the cubicle, grabbing a fluffy white towel and drying off, then wrapped it around hips, underneath his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe re-entered the bedroom and saw Carla was already dressed, and he was expecting her to be annoyed. but instead she was apologetic. She came up and gave him a hug, and a tender kiss on the lips, before cuddling against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I was angry, Papi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it baby.\" He replied, glad to make peace, wrapping his arms around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood in this pleasant embrace for a few moments before Carls broke away and told Turk to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked around the lagoon hand in hand, Carla wearing a mid-length dark pink dress with a light white jacket against the evening chill. Turk got his canvas shorts on with little trouble, and his dark blue shirt was baggy enough to hide most of his belly while he was sitting, though it bulged out when he stood up. They kissed as the last rays of sun dipped down beneath the horizon, the previous anger forgotten, and tranquility restored. Until they arrived at the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like the previous one, this restaurant catered towards couples, each table being secluded in it's own gazebo, each with breathtaking views of the ocean and the vast field of stars glittering above it. Turk and Carla sat, holding hands across the table and admiring the view, until they were tactfully interrupted by a waitress proffering menus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ordering a  beer for Turk and a white wine for herself, Carla, who hadn't eaten since the ice-cream stand, began perusing the menu hungrily. Turk also glanced at the menu, and to his surprise he found he was a little hungry, despite the massive amount of food he had eaten not three hours ago. He rubbed a  tentative hand over his stomach and found that, while it was still quite firm, it was not the rock hard lump it had been. Maybe he had enough room for some of the rotisserie chicken, or half a lobster. Actually, he thought, feeling his mouth starting to water, maybe a whole lobster, or even the t-bone steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other, Carla had been pretty annoyed with him for pigging out earlier, and they had only just made up. If he wanted to have sex tonight, he would probably have to stick to a small dinner, maybe even just a salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet he was suddenly filled with the urge to stuff himself once again. The waitress arrived, and after Carla ordered the seafood medley, turned to Turk, pencil poised expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk hesitated, glancing at Carla before making a final decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Um... Just the salad for me thanks.\" He handed back the menu as the waitress commended him on his excellent choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs hungry as he was suddenly feeling, Turk knew better than to push his luck when Carla was in one of her moods. From the way she was smiling and stroking his hand, he was sure he had made the right choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they waited for their food, Turk ate as much bread as he thought he could get away with, with plenty of butter and olive oil. He was hoping the salad would be substantial enough, but his heart dropped and his stomach growled when he saw it was little more than a few leaves of lettuce and a handful of tomato, with no more than a drizzle of dressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe munched his way through his salad stoically, watching jealously as Carla packed away two and a half plates of the delicious seafood medley. She had missed lunch thanks to Turk, and hungrily filled her stomach. Finally she put down her fork and patted her stomach. \"Whoof,\" she sighed, \"I think we can skip dessert, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk felt like he could have eaten the entire dessert menu twice over, but Carla was already getting up to leave before he could say a word of protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk woke up to the sound of his stomach rumbling. A quick glance at the bedside clock told him it was only half one in the morning. They had gotten back to their room after dinner and quickly got down to business. Turk forgot about his hunger as soon as Carla slipped out of her dress, revealing that she was wearing nothing underneath. After an hour and a half they had both collapsed with exhaustion, quickly snuggling up and falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, however, Turk doubted he could sleep through the sounds his stomach was making. Carefully removing Carla's arm from around his waist, he sat up and got out of bed, sneaking out of the bedroom to the living area. After scrabbling around for the light switch and letting his eyes  adjust to the glare, Turk quickly located the phone. He picked it up and pressed 1. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Room Service, how may I help you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, could I order some food for suite 23.\" Turk whispered, flipping through the laminated menu next to the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, what would you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, could I get, uh, two shrimp cocktails, a platter of French fries, and the, uh, Surf and Turf? With, extra Turf. Well done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That shouldn't be a problem sir, anything for dessert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I recommend the chocolate fudge cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. sounds good.\" Turk panted, mouth already watering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hung up and, realizing he had better put something on before the food arrived, and grabbed a toweling robe from the bathroom. He muted the TV, turned on ESPN and waited impatiently, trying to distract himself from his hunger with a college basketball highlight reel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knock on the door, when it came, was quiet enough, but in the quietness of the night sounded like someone was trying to break in. Turk froze and listened for sounds of Carla stirring, but a gentle snoring reassured him she was still asleep. He crept to the door and opened it, a finger to his lips. The bellhop nodded, gently pushing the laden cart through the door. He handed Turk the bill, and after giving a generous tip and signing his name he practically threw it back at him and bundled him out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally alone, Turk wheeled the cart over to the couch and grabbed the first shrimp cocktail. It was supposed to serve 2 people, so there was plenty of delicious juicy shrimp and tangy sauce. Turk devoured each shrimp in one bite, sauce dribbling down his chin. Wiping his mouth on the sleeve of his bathrobe, he reached for the second one, eating this one slightly slower than the first, savoring the delicious flavor of the tiny crustaceans. Still chewing the last of the cocktail, Turk lifted the cloches off of the two large plates on the cart, revealing a veritable mountain of french fries and an almost equally large helping of Surf and Turf. It seemed they had given him extra Surf as well. He grabbed and handful of fries, dipped them in the remains of the cocktail sauce and crammed them in his mouth, while his other hand picked up the melted butter boat and poured a liberal helping over the lobster and steak alike. Taking a fork in one hand, Turk ate like a man possessed, making sure his mouth was always full of food. His cheeks bulged, his jaw ached from chewing, his hands and chin were covered in a sheen of grease and butter. His stomach was slowly expanding outwards and he packed it with more and more choice food, getting larger and larger and pushing against the downy softness of his robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he had crunched down the last of the fries and licked the last of the butter from his fingers, Turk's stomach was about the size it had been after the eating contest. He lay back and suppressed a belch, still conscious of Carla in the other room. He undid his robe for better access and begin massaging his swollen stomach, letting out grunts and groans of satisfaction. This had been exactly what he needed. Gazing at the ruin of stained plates and soiled napkins all over the cart, he noticed another, smaller cloche on the lower tier. His dessert! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a series of small burps, Turk leaned forward and lifted up the dish, placing it on the couch next to him. Sure, he was pretty full, but a single slice of chocolate cake couldn't hurt, could it? Removing the cover, he was surprised to find not a single slice but an entire small cake, luxuriously iced and decorated with smooth milk chocolate. Even as he rubbed his rock hard gut, he reckoned he could hear it gurgle in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... just one slice.\" he told himself, picking up a knife and licking his lips. One rather small slice turned into two rather small slices, followed by a slightly larger slice. Two slices later and he was halfway through, so he decided he might as well finish it off. After laboriously cutting and consuming another two slices, Turk simply picked up the final third of cake and finished every last crumb of it. His belly was now larger than it had ever been before, and tight as a drum. The sensation gave Turk a wonderful warm feeling, and he felt that if Carla woke up and caught him right now, face stained with chocolate, stomach the size of a basketball, he wouldn't even care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a last large belch and patting his stomach, he fell back into a deep, contented sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When he woke up, Turk's perspective had returned and he realized just how annoyed Carla would be if she found him lying on the couch in a stained bathrobe, stomach bulging with food, surrounded by the evidence of his gluttony. Dawn was just beginning to break as he got up as rapidly as his still bloated stomach would allow him. He quietly tidied up, placing the plates and cloches back on the cart and cautiously opening the door. He wheeled the cart as far down the hallway as he could, praying it would be removed before he and Carla went down for breakfast. Just before he left he realized he would have to get rid of the robe, as it was covered in chocolate stains and a mixture of butter and cocktail sauce. Looking around, he slipped it off and rapidly padded back to his room in the nude, clutching his belly to stop it bouncing uncomfortably. After a brief stop in the bathroom to clean his face and hands, Turk crept back into the bedroom. Carla was still asleep, thankfully, lying on her front, butt stuck in the air, snoring softly. She was normally a light sleeper, but all the wine at dinner must have had an effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk lay down as quietly as he could, awkward with his protruding gut, but he managed. Safely back in bed and completely satiated, with Carla none the wiser, Turk had no trouble drifting off to sleep for the third time that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunlight streaming through the window pricked at Turk's eyelids, causing him to wake with a yawn. He quickly got up and made for the bathroom. As he washed his hands, he saw that his stomach had gone down quite a bit, hopefully enough for Carla not to have noticed. As he walked back into the bedroom, he saw that his wife wasn't wear he had left her, the bed being empty. His heart beat faster. Had she noticed? Did she know? Where could she be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom door opened, and Turk relaxed as Carla walked in wearing the other white fluffy bathrobe. Judging by the smile on her face, she was still in the dark about his late night binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Papi.\" She smiled, giving him a kiss and rubbing up against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk grinned and kissed her back. \"Good morning Mrs. Turk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a surprise for you...\" she whispered in his ear, taking his hand and leading him out of the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk followed her to the living area. He almost fainted when he saw the cart was back where he had left it. But wait, this was a different cart. A cart filled with pancakes, bacon, eggs, and sausages, as well as jugs of O.J and coffee. There were also racks of toast and bagels, with jams and butter, and a box of donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Turk stared, Carla explained. \"I figured you might have gotten your appetite back after last night. I might have ordered a little too much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Turk was already considering what to eat first. But if Carla was here, he would have to hold back, as hard as that might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I already ate,\" Carla said, pointing to a small plate with a few crumbs on it, \"So I'm going to have a shower and get ready for the beach. The bellhop said to just push it out into the hall when you're finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave Turk another peck on the cheek and headed back into the bedroom. Turk quickly began pigging out, not even bothering to remove the food from the serving trays. He couldn't believe Carla hadn't caught him out, but she'd notice pretty quickly if he kept eating like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just this last time, then I'll stop.\" Turk told himself as he shoveled down the scrambled eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know...</span></div></div>",
