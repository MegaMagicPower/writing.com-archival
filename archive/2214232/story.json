Nicholas, your Sylveon, had been your partner for several years now, but around 6 months ago everything changed when you developed a special potion meant to make Sylveon stronger. The potion was, innocently enough, only supposed to behave like a super vitamin, but the actual result was far more explosive as Nick had gained about 30 lbs of muscle and a foot of height. This had excited both you and Nicholas quite a bit, and started you on the rabbit hole you currently tumbled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing full well that if someone discovered the effectiveness of your potion you would be questioned and your Sylveon tested on you'd decided to live the life of a recluse. After a month the loneliness had started gnawing away at you prompting you to begin work on a potion that would help make Nick a more conversive partner. Two months more of your mad science had produced a solution that was meant to make Nicholas capable of basic speech, but after he'd taken it he was overcome by pain for nearly a week. Wracked with regret you were only able to alleviate the pain rather than cure it until one morning your bulky partner was replaced by a 5 foot tall anthropomorphic version of himself. This had again been a welcome surprise to both of you as now your pet had become more like your roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn recent months though the situation was beginning to haunt your dreams as you'd been becoming more and more attracted to Nick, with his muscled frame and a penis that dangled half way down his thigh, though you'd never let on in front of him. These thought's though had been your inspiration for your latest potion, the one you'd just finished crafting, which would again increase Nick's size and indulge your perverse fantasy of living with a massive 7 foot nudist. Putting the finishing touches on you stood and stretched, eager to see the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nicky,\" you called out, using the nickname he seemed to simultaneously loathe and love, \"I've got a new potion to test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicholas promptly came bounding in eager to try a new potion, knowing how the last two had benefited him. \"Cool! What's this one do Andy?\" he asked, unconsciously wagging his tail and beginning to chub up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a surprise,\" you told him, trying to play it coy and ignore his rising pink and blue organ \"but first I...uh I have to use the bathroom,\" you left to calm down a little and try regaining control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you headed to the restroom Nick began impatiently eyeing the potion on the desk, impatient and eager to see what this new concoction did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you returned after splashing water in your face, discovering you actually had had to pee, you found Nick alone where you'd left him with a now empty beaker and your heart skipped a beat. It'd taken only a few drops to make an Oran berry the size of a Wooloo when you'd been testing, and you definitely had not intended to give him the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does it do?\" Nick asked again letting out a small burp, completely oblivious to what he'd just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's uhh... \" you drifted off trying to figure out what might actually happen and how best to explain it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on tell me Andy!\" Nick pressed impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it...it's supposed to make you...bigger...\" you admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's so cool! How's it gonna work?\" Nick excitedly pestered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's the problem Nicky, I'm not sure...\" you confessed as a concerned look of bewilderment overtook the Sylveon, \"Oh no don't worry I'm here to make sure everything goes ok, I just wish you wouldn't have jumped the gun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" the smile returned to Nick's face before his ADD got the better of him and he wondered off to the next exciting stimuli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped it'd all turn out alright, for now all you could do was monitor and react.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your name is Gabriel and at twenty-three you share a house with your fellow Arcanine and older brother brother Cain. Life wasn't exactly cruel to you, not by any stretch, but if you did resent one thing it'd be your height. Now at six foot one you were by no means the smallest pokemon on the block, but you couldn't help resenting the fact you were a whole two inches shorter than your feral ancestors, who'd walked on all fours no less! Cain however had no such problem at eight foot three and, after he'd spent an approximate half of his twenty-seven year in the gym, people seldom believed you were related let alone brothers. It was a life you'd grown accustomed to though, both feeling the house vibrate whenever Cain walked about and literally living in his very broad shadow, which is why a month ago when your younger brother Isaiah, still a Growlithe, turned eighteen and successfully browbeat you and Cain into letting him move in your normal routine was turned on it's ear. The second he moved in the full gravity of your shortness hit you, your little Growlithe brother was five foot eleven and if he ever managed to afford his own Fire Stone you'd be living with two giants...or rather two reminders of your smallness. Isaiah also had a nasty habit, not unlike Cain, of living like a...well, a guy, and between both your brothers leaving out there junk, everything from empty Protiens to dirty socks, it was a mystery how you and your flowing beautifully maintained mane and tail were even related to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was no different as when you returned home from the library you saw Cain had dropped and left his duffel bag of dirty gym clothes not more than a foot from the door, charming. Making your way in fully you found Isaiah in nothing more than his boxers and eating take out in front of the tv, again charming. \"You know Isaiah, it'd be nice if once I came home and you weren't in your underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Want me to take them off?\" he playfully teased while pulling at his waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know full well that's not what I meant,\" you retorted and went to the kitchen to scrounge up something for yourself. \"Where's Cain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's upstairs showering,\" your brother answered between bites, \"He got home, took everything off, and went straight for the shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that explains those then,\" you gestured to the clothes and joined your brother with a Malasada to snack on, \"Any luck on the job hunt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow reassuring, \"Well if you ever change your mind I can see if the library has anything open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" he almost autonomously replied, well you had tried pushing it on him a dozen times already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen from upstairs a loud clattering followed by a booming \"Shit!\" rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok?\" you hollered up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just the damn towel rack again!\" Cain's gruff voice responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several minutes you and Isaiah just chewed and watched some overexcited Persain spin a wheel on this season's latest game show when Cain walked down the stairs, completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit Cain how many times do I have to ask you not to do that!\" you griped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least one more,\" he shrugged it off and began fishing around in the fridge, bent over looking for one of his \"special\" protein packed Rindo salads. \"What are we watching?\" he asked joining you in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some Persain with stars in her eyes, you want the remote?\" Isaiah answered, and you couldn't help but notice you were never made the same offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surr girv it heer,\" Cain replied through a mouthful of food and leaned forward, involuntarily making his dick flop about as he reached for it. \"Let's see what's on,\" he said, thankfully after swallowing.</span></div></div>",

A greasy, sweaty, overweight, middle-aged Honchkrow came on the screen and started talking about mail order evolution stones. You and Cain were immediately skeptical, particularly over the line \"delivered on receipt of fifth and final payment of $9.99,\" and shared an eyeroll between you that expressed as much, Isaiah however basically needed a bib, helplessly drooling over such a tempting offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zay you can't possibly think those are real,\" you teased, \"Any real stone would cost AT LEAST twice that, at least, and even then it'd be like a fifty/fifty shot if it's real still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah man, considering people know how important they are those things are stupidly expensive,\" Cain chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah shut up! You guys don't get it cause you already evolved!\" Isaiah defensively snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get it? I had to save up for like a solid year for mine,\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me to, but god was it worth it...\" Cain added and started growing erect without a care in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, knock it off,\" you threw a pillow at his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't help it Gabe, just thinking about evolving is so hot,\" he shamelessly carried on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...is it, I mean, does it really feel that good?\" Isaiah asked with wide-eyed curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah man! Feeling your body growing and changing it's, it's just beyond words!\" Cain interrupted with more ravings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...do, do either of you guys still have yours,\" Isaiah asked with bated breath, and starting to visibly tent in his boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Zay but that thing was too valuable to just sit on, I pawned it to help pay for equipment,\" he explained before indulging in a kiss of his own flexed bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gabe?\" he turned to you with very literal puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind immediately raced to the shoe box tucked away in the back of your closet, \"Yes?\" you feigned ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you still have yours,\" he pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a whirlwind you thought about what you should say, in truth you did still have it, but the idea of being the small man around the house wasn't exactly something you enjoyed. As his brother you didn't necessarily <i>want</i> to disadvantage him, but as his brother you also knew Isaiah had always been the tallest in school, excelled in every sport he tried out for, and would very very likely become an enormous overconfident monster. You almost couldn't be sure anything would come of it but there was some pretty strong...energy...between Isaiah and Cain right now with all the talk of evolution and you weren't sure if that was a Pandora's Box you wanted to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think you should, you know, earn it like we did? It's like, the literal mark of becoming a man,\" you tried to stall and divert the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit bein' a baby Gabe,\" Cain interjected, \"It's not some sacred right, it's just a <i>really</i> intense and sexual awakening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDammit that's not helping<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, look Zay...</span></div></div>",

But..\" \"But!\", Cain interrupted, \"You have to use it in front of us so we can, you know, make sure you're ok\" he winked. You notice his chubby starting to twitch, growing more and more excited thinking about seeing some intense growth firsthand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything! Whatever you guys want! Thank you, thank you, thank you Gabe!\" Zay darted up the stairs so fast you almost couldn't track his movements. You round on Cain, \"What the hell is your problem? Can't you just let him do this in peace?\" \"Like I said, that shit gets me hot. You know he want to watch too. I saw your dick twitch\", he leered at you. You immediately try to deny it but feel a burn in your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZay starts thumping on the stairs on his way down, shoe box in hand. \"Are your sure I can use this Gabe?\" he asks one last time. You can't help but give him a small smile at his boyish enthusiasm. \" Yes Zay, I'm sure.\" You reach in and pull out the stone. You forgot how small it is. No bigger than a pebble, you have to hold it between your fingers. Cain bursts out laughing \"How did that thing even help you evolve! No wonder you're still smaller than us!\" You can feel your anger rising but Zay steps in, \"Knock it off Cain! Leave him alone. At least he's helping me!\" Cain stops laughing and actually looks a little guilty. Holy crap little bro!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZay is staring at the stone in your hand so hard, he's practically drooling. You notice his shorts tenting as well. Damn! He's packing more than you too! You tell him that if he wants to save his clothes to take them off. When he's completely stripped down and his cock straining toward the ceiling, you hand over the stone. \"Here you go Zay. I'll see you on the other side. It's gonna be a really strong feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes the stone and stares at it for a moment. \"I feel something...\" he whispers. The stone starts glowing so you know it's beginning. \"..feels so good...so warm\" he mutters. The light is getting brighter and brighter that you have to look away. Just what he was waiting for. With a wicked smirk, Zay pinches the stone, grabs his cock and starts pushing it against his slit! The stone is slowly working its way down his cock. He's so turned on his pre is slicking the way, guiding it effortlessly down in to his balls. A stuttered moan has you looking back at him and the light is coming from his sack! \"Wha..What did you do Zay?!\" you exclaim. \"So..sorry Gabe. I..it just seemed like a good idea. I was so hot just thinking about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his next moan you see him being enveloped in a bright light and see his silhouette start to shift and move. His height starts increasing higher, closer to the ceiling. His width swelling out until he's wider than the recliner chair. When the light reduces and winks out, Zay opens his eyes and looks around. A giant goofy smile grows on his face, \"Oh wow, everything looks so small!\" he rumbles in his deeper voice. He's a giant! You see a sparkle in your peripheral vision and glance down. His balls are enormous and still glowing. When you admit this, he glances down. \"Shouldn't the stone be do-\" he cuts off suddenly. His cock inflates so fast you're surprised he didn't get whiplash. As you're stunned and can't look away, his sack slowly starts expanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each throb of his swelling dick, his balls swell larger. His moaning getting louder, you feel a vibration in the floor and its getting stronger. You look over and see his knot straining and the head of his cock turning purple. \"Oh..god..I'm..cum-..cumming!\" he shouts. His dick erupts like a volcano, spewing cum everywhere. But when you look closer, Zay is swelling in all directions. And fast! By the third spurt his head is pushing at the ceiling. The fifth he's swelling through, raining debris down. The eighth and he's through the roof! The whole house looks like a snow globe, covered in white, including you. You're completely stunned. If you were the smallest before, then you're completely dwarfed now. His foot is bigger than you. You start moving toward the door to go outside to talk to Zay when you heard a startling sound that froze you in your tracks. Daring to turn around and look to see what the noise is you witness...</span></div></div>",
