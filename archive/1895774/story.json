She got up, got ready for her day, went about doing her usual activities. A little after noon Lightning thought it might be nice to go for a walk outside. So she grabbed her gunblade and went out the door. As she walked around outside she lost sight of her house in the distance after a few minutes. At this point Lightning decided it was time to start heading back, but before she could she was engulfed in a blinding bright light. As she tried to sheild her eyes with one hand she quickly drew out her gunblade ready to defend herself, but she wasn't sure were to aim and the bright light was getting brighter. Suddenly, Lightning began to lose consicness. Tried as hard as she could to remain conscious, but it was a futile effort. She felt her gunblade fall out of her hand just as she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After an unknown amount of time Lightning woke up. She slowly got back on her feet and noticed that her surroundings had changed. She seemed to be in a forest with large strange looking trees. Then she noticed her now massive gunblade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I've shrunk to about an inch in height,\" Lightning said stunned by her new size. This was a major problem for her, especially since her gunblade was now to big for her to use. Lightning tried to keep calm and figure out what to do when the ground beneath her feet began to shake, nearly making her lose her balance. She quickly glanced around for the source of the tremors, and saw that being made by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She was less than the size of a breath mint to it. As the ceratoraptor got closer Lightning realized she had to get out of sight before it noticed her. She quickly ran behind her gunblade. There was no possible way she could defend herself at her current size without a weapon. As Lightning hid behind her gunblade she couldn't help but wonder if she had gotten out of sight in time. Cautitously she looked out from behind her gunblade to make sure it hadn't noticed her. She was greeted by the sight of the ceratoraptor's open maw heading right for her.

Lightning looked around the mouth in disbelieve as she became drenched in saliva. The ceratoraptor rolled her around in its mouth and licked her against its palate as it savored her delicious flavor. Eventually, the tongue settled down and began to push Lightning towards the back of the throat. She tried to hold onto the tongue, but she was too slick from the saliva. Once she reached the throat the ceratoraptor swallowed her whole with a loud gulp. Lightning found herself slowly traveling down the esophagus headfirst, getting covered in even more saliva on the way. She struggled as much as she could within the confineing tube, but only succeeded in makeing herself travel down the esophagus faster. Soon her journey came to an end, and Lightning screamed as she landed in the stomach with a plop. She struggled even more than she had been able to in the esophagus, but she knew it was useless. Soon the digestive jucies began to flow and started to work on dissolveing her. 'I never thought I would go like this' Lightning thought to herself as she closed her eyes for the last time.</span></div></div>",

The ceratoraptor looked left and right for Lightning not realizing that she was on the ground right behind its head. Eventually, the ceratoraptor let out loud screech, frustrated that its prey had gotten away, that forced Lightning to cover her ears in order to keep from going deaf, and began to walk away. As Lightning uncovered her ears she noticed a shadow come over her. She looked up and saw the ceratoraptor's foot coming down towards her. Acting quickly, Lightning attempted to dodge the foot, just as she had with the maw, and got...</span></div></div>",

She watched the ceratoraptor leave for a few moments, and then when she was sure it wouldn't turn around and see her, she ran off in the oppisite direction. Lighting wasn't sure how long she had run, but she stopped running once she came across a rock that was taller than her. Panting heavily, she leaned back against the rock and slid down it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I *pant* keep going *pant* on *pant* like this,\" Lightning thought out loud to herself as she slowly began to regain her breath. \"I *pant* need *pant* a weapon *pant* that I can *pant* use.\"Lightning continued to rest for a bit against the rock.

Then she took a step back from the rock and examined the makeshift spear she had just made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's not a gunblade, but I'll have to make do with this for now,\" Lightning said as she examined her new spear.

Almost imeadeately she spotted a water hole that didn't seem to be too far away. However, Lightning knew that water holes attracted all types of creatures, and she wasn't quite used to her makeshift spear yet. So if she went to the water hole there was a good chance something could step on or worse, gobble her up. She shivered a bit at the thought. Then Lightning noticed a small puddle that might be safer for her to get a drink from, but it was farther away.

Lightning had managed to hold the bug at bay with her spear until she was able to get it off of herself, and then she proceeded to stab it the eye.

Cautiously she knelt down, placeing her spear by her side, cupped her hands together in the water, brought them up to her lips, and took a sip of the water. It was cool and refreshing, and Lightning continued to drink from the water until her thirst was satisfied. Then she just sat there for a moment and watched the waves of the water come and go from the shore. Lightning soon realized that she was actually tempted to go for a swim in the water. However, she knew that wouldn't be the wisest idea at her current size, and she debated with herself about what she should do when...</span></div></div>",

Soon she came to a ring of flesh hat was none other than the stomach sphincter. Recognizing Lightning as food it opened up and she fell into the stomach landing with a plop. Lightning quickly stood up and began kicking and pounding on the stomach walls, unwilling to accept her fate as a chocobo's meal. When the digestive juices began to flow, Lightning passed out from a lack of air and exhaustion, collapseing into a puddle that had already formed next to her. Soon she was floating around the stomach in digestive jucies; her unconciousness saveing her from the pain of digestion.

She traveled down the short esophagus, the muscles working quickly to massage her into the stomach. As Lightning slid into the cramped stomach she resumed her futile struggles. However, her movement was restricted by how cramped the stomach was and the sticky saliva that covered her entire body. She soon gave up though, exhausted. It was then that Lightning noticed how warm and soft the stomach walls were. It felt nice, and Lightning allowed herself to drift off into a deep sleep, that she wouldn't awaken from, just as the digestive jucies began to flow.</span></div></div>",

What made things worse though was that she hadn't had time to practice with her spear yet, so it would be no help to tonight. She realized she had to find shelter and quickly. So with spear in hand she set off to find shelter. Eventually, Lightning came across two possible places for her to take shelter in. One was a hole in the ground, and the other seemed to be a rather small cave. She knew that they both had their risks. If either one was already occupied she could wind up in some creature's belly. As the sun sank lower in the sky, Lightning knew she had to make her decision quickly.</span></div></div>",

At first the floor of the hole was a gentle incline, but as Lightning progressed farther into the hole she noticed that the floor was becoming steeper and steeper. Eventually, the floor became so steep that she actually lost her footing.

The creature had a long serpent like body, with only two short legs just below its long neck, and a head that looked similar to that of an adamanchelid's. It was a dark red color and was easily larger then Lightning. She wasn't sure how she could have possibly missed seeing such a large creature hideing around the eggs earlier, but that didn't matter now. What mattered was the fact that an angry looking creature, that she could only assume was the mother, had its full attention on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature hissed at Lightning once more and procceeded to make its way toward her at an incredible speed. Not being someone who was scared off easily, Lightning held up her spear and threw it at the creature as hard as she could. Unfortunately, the creature caught her spear in its mouth, crushed it to peices with its powerful jaws, and continued its charge towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow haveing no weapon to defend herself with, Lightning was forced to run away as she could. She headed towards the entrance that she had into the nest from, with the creature in close pursuit. If she could make it to the entrance and climb out of there then the creature might stop chaseing her. It was good idea but the creature wasn't far behind and Lightning wasn't sure if she could out run it in time, but she had to try. She was almost to the entrance when suddenly something hit her from behind and caused her to fall forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" Lightning said as she looked back to see what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, she saw that there was now some kind of resin covering her legs now. That's what had caused her to fall, but where had it come from? Lightning didn't have to wait long to find out as she looked up to see the creature now towering over her. Staring down at her the creature opened its mouth and spat more of the resin at her. When the resin hit this time it covered Lightning's entire torso and pinned her arms to her side. Now she found herself trapped in a cocoon made of the resin with only her head and feet sticking out. It constricted Lightning's movements and left her unable to get back up on her feet. She struggled in vain to break free, but she was just too constricted the resin. Giving up for a moment Lightning looked back up at the creature that had imprisoned her like this in order to see what it would do next. The creature procceeded to . . .</span></div></div>",

Lightning was confused as to why the creature left. She thought for sure that it was going to eat her or something equally as horrible. However, she couldn't bother with that at the moment, and resumed trying to break free of the cocoon. Once again though it proved to be useless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere has to be some way for me to break free, Lightning thought to herself. Then she suddenly remembered her survival knife. She could try useing it to cut herself free. So Lightning began to try and get her survival knife out, which was alot easier said and done since the cocoon restricted her movent and kept both of her arms pinned to her sides. As she was trying to reach her knife, Lightning heard a bone chilling sound that made her pause. She could hear faint hissing noises coming from within the eggs. It was then that Lightning realized the had done something far worse than eating her as punishment for her intrusion. Beginning to panic she hurried to try and reach her knife so she could escape before the eggs hatched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning finally got her survival knife out of her pocket and began struggleing to open it just as the first craking sounds began. Come on, come on, she pleaded in her head as she struggled to open the knife. Eventually she managed to get it open. Yes!, Lightning thought as began trying to cut the resin open with it. Then her heart sank in despair and she became filled with dread as she dicovered that the resin was too strong for her knife to cut through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No damn it,\" She said and looked over to the eggs to see how much time she had left. Lightning's dread turned to horror as she saw that eggs had finished hatching. The creatures that had hatched from the eggs looked like smaller versions one the that had cocooned her. She only became more terrified as the hatchlings began to move closer and closer to her. Eventually, Lightning screamed in terror, unable to control herself anymore, just before the hatchlings began to eat their very first meal. The pink haired meal that their mother had cocooned for them before leaveing.</span></div></div>",

As Lightning struggled to get free of both the cocoon and the creauture's mouth, it made a quick gulp and brought her cocooned torso into its maw. With dread she realized the creature was eating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo!\" Lightning cried out in despair as the creature made another gulp and brought her head into its maw. The creature then snapped it mouth closed imeadeatly. Inside the maw it was too dark for Lightning to see as she become covered in saliva, and she wasn't able to get a good look at the inside before it snapped shut. However, that didn't really matter too her since she wasn't going to be there long. With one final gulp the creature swallowed her whole, cocoon and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning quickly found herself travelling the creature's long esophagus as she became covered from head to toe in mucus and saliva. She couldn't see how it could have turned out any worse. She had been shrunk to an inch in height and then swallowed alive by a creature she had never seen before. What made it worse was that she was still trapped in her resin cocoon so she was rather uncomfortable as the muscles in the esophagus slowly massaged her down to the stomach. Lightning couldn't even struggle a little since the cocoon was too restrictive and the esophagus too confined. So all she could do was wait until she reached the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Lightning's journey into the creature came to a sudden halt, and she found herself lying in long and confining, though not as confining as the esophagus, chamber. This must be the stomach, she realized. Then, almost as soon as she came to that conclusion, the digestive jucies started seeping in and began to go to work on her as they quickly covered her from head to toe. Lightning cried out in pain as she and her resin cocoon were slowly digested. Fortunately, for her though she passed out from the pain and lack air well before she was turned into a nutritous soup and sent to the intestines. At least Lightning didn't have to suffer from the pain of being digested for too long.</span></div></div>",

Then the creature started licking Lightning against the roof of its mouth and rolling her around on its tongue. This went on for quite sometime as the creature savored her delicious flavor. Then the tongue settled down and began to push her to the back of the throat.

The ground seemed to be comprised of twigs and leaves, and all around her were walls also made of twigs and leaves.

Lightning noticed a small hole in the floor of the nest not too far to her left that looked like it would be large enough for her to fit through.

As she decided on a course of action the chick came closer and closer. Lightning had to act fast or she would become baby food. Makeing a quick decision she...</span></div></div>",

So she decided that the hole would most likely be her best bet for survival. Thus, Lightning started running as fast as she could toward the hole, just barely getting out of the way as the chick tried snapping her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The chick squeaked in annoyance as its meal was getting away.

At this sight she began run even faster, determined not to become a baby bird's lunch. Lightning was almost to the hole, but she could almost feel the bird's breathe as its beak came closer. She wasn't sure if she would make, but she wasn't willing to give up. Soon the hole was just a few feet away, and Lightning leaped towards the hole just as the bird was about to snap her up.

Her head was almost in the back of its throat. Then the chick tilted its head back, lifting her legs up into the air as they kicked wildly as she struggled to get free. The chick then opened and closed its beak as it began to gulp Lightning down. It took only three gulps to swallow her alive, and she began to quickly travel down the esophagus struggleing all the way. Soon she landed in the cramped stomach with a splash. As Lightning attempted to make herself comfortable she couldn't believe what just happened. The chick had just gobbled her up with lightning speed. If she had tried to make it to the hole she might have survived, but instead she had decided to fight and now she was baby food. It didn't take long for the digestive jucies start eating away at Lightning, and cried out in pain as she slowly began to dissolve. She passed from the pain before she was completely digested though. Meanwhile, the chick wondered if its mother would bring it more tasty bugs like the one it just ate.</span></div></div>",

It quickly opened up, accepting her as food, and she fell into the stomach landing with a plop. Lightning looked around her new home in disbelieve. She had just been eaten by a wolf. A wolf just literally swallowed her alive. Lightning refused to accept her fate as wolf food and began struggle and pound on the stomach walls. She soon began to grow tired and laid down exhausted. Lightning fell asleep just as the digestive jucies began to flow, and thus was spared the pain of being digested.</span></div></div>",

Lightning sighed in exasperation. She was going to tell Serah that she should come along in the likely event that no one believed the story. No use dwelling on it, Lightning thought.

She soon relaxed a little though when she realized that Snow hadn't noticed her. That's good so far, she thought to herself. Lightning knew she was probably about size of a tasty treat with no way to defend herself. If Snow had noticed her and was hungry, then she might likely be in. . . well she didn't want to think about that. So slowly Lightning began to back away, trying as best she could to not get noticed. Unfortunately as she was backing away she tripped over a discarded pencil that was just lying in the hallway.

The door to Serah's bedroom was closed, so if she could make it under there she would be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning started to head towards her sister's room. Snow was not far behind though.

Snow lowered its head and sniffed her a bit. The cat hissed a bit as it recognized her scent. Now she was a really special treat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen before Lightning could try to run away again, Snow opened its mouth and lowered it over her upper half. The cat closed its mouth on her waist, all the while making sure not to hurt her, and lifted her into the air. Then Snow started to run off as Lightning's legs kicked the air as she struggled to get free. The journey was not a pleasant one for Lightning as inside the mouth the cat's rough tongue constantly licked her upper half, and it was only made worse by the fact that Snow was purring. Either the cat enjoyed how she tasted or it was happy to finally be able to eat her. It was probably both though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Snow reached their destination. A cat bed that Serah had gotten it. The cat approached the bed and spat Lightning out onto it. Shaking in disgust at being covered in cat saliva, Lightning stood up and was about to make a break for it when Snow started to bat her around with its paws. When the cat stopped batting her around for a moment she stood up once more and tried to run for it only for the cat to grab her cape in its mouth and start dragging her around. Eventually, it released her cape and started batting her around again. Lightning couldn't help but wonder why Snow didn't just eat her and get it over with, and then she remembered that cats always play with their food before eating it. Great, she thought to herself, now not only am I going to be eaten by a cat, but I'm also going to be tortured by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow continued to play with Lightning by batting her around and dragging her by her cape for several minutes. Then the cat grabbed her by cape one last time and instead of dragging her around it tossed her up into the air so hard that her cape was ripped off as it got stuck on the the cat's teeth. Then as Lightning began to fall back to earth she looked down to see Snow's mouth wide open ready to catch her. She flailed her limbs wildly as she desperately tried to alter her course, but was useless. With a plop she landed on the cat's tongue as it closed its mouth, thus sealing her in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning found herself laying face down on the rough tongue inside the cat's dark humid maw. Soon the cat started licking her against the roof of its mouth and rolling her around on its rough tongue, quickly soaking her from head to toe in saliva. The rough tongue hurt as it continued to taste Lightning, and it was made worse by the fact that Snow was purring at her taste again. She prayed that the cat would stop tasting her soon and just swallow her so the torment would end. However, Snow had no intention of doing that anytime soon. The human that it didn't like was just too delicious to eat quickly. So Snow savored her delicious flavor for quite sometime. Eventually, the rough tongue settled down and Lightning sighed a breathe of relief when it started pushing her towards the back of the throat head first. Then the cat tilted its head back and with a loud gulp swallowed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Lightning slowly started to travel down the esophagus, becoming covered from head to toe in mucus and even more saliva. She would have tried struggling within the confining tube, but she was too exhausted from being played with and tasted. However, Lightning found that she didn't really mind as she felt like the muscles were soothingly massaging her while they pushed her down to the stomach. It was only made more soothing by the purring, despite the fact that it hurt her ears, vibrating her body. The soothingness of the esophagus, plus her exhaustion, actually caused Lightning to fall asleep halfway down. By the time she landed in the stomach with a splash, Lightning was in such a deep sleep that she didn't wake up even as the digestive juices began going to work on her. Thus she was saved from much pain as she digested alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Snow laid down on its bed and fell asleep as it digested the most delicious meal it ever had. Later Serah came home alone, because no one believed her story. When she didn't see Lightning anywhere she looking for her. She found the cat lying in its bed and Serah leaned down to pet it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Snow you haven't seen Light. . .\" She began to say until she saw the red fabric hanging out of the cat's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly pulled it out, and saw that it was Lightning's cape. With horror Serah realized that her cat had eaten her sister. For the rest of her life Serah would feel guilt over her sister's death. She felt as though she had intentionally fed Lightning to the cat.</span></div></div>",
