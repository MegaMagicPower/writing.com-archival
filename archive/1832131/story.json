Justin was surprised by the beauty but also scared knowing this didn't make sense mostly because he was in the middle of freaking Texas there was no beach or forest for miles how could any of this be here. he tried to turn around but only saw nothing the tunnel, his old beat up car, the nearly empty parking lot all was gone instead behind him was open air and the boxes he had packed in the back with a odd sheet of paper taped to the top. he tried to get his stuff when a familair cold hand was placed on his shoulder turning he sees Ms. Fuyu different as her hand now bares longer nails and her skin was a pure white her clothes didn't change but a cold aura seems to surround her. \"We will get those brought to your new room shortly Mr. Drew we need to meet everyone else, also let me say welcome to Monster Girl academy I hope we have a fun year.\" she says dragging him off to the main building.    </span></div></div>",

A week ago you were suddenly transported to another world, and by a week ago, you mean a literal week. You were captured by monsters riding monsters, dressed in Victorian era clothes, with both werewolves, vampires. Elves, and Lord knows what else speaking to you. In their near madness of trying to diesect you, began to scream and yell throwing what ever was in reach, eventually getting a sleep spell to your face. In the end a magical necklace was put on your neck, call a '<i>ueaqilieyA</i> am artifact that allows you to all languages heard, seen, and, translate them back with absolute precision. As it was, your home world somehow made contact with the government here, debated over your being, and, in good faith, came to a decision: that you are now a transfer student in this world, since you can't return home. They sent you a house, some form of electricity, all the essentials, and internet access. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a week it was built dwarves, you were lectured by elves on etiquettes, and, finally, given a fairly normal house. In another world. With what could be assumed as 'nice' neighbors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are intimidated, sir Jericho?\" The elf said as the carriage, began to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I mean, yes. It's not just the new environment.\" You meekly stated looking out into the new city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Child, you would do well to remember, that we are not the stories your people weave, we are civilized. Very far from such baseless stories. he stated. \"As it is I do recall having such fears once in my younger years. I was half your age when my father took me to a gathering of nobles, we were the only elves in the whole mansion.\" He once again assumed a very calm demeanor. And silently looked you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, are humans just as destructive as we claim?\" He asked you this time switching your positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea. There are books about how deprived we can be. Stories of world wars, collapses of entire nations.\" You paused looking at him eye to eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"World wars? What do you mean by world wars?\" He asked, this time with a greater interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah it was before my time. But there have been two world wars involving most of the nation's and countries of my world.\" You said a little taken back by his interest in war. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf broke your gaze and looked at the glass window. \"Ah your destination is upon us Jericho. Let us continue this conversation in a more jovial mood. Do take care in your academics sir.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you for your company, Venntis.\" You said. Slowly bowing after you climbed out of the carriage. The elf nodded his head and you turned to leave for class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Jericho, one more worthy mention, my daughters Uslia, and Erias attend the academy as well. O have informed them to help you in your endeavors, but no more than that.\" Venntis said, with a hearty, but barely noticeable grin. You thanked him for watching over you and went to class. <br>\r\nThe local, clearly looking at you. Your earthling clothes, headphones, backpack, boots, and, whatever else was on your person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" You called out to a student, where is alchemy basics?  She turned her body around. Only to reveal a fanged, horn, short girl, with blue skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it's in Mr.Forgear's laboratory, follow this hall to the end and it will be on your left sir.\" She said, while simply giving you a deep inspection, as were her group of friends......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you... I'll take my leave now.\" You said as you went noticing their hushed whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's the human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How brave of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father told me I must speak to it, to see if we could start trading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard it is a male.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's rather exciting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were feeling the heat of the school's new found toy from the locals all ready.</span></div></div>",

Even so, the monsters, who was a mummy, a werewolf, and various others who were at the scene at the time, was going to kill her. Then, the most incredible thing happened, one of the older monsters there, who was a vampire, couldn't bear to leave the child unattended, and therefore she was taken to the \"Foster Home for Monsters\" and was raised there by various monsters there. Many there were wary at first of a human girl living with them, but then they all adored her as if she was part of their family. She is very kind and helpful around the place, and doesn't let the fact of monsters and their appearances scare her at all, though she can be a bit shy, and doesn't really know a lot about the human world as she was raised mainly by various monsters. One day, she received an invitation to the Monster Girl Academy, and she was the first human child to go to school there. Till then, she was just homeschooled by the monsters that took her in.

Her reason for coming to the school is to seek out a human who made enemies of her gargoyle clan by stealing an enchanted shield that has been in her family for generations. Opal now seeks to recover the shield, having tracked her enemy to Grimoire High where she is planning on finding him and making him pay for his crime.<br>\r\nAny talents or skills: Opal is 50 times stronger than a human being and being a gargoyle, she can fly through use of her large leathery wings. Additionally, she can turn her body into solid rock in order to act as camouflage. She's been studying magic for most of her life and can cast spells by speaking backwards (think of Zatanna).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is Opal's last year seeking out the shield stealer at Grimoire High and she has yet to find a lead in her quest. At this time, she is growing more and more impatient as she appears to be holding up what appears to be a cybernetic crystal ball. \"I am losing patience, Oracle,\" she says to the crystal. \"Two years ago, you told me that the thief would be at Grimoire High and in two years I haven't found any sign of him. \"Calm down, Opal. I told you that the thief <i>would</i> be at Grimoire High. That didn't necessarily mean that they would already be there when you arrived.\" Opal just rolls her eyes. \"You oracles take things all too literally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oracle sphere just opened up into a crystal eye. The thief has stolen the Viagon Crest and I predict that he will finally be able to tap into the secrets deep within. There are some things that humans weren't meant to know. But I predict that you will meet up with the thief soon. Listen to my instructions....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Opal paid close attention to what the sphere had to tell her and took note of what she had to do.

She was going to school early because of the oracle crystal's instructions. \"I have discovered a way that will force the Viagon Crest to reveal itself, so listen closely, Opal; I have the ability to transform female human beings into monsters, providing they are virgins of course.\" \"Of course,\" said Opal with a laugh. \"What else. So, you want me to start going around turning the entire school into monsters?\" \"Not quite, my dear Opal. You see, only those with the potential to use magic will be able to transform. Use it on anyone else and they will not survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpal rolled her eyes. \"So, don't tell me, you know exactly who will be transformed and can seek them out.\" \"That is correct,\" said the oracle. \"We must seek out nine students of Grimoire High and transmogrify them into our monster allies. My spell will allow them to assume their human forms at will outside of the school in order to limit the drama but we must locate exactly nine.\" \"And where does that get us?\" The Oracle Eye then showed an image of a strange rock formation, one that appeared to have nine diagonal shaped rocks that resembled platforms. In the center were rocks that formed the shape of a flower. \"When nine virgin monsters arrive at this exact spot, the stone flower will reveal the face of our enemy and the location of the Viagon Crest. But until then, we must create nine polymorph monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpal nodded her head and arrived at the school where she saw students all around. There were human students among monster girls. One of the monster girls was a female werewolf playing basketball and she waved at Opal as Opal waved back. \"Why can't we just gather Luna and eight other monsters, Oracle?\" asked Opal to her oracular guide. The Oracle shook his eye. \"The spell requires monsters that weren't born monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpal walks up to the front door and sees two students already near the door. One of which was a female motorcyclist dressed in a delinquent outfit. She had tanned skin and wore her long black hair into a pompadour.

The overweight girl covered her backside with her book before getting back up. \"Oracle,\" said Opal. \"I know Betty. She's an overweight klutz who has tried to get her weight under control but nothing worked.\" \"Perfect,\" said the oracle. \"I know the perfect creature to transform her into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty walked into the school hiding her ripped skirt with her schoolbook. \"That's the third skirt this month,\" she groaned. \"I swear I'm going to be immobile by college. Drat.\" That's when Betty noticed a shadow cast above her and gasped before she turned and saw Opal. The overweight British girl stepped back and accidentally knocked a young man down a small flight of stairs with her large rear before blushing. \"Oh,\" said Betty. \"Hi Opal. How's your quest going?\" \"Not so good,\" said Opal. \"My oracle says that you could be of used to me.\" Betty let out a scoff. \"Me?\" she asked. \"Don't make me laugh. What am I supposed to do? Suffocate the thief with me big old bum.\" Opal held up the oracle sphere and it was blinking as it stared at Betty. \"Your weight seems to cause you distress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty let out a sigh. \"I've been this way since I was born. I tried starving myself and exercise but I just can't shake off this excess fat. I wish I knew a way to become as skinny as a twig.\" The oracle eye shined bright as Betty looked in surprise. Opal was just as surprised herself. \"Opal,\" said the oracular eye. \"Hand me to Betty.\" Opal did so and Betty held the oracle eye. \"From this moment on,\" said the oracle eye. \"You are one of our allies. You'll be a human whenever you choose but you'll leave your humanity behind whenever you are in this school. Now, you shall be the first.\" The eye glowed and bathed Betty in a strange energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty screamed as a transformation took place. Even Opal was shocked as Betty's eyes turned bright red and her skin started to fade away. While her purple's hair was in tact, Betty body begun to warp until she had transformed into a seven foot tall skeleton. Betty looked around her bony body and gasped as she even looked at her hands and then looked back at her now bony and thin backside. Opal was horrified. \"Oracle!\" she yelled. \"What did you do? You just killed her!\" \"Relax, Opal, she isn't really deceased. I have transformed your classmate into a living skeleton. But when outside of Grimoire High, she will be able to return to human form and back at will.\" Betty just flickered her jawbone and twitched her skeletal fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to take some getting used to.\" Suddenly the bell rang. \"Geez!\" yelled Opal. \"We better get to class.\" With that, the skeleton and gargoyle ran to get to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's POV do we follow now?</span></div></div>",

How would she like a taste of real power?\u201d Opal gave a look of surprise. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d she said. \u201cAtlanta Deneb? One of the nine allies. Get real, Oracle.

He let out a laugh and he looked at Olympia\u2019s panties. \u201cShowtime.\u201d The morally ambiguous eye said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Ohsugi was too busy lecturing his geography class to notice the eye preparing to cast a fateful spell and Opal was too busy taking notes to know what was going on. Atlanta was undergoing a transformation, but not the same kind of transformation as Betty. First, her shoes begun to get rather tight. Atlanta grunted. \u201cWhat is with these shoes?\u201d she thought. \u201cI just bought them yesterday. Atlanta\u2019s feet slipped out of her shoes and revealed that they had turned into golden hooves. At the same time, Atlanta sprouted what looked like gills on her neck as her skin turned a golden yellow orange color from the waist up as her legs expanded into thunderous orange fish-scaled thighs. Atlanta then groaned as her face stretched out to resemble that of a goat and giant curved black horns came out of her head. Finally, she sprouted a giant udder between her legs that tore apart her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpal turned her head and spotted her classmate being transformed and gasped. Mr. Ohsugi stopped speaking and gasped at what he saw. Atlanta struggled to get out her desk, only doing so once she broke it. She stood up to learn she was now an 8-foot tall capricorn, a Greek monster resembling a hybrid of a fish and a goat. She looked at her webbed hands and panted before screaming and running out of the room the moment she noticed everyone staring at her. Mr. Ohsugi promptly fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty saw what happened and clattered her jaws. \u201cSuddenly,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing turned into a skeleton doesn\u2019t seem so bad.\u201d The oracular eye rolled its way back to Opal who gave a look of horror before making her eyes glow red with anger as she looked at the eye. \u201cOnly, lucky seven to go.\u201d Was all the oracle had to say for his actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho\u2019s POV do we follow now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Opal's next class was math class and as she sat down in her seat, another student sat next to her. She was a Native American teenage girl who was wearing sports tape around her wrists and a duffle bag that had a bow in it as well as her school books. The girl noticed Opal and then smiled. \"Hi, Opal. How goes the quest?\" Opal let out a sigh. \"It's going as well as it can Selena.\" Selena Mustang was Opal's closest friend and she was the captain of the archery team at school. She was the one who was most open to the idea of monsters attending Grimoire High and she and her gargoyle friend were on very good terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Selena smirked at Opal. \"What's that I hear about human girls turning into monsters, Opal?\" she asked cheekily. \"First the chubby and timid Betty gets turned into a living skeleton and then that snob Atlanta becomes a capricorn and now I hear that the vice principal turned into a harpy. Then again, she already was a harpy in the metaphorical sense. It did cross my mind that your oracle friend has been busy.\" Opal let out a sigh. \u201cWell. The oracle told me that I was to find 9 virgins and they would help me from the enemy that I\u2019m looking for.\u201d Selena let out a laugh. \u201cWell, you have 6 to go.\u201d Maybe I\u2019m on the list.\u201d Opal and Selena laughed to themselves but then stopped because the mean and nasty math teacher, Mr. Maddocks walked in. \u201cAlright, Neanderthals. Open your books to page 32.\u201d Mr. Maddocks stared at Opal. \u201cAnd in case you freaks don\u2019t know how to count, it\u2019s the page with this symbol at the bottom.\u201d Mr. Maddocks drew the number 32 on the blackboard. Opal gave a scoff. \u201cJerk.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the math teacher was droning on, the oracle ball slipped into Selena's duffle bag and then took a good long look at Selena. \"Hmm,\" he said. \"Very interesting. She's 1 of the 9. Not that I'm surprised. Aha.\" The Oracle emitted magic energy that enveloped Selena as she was busy taking notes. First, her legs took on a cream and cinnamon fur color and then her butt begun to expand and elongate until her pants and underwear were completely destroyed and she sprouted a long tail the same color as her midnight colored hair. She also grew a second pair of legs that ended in hooves. Her front feet also transformed into hooves as they slipped out of her shoes. Finally, Selena's ears turned into those of a Przewalski's Horse. She had become a centaur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, since Selena was sitting down in a chair at the time, the transformation was very uncomfortable and she was grunting in absolute pain as she shook her rear. This disturbed the math teacher who glared at her. \u201cFor ****\u2019s sake, Ms. Mustang, what is wrong with you!\u201d Mr. Maddocks then screamed because Selena stood up and she was wearing her chair around her horse back between her front and back legs. She grunted slightly and broke the chair off as the rest of the class gasped. Opal\u2019s jaw dropped and then she angrily picked up the oracle and put him back in her own backpack. Selena then glared at Opal who could only smile sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce class was over, Selena gave Opal an earful. \u201cYou know. I was being sarcastic. And yet your stupid orb turns me into a centaur.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t get overheated, Selena,\u201d said Opal. \u201cThe oracle said that you\u2019ll be a monster every second you\u2019re on school property but outside of the school you can transform between human and monster of your own free will.\u201d Selena then felt a fly on her horse rump and spanked herself with her tail to swat it. \u201cWell,\u201d said Selena. \u201cFrom the looks of it, I\u2019ll have no choice but to take all my classes standing up from now on, pants will be out of the question and my parents are going to have to convert my bedroom into a stable. It\u2019s lucky for you that I have archery practice at the same time you have gym. I\u2019ll talk to you about this later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpal nodded her head and let out a sigh as she watched her friend galloping away. Selena then paused. \u201cHmm,\u201d she said. \u201cOn second thought, I could really work out with twice the legs. Perhaps I\u2019ll let Opal off easy.\u201d As Opal walked down the hall, she passed a natural-born centaur girl who stared at her horse half and scoffed. \u201cDefinitely implants.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She has reddish brown hair worn in a Japanese style bun and a beaked face with a light blue birthmark on the tip of her upper lip. Being an aquatic monster, she has webbed hands and feet and being a kappa, she has a large dome in the center of her head that is filled with water. Due to her shell she is unable to wear clothing.  In spire of her age, Lynda looks 29 due to kappas having a very, very long lifespan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJob: Coach<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackground: Lynda is a yokai from Japan who who used to live in an underground grotto until she was forced to surface due to an earthquake. For decades she was the reigning champion in yokai sumo before monsters and humans integrated their society with one another and Lynda found herself fighting yokai and humans, the latter of which could never prove a challenge for her. Growing tired of a wrestling ring where she ruled undefeated, Lynda moved from Japan and got a job as a wrestling coach at the monster girls academy. However, she hasn\u2019t lost her edge and likes to remind a few troublemaking students that picking a fight with her is a seriously bad idea. The students, male and female, monster and human are intimidated by the very large kappa woman but she has a softer side that is brought out when she is with her adoptive human son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalents and Skills: Being a kappa, Lynda can swim as fast as a torpedo, stay underwater for hours without coming up for air, and is skilled in sumo wrestling. Lynda\u2019s shell is indestructible enough to withstand an explosion and she is strong enough to lift a truck with one arm. In spite of her massive bulk, Lynda is as graceful as a ballerina.Tengu<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYokai # 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Kasumi Yoda<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Tengu<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 26<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: A rather fat and bright red-skinned goblin woman with large black-feathered wings on her back. Being a tengu, Kasumi has a very long nose. She also has platinum blonde hair and blue patch over her left eye. For clothing, she usually wears a pair of white jeans with a green jacket, black tanktop and a pair of tengu geta sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJob: Security Guard<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackground: Kasumi is a Japanese immigrant to the who was forced to leave Japan and get a job at the monster girl academy. She was the witness to a terrible crime and her testimony revealed that a particularly dangerous yokai was responsible and resulted in that very same yokai being imprisoned, bringing a grudge that threatened the young tengu woman\u2019s life. Kasumi had no choice but to live among humans. Unfortunately, Kasumi like most tengus, doesn\u2019t like humans that much and likes to play tricks on them whenever she gets the chance. Some of her tricks are harmless but other times they can be dangerous. However, she saves her more fiendish tricks for troublesome boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalents and Skills: Kasumi is very clever and skilled with medicines, potions and spells. Being an air element monster, she can move at rapid speed and fly really high. She also possesses the ability to perform certain ninjutsu techniques such as teleportation and substitution. Kasumi\u2019s nails are sharp enough to cut the air and create razor winds that can cut through steel. Finally, Kasumi possesses an invisibility cloak that allows her to hide from humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow who do we follow?</span></div></div>",

She was born from giant parents (the male has pass away), and lives with her mother in Mt Fuji in Japan. Now the humans in Japan have known the giants for many years, and have adjusted their cities to suit their needs and is usually very friendly with them a majority of the time, though some of them and unknown parts of the world, the views on giants and humans can vary differently. Some are friendly and will usually help the humans, and others will be at each other's throats, well the giants would be easily on the human's throats, or in one. She known human culture as her mother has had a human friend who was able to get her a job as a movie star, but as a giant monster movie star, and she is very popular among the crowd, from the boys and girls, human, giant, and monster. She is also a model, and is a great friend with the city of Tokyo. She even has a few giant friends like her who are also friends with the city as well, and are also support to the city in various ways. A running joke is that the people who are smaller to them will call the girl monster names, like how she is called Nariezilla from time to time, and she doesn't mind. Because of how big the girls are, the monster academy made a giant version for them so they can learn just like the other students. Let's see how that goes.<br>\r\nAny talents or skills: One of her most important traits is that she gets along with humans and monsters easily, and can navigate any enviornment without causing any damages as all, unless she is in a giant monster movie of course. Being bigger obivously, the strength, and her adorable appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanna follow her? (I will admit this, even though she looks human, a giant can still be considered a monster so she does qualify.)</span></div></div>",
