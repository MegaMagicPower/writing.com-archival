You actually had a good night's rest, so technically you're all in good health to face the day, though that doesn't mean you're terribly excited about it if it's some boring stuff, like one more school day. Then again, whether it's school or not, you look forward to spending more quality time with Jen, your crush. And deep down, you enjoy Lillian's endless teasing, although letting her know that would be borderline suicidal, or a very risky bet (although you could also argue that the reward would be incredibly high too). You soon get out of bed and go take a nice, cool shower before you get dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make yourself a nice breakfast, you're pretty much by yourself since your parents constantly travel around the country because of their job, though depending on the time of the year, you may or may not be fully alone. You look at your phone, as you have no idea what date it is today...</span></div></div>",

School had been so overwhelming on its last days that you barely even registered the days going by, and summer vacation almost caught you off-guard 'Summer vacation, huh? Nice!' You think. You're looking forward to spending time with Jen, and maybe ask her out one of these days. Hanging out with Lillian is also fun, though you wish you had a gas mask or an oxygen tank. A part of you still kinda looks forward to that, despite the murder inflicted on your respiratory system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it's summer, it's also highly likely that Ariadne will show up sooner or later, and that is if your parents didn't actually tell you to pick her up 'Eh, that hardly matters, she minds her own business even if she's here... or so I hope' you thought. There were some people from school that also seemed to have wanted to hang out with you outside class, which you never did outside your only two friends, but you don't think it's too likely. You've got the feeling there is something you must do, however your memory is still a bit fuzzy, as you pretty much showered and crashed onto your bed before blacking out, so, you still wonder if you've got any plans today...</span></div></div>",

Memories quickly come back to you, and you effectively remember that Lillian and Jen had been talking about going together to the beach for quite a while, and it was the thing they were looking forward the most. School had been so dull you somehow forgot, though. Still, you smile, you're going to get a chance to look at Jen in a bikini, though you're a bit worried about your heart, knowing Lillian likes to go for extremely skimpy stuff to show off her outrageous curves. You quickly reply and grab your stuff, a couple of towels, sunblock, some nice sunglasses, flipflops, a change of clothes and swimming trunks as well as your wallet because you're obviously going to need cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't consider yourself a very \"outdoors\" person, but you certainly enjoy swimming, and either the beach or a swimming pool are nice plans in your book. Besides, you remind yourself that you're going to see two sexy girls in a swimsuit, or, if you're lucky, a bikini. As you finish putting your stuff in a backpack, you get another text telling you that they're waiting at Lillian's house, right next to yours. Jen's the one with the car, and you think Lillian has some beach chairs, so it makes sense. You walk out of your house and effectively, they're putting the beach chairs in the car's trunk <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" You wave at them, and they greet you back with a smile <br>\r\n\"Hey! Summer's finally here, I almost can't believe it!\" Jen says with a giggle<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you didn't sleep in though...\" Lillian said as she finished putting the last chair in the trunk and closing it. She then walked towards you and leaned on you hip-first \"Or maybe the thought of looking at two beauties in bikinis kept you up all night, huh?\" she said with a cryptic look even you couldn't tell whether it was a joke or she was being serious, but then again, having been her friend for so long, you reasonably bet it's the former case.<br>\r\n\"I slept well, thank you\" You replied with a snarky smirk, and she comically pouted in response. She turned around, rubbing her enormous bottom on your groin for a brief moment as she walked towards the car, which made it bounce and jiggle more than you think it had a right to \"You won't be disappointed at least\" she added as she suddenly looked at you and smirked. You froze for a split second, and wondered if she caught you staring, but you hope she didn't. You laugh it off and look back at Jen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lillian...\" You two both say at once with a sigh. You're happy she's at least aware that all the teasing comes from her, you think many other girls would probably get jealous, or mad at you even if you were innocent, which would suck.<br>\r\n\"She wasn't lying about the bikinis part though\" Jen added with a giggle, and you're not sure if she batted her eyelashes at you or just blinked like a normal person, but you decide not to risk your chances \"Let's go!\" She added, and with that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The car ride to the beach doesn't feel overly long, and it's just three friends having fun and laughing. Before you know, the car stops, and you see you are indeed at the beach. Surprisingly enough, there isn't a whole lot of people around, which you find a bit strange, since usually the beach is brimming with people on summer vacation. You shrug and think that maybe people have got better stuff to do today, which you appreciate, as you don't particularly enjoy crowded places. You get out of the car and so do the girls and Jen opens the trunk, you automatically reach for the chairs, being the only guy around, and guess you're expected to carry them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" You hear Lillian say, and you turn around, feeling curious about that. Your eyes almost pop out as both she and Jen take off her clothes right then and there, revealing that they'd been wearing their bikinis all along. You look at Jen's first, and it's more beautiful than you ever expected, it's a bright red Brazilian bikini that somehow makes her enormous chest look even bigger, and it wobbles even while she's standing still, invitingly in a way, though you decide against making your staring too blatant. She really made an effort, though the bikini itself might be one size too small for her, and you can practically hear Lillian giving her that kind of advice. You look farther down, and her bikini bottom tightly hugs her large hips, cutting a bit into their delicious thickness, and you can only imagine how it looks from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought alone makes you instantly blush. However, you're snapped out of that as Lillian clears her throat, clearly annoyed at your lack of attention to her, and as soon as you see her, you blush harder and feel like you might have a heart attack, or a stroke... Lillian stood before you with an absurd yellow bikini, that you're not even sure if it's some kind of microkini or just a bikini that's two or three sizes too small for her. Her top seems to struggle to cover her boobs, which you're a bit surprised by, as you tended to forget she actually has a sizable bust, since all her clothing at school emphasized her rear instead. It's so tight it definitely cuts into her soft, thick flesh, and apparently she's not afraid to show that she has a little of love handles, though to be fair, they don't really detract from her look. You still could see her mouth somewhere above, and it slowly curved into a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't seen the best part yet though\" She said as she slowly turned around. Your heart skipped a few beats as once again you were presented with the view of the biggest ass you knew of. It rippled and wobbled deliciously from her faintest motions, and it was so huge it looked unreal in a way, and exceedingly real in another. Her bikini bottom itself was, however, a puny excuse of a thong that was mercilessly devoured by her massive crack, which, despite being in direct sunlight, you still couldn't see the end of. You gulped hard and heard her giggle. \"Oops!\" Lillian then 'dropped' her phone and promptly bent over to pick it up, which made her giant ass spread a little, as well as jiggle and wobble more as she took her sweet time to pick it up. After she did, she looked back at you with a smile, and gave you a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, there'll be a lot more of that as the day goes by\" she said with a smug smile while you looked away, trying to let your face cool down, it felt like it might as well be a kettle at this point. You take a deep breath and try to use what little you learned of meditation to try and get your body back under control. It works after a few seconds, fortunately. You wonder what'll happen next...</span></div></div>",

I actually slept in and missed breakfast to be here on time, so, I think I should grab something to eat\" she said apologetically<br>\r\n\"That's fine. I'll go with you. I figured we'd also need some drinks\" Lillian shrugged and looked at you \"Want something?\" she asked<br>\r\n\"Well, I had breakfast not too long before, but I'd be down for a soda\" You reply with a shrug, and go back to the car to grab your backpack and get some cash from your wallet to give her.<br>\r\n\"People usually say what kind of drink they'll want\" Lillian said with a smug look<br>\r\n\"I think you've known me long enough to know my favorite... and if you miss that, I guess you should turn over your 'best friend card' \" You reply with equal smugness, and she laughs<br>\r\n\"Touch\u00e9. But if I can't find it, it'll have to be something else\" She warned<br>\r\n\"You easily know my top 5 drinks\" You chuckled<br>\r\n\"More like 10, or even 15 if I think about it\" Lillian said \"Welp, we'll go get that while you set up our stuff, ok?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but how will you know where to find me?\" You asked with a raised eyebrow<br>\r\n\"There's a huge chunk of the beach with hardly any people in it, and you're like 7 feet tall, I don't think you're easy to miss, duh\" She said, flicking a finger on your forehead<br>\r\n\"Okay, got me there. Anyway, I'll try to be in a straight line from here, you should easily find our parasols\" You said<br>\r\n\"Alright! See ya in a few!\" Both she and Jen then left, they headed to a bunch of food stands in the distance. You shrugged and grabbed the stuff. The good thing about your size was that it let you get away with being quite strong despite not being a health nut nor a gym addict, so you grabbed everything in one go and walked to a nice, fairly secluded spot close to the sea but not too close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit of hard, physical work, but you got it, and in a few minutes, you had put the towels, the parasols and the three beach chairs to have a nice, relaxing vacation day at the beach, you sigh in satisfaction and lay on one of the beach chairs and browse your phone for memes. Not too long after, you're not sure if it's the heat or something else, since you're not exactly the kind of guy to tire out easily, but you suddenly feel sleepy, very sleepy. Your body feels weak, and you can no longer move. You feel scared. It's normal instinct that when you're falling asleep you feel like you're falling, as your brain sends a drastic electrical signal to jolt your body back to life, but this time, that jolt never comes, and you can't even move your limbs anymore. You think about screaming for help, but even your mouth and vocal chords fail to respond you 'What the hell is this?!' you think, and you fruitlessly try to will your body into moving to no avail 'Is... is this how I die? I didn't even do anything stupid! I didn't eat or drink anything weird! C'mon!' You think and struggle harder, but that only depletes what little energy you had left, which dwindles down by the second. Soon, the darkness gets its cold, ruthless grasp on you 'You've got to be freaking... kidding... me...' you think, still angry at the sheer absurdity of this situation, that escapes your comprehension as your conscience drifts away into the endless void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unknown amount of time later, you suddenly wake up, although your eyes are still closed, you can still see that there's sunlight over you. You wonder is that was some sort of day-nightmare, or sleep paralysis, but you're glad to be alive, and that whatever happened is over. However, something feels off, and you open your eyes. There's a hell of a lot more open space around you, very strangely; you look down next, and you see that a similar material to your beach chair is under you, but it extends miles and miles into the horizon, and as your eyes regain their focus, you can see that the thing still has the same colored stripes, but they're much larger and spread much farther away. You scratch your head, wondering if this is some kind of fever dream, as you weren't the kind to do drugs. You stand up and feel the sunlight heating your skin, but that could be simulated in a dream, or so you think. You next pinch yourself, which only succeeds in making you feel pain, but this weird illusion you seem to be trapped in won't go away. You then slap yourself, to no effect, and before you can think of anything else, there's a series of earthquakes that knock you off your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to stand up and turn to look, and you feel your blood run cold: Before you, though at what must be several miles away in your scale, Lillian and Jen stand with their backs turned. For them to look so large and yet be so far away, they must be beyond huge to you. You then quickly put two and two together, and a horrid realization hits you like a bucket of cold water: Somehow, you shrunk to an incredibly small size. You're decent at calculating the size of things without rulers, but this is absolutely ridiculous. Still, by your own estimation, you must be less than half an inch tall compared to the chair <br>\r\n\"What the friggin he-?!\" you mumble to yourself when suddenly, a thunderous explosion roars from their direction, and soon after, a colossal gale wind knocks you over and the smell hits you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross, Lillian! Did you really just fart?\" Jen asks<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what's the problem?\" Lillian shrugged \"You've heard me fart before\" she said before she let out another one, even longer and louder than the first. Despite the vast (to you) distance, her titanic release hit you like a truck, harder than the first. The sheer force of her 'wind' knocked you hard on your back and the temperature raised a little around you for a few seconds. The smell worsened, obviously.<br>\r\n\"Well, they smell really bad, and Blaise is right over there...\" Jen replied, fanning the offensive smell away from her own face<br>\r\n\"So what? Yours become far worse than mine the moment you eat anything with beans and I put up with it\" Lillian replied nonchalantly, prompting Jen to blush hard and shush her. She gave her a smug grin \"Oh, right... <i>he doesn't know... yet...</i> \"<br>\r\n\"He doesn't need to know that!\" Jen said in an angry whisper<br>\r\n\"Please, he knows better than anyone else that girls fart too. I do it all the time, and he doesn't even mind\" Lillian replied, still with that smug aura emanating from her<br>\r\n\"W-Well, maybe it works for you, but I don't want to gross him out...\" Jen looked away embarrassedly<br>\r\n\"I don't know if you ever plan on making a move on him, but if you do, I seriously don't think he'll dump you for something as trivial as a fart. Everyone does it\" Lillian said a bit more seriously, dropping the smug smirk from earlier<br>\r\n\"Uh... can we drop this topic for now? We're not within earshot, but I'd rather not take my chances...\" Jen sighed<br>\r\n\"Anyway, if you're really that worried, how about you give me those three bean burritos you got?\" Lillian said next<br>\r\n\"Eh, you're right... I shouldn't be eating this anyway...\" Jen said as she handed them over to her <br>\r\n\"Should've thought of that before you ate one...\" Lillian said as she stuffed her mouth with one of them<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, didn't you already eat three of these yourself on the way here?\" Jen asked with a raised eyebrow<br>\r\n\"That's the nice thing about having a bigger 'fuel tank' \" Lillian laughed as she patted her belly, and happily scarfed the second burrito down like a hungry wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're surprised you didn't freeze and shatter upon hearing that conversation. Considering that you're on a chair, this can quickly become really really REALLY bad for you if you don't act quickly, but the distances are absurdly vast, you don't think you can really make out of there in time, and considering there's 3 chairs in total, you pray that yours will be spared. The earthquakes return, and they intensify as the two colossal girls draw closer to your location, you close your eyes as you blindly run away, hoping for basically a miracle...</span></div></div>",

Either of these girls has a huge ass that will likely not just take up the whole chair, but it will likely also spill over to the sides, which means there's no room for you to hide. You keep on running, for the adrenaline pumping throughout your body compels you to do so, although you're surprised that the shadow isn't darkening, and you don't feel like anything is moving above you. You keep running, you can't risk wasting even a single millisecond on the off chance that you can somehow get away from getting crushed by an unfathomably large butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like minutes, or miles in your scale, the adrenaline levels in your blood drop, and soon you stop, falling to your knees out of sheer exhaustion. The shadow hasn't changed, and out of a morbid sense of curiosity, you struggle to stand up and turn around. Instead of a gigantic ass hovering over you, Lillian is standing in front of your chair with her arms crossed. Her face is miles above in the sky, and yet, you feel your eyes lock with yours, and soon her jaw drops 'Did... did she really see me?!' you think to yourself, but you're not sure if these are good or bad news, although, at least it means you got spared from getting crushed into oblivion by the biggest, fattest and heaviest ass you knew. She gives you a smile, but that doesn't do anything to make you feel better, it's the kind of smile she gives whenever she's gonna tease the ever living hell out of you, and you fear what she might be up to with you at your current size. She turns to look at Jen, who's staring at the sea and sipping her drink, probably thinking about what to do first, and Lillian looks back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if she read your mind, she gestures at you to be quiet and with a silent giggle, she carefully picks you up with two fingers, which look like skyscrapers to you, which means you're probably around the size you thought, less than half of an inch, as small as an ant, if not even smaller. She then lifts you up to her eye level and stares at you intently, her emerald eyes, magnified thousands of times over, have a piercing beauty you feel you overlooked far too many times, but right now, you fear whatever thought lies behind those eyes, for they're probably nothing good for you by her smug, mischievous, and at the same time amazed look. She looked like a kid that found her Christmas present early. You saw her pupils widen as she examined you, and, as counter-productive as it might be, you decided to try and wave to prove that you were alive, in case she thought you were some kind of toy and got some other 'funny' ideas. She stared marveled at you, and it seems like she was able to not just make out your general look, but she looked into your eyes, and stared at your body, she watched you breathe and you feel you saw some kind of thing awaken in her, but you couldn't tell if it was some sort of sinister hunger, or if her playfulness was reaching levels far beyond what you knew, and worst of all, you had no idea which would be the worse option. You can almost see the wheels turning in her head as she ponders what to do with you, with the idea of \"helping you\" probably buried deep at the bottom of her list of options, if not downright discarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, you're at her complete mercy, and you hope that the judgement she passes onto you is good, or, not as painful as you think...</span></div></div>",

She winked at you, lowered you a bit to her lips and blew you a kiss before she slowly lowered you farther down and brought you around her waist. Nothing could prepare you for the next sight, her ass was already ridiculously huge at normal size, easily capable of swallowing your face if she so wished; now, it was quite literally a pair of round, jiggling, fatty planets. She wiggled her hips to further tease you, and you couldn't help but stare as the impossibly enormous masses rippled and bounced into each other, each time they did so making an intimidating boom that slightly shook your bones. You gulped hard, you didn't think Lillian could take her teasing so far, and you still held the remote hope that this were a mere joke to make fun of your current size before seriously getting you help. Still, you knew that wasn't very likely to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian pressed you into one of her enormous cheeks, and you could feel both its warmth and incredible softness; as you kinda knew already, her ass was mostly fat, and thus, when she pressed you more into it, you sank a couple inches into her blubbery squishiness. She then rubbed you in small circles on it, and it looked like she wanted to feel you across every single square inch of her gigantic cheek. She looked again at Jen, who was still finishing her drink, or maybe trying to regain her composure after that conversation she just had with her. Lillian shrugged and focused back on you, repeating the process with her other asscheek. When she finished, she looked at you from over her shoulder and gave you a big, mischievous grin and wiggled her eyebrows as well as she brought you before her humongous crack, a chasm that could put even the Grand Canyon to shame if you were normal sized compared to it. You go pale and frantically shake your head, but her smile widens and she nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly digs her yellow thong out of the depths of her titanic asscrack and pulls it back. She triple checked on Jen to make sure she's not looking or heading her way, but is relieved to see that she's still seemingly lost in thought. Smiling at you again, she stuffed you into the back of her puny looking thong before she lets go, and it snaps back into her deep crack. She pulled up her thong and giggled, feeling the tiny lump wedged deep into her huge, fat ass, encased all around by her soft flesh. It was so big that even like this, you were only about halfway deep into her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian smiled. She, by any stretch of the imagination, had never expected something like this could happen, but she deemed it to good a chance to pass up, and now she could finally claim Blaise as hers and hers alone. She wanted to talk to him when they got back home, she had so many questions, but for now, that was out of the question, and there was one point that she needed to get across by then: He belonged to her, and he was going to spend A LOT of time with her plus-sized booty from now on. She knew he was tough, and a bit stubborn, so she'd leave him there until he got the message that he was her plaything now, after which, she'd let him out. She slowly shook her hips and felt their jiggling and wobbling all over his tiny figure. Biting her bottom lip, she clenched her butt the lightest she could, just to feel him sinking even more into her flesh and struggled a bit to contain her laughter. 'This is certainly going to be an interesting day' she thought and grabbed her butt, lightly kneading it and fondling herself in a way, but focusing into Blaise's tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you found yourself in pitch black darkness, entirely surrounded by a warm, squishy mass with a mind-blowing weight from both sides that exceeded your understanding. The stench of her previous farts lingered, as even her gases found it difficult to escape such a gigantic rear. The warmth around you also quickly became rather uncomfortable, though it wasn't the worst thing in the world. Still, it took you a few minutes to fully process what just happened, and when you finally did, the realization hit you like a bucket of bricks, and you started hyperventilating. Your situation was beyond bleak: You were incredibly small, almost a speck, trapped in the biggest, heaviest, and to your misfortune gassiest booty ever, and it was this last part that made your blood feel like it froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven at normal size, Lillian's farts were intense enough that she could blow papers off desks that happened to be behind her as she broke wind, and even erasers and pencil sharpeners could get blown away too. Of course, she found that hilarious and considered it a talent<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Flashback]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in 7th grade, puberty had already hit Lillian, she was the tallest girl in the class and her ass was unrivaled in sheer size. Being a bit more childish at that age (12 - 13), she often made jokes about her (rather constant) farts. One day, after the final bell had rung and all students had left or were leaving, you saw her standing before your desk when you suddenly heard a certain thundering roar followed by the sound of papers getting blown away, as well as an eraser and pencil sharpener, and even a couple of pencils fell off as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, Lillian!\" You complained, though you also found it difficult not to laugh, and were trying your hardest at it. You knelt down to pick up your papers and school supplies, put them on the desk before she farted again, and they flew off the desk just like before. She looked down at you from over her shoulder and smiled mischievously, but you just sighed and picked them up again, this time, holding them down with a hand to ensure they wouldn't fly away a third time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be more careful with where you point that weapon\" You teased her, but she 'called your bluff', so to speak<br>\r\n\"Normally people get away when they have a weapon pointed at them, don't they?\" she said as she turned her butt to exactly face you<br>\r\n\"Only school supplies are endangered by that weapon, and it's not like they can run away...\" You replied with a deadpan look<br>\r\n\"For now, but who knows about the future?\" Lillian smiled<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n\"If I hit the radioactivity jackpot I could grow as big as Godzilla... think about it...\" Lillian's smile became more smug, but she had actually thrown you off, and you took a moment to try and understand what she was saying \"Imagine that I become the size of Godzilla...\" she said slowly, and your 12 years old mind finally got it, your eyes widened and when she saw it, she laughed<br>\r\n\"At that size even <b>this</b> weapon could be pretty devastating, don't you think?\" she said, smacking her booty for emphasis, however, you found yourself unable to respond with anything coherent \"I bet I could blow the school away if I can get my hands on some bean burritos before I grow\" she added <br>\r\n\"That'd be the worst apocalypse ever\" You finally responded<br>\r\n\"Eh, there are worse ways to go\" She said with a shrug as she nonchalantly grabbed your pencil sharpener, dangled it above her crack for a few seconds before dropping it in, and shortly after, she ripped another massive fart \"What would you rather? Getting blown to bits in an instant, or... staying in the world's biggest gas chamber?\" she said, slightly kneading her butt<br>\r\n\"Okay, got me there...\" You raised an eyebrow. At this point, you were hardly surprised by having conversations like this with her. <br>\r\n\"So, you better be careful and don't make me mad, or one day you could end up right there\" Lillian laughed and let out yet another big fart that echoed around the empty classroom<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll make sure to keep you away from anything radioactive, besides your farts\" You said, laughing a little at the end. Lillian then remembered your pencil sharpener and dug it out of her crack \"Oh, I was forgetting about this...\" she said with a giggle<br>\r\n\"You can keep it...\" You shuddered, but still, both of you laughed, and soon headed out of class and back home<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[End of Flashback]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of all things, how in the seven hells did that manage to come true?\" You mumbled to yourself. Snapping back of your inner monologue and flashbacks, you faintly heard Lillian giggling, and your surroundings shake from side to side, but in such a massive way that it's hard to describe, it was as if the whole world swung from one side to the other, and that said world consisted of an impossibly large pair of warm waterbeds. The pressure on you coming from those two 'walls' was mind-blowing, but somehow, you felt it increase, and you sank more into the warm jiggly mass around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian shook her hips some more before grabbing her thong and wedging it even deeper into her crack, she wanted Blaise to understand that she was his whole world now, in a quite literal sense, she also knew that Jen would soon come back and they'd have to do stuff while pretending not to know what happened with him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[And the next choices are...]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Front row seat for Hurricane Lillian</b>: Her big breakfast and the burritos from earlier started to kick in, making her stomach rumble and groan. She bit her lip in excitement, unleashing her massive farts upon your tiny form was definitely part of her plans, but she had intended to leave that for later until you 'got used' to her rear. However, she won't be able to hold the incoming gas in, and decided to just 'screw it' and fart all over poor Blaise. You just got yourself a front row seat for a truly massive, monstrous storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lillian's ass toy:</b> She can feel her bowels already at work with all she ate before, but she decides to hold them in until they can get back to her home, where she can let loose freely (and they'll be much, MUCH worse). However, for now, she'll just keep shaking her hips and clenching on you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ass-blasted</b>: Lillian already feels gassy and decides to let it rip upon you. Her first fart, though, is so huge and powerful that it shoots you out of her ass like a bullet and you end up flying off somewhere else</span></div></div>",

Lillian then lets go of the band, causing you to be launched in between Jen's crack. Jen somehow didn't feel a thing. Lillian then starts talk with Jen for a while. \"You sure you don't want one of my burritos?\" Lillian asked Jen \"I know you want one\". Jen thought about it. She was really hungry, and she could probably hide he farts from you. Little did she know that you would feel every fart she ripped. \"You know what, sure.\" Jen said hesitantly, \"Sure\".

Behind the door, a black woman stood there in a black suit and at the same height as you.<br>\r\n\"Is a Blaise Rodr\u00ecguez here?\" She asked, her hazel eyes scanning you in full detail.<br>\r\n\"That's me, Miss...\" \"Agent Vivian Foxy, Mr. Rodriguez.\" She answered and your eyes bulged out at the government agent before you.<br>\r\n\"I'll keep this short: you have been randomly selected for a secret government project and we would like you to be apart of it. However, you are free to reject this offer and we'll select another candidate. though you'll miss out on the massive compensation we planned to give you.\"<br>\r\n\"And that is...\" \"300 million will be sent to your bank account and three years of no taxes of any kind, as we'll pay for it. That's the initial price,\" she replied, your jaw dropping at the pay.<br>\r\n\"This quite something, but I'm underage first off and second, what...\" \"Classified.\" You managed to say before Foxy shut you down.<br>\r\n\"I understand this isn't an easy decision, so we'll wait your decision three days later. Here's my card if you want to call me earlier\"<br>\r\nWith that, she turned around and left. While her bust was a decent D-cup, her backside was quite plump, despite it being slightly smaller than Jen's. Her butt jiggled along with her afro, your eyes following her backside until she entered her car and drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually contact your mother and after a bit of debating between the two of you, your mother gave in through tears and you immediately called up Agent Foxy. The next day, you see Foxy waiting in front of the car and after hugging your family and friends, you left with Vivian. Though she was a government agent and always changed the topic from the project, she was quite the friendly person and talked about your life. Eventually, you both reach an apartment building in downtown and exit the vehicle as a man ran out from the building. With a flash of her badge, the man nodded and stepped aside as Vivian led you into the building. After reaching the fifth floor, you both walked up to a door that had the number 508 and in a series of knocks and slaps, the door opened up. Standing there, a muscle bound woman wearing some military pants with combat boots and a light green tank top. With a bust bigger than her head and an ass that surpassed all sizes you have seen so far, the soldier saluted the agent.<br>\r\n\"At ease, Sgt. Penny Stone,\" Vivian said and the woman relaxed, a bit too much.<br>\r\nAn explosive foghorn roared out of Penny's butt and the intense scent of decayed chicken could be smelled, both you and Agent Foxy covering your noses. After fifteen seconds, the fart ended and the brunette sighed happily.<br>\r\n\"That curry really hit the spot! Later!\" Penny giggled, brushing her wavy, brown hair away from her face as she patted her exposed eight pack and left the duo in her fart cloud.<br>\r\nDespite the tears, you saw how her backside didn't jiggle, but sway with her wide hips and Vivian's own belly gurgled in response. A wet spattering of a fart caught your attention to the back of the room, where another woman sat in front of the computer and raised her cheek up to fart. Unlike Vivian and Penny, who were respectively equal and taller than you in height, the blonde was a bit shorter than you and was quite fat. Wearing a lab coat over a green sweater and some brown dress pants, it was quite taut around her blubbery body as the blonde had sharp green eyes. With a rack to put all others to shame, a gut big as a past due quintets and butt cheeks bigger than both combined, she was very curvy to your eyes. Shifting through the junk food wrappers, the scientist waddled over to you and glared at you through her glasses.<br>\r\n\"Is this the guy?\" She asked gruffly, ignoring the earlier fart with her own gas from her rear end.<br>\r\nVivian nodded and the scientist grinned before she injected you with an unknown liquid. You blacked out and heard a 'Dr. Samantha Carter' from the government agent, the scientist's name you assumed, before you lost consciousness. Waking up later, you saw you were wearing a black skin suit, but the ground felt weird. Looking around, you were shocked that everything was huge and a chuckle rumbled across the 'land' you were on.<br>\r\n\"You shrunk, stupid. This experiment is testing out extreme environments in this state and will last for a month,\" Dr. Carter said, you now realized you were on her hand.<br>\r\n\"You just have to have to survive in the bowels as you do some assigned tasks we give you and you don't worry about any poop coming after you as the bowels were modified to make gas instead,\" Vivian explained and you tilted your head in confusion.<br>\r\n\"Bowels?\" \"That's Right! You'll be entering the final stages of the digestive system!\" Dr. Carter sneered as she presented you to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, a violent eruption rumbled the 'plains' and a feminine sigh came out from the 'hill's' direction before an unbelievable smell hit you hard, the feeling of vomit reaching your mouth.

Breasts as big as her head, with a thin waist before it expands out into a very thick hips, it wasn't surprising for people to think she was the king's daughter instead of his wife. Giving the look of a German woman with green hair and violet eyes, her face is always stiff and the queen is usually expressionless even after her husband's passing. However, despite looking apathetic and strict towards everything, Vanessa is depressed about her lover being gone and chose to deal with it by taking over his duties in a cold manner. She's also misses their sex life as much as the king, seeing she has quite the fetish to satisfy her. Things could get spicy between you two, seeing how you have no idea how she'll react to your current state. 50-29-59<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Princess Penelope or Penny, a plump, long, pink haired girl around your age of a height of 6'3\". Spoiled throughout her life by the people around her, she's more na\u00efve than cruel, believing everything she's doing is right because of a lack of education. But other than this flaw, she's one of the most kindest people around, and could bring life into the dead souls around her. With big breasts, bigger bum, and a belly bigger than both combined, Penny is quite fat from her lifestyle and the results from it also affected her bowels, one time having her fart non-stop for a week before. 45-104-57<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Head maid Belinda, a bearkin that works as both the head maid and personal maid of Penny. With possibly the biggest breasts around, her motherly figure was no joke, as it could make many heads turn with her slim waist and plump rump. Her wavy violet hair hangs a bit above her bottom as her cyan eyes open up like jewels, adding more to her motherhood look. Just like her figure, she's very motherly and loves to help out, a massive factor to why Penny was spoiled in the first place. Belinda, unfortunately, has a habit of misunderstanding things and can make things worse without realizing it. 68-20-44<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam the 5'8\" butler, an effeminate, pear-shaped male elf that is actually a woman and usually serves directly under the queen. Piercing, golden eyes; short, cropped up blue hair; Sam is the very definition of handsome, and the body she had was very similar to your second cousin, Celeste. Publicly, Sam is a hard worker and is very polite, capable of doing her duties very well. In reality, though, Sam gets easily stressed out by her duties and her stomach reacts strongly to this, Sam usually fumigating areas to the point it's considered to be a death trap gas chamber. While only a few know her actual identity, how will she react to you when she finds you? 25-23-80<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Guard knight, Cleo the 6'5\" demon. Not much is known about her, as she rarely talks, only if she's been ordered to. With white curly hair that rains until her mid-back, her blue eyes with orange irises contrasts against her crimson skin and black horns that curve towards the sky. With bulging muscles all over her, from her thick limbs to her 8 pack abs, nobody would be stupid enough to mess with her. However, there rumors of mysterious green flames that appear and emit a horrendous stench, but Cleo denies anything about it with a purple blush. 39-29-43<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2)You're at an inn, housing the strongest S class adventurer party, Arkfiend.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bell, the human swordsman. Considered to be the next hero, Bell has reason to be confident and likes to show off. However, she does have some kindness and shows a tsundere attitude towards people she cares about; the more violent she is, the bigger the love she has for that person. With a slender body, shaped by workouts, and the red ruby eyes matching her sandy yellow side pony tail, she's quite the beauty. However, she's embarrassed by her loose bowels, which creates monstrous farts and Bell, from her pride, doesn't want anyone to know about it. 33-24-39<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carly, the dark elf assassin of 5'3\". With dark skin and white hair reaching her shoulders, Carly has an expressionless look in her amber eyes. Despite being the best in stealth with a bow and dagger, her fat butt refuses to stay quiet in situations that require silence. It's more of an annoyance for her and she wouldn't mind making it quiet by putting something up her deep butt. 40-21-54<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah, the super shy dwarven priestess. At the usual height for dwarves of 3'5\", Sarah is shy around people, even less around the people she knows. Dressed in a very white nun habit that covers everything, nobody can really see her body, except for the brown eyes that stare from rotund face. However, people can tell how stacked the short stack is with her curvy tits and round bottom (sometimes her chubby belly). Her stomach reacts badly to stressful situations and she easily gets stressed out from her shyness, resulting in some potent farts. 44-33-55<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eliza the squirrel beastkin mage of 6'9\". Dressed in a purple dress and matching witch's hat, her golden tail sticks out like that to match her long, straight hair. With mischief in her green eyes, Eliza plans to become the greatest fart wizard of all time in the world. Conducting multiple experiments on herself or anybody around her, mostly her teammates to their misfortune, learning new spells, loading up on gassy food; it was all to improve the gastric monster that has been brewing her body. With shapely breasts and a sexy ass, she's still sadden nobody would lend an ear to her findings and indulge with her in this curiosity of hers for a long time. 54-26-67<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) It's just some random villager's hut that only houses a human, female villager that does a bunch of work, like farming, blacksmithing, and of the like. Character design is up to the reader.</span></div></div>",

She was marveled at the fact that even your clothes shrank with you. Her initial shock and surprise quickly wore off, and what remained was unparalleled curiosity. You had been nervous about getting caught by fingers larger than skyscrapers, but at the same time, there was some sense of relief, as she did notice you after all, it could've been much, much worse otherwise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" She asked, though it sounded like it was more to herself than you<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I've got no idea...\" You scratched your head<br>\r\n\"Should we go to a hospital?\" You suggested<br>\r\n\"Honey, I sincerely doubt anyone in a hospital has any way of helping you... and if we make this public, I think the government or something would probably take you away to do experiments on you like some lab rat...\" Sheila replied and you nodded in agreement with a sigh<br>\r\n\"Yeah, probably not a good idea...\" You then looked away awkwardly, wondering what you were going to do next, though you guessed Sheila would just straight take you back home and give you to your mom, however, that did not happen, and instead you saw her slowly form a smile on her face<br>\r\n\"You know, we can still have some <i>fun</i>...\" She whispered and you shuddered<br>\r\n\"W-What do you mean?\" You asked a bit nervously. She smiled and winked at you again.<br>\r\n\"Well, if I recall correctly, you used to love going to bouncy castles and the like...\" She said in a oddly provocative way, but what she said in itself sounded innocent enough, which threw you off...<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, yes... back when I was a kid...\" You said, unsure about what she could possibly mean...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given your size, you could say my entire body is just one giant bouncy house to you...\" She giggled and slowly lowered you down to her chest level, and she lightly shook it, making her mountain-sized mammaries jiggle unlike anything else you had seen before. Indeed, they looked rather bouncy, and the sight made you blush intensely. She then lowered you a bit farther down and pressed you into her tummy, where you sank noticeably into her squishy, pudgy flesh<br>\r\n\"I bet you could bounce real good on my belly\" She laughed and gently rubbed you on it while pressing you even deeper into her flesh. You, however, felt like your skeleton would've jumped out of your body if you hadn't been pinned in place as you suddenly heard a massive growl that came from within Sheila's stomach. It sounded like a caged, angry beast<br>\r\n\"Oof...\" You heard her say and stopped pressing you into her tummy<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" You asked<br>\r\n\"Uh, not much. It's just that silly Auntie Sheila really pigged out last night on your mom's burritos...\" She replied and used her free hand to clutch her stomach as it growled and groaned rather loudly.<br>\r\n\"Maybe bouncing on my belly is not the best idea at the moment\" She chuckled and slowly brought you back to her face level. She smiled again at you, but it was a smile more akin to Lillian's when she's about to mess with you, you gulp...<br>\r\n\"I've got something else much better in mind... but I want you to be sincere...\" She said, surprisingly sternly. It was a bit strange that despite her size, Sheila hardly ever commanded true 'mom energy', but for that brief moment, she definitely did.<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" You asked with a slight stutter<br>\r\n\"Do you like my big booty?\" She asked so bluntly it made you do a triple take on what she just said.<br>\r\n\"W-W-W-What?!\"<br>\r\n\"You heard me...\" She said with a playful smile. You gulped hard. You had no idea what the right call was in this situation. You didn't even know if there was a right call at all. On the one hand, if you say 'No', there's the possibility that she either doesn't believe you, or, if she does, she feels insulted, as you knew it was the part of her body she prized the most, and you definitely didn't want to incur in the wrath of someone many thousands of times, if not millions, larger than you. On the other hand, God knows what'll happen if you answer 'Yes'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila chuckled as she saw the tiny boy in her grip wrack his brain for a proper answer, she found his reactions cute and waited patiently. After a few minutes, you still weren't sure what to answer, but decided to go with the least risky one...<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" You said shyly and looked away, expecting something horrible to happen, but all you felt was the booming from Sheila's laughter.<br>\r\n\"There, there... Was it so hard?\" She soothed you, lightly rubbing your head with one of her fingertips, with incredible dexterity and care.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\" You said, still looking away.<br>\r\n\"Don't apologize, hon. All I wanted was to have you acknowledge your desire...\" she said in a flirty way.<br>\r\n\"...So that we can act upon it...\" she whispered and your whole body shuddered. She then lowered you and brought you around her waist, soon you faced the most breath-taking view ever, her absolutely and monstrously gigantic ass. Two jiggling meaty globes so vast you could wander aimlessly around just one of them and get lost, and that was without mentioning the colossal chasm in between them, it looked from your perspective like entire cities could get lost there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila shook her hips and that made both of her immense asscheeks wobble near uncontrollably, and you couldn't help but stare in shock and disbelief at tsunami sized waves of fatty flesh ripple across the massive globes. She smiled and let you stare until the jiggling gradually died down, although it took several minutes. She then lowered you a bit farther down, where you could see her panties-turned-thong.<br>\r\n\"Look! You're about as tiny as the stars on the flag!\" She pointed out, giggling, and brought you close to the middle of said panties, where you could see some of Brazil's flag, what hadn't been devoured by her gigantic crack. Indeed, the small stars on the flag's blue orb's underside were slightly bigger than you. It was awe-inspiring, but it also made you feel nervous, then you heard a low, distant rumbling that seemingly came from deep within, which made you shudder<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I saw...\" You reply awkwardly, unsure where this is going to go next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Paths. Note: On all three routes she's gonna be gassy as hell]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So, I've got these BIG trampolines, and you happen to be the right size to have fun on them...\" She said with a slight laugh and wiggled her hips some more <br>\r\n\"I want to feel you on them...\" She added with a more dangerous sounding whisper<br>\r\n\"If you could give me a massage, believe me, I'd really make it worth your while...\" She finished, almost purring, before she gently deposited you on one of her titanic cheeks. Despite your minuscule weight, your legs sank up to your ankles into the doughy 'ground', and its warmth sent electric shocks up your spine. Still, that rumbling from earlier made you feel nervous, and you couldn't help but have a very bad feeling about this</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You're going to love this, hold on...\" She said as she walked to her bedroom, and she grabbed what looked like a thin metallic pole from her closet.<br>\r\n\"I've been practicing some more new dancing moves, and I want to give you a first class seat to them\" She said as she carefully cut a tiny piece of tape and proceeded to tape you to the pole, which was about as thick as a broom stick, though it was still massive to you. You then felt sheer terror when she turned around and revealed that she put you exactly at her huge butt's level. You had seen before that her signature thing appeared to be backing up into the pole, which was so small it would just get mercilessly engulfed between her humongous cheeks. In addition to that, you heard the rumbling again, and it definitely came from her colossal derriere</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, since you confessed a desire of yours, I'll do the same...\" Sheila said with a strange hint of seriousness. You gulped hard but nodded<br>\r\n\"I want to fart on you...\" She said, and you almost choked on nothing out of shock. Your eyes widened and your blood ran cold<br>\r\n\"W-What?!\"<br>\r\n\"I've always been sort of intrigued... Lillian gets away with it a lot... and even your mom does it sometimes... how come only I am left out?\" She frowned. You were beyond baffled at that kind of statement and it was as if your brain downright crashed like a computer with a blue screen of death. She then brought you closer to her enormous crack.<br>\r\n\"Granted, I'm a tiny bit gassier than usual, but it's not like we get a chance like this every day...\" <br>\r\n\"B-B-B-But...\" You stuttered desperately.<br>\r\n\"Exactly, hon! It's a win-win for both of us...\" she said as she seductively wiggled her hips some more.<br>\r\n\"You'll get the most VIP view ever of the biggest booty in Brazil...\" She rubbed her butt with her free hand.<br>\r\n\"For the small price of having to endure a couple of toots of mine...\" She couldn't help but giggle at that<br>\r\n\"A-Auntie Sheila, I'm too small!\" You shouted, but her smile did not disappear<br>\r\n\"That makes it even more perfect...\" She replied<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n\"Your size is perfect for this! Nobody will ever suspect that there's a boy deep within this big, gassy booty of mine\" She laughed. You were even more worried now, it sounded like she wanted to keep you there for a long time.<br>\r\n\"Not even Lillian would ever figure out I've got someone stashed back there. It's safer than a bank vault!\" She laughed some more and playfully spanked herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began to pull her panties back and before you knew it, she dropped you into their back and sent you falling down for what felt like miles as she let them snap back to place and that pushed you deep into her unfathomably large asscrack. You felt an insane pressure from both sides, but at the same time you were encased in a warm, squishy material you were very well aware what it was<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" You vaguely heard her say, and the rumbling became much louder</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You couldn't help you were standing on one of Sheila's ludicrously huge cheeks. Maintaining your footing proved to be a bit of a challenge though, as this was different even from when you had to stand on a bouncy house, this was more akin to a waterbed, but not quite the same. You tentatively took a few steps, then everything shook and you fell face-first onto the doughy surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That tickled, sweetie!\" Sheila laughed for a moment, then she slowly wiggled her hips, making her gigantic blubbery masses wobble in a way that'd be hypnotic for most men, but to you if was a combination of an earthquake and a series of tsunamis of fat and flesh.<br>\r\n\"Please keep walking... It feels nice...\" She said with a pleased sigh. Something about her voice made you gulp, but you decide to do as she said regardless. Just seeing how the massive fleshy globe stretched across all directions and into your horizon made you think that maybe even calling it 'planet-sized' was an understatement. You also shuddered at the thought of what would've happened if Sheila had decided to sit on you instead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you kept on walking, you sort of got used to how to keep your balance on the incredibly soft and squishy surface. Your legs felt shaky as the knowledge that this was definitely the biggest ass you'd ever faced in your life only made you blush uncomfortably. Your tiny steps indeed tickled Sheila despite her massive size compared to you, and somehow, it didn't feel quite the same as an ant crawling on her, and she could actually feel your two feet with little focusing on her part. She kept glancing down at her butt, barely making out the tiny speck on one of her jiggling cheeks, but she still found it cute in a way, although, it also seemed to awaken something else in her, and she started thinking of ways to keep you. She looked at you on her huge butt again and thought that maybe that should be enough for a good while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squishy 'ground' beneath your feet twitched lightly with each step you took, and every few ones, everything shook, which meant Sheila was tickled, and that same ground more or less became liquid-like as large waves rippled across it. Even after several minutes walking around her larger-than-planet-sized cheek, you felt like you had only advanced a couple of inches in real scale, but you were able to see to see a hint of its colossal twin in the distance. The ground shook again, but it felt different from when Sheila got tickled, and you heard a deep, distant rumbling from somewhere down below. A series of loud, gurgling groans were also heard, but they came from much higher up. You then heard her sigh in apparent discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several more minutes, and more concerning rumbling and growling, Sheila decided that she'd rather lay than stand up as she had been doing so far.<br>\r\n\"Hey, sweetie, I'm going back to my room... Hold on tight!\" She said cheerfully and gave you a minute before she started walking. Like everything about her, overwhelming fell short of describing her, you actually grabbed two handfuls of her flesh and clung as tightly as you could, but nothing could prepare you for the insanely massive sense of motion as her gigantic cheek swayed from side to side, and in addition to that wobbled and jiggled every time her foot landed on the floor. It didn't take her long to reach the bedroom and she carefully laid on the bed on her stomach, though this too caused it to growl, seemingly angrily as if in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done... I guessed it'd be a bit safer if I laid down instead of standing up\" She explained and gave her hips a seductive wiggle, which was yet another series of quakes and rippling fleshy waves for you to deal with, but you weren't mad at those. And it was oddly arousing, but you felt kinda wrong about it, considering this is your mom's best friend, or the sister she didn't have, and yet, if was her who initiated this whole thing and sorta forced you to say that you liked her physique. You pondered on what else she could be possibly up to, but her personality was too unpredictable to tell for sure, so far, this was rather innocent, compared to other instances of her teasing you've experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to walk on the vast, jiggly 'planet' and soon you reached the massive canyon she called an asscrack. It definitely put the Grand Canyon to shame, and there was no way you'd make it to the other side unless you could somehow get a tiny plane. The low grumbling from the abyss' depths was much louder and it slightly shook the 'ground' under your feet, but Sheila didn't seem to notice, or if she did, she said nothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, how about you try bouncing on my special 'trampolines'?\" She asked with a smile, looking at you from over her shoulder. You looked at the humongous abyss below and gulped, then again, if you just get away from it you should be safe, so you walk a couple hundred meters in your scale before you give your first attempt at bouncing on her squishy flesh, a half-hearted jump, to 'test the waters', so to speak. You're surprised to find that you actually propelled yourself pretty high (again, in your scale) into the air, Sheila's fat cheek being a much power powerful trampoline than any you knew. Your landing was, of course, extra soft, and bounced rather high a few times before you landed for good. Your heart pounded from the adrenaline rush from the experience, and your previous concerns melted away... This was legitimately fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt safe, this reminded you of the many wholesome times you've had with her. Being the only 'aunt' you ever had, she actually spent quite a lot of time with you throughout your childhood and teen years. And despite not being on the same level of athleticism as your mom, she still made an honest effort to play sports with you and Lillian whenever she could. The funny thing was that, even with her dancer training, and sporting impressive strength, she had rather low stamina and tired out quickly, but she'd always spin it around to make it look like it was you kids who were tired, and she was just deciding on taking a break for everyone. This quickly became an open secret of sorts, and a recurring gag, if you want to put it that way. Many times you ended up just resting on the grass or under a tree, and your head was usually cushioned by her soft belly or lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You see? There's a nice side to having a <b>big</b> auntie\" She would say many times<br>\r\n\"If I were pencil thin there'd be nothing soft for you to rest on\" She also would add, either pressing you a little into her belly or giving you a hug and bringing you closer to her chest. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though sometimes it sounded like she may be ashamed of her physique, most of the time she was confident about it, and more often than not joked about it. She in particular liked to pretend not to notice you before she sat down on the couch, right on the part you were sitting on, but she always stopped before she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good thing I noticed you there! You need to be careful though hon\" She'd usually say<br>\r\n\"If I sat down, you'd become flat like a paper\" She often joked , and that made her laugh some more<br>\r\n\"Or maybe you'd get lost under there...\" </i><br>\r\nShe sometimes added, but it was all in good fun, and sometimes she'd reverse the joke by having you sit on her own lap, citing it as a much safer alternative. She always made you feel a little flustered, and thinking back on it, you wonder if she had anything to do with how your taste in women developed. Many would think anything resembling their mom would be an instant turn off, and while she was playful, 'Auntie Sheila' metaphorically (and literally, many times probably) took the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh... That felt even better than your tiny footsteps... Do that again...\" She said, snapping you out of your fond reminiscing, her voice unable to hide the pleasure she felt. Despite her massive size, her soft body, and specially her prized curves were fairly more sensitive than one would expect, and the extremely gentle touch of your near weightless body was sending mad shivers up and down her back. Feeling emboldened, you began to jump and giving them your all. In a way, it was like walking on the moon, but better, and with higher jumps you found you could more or less fly temporarily, and no matter where you landed you knew it was always soft. You could also hear Sheila sigh in pleasure and even purr somehow, but you didn't focus much on that, this was indeed really fun. To you, it was like you could jump hundreds of meters high, and even more in any direction. Tiny ripples wobbled their way across her blubbery globe as you kept jumping on it and bouncing. Strangely to you, her claim about her butt being amazing trampolines was indeed true, at least for someone of your current stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thrill from this new experience, however, soon made you more and more confident, until perhaps you became <b><i>too</i></b> confident, but that's alright, isn't it? There's no way this can go wrong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Author's note: I didn't mean to mislead about the massaging part, but decided to include it in one of the next chapters]</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The last jump you made was much higher than the rest, and when you landed, you bounced once again, but you weren't able to control the direction, and much to your dismay, you saw that you had just jumped over the 'edge' of Sheila's titanic asscrack. Being so light, you prayed you'd be able to make it to the other side and let this be a close call to sober up, but as gravity took its hold on you and you started going down, you realized that just wasn't going to be. Being the silent type in panic situations came to bite you when you would've needed it the most, as you remained quiet as opposed to screaming on your way down, which she may have heard. You more or less spaced-out as you fell for what felt like miles into the dark crevice, though you were at least thankful that her panties would be somewhere down there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila's crack was so vast it was only after more than halfway down it that you grazed one of its sides, and the colossal wall twitched in response as you slid down against it. She shuddered as she felt the lightest caress go down her enormous buttcrack, and that sent more, and more powerful shivers up and down her spine, and brought a pleasant tingly feeling all over her body. She also blushed a little, knowing what it meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh... Naughty...\" She said in an overly playful tone, and as she teasingly wiggled her hips, she failed to notice her cheeks lightly clenched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still in a daze, when suddenly everything shook and forced you out of it. You were in pitch black darkness, everything around you wobbled like gelatin, and you felt two enormous waterbed-like walls press on you from each side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think you'd be willing to go there...\" She then said<br>\r\n\"Not that I mind...\" She giggled almost like a highschool girl that just got a confession from her crush. But after a few seconds, it looked like her adult self stepped back in and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n\"Still... I don't really think my booty smells too good right now, does it?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as a matter of fact, she was right, too right, you could even say. Her crack reeked badly, and after what you heard about burritos, you guessed she had been already farting for a while. Still, as you were encased in her blubbery mass, you couldn't even move your arms to cover your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen... I get it that you like my big booty, even more than I first thought... but right now's not a good moment to go spelunking down there...\" She said, and as if on cue her stomach groaned and gurgled, and she also felt an intense pressure near her gargantuan ass.<br>\r\n\"So... since I can't hear you all the way over there, just move. Do something I can feel and I'll take it that you want out of there...\" She said, completely oblivious to the fact that you were pinned in place by her sheer weight. You were actually trying to move with all your might, but the weight on you from all sides was simply too much. She patiently waited, but after roughly a minute, there was no answer. She blushed a little harder.<br>\r\n\"Do... do you really not mind the smell back there?\" She asked with a hint of hesitation. Another minute passed and there was no answer, and she could clearly feel him stay still between her massive cheeks.<br>\r\n'Maybe he even likes it... Well then, who am I to cut his fun short, right?' She thought to herself with a quiet giggle<br>\r\n'And to choose now of all times to go there... I did tell him about the burritos... And he perfectly knows what they do to me... Maybe he wants me to let loose on him, huh...' She kept thinking, and that thought turned her on in a way she hadn't felt before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, before going down a potentially dangerous route, she decided to truly make sure he was up for what was coming next.<br>\r\n\"Okay, last chance... Please move or do anything I'll feel if you want me to take you out of there...\" She said, back in her more serious tone<br>\r\n\"Or... don't move if you want to stay in there...\" She added with a giggle. She decided to even give him more time to answer, but after 5 minutes, she felt nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were trying your hardest to move and scream, but as soon as you opened your mouth you got more than a mouthful of her plentiful rear, and no sound would make it out of your mouth. Your limbs were simply encased by such weight that you weren't able to move them even an inch. The jiggly masses that engulfed you shuddered once more. Sheila's eyes widened<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'D...Did he just kiss my booty?' she gasped, as she felt a very tiny touch, but unlike the others, there was a hint of wetness to it, and she even made out his small tongue after focusing for a moment. This was unexpected. You always reacted indifferently or negatively whenever Lillian broke wind around you, and while you were more restrained in your reactions towards your own mom, that was for fairly obvious reasons, but she didn't think you'd willingly subject yourself to that, and even more so given your current size. She then wondered if perhaps it was because it was <b><i>her</i></b> butt this time he was dealing with, and felt slightly flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Blaise... You truly are a brave man...\" She said with sincere amazement, and even a hint of respect to your newly perceived manliness in her books. The fact that she called you a man was already odd in itself, which meant she didn't see you as a kid anymore, much to your misfortune.<br>\r\n\"I did tell you that I pigged out on burritos last night though... I thought that would've been enough of a hint...\" She then said<br>\r\n\"So, just to set things straight I'm letting you know what you just signed up for...\" She said in an unintentionally ominous way that sent cold shivers down your spine.<br>\r\n\"...You can probably guess that I'm feeling... gassy...\" She said just as her stomach's groans intensified, and you could hear a stronger rumbling coming from deeper into her massive asscrack. The jiggly walls encasing you vibrated from the rumbling's own sheer intensity and that made you go pale. Then you felt your entire world shift from side to side, which meant she was likely wiggling her hips again.<br>\r\n\"Are you really sure you want to stay in there? I know I asked before, but I still feel like you don't really understand what you're in for...\" She said, and you struggled harder than ever to move or scream, but what little movement you managed to get done with your mouth caused everything to twitch and wobble again. You heard her laugh.<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright... I get it...\" She said with a slightly embarrassed laugh.<br>\r\n'Gosh, he really wants to have it...' She thought, mistaking your previous effort as more kisses to her enormous booty. Her stomach, which had been feeling in knots, and also like literal tornadoes were swirling inside, kept on groaning, but it a much more violent-sounding way, and she knew she wasn't going to be able to hold anything in for much longer. <br>\r\n\"Okay... then, I think you should brace yourself hon...\" she raised her butt into the air a little and wiggled it in a way that she meant as a warning about the impending storm.<br>\r\n\"At least... they shouldn't be much worse than what Lillian's unleashed upon you, right?\" She said, but you weren't quite sure if that was to you or rather to herself. You were also absolutely baffled about her lack of self-awareness, even you knew that the difference between her and Lillian's gas was huge! And that's not to mention she's ignoring your current size. But worrying about those things now was pointless anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Paths]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Your heart pounds desperately, seemingly wanting out of your body as you lie helplessly while the deep gurgling groans from the depths of Sheila's crack get louder and louder.

When she heard about you from Yamile, she was a bit disappointed that you weren't a rich, white boy, but other than that, you really don't want what she thinks of her as you never met her. While she enjoys her homeland its culture, she's quite englamoured with the food on this side of the world, despite how badly her stomach reacts to it and her own brand of curry. 39 years old. 57-34-69<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Chahna</b>, the eldest child of 22. An all-round man-eater and slut. She loves hanging out with men and fulfilling her lust, that it scares a majority of the male population. Even the men she slept with are reluctant to do it again because of her endless stamina in the sack and Yamile vowed to defend your chastity from her as a joke (you think as she unconsciously stared at your crotch in lust, maybe). Thankfully, she goes to an all-girls college far from here; the same one your adopted sister goes to. Her hair is wild and flows until her mid-back as her green eyes sparkle in the light. She usually dresses in a sexy manner to show off her assets that nearly matches her mother's. She's not afraid of other people's kinks, no matter how gross it is and her homeland cuisine has been to upset her bowels. Her lust can her make misunderstand the other party. 56-30-65<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Dulari</b>, 20 years old. With her hair in a pony tail and black glasses on her petite nose, she greatly inherited her mother's sternness when it comes to studying and tries to impose it on others. She is annoyed by her older sister with her antics and scolds her on it, though Chahna ignores her usually. Thinks of you as a bit of a troublemaker, but is quite doubtful of the claim as she didn't meet you yet. Just like the rest of her family, she tends to pass gas from the large amount of curry she eats, but is nice enough to blast it elsewhere. However, when angry with someone, she would use her farts to torture them. She also goes to the same college as her sister as a freshman. 50-27-55<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Falguni</b>, 17 years old. A cheerleader in your rival school and a selfish woman. Completely and utterly in vain, she only cares about her beauty and has earned the scorn of almost all the women around her, family included. With brown eyes and her black hair in pigtails, many people can admire her beauty. However, her backside has been known to erupt loudly, even on an empty stomach, and Falguni is quite embarrassed by it, so she goes to a private place, ensuring nobody knows about it (though her family loves to tease her about it). Best not to be found by her, especially when she's gassy. 55-27-44<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Fulki</b>, 16 years old and twin of Yamile. A super energetic girl that looks the same as Yamile, though her blue eyes contrast with Yamile's greens and her hair is cut short of her shoulders. A tomboy through and through, she has no problem letting them rip and is an utter idiot. However, she is quite kind, and seems to like you from Yamile's description of you. 47-28-58<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Gazala</b>, 15 years old. A super shy girl and the youngest of the daughters, Gazala gets easily stressed out and it doesn't help when she farts in times of stress. Her bangs cover her eyes as they're shielded by her glasses. She's extremely shy of anyone that isn't family and would hide from them. 60-29-57<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's still Celeste's house to go to, though.</span></div></div>",

Everything seemed to spin around you, but you continued walking to the locker room. Then everything began to grow, you ran to the locker room in a panic. You grabbed onto the edge of a bench before it went out of reach and pulled yourself up. You looked around and realized you had ran into the girls locker room by mistake. You continued to shrink until you were a minuscule 1/10 of an inch tall. Then the girls started to come in, and at your size every one of them was absolutely enormous. Lillian and Jen were among them of course but there were also the other girls in your PE class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Veronica</b>: 18 years old, currently in her senior year of high school. Standing at a decent 174 cm/ 5'8\" tall with long straight red hair that went just past her shoulders and bright green eyes. She had a body that rivaled Celeste's with most of her weight being found around her butt except she was more physically active, giving her butt a mix of fat and muscle that made it look near perfect. She was known as the gassiest girl in school, and for good reason, she let loose farts that shook rooms or were easily mistaken for a sewage leak on a daily basis. She actually asked you out, thinking that you had a fetish after seeing Lillian fart in your face several times, but after you explained that you weren't really into farts she left in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Measurements</b>: 29 - 25 - 40<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Monique</b>: 17 years old and currently in her junior year, Monique stood at 168 cm/ 5'6\" tall with short burnett hair that almost reached her neck and deep brown eyes. She had a butt almost as large as Jen's, but she hated it. Monique would run, diet or workout on a daily basis but it never seemed to get rid of even an inch of her booty fat, however she had terrible case of swamp ass. Whenever she got hot or physically active she started sweating a ton, and a large wet line would appear on her clothes down her ass crack. Her swamp ass and her daily exercise meant there was almost always a sweat stain on her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Measurements</b>: 32 - 28 - 55<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Emily</b>: 18 years old and in her senior year, Emily stood at 185 cm / 6'1\" with long wavy blond hair and light blue eyes. She had a body similar to Jen's save her noticeably smaller tits. She was known for being supposedly extremely sadistic towards men. There were rumors of her seducing boys just to get them alone and torcher them with her ass, most boys didn't want to admit they were overpowered by a girl but if they did it always came down to one word against the other. You heard her favorite thing to do was to smother them with her ass and when they were desperate and panicking for air, she would lift up her butt just enough to let them breath and fart on them. Luckily Jen and Lillian's protectiveness of you kept you from finding out if these rumors were true, though she looked innocent enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Measurements</b> 36 - 26 - 53<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were looking up in disbelief at the impossibly large women as they filled the room. You began screaming and waving your arms to try and get their attention, although at 1/10th of an inch it was doubtful they would even hear you. Then they started to undress, you stared in awe as Jen took off her clothes. You've had a crush on Jen for awhile and seeing her undress, even though she beyond enormous, mesmerized you. A pair of gym shorts landed right next to you, barely missing you and snapping you out of your trance.

Meanwhile, Veronica was changing when she caught sight of Jen's breasts and stared at her own. Despite having a big booty, her breasts were opposite, envy growing stronger in her.<br>\r\n\"Not fair,\" Veronica muttered under her breath.<br>\r\n\"Well, be thankful you got an ass like that hanging off you!\" A voice said, startling her and Veronica farts quietly, some of the girls moving away from her.<br>\r\nThe newcomer slams her ass near her and inspects her as Veronica also takes her time to examine her new friend. A Hispanic woman that's slightly taller over than her, she chubby, but thick in the right places, especially her big bum.<br>\r\n\"Must be an underclassmen, as I don't recognize her from any of my grade.

I <i><u>really</u></i> wished he does so,\" the other said, venom seeping into her words before drowning it completely.<br>\r\n\"Lillian!\" Veronica almost shouted, quick to lower voice, in shock as she stared at your best friend and was able to immediately remember her right away.<br>\r\n\"Heard you tried to ask him out before, so what's the deal?\" Lillian asked, staring long and hard at Veronica.<br>\r\n\"Oh?! That... that was... a mistake,\" Veronica said, her voice dying as her face turns red.<br>\r\nConfusion draws on Lillian's face as she looks at her senior in worry.<br>\r\n\"Hey, you alright? Blaise didn't do anything weird?\" Lillian asks and Veronica shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"I thought he had... Because of you...

That's something I like doing to him when we were growing up and he would always gag on my farts!\" Lillian laughed, Veronica trying to shush her, thankfully, most of the girls are gone at this point.<br>\r\nLillian was able to eventually calm down and brush a tear away from her eye before a very embarrassed Veronica.<br>\r\n\"I thought you were some skank like Emily or Celeste, but you're a pretty good person. I'll tell you what: you hang out with me, Jen, and Blaise, and we'll figure each other out. If you're still interested in him, then, maybe, you can ask him. He's a pretty good guy once you get to know him.\"<br>\r\n\"I know, seeing how he explained the situation to me,\" Veronica said, smiling a bit as Lillian pats her back.</span></div></div>",

Without warning she released a massive fart right on top of you. It smelled terrible and the force flung you a few inches across the bench. You were overjoyed to be flung free from Veronica's stinky booty, then you looked up in dread as Lillian straddled the bench to make her butt face directly towards Veronica's. Lillian's butt was huge at normal size, but now it eclipsed your vision entirely.<br>\r\n\"Well than I guess I'm part of the minority,\" Lillian said as she let loose an equally terrible ass blast.

She let loose a powerful fart, it didn't smell as bad as Veronica's but it was powerful enough to violently slam you up into Veronica's lace panties. Your legs got caught in the smallest hole of the lacing and as Lillian's fart died you were left stuck in Veronica's stinky panties.<br>\r\n\"Would he really be willing to judge these?\" Veronica asked as she released a humongous fart that shook the bench.

My lactose intolerance can turn my butt into a lethal weapon.\" Veronica said as she got up and began to pull up her gym shorts. You watched as the blue polyester prison came closer and closer. You struggled to break free from the silk panties, but it was no use. Her shorts were halfway up her thighs when she let loose her most massive and stinkiest fart yet.

Celeste sighed and nodded before giving you a small smile. You see that she brought lunch, no doubt one more of her dieting attempts that is doomed to fail.<br>\r\n\"Speaking of feeling better... maybe you could take a break from that whole dieting business and eat food that actually tastes good and makes you feel good, huh?\" You suggested and she chuckled.<br>\r\n\"Drop the diet, you say?\" She took a step towards you, her body was closer to yours, enough for you to feel a hint of her body warmth despite being a couple of inches away.<br>\r\n\"Why does it sound like you want me to get bigger?\" She said more quietly, almost whispering as her hand reached for your chest and gently caressed it<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right... You like 'em big, don't you?\" She added with a more mischievous smirk<br>\r\n\"HUH?! What's THAT supposed to mean?\" You ask, raising your right eyebrow higher<br>\r\n\"You know... Jen...

You averted her look.<br>\r\n\"Thought so\" Celeste said and her grin widened, the way she made it sound was as if she were satisfied by that answer.<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I've got no lunch money today... so, no choice but to eat this, but... if it makes you happy, I'll drop the diet starting tomorrow...\" She said as she hugged you.<br>\r\n\"But you better take responsibility for whatever happens next...\" She winked at you before letting go. You sighed, and wondered for the umpteenth time why you even bothered with her at all. She then grabbed her stuff for Science class and closed her locker...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Paths]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Shall we head to class then?\" She asks and you nod, not like you have much of a choice.

You glance at Celeste and think that if she hadn't made your relationship awkward and strained, it'd be fairly nice to have a family member his age study alongside him, but instead she was more of a nuisance he was too kind to truly deal with, and in addition to that, you genuinely wanted to help her over her self-image issues, that wouldn't be healthy down the road, but in the end, there wasn't all that much you could do. Your current concern was to make sure she didn't make Science class worse for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, you arrive. You got there fairly early, so, it was only a bit later that other students arrived, among which were Lillian and Jen, much to your relief. Soon after, the teacher arrived, looking tired and sleep-deprived.<br>\r\n\"Okay, everyone... choose a partner because we're going to do some experiments, and we'll have a small quiz after!\" She said and yawned. She definitely looked like she needed her coffee. Then her phone rang, and she groaned in irritation.<br>\r\n\"Alright, you've got a few minutes to decide... I have to take this call, when I come back, we're going to start working\" She said as she walked out of the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe formerly quiet room quickly got filled with the sounds of everyone talking, and of course, people were quick to form their working duos, everyone stood up and people started going to their work stations <i>[I actually forgot what these things are called in English, but I mean the tables with stools and the lab equipment]</i>. Never the very proactive type, you stood up and glanced at Jen, then at Lillian and wondered if they had thought of you or had already thought of someone else. You were also a bit worried Celeste might try to drag you along with her, but you lost sight of her. Suddenly, a feminine arm wraps around yours and pulls you...</span></div></div>",

Don't be like that... Just give me a chance...\" She said, pulling you closer.<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem?\" You heard Lillian's voice behind you, and the large shadow that covered yours on the floor pretty much confirmed it. You turned to look at her.<br>\r\n\"H-Hey\" You greeted, a bit weakly, as dealing with Celeste made you feel drained rather fast.<br>\r\n\"Hey there...\" You then heard Jen, standing next to Lillian with her arms crossed, and both girls were staring daggers at Celeste. You chuckled quietly, as you imagined this was rather unusual, and in most other circumstances, it was usually a girl's male friends who'd defend her from people hitting on her. Not like you were exactly physically helpless, but your size and might were all for naught against a girl after all, in a way, you were powerless, and you appreciated that these two cared enough about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... We're just going to work together for today's class...\" Celeste replied flatly<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a rather one-sided decision to me...\" Jen said. The fire in her eyes made your heart beat harder, but you wondered if she merely protected you because of your friendship, or if perhaps there was more to it.<br>\r\n\"Blaise, did you agree to work with her?\" Lillian asked with a half smile, knowing she had just opened the door for you to get away from her clutches. You took a shallow breath and briefly glanced at Celeste, who was split between feeling dejected, but also angry at the other two girls.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Celeste, but you didn't even ask... so, no, I didn't agree to anything...\" You replied, but then the teacher walked in and snapped her fingers<br>\r\n\"Alright guys, everyone get ready to work! I'll begin explaining the experiment...\" She said. The four of you were caught like deers in headlights and before anyone could say anything, the teacher spoke again...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both Lillian and Jen wanted to argue, but they saw in the teacher's face that she was in no mood for that, and with a sigh, decided to drop it. Celeste gave them a smug smile as she walked with you to her work station. You sighed, this was going to be a long class...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher began by giving the list of chemical substances you'd be using for the experiment, and you began taking note. It took a while, as this experiment was fairly complex and involved many different chemicals plus several pieces of equipment. Just as you finished writing down everything, you turned to Celeste to start gathering the stuff, when you noticed that she had her notebook open and was looking at a list of her own, and she had grabbed the substances and equipment for it rather than what the teacher was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celeste, what the hell?!\" You whispered angrily, but she smiled again and playfully shushed you.<br>\r\n\"No, seriously, what do you think you're doing...?\" You asked with concern<br>\r\n\"I found this special chemical recipe on the deep web the other day... it's a weight loss compound that's much better than anything on the market, but they don't sell it because it's not approved by the FDA and whatnot...\" She explained<br>\r\n\"If the teacher finds out we're gonna get hanged\" Your eyes narrowed<br>\r\n\"She won't if nobody says anything...\" She replied and shot you a pleading look. You were really annoyed by her obsessive tendencies, and the fact that she was willing to risk many things just for that. You glanced at her notebook again. The ingredients listed and the instructions given were all very precise, and it didn't seem like someone's random shopping list.<br>\r\n'At least she seems to have gotten actual instructions and not just a bullshit tutorial...' You thought and decided to let her be, though you'd take no part in this, and definitely weren't going to take the fall should she get caught.<br>\r\n\"Thanks a million!\" She said and gave you a quick kiss on the cheek, to which you groaned in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeleste then began carefully mixing the chemicals, in the exact amounts as were written in her notebook. You still weren't sure if it was a good idea to let her make whatever that was and presumably drink it, but then again, she was 17 friggin years old, she could make her own decisions and face the consequences, and you didn't feel like trying to dissuade her any further. You just hoped she didn't get caught for the sake of not having to deal with anything extra today. You glanced around, everyone was focused on their work and sigh in relief. Minutes felt like hours to you, and you had become more anxious about getting caught than the culprit herself, ironically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that thing going to be done soon?\" You asked<br>\r\n\"Almost... I just need to add a few drops of this and stir it for a bit...\" She said, and suddenly you heard her stomach grumble. You guessed she probably skipped breakfast, but instead she looked a bit sickened and looked away in embarrassment.<br>\r\n\"I... uh... need to go to the bathroom real quick, please just keep stirring this. It should take about 5 minutes and the liquid will change color when it's done...\" She said and stood up before you could even protest. She walked to the teacher and asked for permission to go to the bathroom, leaving you with whatever she was making. You sigh and go over to her seat and keep stirring the liquid. Many of its components started off colorless, but right now, the liquid had a deep blue color, and it sizzled like a soda. You felt that it gave off a bit of warmth, and in a way it looked like it was in the first stages of boiling as you kept on stirring it with the glass rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then had to do a double take, as it looked like the mysterious liquid somehow got electrically charged. You'd swear you saw a small electric arc within the liquid itself. You gulped and wondered if Celeste really intended to drink this concoction. Just as he kept stirring, he noticed the liquid's blue hue kept on lightening, and as the 5 required minutes approached, he felt a faint electrical field, the hairs on his arms stood on end, and he felt the vague tingly feeling like that of touching an old analog tv right after it had been turned off. He then felt as if the liquid pulsed with an unknown invisible energy, eerily resembling a human heartbeat. Finally, the liquid suddenly changed to a turquoise color and you felt a stronger pulse that went from your arms and all over your body. You never expected a chemical mixture could give this kind of reaction, you knew some stuff can explode or catch fire when mixed wrong, but you never heard of them generating anything resembling an electrical charge. You don't get to ponder on it for long, though, as you quickly feel drained of your vitality. Your eyes feel suddenly much heavier and your hearing becomes distorted. Once again you feel the heartbeat-like pulse, but now, it came from within you, and it lulled you to sleep. You felt so tired you weren't able to resist it for long, and soon your eyes closed and you blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater... You suddenly woke up and wonder if that chemical thing did anything to you. As you sat up and let your eyes recover their focus, you quickly realize you're somewhere else. You're sitting on the same black leathery material from the lab chairs, but instead of said small stool, this surface is a vast expanse that stretches into the horizon in all directions. You look farther ahead and after a few minutes you realize that you're indeed in the lab, and considering what happened, it wasn't very likely everything suddenly grew, which meant that it was you who shrank, and tremendously at that. You then felt the ground shake, and fell on your face, caught off guard, but with some struggling, you stand up and keep your footing while the ground keeps shaking. A giant shadow covers you and your surrounding area and you turn around to find out why...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Author's note: The difference between Lillian's and Jen's path here is that the latter has clearly found you, but the former hasn't yet...]</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Much to your shock and horror, Celeste had come back from the bathroom and was just about to sit on her stool, which is the one you were on, and there was no way she'd know that. From your location, it looked mind-numbingly huge, and as you glanced down at the fairly reflective black surface of the chair, you just saw how puny you were in comparison. If the stool's seat cushion was country sized to you, Celeste's tremendous behind might as well have been the moon falling upon you. It easily took up your entire view of the 'sky'. The dark blue of her short shorts looked strained, as if about to burst, which meant that Celeste either completely ignored or refused to acknowledge her backside's true dimensions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God...dammit...\" You said in exasperation as the gigantic dark blue globes descend upon you. There was no time to run, or even to seek any kind of cover, and the realization that this was the end of the road for you didn't send you into the flying panic you would've thought, and instead took it rather cynically, wondering if there was even a God up there, whose sense of humor was so beyond human understanding that such an end to your life somehow made sense... But instead of losing yourself to the endless void, you just found yourself in near pitch black darkness. You also felt a noticeable warmth all around you, though it came from above, and lastly, a fairly unpleasant smell hit you. Knowing what you were under made obvious what the smell likely was, though that didn't make things better for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It must've been incredibly lucky that she didn't squash me with those moon-sized cheeks' You thought, realizing you appeared to be under her crack, which also meant those short shorts weren't just too tight, but were likely a few sizes too small. At least that saved you, or so you think. You start walking around trying to find any hint of an exit, as you know that with the most minimal shifting she'd probably flatten you under her unfathomable mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeleste was a bit surprised to see you gone, and the first thing she thought was that you ditched her experiment for whatever reason, but then she looked at the beaker on the desk.<br>\r\n'Oh... Well... at least he did the last step for me...' She thought.<br>\r\n'But why did he leave?' She also wondered. But then she shrugged and went to sit down, on her own stool chair of course. She quickly poured her creation into a jar she got from her backpack and stashed it away in it, then she quickly began doing the actual class experiment before the teacher took notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she worked on the class experiment, her stomach growled and grumbled again. That special salad and vegetable juice mix she had for breakfast was not sitting well with her at all, and she had had to excuse herself to go to the bathroom and unleash her pent up gas, but frustratingly enough, it quickly built back up in her gut. The Science teacher was rather strict and she wouldn't let her go to the bathroom a second time. She looked around. The mostly silent room would be no good, if she let loose here she'd definitely be heard. Just then, the teacher called to end the experiment, and before the quiz, she wrote a couple of questions about the experiment meant to be discussed by the working duos. She smiled, this was like a blessing from Heaven. Now with the cover of the sound of everyone talking, she eased along the bubbly pressure that hurt her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped in your tracks as you heard deep gurgling and groaning, it sounded distant, but it definitely came from above. Coupled with the lingering smell that enveloped you, you gulped, knowing that'd be no good. Suddenly, a deafening roar like that of a volcanic eruption makes your ears ring, and a powerful wind knocks you down on your stomach and pins you for a moment. The temperature raises around you, and a much worse smell appears. You couldn't believe that you had to be at basically the prime spot precisely when she had to fart.<br>\r\n'I knew those crappy diets she always did were bad, but I had no idea just how bad they really were...' You thought as you covered your nose and mouth, but it was too late, any and all breathable air around you had been replaced by Celeste's gassy burst. The previously stale air and remnants of her previous farts were like Heaven in comparison. Still, you coughed, but when you tried to get up, you heard a much louder rumbling...</span></div></div>",

The fart she's holding in is way massive, and she's not sure about letting it out even with the current noise. She was also unsure on how long she had before you came back, completely unaware of your current situation. A few small toots escaped from her large ass as she tried her hardest at holding it in. To you, those \"small\" toots were like volcanic eruptions, with sulfur and all. With no way out, you were forced to breathe the rotten scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of minutes later, she couldn't hold it in anymore, and since her stomach hurt too much to care, she just leaned forward and unleashed a massive monster of a fart that made her large cheeks wobble uncontrollably, and by had to be a miracle, wasn't heard or noticed by anyone else around. For you, a nuke had indeed just been detonated upon you. A warm hurricane wind tore you off the ground and as the colossal gelatinous massed that pinned you down slowly raised, you got sent flying, and the shockwave from the noise hit you as well, leaving you dizzy and disoriented as you flew off into the distance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Note: Both Lillian and Jen are sitting a few rows behind Celeste]</i></span></div></div>",

Your whole body was still shaken from getting sent out flying like a bullet and the methane-heavy smell that clung onto you did nothing to help your dizzy state. While you were trying to regain your bearings, two colossal walls appeared at your sides, and it didn't take you a lot to realize that they had to be someone's thighs, clad in what looked like blue yoga pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous thighs almost took up all available room on the stool, leaving only a tiny sliver of it free, sparing you from getting sandwiched by their unconceivably huge mass. Then, a much more massive earthquake ensued, the thud of what had to be a truly monstrous ass, even compared to Celeste's astronomical-sized one, resonated around you, and it sent you flying up, saving you from being consumed by the pair of massive thighs as they slammed into each other right after. It was still several hundred meters in your scale, but nowhere near as high or as far as Celeste's gigantic fart had sent you, and soon you landed on a jiggling blue surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even get to stand up again as you heard a gasp.<br>\r\n\"Blaise, is that you?!\" A voice that you were already familiar with whispered, though to you it was still intimidatingly booming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, this had turned out to be one of the better possible outcomes, as you turned around and looked up at Lillian. Even though you could only see half of her body from your current location, she already looked mountainous, or even larger, definitely much more so than Celeste, you could feel. Fortunately her chubby belly and moderate bust did not block her view of you. You weren't even sure your voice would be able to make it all the way to her ears, but something inside you compelled you to try nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, it's me!\" You shouted as loud as you could manage, even cupping your hands around your mouth for greater effect. You saw her expression change to one of even more surprise, she had heard you. It looked like she was now contemplating what to do next, but then she suddenly picked you up. Despite her rushed action, she was surprisingly gentle, and her skyscraper-sized fingers only grabbed you with enough pressure to hold you without hurting you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian had just made the discovery of a lifetime as she found her best friend/crush Blaise at near speck size, but it was in one of the worst places and at the worst times as she was in a classroom full of students and with the teacher as well, though everyone was currently talking amongst themselves since they were working on the class task. There was a sudden pause to the noise and fearing that someone else might see what she had right now, or that the teacher somehow noticed that she wasn't doing the class activity, made her hastily pick the tiny Blaise up and in an act of pure impulse, shoved him down the back of her pants, as she had no pockets on her, and her cleavage would've been way too obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe talking soon resumed, and she had no idea why there was that sudden pause. This, however, was a decision she would soon come to regret. While she could be considered to be gassy all the time, she had days where she was even gassier, and today was one of those days. And what was <i>bad gas</i> in her books was far worse than what it'd be to most other people.<br>\r\n'Crap!' she thought as she could already feel gas making its way down her bowels, and it was too much to hold in. A few seconds later, she let out a \"small\" fart that was pretty big to anyone else. It made her huge cheeks jiggle and wobble as the large gust of wind vibrated its way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer farts were basically an undeniable part of everyday school life, and it didn't even stop the students from talking. She had already made a sort of reputation about them for herself, and normally she couldn't care less. Funnily enough, it had also gotten to that point for everybody else. The only reason she felt bad now was because she had just put Blaise right there, and at an incredibly small size. She farted on his lap or his face too many times to count, but this was on a whole league of its own. And despite being already know for her tremendous gas, she didn't want to be seen picking her butt, so she couldn't retrieve him for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happened too fast for you, but even though you felt that, some things still seemed to be in slow motion. You clearly saw her hand lower you as it brought you around her back but you didn't even get the chance to scream. You had thought Celeste's ass was huge, like a moon, but it was less than puny in comparison to Lillian's, each of her humongous cheeks seeming larger than a whole planet to you. Without a chance to even process what was going on, she pulled her pants' waistband back and shoved you inside. You were gently put on one of her titanic cheeks, and after her hand withdrew her yoga pants snapped shut, pinning you to its warm, blubbery flesh. You couldn't deny that it was rather comfy as the extremely soft cheek encased you, molding to your own shape and infusing you with its warmth, however, you knew very well that you were in a highly dangerous location, and you could only wonder why she would put you here in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught in your own thoughts, you failed to realize on time that you were slipping towards her colossal crack, and just as you reached the entrance to it, a gigantic explosion ensued, one that easily put Celeste's monster fart to shame many times over. Its thunderous roar nearly deafened you and rattled your bones as if they were twigs. Oddly enough, while it smelled bad, it wasn't as bad as Celeste's, though Lillian clearly more than made up for that in noise and sheer volume. Then again, at your size, it was probably worse that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian apologized to you in her mind as her stomach kept on rumbling. She leaned to one side in an attempt to let her butt air out for your sake and blushed a little, trying to imagine what you just went through. Unfortunately for you both, that only served to ease along even more gas, which escaped as a longer, louder and overall more powerful fart. Jen, who was sitting next to her and had been taking notes from what was written on the board turned to look at her after that boisterous release, and for the first time, Lillian struggled to keep a straight face, but she managed to and tried to sound and look as nonchalant as she always was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you I've got pretty bad gas today\" She shrugged and Jen went back to taking notes before they'd discuss about the experiment, which was at the bottom of the list of things in Lillian's mind at the moment. Then, another equally big fart burst out from between her massive cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were reeling from Lillian's titanic release, she shifted her weight around and that plunged you deep into her canyon-esque crack, where an atom bomb of a fart blew into you with incredible force, it was like standing before a thousand jet engines, or a gigantic hurricane. The rumbling roar that accompanied her gassy release shook you to the core, and more than hearing it, you felt it in all of your bones as a series of huge shockwaves. You knew and understood that Lillian was always gassy, but you didn't understand why she'd put you in her butt knowing that. Her two farts alone made you a lot dizzier than Celeste's many ones managed to, and then you were hit with a third blast that made you question yourself on whether or not it had been a better to be found by Lillian rather than staying under Celeste.

You could feel each individual thread of her short shorts, in fact with how small you were it would be easy to use the threads as a ladder. You heard the rumbling again and knew you had no time, you slammed your fists against Celeste's immeasurable butt crack hopping for her to notice you. The rumbling of the impending ass blast grew louder, you slammed, banged and kicked against her meaty wall in a last ditch effort to get her attention. Then it happened, by some fraction of a miracle Celeste had felt you and you saw her building of a finger heading your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Up far above you Celeste felt a small itch in her butt crack she went to discreetly scratch it with her index finger. She looked around to be sure nobody was watching before sticking the same finger down her shorts to scratch behind her thong. She gently removed her hand from her ass and went back to answering the quiz. Celeste could feel her next fart begging to escape from her bowels, but she knew this one would be way to big to not be heard. She was struggling to hold it in but if she could just wait two more minutes she could get out as many farts as she needed in the restroom again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Down below when Celeste had scratched you with her finger you had gotten caught on her nail, only to be released from it when she scratched behind her thong, you were now in a much worse position. Her pink thong was blocking your only exit, and the rumbling was much louder on this side. The smell was worse too, like a dump truck filled with rotten food. You turned around to see Celeste's Town sized anus right in front of you, and it was easy to tell she was having trouble holding in a massive fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celeste had finished her quiz and was waiting for the bell to ring. She bit her lip as her stomach growled and she felt her still unreleased fart grow even more. She was thankful that Blaise wasn't here, she was sure one little distraction would cause her to release her methane monster. She could feel how big it was, she knew releasing this fart in class would be the end of her social life, and she refused to be known as the fart girl. She pulled up her thong and gave herself a wedgie in an effort to stop any chance of it slipping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were pressed into the wrinkles of Celeste's smelly anus as her thong was pulled against her skin. You heard the bell ring and you felt Celeste rushing to pack her things. Suddenly her ass cheeks started to slam into you one after the other, over and over. You heard a bathroom stall slam shut and knew the time had come, you were about to take the worst Dutch oven in history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celeste put her hands against the stall door, arched her back and raised her butt high into the air. She was going to get all of her gas out right now. She felt a small itch on her butthole right before she grunted and let loose her absolute monster of a fart. The stall shook from the sheer might of her release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The only reason Celeste's fart didn't blow you away was because her thong was blocking you. Her anus was wide open, with you in the center, you could see the insides of her ass like it was the world's largest and nastiest cave. On top of that it was releasing a hurricane of pent up gas that had one purpose, destroying your nose. It smelled like a sewage leak and you knew it was going to take more than a shower to get this sent off of you. Her fart went on for more than a minute, as it died down her Anus closed around you with a vice like grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Options<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grease from her anus and the extreme amount of methane from her farts cause a secondary reaction in the formula she made, making you shrink even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeleste investigates her itch and finds you, but instead of helping you she decides to keep you for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeleste continues to release more gas<br>\r\n</b></span></div></div>",

You and her walk in the opposite direction to Science class and after a couple of minutes you realize she led you to the school gym, and you notice that there's nobody around. It's dark, as expected of any classroom that's not in use, and it's cloudy, so, there's not much sunlight coming in either.<br>\r\n\"Did you forget something he-\" You ask while turning around, only to have Celeste spray you in the face with an unknown liquid<br>\r\n\"Celeste, what the hell?!\" You shout, but she just giggled again and sprayed you a couple more times before you side stepped and took a few steps back.<br>\r\n\"Is this supposed to be a joke?\" You ask angrily<br>\r\n\"Not really, but you'll find out soon enough...\" She replied in an overly sweet and somewhat annoying tone, she looked at her phone <br>\r\n\"To be more precise, in about 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...\" she said as you suddenly and inevitably blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn indeterminate amount of time later... You groggily wake up, and despite not doing drugs nor alcohol, you've learned why either of those things is probably a bad idea. Your head feels like it's spinning 'Geez, what the damned hell was that?' You said as you lightly slap your face in an attempt to force yourself to regain your focus. Still feeling rather dizzy, you open your eyes and stand up. When they finally regain their focus, you almost faint again from the view, before you was a colossal shoe, larger than any building you ever saw, and said shoe was not empty, there was a foot in it. Looking a bit to the side, you can see another shoe and its respective foot in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know Celeste was the type to use psychotropics...\" You mutter, still trying to comprehend what stood before you. Then, you started looking up, even straining your neck a little, and found that this mysterious colossal figure looked familiar in a way<br>\r\n\"Wakey wakey sleepyhead!\" Celeste's voice boomed from the heavens<br>\r\n\"...what...?\" You ask nobody in particular out of sheer disbelief. Your eyes then widen when the gigantic figure before you crouches, and its hand reaches towards you. Without thinking it twice, you start running, but the hand easily catches you and picks you up with two skyscraper-sized fingers. In a mere instant, you see Celeste's face, but thousands of times bigger and her light brow eyes give you a stare that feels like it's piercing through your soul.<br>\r\n\"I think I overdid it a tiny bit...\" She said and smiled<br>\r\n\"You what?\"<br>\r\n\"Still, you're kinda cute at this size...\" She added<br>\r\n\"Celeste, what the hell did you do?!\" You shouted, unsure about whether or not she could even hear you<br>\r\n\"Don't you see? I shrank you, silly!\" She replied as if she just answered a really dumb question<br>\r\n\"W-Why?!\" You scream.<br>\r\n\"That's a very good question...\" She whispered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Paths]</i><br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I can't get bigger anywhere near fast enough to interest you, but if I make you smaller it's technically the same result...\" Celeste replied<br>\r\n\"Now you've got a whole lot more of me to love...\" She purred as she used her free hand to caress her chest, stomach and thighs <br>\r\n\"Don't worry though, I'll still stick to my word and will drop the diet just for you...\" she giggled as you went pale. But you hadn't even seen the beginning of it as her hand lowers you down and brings you around her waist.<br>\r\n\"I can't even dream of having a butt as big as Jen's or Lillian's, but I think it should be more than enough to keep you happy\" She said, and your blood ran cold as you saw her monumental behind, it was like a pair of mountain-sized water balloons to you. Even with her standing still, it rippled and wobbled noticeably, owing to the fact that it was nearly entirely made of fat.<br>\r\n\"Who knows, it may get bigger...\" She said teasingly and used her free hand to pull her short shorts and underwear back while the other hand brought you closer to her chasm of an asscrack, dangling you precariously above it.<br>\r\n\"Knock yourself out!\" She laughed as she dropped you in, and let her underwear and shorts snap back into place, sending you falling into her colossal abyss, the only relief you got was the knowledge that you'd have a soft landing...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's so you can learn that excesses are bad...\" she replied sternly<br>\r\n\"Come again?\" You reply confused<br>\r\n\"I told you about Lillian... She's too big... too fat... too heavy... but you like that kind of huge, gross body, don't you?\" She said. You were actually annoyed and angered by her insults towards your best friend, but you knew better than to defy someone several thousand times larger than you without a plan.<br>\r\n\"So, I'm going to let you learn first-hand why it's a terrible idea to be with her and people like her...\" She said, and you could feel the blood in your body heating up<br>\r\n\"That disgusting fat you adore is going to crush you flat...\" She added with a sinister glint in her eye<br>\r\n\"The pot calling the kettle black...\" You finally reply, and she blinked twice in surprise<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?!\" Celeste growled<br>\r\n\"You keep on calling her fat, yet it's you who fights against the weighing machine!\" You retort, and she's left speechless for a moment, she had never expected that kind of comeback from you, but you just had about had it with her arrogance and disdain for your friends.<br>\r\n\"That's because she's a whale, and doesn't care at all!\" She yells after a few seconds<br>\r\n\"You know that she's actually one of the top students in PE, right? While you absolutely suck at anything remotely athletic...\" You spit venomously.<br>\r\n\"If you really wonder why you keep getting 'fat' numbers on the weighing machine, all you have to do is turn around and look down...\" You finished off with that, your heart pounding out of sheer rage. You definitely didn't take kindly to anyone insulting your friends or family. You heard Celeste struggle to say something, but her voice kept breaking up. She looked away, but you still saw a tear slide all the way down from her cheeks. For a moment, you hesitate, and wonder if perhaps you went too far, but you were still deeply angered by what she said. She wiped her tears and took a few deep breaths to regain some of her composure. Then she looked at you with an unprecedented fury in her eyes.<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" She almost roared at you <br>\r\n\"You know, I was going to go easy on you and leave you where she'd squash you for a bit before you could get away...\" she muttered, her quiet tone became increasingly chilling with each word.<br>\r\n\"But not anymore... You like her so much that you're willing to defend her like that?! Fine! Let's see who can defend you from her...\" She said, and gave you a dark smile. She brought you closer to her lips next.<br>\r\n\"You love her big, fat ass so much, don't you?\" she asked rhetorically<br>\r\n\"Well then, let's see how much you like it at your size!\" She said with more venom in her voice than you knew she was capable of, but then she tapped her chin in thought and laughed sinisterly.<br>\r\n\"She really does fart a lot, doesn't she? I wonder if you'll be able to survive those atom bombs when you're the size of a speck...\" She said, and you shuddered despite your anger, she truly got you there, but despite that, you weren't going to back down and beg for mercy. Even if what came next was borderline a death sentence, you'd still give it your all and either make it out or die trying, but either way, you'd go on with a clean conscience, no matter what.<br>\r\n\"Do your worst!\" You shouted<br>\r\n\"With pleasure...\" Celeste replied as she put you on her palm and closed her fist over you. At least you knew your destination, and if you somehow indeed managed to make it out of there and got Lillian's help, Celeste would be screwed. There was no way this bratty scrawny girl with a fat butt would be any match for your behemoth of a best friend. And you knew Lillian has been wanting to beat her up for a long time, the only thing keeping her from doing it was the fact that you considered her family. It would be the riskiest bet you'd ever make in your life, but it was preferable to living the rest of your days as your perverted cousin's toy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Actually, you could say this is kind of an experiment...\" Celeste said<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n\"It's pretty simple... you'll have a couple of tests that you need to pass...\" she said cryptically<br>\r\n\"I'm not quite following...\"<br>\r\n\"You might end up living a dream... or a nightmare, depending on how you play your cards...\"<br>\r\n\"So, like a lab rat?\" You raised an eyebrow<br>\r\n\"Hmm... in a way, yeah... but I guarantee you that your 'labyrinth' is going to be a whole lot more interesting...\" She chuckled<br>\r\n\"What's this labyrinth you're talking about, and what do I have to do?\" You asked<br>\r\n\"Ooh... Your labyrinth is going to be... Jen's body...\" She smiled, but you went pale<br>\r\n\"Please tell me you're not going to make her eat me...\" You shuddered<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, no,no,no... Not at all... In fact, quite the opposite...\" She replied, and giggled when she saw your confused look<br>\r\n\"You're going to get a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see her like nobody ever has, or will...\" Celeste kept on grinning<br>\r\n\"You're going to start off in that big beautiful booty you like...

As long as a problem turns up, she turn to you or Celeste with suspicions, but your mother said it was because she was very worried about you two. Celeste is terrified of her and would clam up in her presence and your friends were no better. Lillian would try to stand up to her, but eventually would be silenced.

Also, Lillian and Jen sit together for lunch, as it's usually the three of you who sit together at one of the tables]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell into a sea of crimson sludge with black and green pieces, you can see through the tomato sauce that it was Jen's chili you landed in and you're on her spoon. You try shouting, as you hope that Jen will hear, but the gods deny this and you enter her mouth. You scream, fearing this will be your brutal end. Everything goes dark, and the shift in humidity and warmth hits you pretty hard. You go into fetal position, awaiting your end, almost preferring to be chewed rather than swallowed alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for you, Jen happened to be quite the chili connoisseur and immediately noticed an odd taste in her mouth. It wasn't bad by any means, but it was definitely something she didn't recall adding to it. Rather than chewing it, she tried to carefully taste it as thoroughly as she could using her tongue, and quickly noted that its shape was odd as well. She swallowed the rest of the food but pinned the odd tasty thing to the inside of her cheek as she did to keep it from getting swallowed as well. She then discreetly covered her mouth as she took the mysterious object out of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened when she realized it seemed to be a tiny doll, a replica of Blaise at that, and it was so detailed that it even worse the exact same clothes he wore today. Raising an eyebrow, she brought it closer to her eyes to further inspect it, and almost failed to suppress a gasp as it moved. She heard it cough and wipe what had to be her saliva off its face. It was surreal, it couldn't be a simple doll, but, she didn't think it'd be possible for it to be a real person, or be Blaise himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Come to think of it... he never skips lunch with us... and he hasn't shown up yet...'</i> She thought. She looked around, and she didn't see him with either Celeste or Yamile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts on that were interrupted as the tiny figure then stood up on her fingertip, its movements were too smooth to be a robot, and it was too small to have batteries or a charging port. As crazy as this scenario looked, the only obvious answer was that this was a tiny person. She remembered that she had you explain the plot of Sherlock Holmes' books to her, since she had missed that class and needed the info for homework, and you told her one of his famous quotes, explaining his reasoning:<br>\r\n<b><i>\"When you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth\"</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to listen to that memory, however, she couldn't just talk to you as it was, as Lillian was sitting right next to her.

She sighed in relief, and could finally afford to talk to you.<br>\r\n\"Hey... Blaise... is that you?\" She asked, giggling at the sheer silliness of the situation, but her heart was already pounding. Her pulse quickened when she saw you nod.<br>\r\n\"W-What happened? How did you get like this?\"<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know. I literally just woke up in your chili...\" You replied, she managed to hear you since she was focusing on you and tuning out everything else, but even then it was quite the effort. She smiled and gently patted your head with her fingertip in an attempt at comforting you.<br>\r\n\"Speaking of that... you gave that chili an unusual flavor\" She giggled<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, I guess that's good news. If I taste bad, then nobody will want to eat me\" You laughed, scratching your head<br>\r\n\"Oh, I didn't mean that at all... You didn't taste bad...\" Jen said and your laughter gradually stopped<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n\"You actually tasted... really good...\" She said with a faint blush, and you had no idea how to respond to that. You looked at her awkwardly, unsure on how to follow the conversation. <br>\r\n\"Would you let me taste you again?\" She asked with a sweet smile<br>\r\n\"H-Huh?!\"<br>\r\n\"It's not like you can get any more drenched...\" She said, and her faint blush returned. Before you could object, she dipped you into her chili and licked it off you. She licked you several times to make sure she got it all off. You were beyond flabbergasted. She repeated the process several times, and each time she licked you more and more before dipping you back into the chili. It felt unreal, her tongue was building size to you, but it was able to be gentle on you, and it seemed that she wanted to feel you on every square inch of it with each lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen really liked your taste, and while she had been intrigued by it earlier, this had been mostly a pretext to try and send more drastic signals to you. After 3 years of friendship and knowing plenty of info thanks to Lillian, she knew that while you were by no means dumb on most things, you were too innocent on others, and had never caught on any of the signals she had sent you that she wanted you to ask her out. She had learned from Lillian that she needed to be blunt, though she didn't like that style. Still, this presented an unique chance and she went for it. Even if it was rather unlikely, she hoped one of these days you'd finally ask some big questions that would lead to either realizing her feelings for you, or set things up for her to ask you out after you failing to do so so many times. Her current attempt would be the most blatant to date, but she knew it'd likely go over your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed you into her lips after licking you clean for the umpteenth time and that made your brain nearly stop working as you felt how plush and warm they were. They squeezed you a bit as she licked you more, and you started to wonder if this was still tasting at all. It started looking more like just kissing, but that made no sense to you. You thought you were just overthinking things. And while you were deep in thought, her licking only grew more passionate, and her lips \"played\" more with you until she suddenly popped you in her mouth, snapping you out of her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen giggled quietly as she tasted you like a piece of candy, her tongue wrapped itself around you and rubbed you all over it, as well as on the inside of her cheeks and the roof of her mouth. She just couldn't get enough of your taste, and her blush intensified as she kept on playing with you using her mouth. After a couple minutes, worried about whether or not you could breathe, she took you out of her mouth like the first time, gently blew on you to dry you off, and finished by rubbing you on her monumental chest, wiping you clean on her left boob, a mountain-sized mound of flesh to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I think I got carried away...\" She apologized, but her expression was rather playful still.<br>\r\n\"It's okay... I never thought I'd taste that good...\" You laughed \"I'll take it as a compliment...\" you added, but still felt awkward about the whole ordeal.<br>\r\n\"Uh... what are we going to do about my size?\" You sighed and decided to finally ask the big question.<br>\r\n\"I don't really know... Obviously, I have to keep you safe, but I can't even begin to imagine how to actually help you\" Jen replied \"Should we go to the science teacher?\" she asked<br>\r\n\"I don't think she'll be able to help much... and she might hand me over to the Principal if she can't handle my situation...\" You said with a shudder, terrified of what it'd be like to encounter Arianna at your current size<br>\r\n\"I guess that means you'll have to stay with me until we can figure things out\" She said with a very subtle smile that you failed to notice. You saw her then blush some more.<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Houston, we have a problem\" she said and you looked at her quizzically \"You see... I don't have any pockets, and I... I chose not to wear a bra today...\" she said with growing embarrassment<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't mind keeping you in here for the time being\" she giggled cutely as she lowered you to her enormous bust, which wobbled slightly even with her sitting still. You instantly blushed harder than her.<br>\r\n\"But I'm afraid you'll fall from there, so, there's only one option left...\" She said as she slowly lowered you down to her waist level, and brought you around it. Much to your dismay, she presented you with the view of her massive ass, clad in a short skirt and a tiny red thong which she pulled back, revealing her enormous crack.<br>\r\n\"My <i>second cleavage</i> will have to do for now\" She tried to joke to lighten the mood, but that did nothing to help you.<br>\r\n\"Jen wait!\" You screamed but she had already dropped you in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew Jen had a pretty big butt, even if it often got overshadowed by Lillian's much bigger one, but right now, it was far bigger than hers, and any other girl's for that matter. The only relief you got was the knowledge that your landing would be somewhere soft. You fell right into her crack just as she let go of her thong, which snapped back and wedged itself, taking you with it, deep into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, you landed on what pretty much felt like warm marshmallows, and knowing this was Jen's butt of all places made your heart instantly start pounding like crazy. For a moment, you wondered if this was a form of Heaven, but that illusion quickly shattered as you took your first breath. While it didn't smell too disgusting, it definitely smelled like what it was, an ass. It wasn't too sweaty, but there was a faint reek that you'd rather not think much about. This was knowledge you'd have to take to the grave, as never in a million lifetimes you'd be able to tell Jen to her face that her butt smelled.<br>\r\n<i>'Eh, I guess it could've been worse...'</i> you thought, and then shuddered after imagining ending up in this very same situation but with Lillian instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I hope he doesn't mind too much the smell back there' </i>Jen thought 'I bet Lillian would've done this right off the bat... but it'd take an unreal amount of self confidence to do it knowing how gassy she is...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping out of her thoughts, she soon realized she had already finished her chili, much to her own dismay, as she had meant to stop eating it after discovering Blaise. <i>'Guess I really overdid it with the licking...'</i> she thought with a sigh and gently patted her belly. It looked a bit pudgy after having a big meal, what she usually dubbed a <b><i>food baby</i></b>. But now, that'd spell bad news for the two of them, as chili wasn't exactly kind to her stomach, despite her fondness for it. Taking him out of her butt was out of the question, but she wondered if she should warn Blaise somehow about the impending danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'But then he'd think I put him in there on purpose... Uh... I think the best way to go about it is to just let loose and apologize later... I hope it's not so bad for him'</i> She thought, though she knew he'd be pretty much facing a storm soon. <i>'I can't possibly be any worse than Lillian at least'</i> she attempted to reassure herself. Shortly after, Lillian came back to continue eating her burritos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Paths]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jen goes about her day with her tiny crush/stowaway deep between her biggest pair of assets.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Covered in grease and some beefy 'boulders' of some kind, you can see Lillian staring at you hungrily. Realizing you were on her burritos, you try to run, but the steep slope from Lillian holding it and the grease prevents you from moving, your foot slipping you back into the majority of the burrito filling and you scream, you can see her licking her lips and open her mouth wide and desperately try to swim your way out, going towards the back end of the burrito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe easily fits one third of said burrito into her mouth before biting down, missing you by mere inches in your scale. Seeing how easily she chews a multi building-sized portion of food, which would weigh several hundred tons in your own scale humbles you like nothing else, but you quickly snap out of it and resume trying to swim or run out of the burrito's filling and try to get to the back end of it, though to you it was held miles above the food tray and you couldn't risk dropping down from so high. Still, that'd be an issue for later, as the top priority right now was to avoid getting eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral seconds later, she bit a second time, and like before, you almost didn't make it. Even more panicked than before, you run to the end of the burrito and wonder what to do next. You then fall on your stomach as the \"ground\" under you shifts, Lillian is bringing the final piece of the burrito to eat in one bite, but as she does, she tilts it some more and you end up falling off. The air around you chills you as you fell, but soon you're warmed once again as you land into another burrito. Like at the beginning, the burrito's greasy surface greatly slows you down, ironically, you had better chances inside than outside it. Seemingly by a miracle, Lillian took a smaller bite this time, but still only missed you by a tiny margin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were determined not to waste that chance, and now you knew you could survive the fall, though that'd be as long as you landed on one of the burritos, so you run forward to jump off it. However, fate seems to want to screw with you yet again as Lillian tilts the burrito upwards and the inertia of that movement sends you tumbling back. As its angle was too steep for you, you had to do like before and run towards its back end and jump off from there, though that was far easier to say than to do, the greasy layer on the burrito's tortilla made it extremely difficult for you to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis ordeal repeated several times, as Lillian had grabbed 6 large burritos for herself, and it had taken a huge toll on you, you were deeply exhausted by the 5th burrito she started eating, all of your muscles ached and barely responded. In fact, you probably hadn't knocked out by sheer willpower, and you crawled/limped your way towards the burrito's back end. Each one had been like walking across a city in a straight line, in terms of scale, but made much harder by the sticky stuff slowing you down and threatening to keep you in place. Breathing heavily, you almost go on autopilot, your brain feelin itself too tired to handle the situation anymore, but despite your beaten state, you get a sort of second wind that keeps you from going unconscious, but doesn't boost your body all that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Paths]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mustering up the very last of your strength, you gain whatever impulse you can and jump off the giant burrito before Lillian brings its last portion to her mouth, but you land on the last one with no more strength left, though you stay conscious...<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You try with all your might, but your body refuses to respond, and you can only watch in agonized panic as the burrito and you enter Lillian's mouth...<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------</span></div></div>",

You tried your hardest at forcing it back to action to no avail. Soon, Lillian swallowed the previous burrito and hungrily looked at the one you lied on. She slowly grabbed it and lifted it up, tilting it a bit just like she always did. Seeing it go up and towards her open mouth managed to finally force your body to respond through sheer panic, and you stood up and turned around. However, that's all that forced last jolt of energy did for you, as you tried to take the first stride, your legs went numb again and you tumbled down all the way to the back edge of the burrito, kept in place by its sticky grease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Goddammit... so close... just a few more inches and I would've fallen off...' </i>You thought in frustration, but only then another realization hit you<br>\r\n<i>'What would happen next, assuming I avoided getting eaten?'</i> You wondered. The most likely answer is that you'd be thrown into the washer and would probably drown. You remembered that Ms. McAllen and the Principal were the lunch supervisors for the week, so, they would be the ones to pick up the trays, and there was a slim chance they'd find you. Given how stern Arianna was to you, she'd probably think you did this to yourself, and you shiver in terror, imagining having to deal with her at such a diminished size. On the other hand, there was Ms. McAllen, who is pretty sweet and kind, but maybe playful to a fault, and the way she always has teased you made you uncomfortable, there was a vague sense that you wouldn't be all that safe with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked again at Lillian, she smiled and brought the last piece of her last burrito to her mouth. This was going to be it for you. You kept on trying your body just to move a little more, but it felt too numb to respond. Soon you, along with the burrito piece, entered her mouth and you closed your eyes, not wanting to see house-sized teeth smash or slice you to pieces. Several tense seconds passed, and her huge tongue shifted you around, but her teeth never came close to even graze you. Eventually you hear her swallow the other stuff, but her tongue held you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, Lillian was smiling, she had known all along that you were tiny and in her food, and had just been playing around, letting you escape as she purposely took her sweet time eating. She carefully made sure to swallow the actual food but left you in her mouth, she then got up and went to the bathroom, struggling not to giggle along the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of minutes later, she entered the girls' bathroom and looked around, there was no one around. This made her smile, and walked into one of the stalls, which she locked, just in case. She then finally opened her mouth and took you out. You were absolutely baffled and flabbergasted, though you couldn't deny your relief about getting spared from ending up in Lillian's stomach. She smiled cheekily at you, and you didn't like that look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy the show?\" She asked, and yet there was another thing you found odd, she didn't seem the least bit surprised about your current condition. You couldn't even begin to think a proper answer after what you just went through, even more so with the implicit knowledge that it was a game to her. She was your best friend, and teased and pranked you pretty heavily for most of your life, but this might have gone too far even for her. Still, you weren't all that mad at her and just wanted her to take this more seriously. Staring at you, she chuckled.<br>\r\n\"Even now I still can read you like a book\" She said <br>\r\n\"Okay, I probably got carried away with that little prank from earlier...\" Before you could even say anything, she suddenly brought you back to her mouth and gave you a quick lick<br>\r\n\"If it makes you feel better, you didn't taste bad at all...\" She giggled \"Though, burritos are still the tastiest, so you shouldn't worry about me eating you\" She then gently blew on you to dry you off.<br>\r\n\"Now, now, before you get mad... I'll make it up to you...\" She said in a suggestive way that almost felt out of character as far as you could tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian slowly lowered you down, first giving you quite the view of her chest, which was pretty large if she pretty much never flaunted it, next her slightly pudgy belly, now looking even pudgier after all the food she had just eaten. Giggling some more, she lowered you even farther down and brought you around her waist. You weren't prepared for <i><b>that</b></i> view. You knew she had a huge butt, the biggest in school among students, but right now it was so huge it was ridiculous to you. A pair of humongous, jiggly planetoids encased in seriously ill-fitting black spandex shorts. Just one of her cheeks could easily overtake your entire horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><i>All of</i></b> <u><i><b>this</b></i></u> is yours...\" She said as she used her free hand to attempt to cup one of her titanic glutes, and sinking her fingers into it, showing off just how squishy and soft it was<br>\r\n\"W-What?\" You finally spoke<br>\r\n\"After I made you suffer like that, I think you deserve a very nice reward, or a peace offering, if you wish\" She chuckled and brought you closer to her gigantic derriere<br>\r\n\"You're free to do <i>anything</i> you want to this big booty\" She said, once again in a seductive tone you didn't even know she was capable of, and as she said that, she lightly pressed you into one of her gelatinous cheeks and rubbed you on it in small circles. She did this across every single square inch of her jiggly meaty globe before she repeated the process with the other, and after that, with no warning, she put you against one of the stall's walls and pressed her enormous butt into it, and you. Her weight was beyond immeasurable, but her flesh was so soft you weren't hurt, just pinned in place. At least now you knew you could theoretically withstand her massive weight and live to tell the tale, though that may be the least of your worries at this moment. She hummed happily to herself as she rubbed her huge butt on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even a hug? It has to feel nice, to have a warm, soft pillow on top of you...\" She said teasingly and wiggled her hips, causing large waves of fatty flesh to ripple across her cheeks and shake you wildly. She leaned back, pressing more of her weight on you, and she stayed like that for a couple of minutes. After that she stopped leaning against the wall and pulled you out from under her butt, though she still held you right next to it.<br>\r\n\"Why...?\" You asked tiredly<br>\r\n\"Why? Huh, well, because I have a big, sexy booty and you're a red-blooded guy, duh...\" She replied in a rather deadpan tone \"It should be obvious...\" she laughed a bit, as she knew what you were really asking, but she wouldn't admit it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened when out of the blue, she used her free hand to pull her shorts down, struggling noticeably, as those spandex shorts were several sizes too small and looked painted on her. Still, a few minutes later, her gigantic butt was released from its tight imprisonment, and it looked considerably bigger than before. She brought you right in front of it<br>\r\n\"Can you really tell me that <i><b>this</b></i> doesn't get your blood pumping?\" She teasingly asked and lightly spanked herself, sending tsunami-sized ripples across one of her deliciously huge and jiggly cheeks. You gulped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought\" She smiled more and once again she pressed you into her incredibly soft flesh for a minute before she held you right before her canyon-sized crack<br>\r\n\"Do you like my thong?\" She asked in an overly cheerful song-song tone, and you had no idea how to respond, you couldn't even see anything, it was simply pitch black inside<br>\r\n\"Uh... I don't see anything from here...\" You replied awkwardly, and you heard her giggle a lot for a few seconds<br>\r\n\"Beautiful answer...\" she said \"That means a good close-up look is in order...\" That made you gulp harder<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held you a bit higher in the air so you had a better view of her colossal behind as she slowly pulled her deeply wedged thong out, like her shorts, it was obvious that it was several sizes too small for her<br>\r\n\"Wait, Lillian, stop!\" You shouted<br>\r\n\"All done... Are you ready for your prize?\" She said, teasingly wiggling her eyebrows at you<br>\r\n\"N-No!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian sighed and brought you to her face.<br>\r\n\"Can you really look me in the eye and tell me you don't like butts?\" She said, and that left you in a stunned silence.<br>\r\n\"I don't even need to look at your eyes, I know the answer already...\" She added as her lips slowly curved into a smirk. She brought you again before her massive ass, and wiggled her hips to give it even more jiggle. Her gigantic cheeks made intimidating booms every time they bounced into each other, and you could even feel them rattle your bones.<br>\r\n\"It's not every day that your best friend gives you a first-class tour of her big sexy booty...\" she teased more. You panicked. You both knew she had just gorged herself on burritos. Even if she hadn't, putting you in her butt would be incredibly dangerous anyway, given your size and her gassiness<br>\r\n\"Wait, Lillian!\"<br>\r\n\"What is it now this time?\"<br>\r\n\"You... You just ate a ton of burritos...\" You said, still not feeling like being too blunt with her, she was still a girl after all. She gave you a dumbfounded look for a few seconds before she burst out laughing<br>\r\n\"Of course I know that...\" She said \"A big ass like this is bound to have to let off some gas...\" she said, lightly spanking herself again<br>\r\n\"Then it's probably not a good idea-\" You were trying to say but she swiftly interrupted you<br>\r\n\"I fart around you and on you all the time, Blaise... if anything you should be pretty much immune to my farts after all these years\" She joked \"Or at least, be used to them enough...\" she said in a quieter, flirtier tone<br>\r\n\"Have fun!\" she said before she finally pulled her thong back and dropped you in...</span></div></div>",

With each prong of the fork bigger than your head, you definitely don't want to be skewered by it and you maneuver your way out as you scream up towards her. Just before she stabs you, the fork stops and you can see Arianna looking at you. She quickly looks around and once she's sees nobody is looking, she quickly picks you up, covering her eye with the hand you're in. Her eyes bulge out immediately as she can tell that you're the real deal, but Arianna is quick to resume her cold stature and drops you between her breasts. While you were relieved that you weren't stabbed, you couldn't but worry at what Arianna would do to you, however, her breasts and scent made things very comfortable for you.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Arianna pulls out her phone and pretends to check it out, before addressing to Lulu.<br>\r\n\"Ms. McAllen, something came up, so I'll be heading back to my office. Make sure these kids don't do something stupid, especially Celeste,\" she said, Ms. McAllen turning and nods at Arianna's words as she swallows her soup.<br>\r\n\"Hm, what about Blaise? In fact, where is he? I haven't seen with his friends or anywhere else for that matter,\" she said, but the principal was gone then.<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Arianna is strolling up to her office, ignoring the secretary that immediately pretended to be having an important call with someone and shuts the door after entering her office. Giant fingers break your trance from your cousin's giant boobs as they pick you up and Arianna reinspects you again as she walks behind her desk with her lunch.<br>\r\n\"Arianna, it's me, Blaise.... Your cousin.... You okay, cus?... Ms. Abalos?\" You ask after an awkward amount of time passes by as you two stay silent.<br>\r\n\"Tiny Blaise... So cute!\" She squeals, a dopey grin growing on her face as she drools a bit and rubs her cheek against you.<br>\r\n\"Ari! What are you doing?\" You shout, greatly surprised and confused by the turn of events as she continues to rub against you.<br>\r\n\"First off, you're hurting me and secondly, don't you hate me at all?\" You question her, lying about the first part, and your first cousin, shocked at your question, pulls her hand away from her, almost flinging you off it.<br>\r\n\"Hate you? I could never... Is that what you thought of me?!\" She asked, ready to cry.<br>\r\n\"You're always so stern towards the students and whenever something happens, you come to me or Celeste about,\" you answer truthfully.<br>\r\n\"Teenagers are savage animals and can do a great deal of harm, but what would happen if they hurt my cute Blaisey Wlaisey?\" She asked, biting hard on thumb on her other hand, as you just thought she had a few screws loose.<br>\r\n\"And Celeste?\" \"She's like you, but if only she wasn't so obsessed with her weight and look in reality, then maybe...\" Arianna answers carefree, you just apologizing to Celeste in her stead.<br>\r\n\"But whether or not this is a dream, I have a tiny, cutie Blaise in my palm...\" Arianna said lustfully, biting her bottom lip and a shiver of fear went down you your spine.<br>\r\nCupping her hand, she brings you towards her massive butt and covers it. Being the biggest butt around, even bigger than Ms. McAllen's (though it comes short to Lillian's mother's), many males lusted for Arianna's butt, you included. But with your size, her plump bubble booty were now mountains to you and with a grunt, an explosion of flatulence hits, the smell of petrol sewage and rotten vegetables hitting you hard. After making a series of bubbles pop in the seat of her pants, Arianna brings you in front of her crotch, where you can smell her arousal.<br>\r\n\"Fffffuuuuuuccccckkkk! That was good!\" She drooled as you finally recovered from her methane attack.<br>\r\n\"You know, I have a doll that resembles you and when I get home, my belly all bloated up, I sit right on its face.

Looking up, you see your art teacher, Ms. McAllen or Lulu for short, talking with one of her students. Considering you're in a highly dangerous zone, and you can easily get scooped up and eaten, you disregard everything else and start screaming as hard as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student she was talking to left rather quickly much to your relief, and the moment of truth came when she looked down at her soup. By the grace of some god up in Heaven, she managed to hear your screams and blinked twice in disbelief. A tiny doll, no bigger than an ant, splashed around in her soup. It was too small to have batteries, and there was no way it could be charged, and by how it moved, it definitely had to be a real, living thing. Smiling, she gestured at you to be quiet, signaling that she had seen you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed in relief, but before anything else, you were lifted up as she scooped up in her spoon the soup around you, taking you with it. Now closer to her face, she could take a better look at you, and upon realizing your identity she silently gasped. She glanced to the right, as the Principal, Arianna, sat right next to her, but she was half-eating half-keeping watch on the students around, as both of them got lunch supervision duty for the week. Not being a student, Ms. McAllen could enjoy the luxury of not being under her \"radar\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, speaking would be impossible at the moment, and she knew Arianna had pretty good hearing, so she wouldn't take any chances. She had many questions for you, and unknown to you, quite a few proposals, but communication would have to wait until they were in better circumstances. For now, she needed to secure you, a difficult task, as again, the eagle-eyed principal was sitting right next to her, and she had no doubt that she'd react to anything remotely suspicious on her watch. Her stern demeanor wasn't limited to students, she was also about just as strict on teachers, though she was a bit more lenient with Lulu as they were more or less friends, and her carefree/bubbly attitude slowly but steadily rubbed off on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slurped up the soup but was careful enough to leave you on the spoon, pondering how to actually secure you. Putting anything in her cleavage, or even in her pants' pockets would definitely look suspicious. Seeing that you still had some soup on you, she playfully licked it off as best as she could, and gently blew on you to dry you off to the best of her ability at the moment. To any outside observer, it'd simply look like the gorgeous art teacher quietly enjoyed her soup and blew on it to cool it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and saw Ms. McAllen deep in thought, probably thinking how to talk to you. You almost had a heart attack upon seeing Arianna sitting next to her, eating her Brussel sprout salad while keeping watch on the students around. You definitely didn't want to have to deal with her at your current size, for who knows what might happen. You couldn't help but be amazed at how large everything was around you, the spoon that held you was almost as big as a city block in your scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, she finally came up with something, and she smiled, as it was a really naughty idea. Looking down at you, she gave you a playful smile that confused you, followed by a teasing wink, and finally, she discreetly blew a kiss at you. You knew Ms. McAllen was rather touchy-feely with you, and teased you quite a lot in and outside of classes, but you hoped she'd take your situation more seriously. You absolutely had no idea what she could mean with what she did, but you didn't get to think about it for long as she swiftly but gently picked you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were only more confused as her fingers lowered you down and then went around her back. What came next was something you'd never have expected in a million years, as she brought you to her gigantic butt, clad in tight sky blue jeans that looked ready to burst, or looked painted on. Her hand drew closer to it, and you saw that she pretended to scratch her massive booty. You raised an eyebrow, that had been a pretty clever move, and you sighed in relief, as it seemed she'd just put you in one of her back pockets, though it'd be a tight fit for you, it wouldn't be so bad, and besides, you'd be resting against one of the biggest, fattest and hottest asses in the entire school. Not a bad tradeoff, or so you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, rather than doing just that, she pulled her pants' waistband back, revealing an exceedingly skimpy black thong that was mercilessly swallowed by her humongous crack, barely visible other than the puny black fabric triangle above her monstrous cheeks. \"Ms. McA-\" was all you managed to say before she suddenly, but still discreetly pushed you into her canyon-esque crack. It was incredibly warm and soft, her enormous cheeks felt like they were made of jello, but unfortunately for you, her big booty reeked. You had a feeling that it wasn't just the normal smell you'd attribute to a butt, it was worse, and it definitely reeked of farts, but you'd never be able to let her know that, if she ever asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe already overwhelming atmosphere only got warmer and smellier as she pushed you deeper with a finger, and maneuvered you to get inside her thong, obviously in the back portion of it. Then she pushed you even deeper in for good measure, and her finger. You felt as if you had just been submerged in the bottom of a marshmallow or gelatin ocean. Smell aside, it didn't feel terribly bad, as with your shrunken size, you felt a little cold outside, so her warmth was comforting, though it felt kinda overbearing. Suddenly, the colossal squishy walls at your sides pressed into each other and into you, more thoroughly engulfing you into their seemingly immeasurable mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulu smiled as she got away with her plan, she pushed Blaise into the depths of her massive booty and secured him for the time being. She felt shivers go up her spine as she could feel a tiny lump engulfed by the sheer mass of her prodigious rear. She gave a tiny clench to get a better feel on him, and giggled quietly, wondering what it'd be like to someone so small. With her \"prize\" all secure and well hidden, she went back to eating, finishing her bean soup relatively fast in just a couple of minutes. She silently giggled to herself again as she got up and decided to go for a second serving of that soup, which she ate with even more delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think you'd go for a second serving, the first one was already pretty large\" Arianna casually commented<br>\r\n\"I didn't either, but I think lunch supervisor duty makes me hungry\" Ms. McAllen replied with a small laugh<br>\r\n\"How's the salad, by the way?\" She asked<br>\r\n\"I won't know until later... My stomach has been acting up all week... My aunt told me to eat these to soothe it, but it'll be a few hours until I know if it worked for sure...\" Arianna explained, Ms. McAllen kept a straight face, but internally smiled.<br>\r\n<i>'Interesting...'</i> she thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kept eating and watched the students around, but since they were high schoolers, fortunately they were fairly well behaved, at least on lunch. Then again, the presence of Arianna herself was an incredibly powerful deterrent. Lulu was thankful for that, if they were making a ruckus she wouldn't have been able to make the incredible find she just did today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slightly shifted around in her seat, dragging Blaise a bit deeper in between her gigantic cheeks.<br>\r\n<i>'He must love it in my big booty right now'</i> she thought <i>'But it's going to get a whole lot more <b>interesting</b> in about an hour...'</i><br>\r\nAfter lunch and one class, she'd get a free hour to herself, as the group she'd be having would go on a short school excursion, and another teacher was in charge. It was just perfect for her, as this would be precisely when the bean soup would kick in, and she would find out for herself what it felt like to let out her admittedly massive farts (even more so after two bean soups) on her favorite student. She couldn't wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer playfulness was already shifting into high gear as she'd still have plenty of chances to play with you using her big butt with absolute impunity, as nobody in their wildest dreams would think that their Art teacher would have a student trapped deep in between her humongous assets and squished him around as she walked, or pinned him under her weight while she sat, or that his entire world would shift and sway along with her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome other ideas came to her, as she was one of the few people aware of Arianna's recent farting problem that she could barely keep in check to maintain her professional aura. Also knowing the cryptic relationship with her cousin Blaise, and that she seemed to be particularly interested in him, she wondered if she should give him to her after she's had her fun. Or sneak him into her battered office chair and let her discover him herself. She also considered letting Lillian know, but she was sure she'd likely demand to have him, and she didn't feel like giving away her toy so soon. Giving it some more thought, she decided to leave these ideas in the back burner and just enjoy her upcoming <b><i>\"fun\"</i></b> with Blaise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, you were completely unaware of the situation, and of the danger you were in. You guessed putting you in her butt was just one more of her playful antics and that she'd let you out as soon as it was reasonably possible. You had no idea that somehow, you had ended up in one of the worst possible scenarios, trapped in the depths of one of the biggest asses in the entire school at the size of an ant, and that your beautiful Art teacher planned to unleash an hour worth of her legendarily devastating room-shaking farts upon your tiny form, only to probably keep you for herself after.</span></div></div>",

You weren't quite the violent person, but you felt like punching her in the face after you got out of this, or, more accurately and less harmfully, give her big ass a kick with all your might. It was a Friday, a fricking Friday!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The earthquakes intensified until you were forced to lay on your stomach, as it was impossible to stand up. You then saw a colossal figure walk in from the distance, and you shuddered, even though you knew you had been shrunk ridiculously small, you weren't quite prepared for the true reality of your size compared to another human being, and it didn't help that Ms. McAllen, or Lulu, as she preferred to be called by those she considered close, was anything but small. Each footstep of hers felt like a magnitude 8 earthquake to you, and you could even tell that the bench itself shook a little each time as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, she could go to literally any bench around, I can't possibly be that unlu-' You thought, but that thought was cut off as her gigantic frame towered over you. She sighed and put a bag she was carrying on the floor to her side. You decided to stay still, since moving might be a giveaway, and if you don't move, she might not notice you in there. So, you can't help but stare up; her body doesn't even begin to compare with even big stuff you're familiar with, it looks like she'd dwarf anything, houses, buildings, mountains... she was on a whole other league of her own in terms of size. Still, you couldn't help but wonder what she'd be doing at gym at this time... unless... she actually worked out at this precise time to be by herself, maybe feeling a bit self conscious about her weight, though she never seemed the least bit insecure about her figure, and instead she usually appeared rather proud of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't seem to be paying attention to you, and grabbed her shirt and slowly took it off, revealing a black sports bra that looked a bit too small for her, making her chest look even bigger than it already was, though to Blake they were already at the mountain tier size-wise. What he found odd, though, was that it definitely didn't look like the way one would simply take off a shirt... it was far more slow, as if she were stripping for someone. She smiled and looked down at her chest, she caressed it next and cupped her boobs a few times, as if to show off their size to an inexistent audience. Eventually, she put the shirt on the bench, close to one of its ends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then smiled and slowly turned around, giving you a view that you were absolutely not prepared for, her utterly massive ass. It was so huge it was completely mind-blowing, it dwarfed the rest of her body so badly that it wasn't funny, and while her boobs were mountains to you, her bottom twins were vast planets, if you ever found yourself stranded on one of them, it looked like you could forever wander aimlessly around it, and never reach anywhere. Even when contained by its tight denim prison, it wobbled wildly like gelatin, and said wobbling only intensified as she started to struggle to take her pants off. She either had real difficulty containing all that ass, or she was too taking her sweet time like before. In any case, you stood helpless, watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a fair bit of effort, but she managed to slide the jeans down from her waist, doing so very very slowly, and soon you realized why, her pants were indeed always far too small, her monstrous ass was compacted tightly into it, and when she started to slide it down, they seemingly expanded, almost like balloons, and when she finally got them all the way down, her already massive ass looked far bigger, and it revealed that it badly demolished what probably were black lace panties into something less than a thong, which disappeared into her humongous crack, which was so deep that even while she bent over in direct light, it was completely dark deep inside, and you couldn't see where it ended. That thought made you shudder more than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike with the shirt, she tossed her jeans aside pretty carelessly, and sensually swung her enormous hips from side to side, making her ridiculously large cheeks bounce and clap with little effort, and those claps were like sonic booms to you down on the bench. It was a morbid spectacle, even magnified thousands or millions of times over, there was something incredibly sexy and stunning about her, but at the same time, it was incredibly intimidating, as you remembered what benches are for, and that you happen to be on one, and worst of all, the one behind her. It was hard to keep a straight face, and also not to break out and run, but so far, it seemed you had been playing it safe indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. McAllen stepped back, her calves were less than fractions of an inch close to the bench's legs, and above, her mammoth ass kept on jiggling and wobbling, casting a shadow that was far too big to be properly contained by it. With seemingly practiced grace, she slowly lowered her tremendous rear over the bench while still swinging it from side to side. Your heart pounded faster and more intensely, a pair of worlds was effectively descending upon you. Making a risky bet, you still don't move, and hope she doesn't sit all the way down, and even if she did, it would've been impossible for you to get away even if you ran for half an hour with no breaks. Her colossal ass lowers farther and farther down until it almost touches the bench, it's so close you can feel its warmth, and if you extended your arm you could touch it. Her immense chasm of an asscrack hovers right above you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[What happens next?]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>You look up, and realize she's looking straight at you \"Enjoying the show?\" she asks with a wink before she swiftly picks you up...</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>She finally decides to sit down on the bench, and you're engulfed and pinned beneath her titanic ass while she takes her shoes and socks off to do exercise...</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>There's a low, deep rumbling for a split second, and before you know it, you're on the receiving end of the biggest, most powerful explosion ever since the Big Band as Ms. McAllen unleashes one of her room-shaking farts right on you, at near point blank...

I clearly saw that you did...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, your blood might as well have boiled off and evaporated, you felt as if it abandoned your body somehow, and knowing Ms. McAllen, there was no way this was going to end up well, for you that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little birdy told me you were a true ass-man, but I'm still glad to have confirmed it myself\" She said and used her free hand to caress her vast behind.

You couldn't help but stare at the impossibly large and heavy globes of fat and flesh ripple and wobble before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. McAllen smiled and wiggled her butt more, believing that she had captivated you with its spell, while in reality, you were thoroughly intimidated by its sheer size and weight, and baffled by how easily she could make that overwhelmingly large amount of mass move with such ease. You could only think that you'd get crushed flatter than paper thin if you fell in between those blubbery planets and shuddered. Every time they bounced into each other, a massive shockwave flew past you and you felt it shake you to your very core. She hummed a happy little tune to herself, enjoying what she thought was you staring at her gigantic 'assets' in sheer awe and amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the little birdy was right... but don't worry hon, as you can see, I've got more than enough booty to keep you satisfied forever!\" She laughed and smacked her right cheek, sending tsunami-sized waves of fatty flesh rippling across her jiggling planetoid. The thunderclap-like smack snapped you out of your shocked trance and you tried to scream, but part of her fingertip still covered your mouth. She lowered him closer and closer to her canyon-esque crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, you're taking a trip to where no man has gone before\" she said with a faint giggle and swung her hips a bit more drastically to make her titanic ass jiggle even more \"And if you're good, where no man may ever leave...\" she added with a heavily seductive tone in which you somehow felt a hint of a dark lust that chilled you to the bone. Your eyes widened and you entered a complete state of panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of yourself getting dragged into the dark, deep recesses of Ms. McAllen's seemingly bottomless buttcrack, trying to claw your way out from between her humongous glutes to no avail made you feel like you were just short of freezing solid. The thought of what lay deep down in between the cosmic chasm of your Art teacher's excessively large asscheeks had never occurred to you before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Was it smelly?<br>\r\nHow hot and sweaty was it in her butt?<br>\r\nWas she gassy?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese questions gnawed at your mind as you hopelessly realized you'd be able to answer them in exceedingly livid detail soon, and that mortified you the most. You think back about Lillian, the one responsible for your current predicament, and you wonder if this would've been any better had she chosen to play with you herself, though you quickly realize that probably there wouldn't be much of a difference, aside from the size of their butts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. McAllen then carefully pulled her \"thong\" back and deposited you in its back before letting it sink back into her hungry crack. To you, the word \"overwhelming\" fell short to describe anything here, you were trapped in pitch black darkness, completely encased by a pair of warm, squishy and soft blubbery masses whose weight escaped your comprehension. They were slightly moist with sweat, which was no surprise given her booty's tremendous size. There was a rather faint scent of sweaty skin all around you, which was to be expected, and almost surprisingly, it wasn't as bad as you initially thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was a little bit like a sauna, sans the scorching temperatures, and you felt like you were getting bathed in the steam from her evaporating sweat. You then shuddered as you sensed something else in the air, though not quite a smell. It got your heart pumping, and it sent electric shocks all throughout your body, you wondered if these were her pheromones or something, as you recalled reading that most animals indeed emitted those from their genitals, but also commonly from their butts, though never before you had thought of how that applied to humans. It was intoxicating in a way, but it felt like a dark force trying to get into your deep conscious, and you had no choice but to resist it and fight it off with sheer willpower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised also about the fact that you didn't instantly get crushed flat by her insanely heavy cheeks, but then you realized that you were pressed pretty hard into them, but they were so squishy and soft that they effectively cushioned you from their own weight, although they still pinned you in place, and all of you was encased into her blubbery fat flesh, oddly enough, it almost felt like you were submerged in a liquid, albeit an incredibly thick one at that. Then everything shook wildly, literally like gelatin in an earthquake, and you heard a distant but massive booming noise, and quickly realized that she had just taken a step. You shuddered again, trying to cope with how anything else would feel if a single footstep of hers was such a massive impact to your current world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. McAllen slowly took a few steps around, focusing on feeling the tiny speck trapped between her colossal cheeks, sighing in pleasure when she did. She walked around, savoring each step, feeling the vibrations from her foot hitting the ground travelling up her legs, thighs and disperse into jiggling and wobbling all the way up to her prodigious butt, and with each step, her makeshift thong rode up, getting dragged deeper and deeper into the hungry abyss she had for a crack. She giggled with guilty pleasure, as the near imperceptible lump in her rear also got dragged deeper between her huge, pillowy cheeks. She felt drunk with power, her favorite student-crush was at her mercy to the most absolute of the senses, and her best feature, her 'womanly charms' had effectively become his entire world. She had been skeptical about Lillian's seemingly crazy claims about that shrinking prank, but she felt really happy that she decided to listen. Just one tiny clench of her ass would have overwhelming and mind-blowing power to him, a slight wiggle of her cheeks would be a world-wide earthquake and so on, her most minuscule actions would be massive displays of force to her tiny captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking around long enough for her underwear to wedge itself as deep into her crack as she wanted, she decided to stand still and lightly clench her ass to feel your tiny body engulfed by her overbearing mass. She giggled upon finding you and teasingly shook her hips in a way that maximized her cheeks' jiggling, admiring it herself. She followed with a light slap to her left cheek, sending more ripples across it <i>'It has to be the softest place ever to him'</i> she thought to herself and squeezed both of her massive cheeks with her hands, delighted at the feel of her own smooth, doughy flesh and pondered on what to do next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Paths]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Her stomach suddenly gurgled loudly and it visibly rumbled, surprising her.<br>\r\n\"Oh dear...\" she chuckled with a guilty smile. The big fast food lunch she got back at noon hadn't been sitting well with her, but she hadn't expected to be kicking in yet. She looked down at her big butt again and shook her hips a little <br>\r\n'And right when I had him exactly where I wanted...' she thought and silently pouted, though not for long, and soon that pout became a lusty and guilty smile. She hadn't planned on getting this rough with you so early on, but wondered if you could take them.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA part of her, perhaps the voice of reason, told her that letting loose her admittedly monstrous farts upon a speck-sized boy may not be the best idea, but said voice was fairly quiet, and she found it rather annoying. On the other hand, she felt a new thrill about precisely that. Going back to her previous thoughts, a little shake of her hips was likely an enormous earthquake to you, but she couldn't quite fathom what her massive farts would be like to someone so small and so close to the source, but thinking about it turned her on, but still wondered if it wouldn't be too much for the minuscule boy. She didn't get a chance to think that over as her stomach gurgled more intensely and growled as if angered, making her wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Looks like there's only one way to find out...' She thought, feeling a bit guilty, but also incredibly naughty. She wasn't worried about anyone suddenly walking in, as this was the girls' changing room, and most of them should be either leaving for home or doing their extracurricular activities far from this area, so she'd be pretty much alone to do what she pleased, and unfortunately for the speck-sized boy in her gargantuan derriere, that meant she was about to let loose...

It took like half a minute for reality to hit you: <i>You were incredibly small, and at the mercy of your best friend, who was already huge even when you were normal sized.</i>.

She then seemingly snapped out of it and gave you a big smile, you gulped hard. She slowly lowered you down to her waist level and brought you around, showing you her tremendously massive ass. You felt like your eyes could pop out of your face at any moment, and your heart in your throat. She teasingly wiggled her hips and spanked herself with her free hand, creating tsunami sized waves of rippling jiggly flesh that traveled across her entire cheek. You feel the color drain from your face.<br>\r\n\"Nice and sexy, isn't it?\" Lillian further teased and brought you closer, facing her colossal crack, which hungrily swallowed the yoga pants she chose to wear today. She rubbed you quickly across her cheeks before she brought you back to her face<br>\r\n\"But as nice as that can be, there are other options on the table this time, sweetie\" She chuckled<br>\r\n\"In any case, if I feel like it, I can easily get you back later and we can have some <i>fun</i> together\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her free hand, Lillian booted an app on her phone for shuffling options, she wrote something, but you weren't able to see what it was.

You can't even start imagining what kind of plans were devised by that head of hers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Paths]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ooh... Looks like you hit the jackpot!\" She giggled<br>\r\n\"That's like the opposite of how I feel at this size...\" You grumble<br>\r\n\"That's what you think now... but look at this...\" Lillian showed you her phone. On its screen, you saw the app she used, and the winning option, but you raised an eyebrow, as all it said was 'Jen'<br>\r\n\"What does that even mean?\" You asked<br>\r\n\"That means you get to <b>play</b> with Jen at your current size... or, thinking about it, she gets to play with you...\" She replied<br>\r\n\"Just think about it... Jen, at about the same size as me, a tad smaller though...\" When she said that you instantly blushed and looked away, prompting her to enjoy a hearty chuckle<br>\r\n\"See? It's only a matter of perspective...\" She said, but then she stopped to think about something<br>\r\n\"Hey! Why didn't I get that kind of reaction? Granted, she has huge boobs, but they're no match for my beautiful booty...\" Lillian pouted. You simply answer with a deadpan look.<br>\r\n\"I thought you said you weren't a part of these harebrained plans you got for me...\"<br>\r\n\"That doesn't mean I can't tease you with my sexy curves...\" She said, striking a pose, although you couldn't see much of it, given the height she held you at<br>\r\n\"Anyway... You got off lucky this time... I guess you'll have plenty of fun with Jen...\" Lillian said, getting back to her playful mood<br>\r\n\"I'll even be a good sport and give you intel you're not supposed to have...\" She added with a cryptic smile<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I've talked a lot to Jen, and I've learned quite a few interesting things... things she wouldn't tell you...\" She kept smiling and you didn't know whether to feel flustered or afraid<br>\r\n\"Let's say that if you really want to make her happy, you shouldn't focus so much on her boobs\" She explained<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n\"She has a pretty big butt, you know? And she'd like it if that were your focus instead, she likes it better than her bust... I think she might feel a bit self conscious, I don't know for sure, but the main point is, if you want to please her for real you should do that...\"<br>\r\n\"Do what...?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh, well, play with her butt, compliment it, pamper it, I guess stuff like giving her a massage, or let her sit on you, seduce you with it... stuff like that\" She said in a nonchalant tone but giggled seeing your reaction<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she'll reward you nicely if you make her happy\" <br>\r\n\"Uhh...\"<br>\r\n\"Just don't tell her I told you...\" Lillian chuckled and looked at her phone<br>\r\n\"Oh! It should be about time...\"<br>\r\n\"For what?\"<br>\r\n\"Jen got invited to play volleyball with the school's team for fun, and she should be done by now...\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?!\"<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean...\" She giggled mischievously \"She'll be pretty sweaty after such an intense game... You better be a gentleman and don't say anything...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lillian smiled and giggled quietly.<br>\r\n\"What?\" You asked, and she simply turned her phone around, showing you its screen.<br>\r\n\"Look what option won\" she kept giggling. In her phone, besides the app's screen, was the winning option...<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" You read out loud in confusion<br>\r\n\"Yup\"<br>\r\n\"Yours or mine?\" You asked, but still weren't sure of the full meaning of this<br>\r\n\"Mine of course, duh! I didn't really think of your mom for this\" She shrugged<br>\r\n\"Ok, but what does this have to do with that?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't get it, do you?\" Lillian chuckled and you shook your head in response<br>\r\n\"Well, you see, I actually asked my mom what she would do if she found you tiny, smaller than an ant...\" She began<br>\r\n\"She said she'd first feed you and try to make sure you weren't in danger... you know, typical mom answer, I guess... BUT assuming you're not starving and that you're super tough and in no danger of getting squashed, her answer changed...\" She smiled in a way that made you nervous, and her pause only gave you more suspense. You weren't liking where this was going...<br>\r\n\"She said that in that case, she'd like to give you a first class tour of her huge Brazilian booty\"<br>\r\n\"What?!\" You exclaimed, Lillian burst out laughing at your reaction, you were pale and shaking.<br>\r\n\"Oh man, you should've seen your face... Anyway... she said she was <b>just</b> joking... but to be honest, I don't think she was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then brought you closer to her face.<br>\r\n\"So, how about we find out for real?\" She whispered<br>\r\n\"You've got to be joking...\" You said nervously<br>\r\n\"She works here too, you know? She should be done grading papers by now...\"<br>\r\n\"Come on Lillian, that's too mean even for you...\"<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's mean about that?\" Lillian tilted her head<br>\r\n\"Mom loves you... maybe in more ways than one... and she just wants to have some fun...\" She added, leaving you speechless<br>\r\n\"At least it has to be better than to give you to someone like Principal Abalos... right? With how she is, I imagine that she'd just try to flatten you under her huge ass no questions asked\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, and also felt weird, since hearing Lillian say another woman had a huge ass was rather rare, but it just showed that even she acknowledged their Principal's assets.<br>\r\n\"You can be sure that Mom won't try to squish you with her booty... on purpose at least\" She chuckled<br>\r\n\"You know what's even better? It'll be much easier for me to get a turn with you\" Lillian laughed</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Note: In preparation for this, she made sure her mom ate nothing but stuff with beans throughout the day]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, I didn't expect <b>that one</b> to win...\" She said<br>\r\n\"What?\" You asked, and Lillian showed you her phone, it read 'Yamile'<br>\r\n\"I still don't understand...\"<br>\r\n\"Well, to make it simple, I'm going to give you to her... I'm sure she'll appreciate spending some quality time with you\" She giggled, and you gulped, but were also confused, because as far as you knew, these two didn't interact much. It definitely looked like there were several things you were missing about this.<br>\r\n\"Maybe you can get her to belly dance for you or something\" Lillian teased, making you blush<br>\r\n\"Uh... I don't know what concept you have of her, but she's just another friend like you and Jen, and I don't even spend anywhere as much time with her as with you...\" You tried to rectify things<br>\r\n\"And that's precisely why she'll love getting you as a gift\" She giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then proceeded to text her, telling him the basics, that she had you shrunken to 1/10 of an inch tall, that you were pretty much invulnerable to crushing and that she was going to bring him to her to do as she pleased.<br>\r\n\"All set. Well... almost... I'll have to take you to her house, as she didn't have any activities after school, so she went straight home...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then brought you before her titanic booty again and pulled her pants' waistband back<br>\r\n\"In the meantime, enjoy the ride!\" she chirped as she dropped you in, right into her crack, and the thong she wore didn't offer much protection, being swallowed just as badly as you soon would be. With that, she started walking towards her intended destination...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Encased by what to you were the biggest waterbeds ever, you were partially surprised that you didn't get squashed flat between Lillian's planetary cheeks, but then again, they were so soft that even comparing them to jello felt like it didn't do them justice. You felt your entire world shift and sway from side to side along with her hips. Despite your annoyance, and a noticeable smell, you had to admit that it was fairly comfortable, but telling her that was likely a one way ticket to the valley of her asscrack, somewhere you'd rather not overstay your welcome. Her movement eventually lulled you to sleep, as time didn't even seem to pass while in your squishy confinement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Lillian quietly enjoyed feeling Blaise's tiny body encased by her generous backside and decided to walk all the way to Yamile's house rather than just take a bus. And she took her sweet time at it as well. It took her roughly an hour to reach her destination. Oddly enough, despite having him at a prime location, she chose to spare him from her huge farts for the time being, perhaps because she actually wanted to make good on her previous boast and let him genuinely enjoy her large derriere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven her athletic prowess despite her physique, she didn't work up as much sweat as one would've expected, though she did sweat a bit. Since you slept through most of the 'ride', you failed to notice it. You woke up when you heard what had to be a ringbell, although amplified thousands of times over, yet muffled by thousands or even millions of metric tons of soft booty flesh that still engulfed you. You had no idea what was going to happen next, nor how Yamile would even react to your size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian quickly fished you out of her huge booty and gently blew on you to dry off what little sweat you had on, and patiently waited for the door to be opened, and who came out to answer the door was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>[Note: Here's the link for Yamile's family's description by <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'reborner', '', '', '', '2', '', 'ON', '101063215'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'reborner', '', '', '', '2', '', 'ON'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: reborner\r\nMember Since: November 12th, 2013\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;cursor:pointer;\">Reborner</a></span> <span class=\"noPrint\">(<a title=\"View reborner's Community Recognition\" class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/authors/action/overall/user_id/reborner',%20'CommunityR_101063215',%20'400',%20'650')\">36</a>)</span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/reborner','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/reborner\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'reborner', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Yesterday', 'Yesterday', 'November 12, 2013', '', '', '2', 'Registered User');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-2.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101063215',   'mess101063215_1606215455', '710', '540');  event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101063215/in/1\" target=\"_top\" title=\"Email User: reborner [Offline / Private]\" class=\"imgLink imgPortLink noPrint\"><span style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/mail-off.gif\" width=\"22\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><span class=\"noPrint\"><span id=\"new_ffreborner\"><a class=\"imgLink\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" onclick=\"doAjaxO('ffreborner', '', 'post', 'https://www.Writing.Com/main/my_favorites.php', 'action=fanfav&amp;fav=1&amp;user_id=101063215&amp;nopad=1&amp;new=1&amp;ajax=new_ffreborner');\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Click to add reborner to 'My Favorites'. \r\nClick again to become a 'Fan'. \"><span id=\"ffreborner\" style=\"padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/favplus.gif\" style=\"padding-right:1px;\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></a></span></span>] <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2234425-Giantessshrinking--farts/map/12431\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive...</a> </i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Paths]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yamile, who looked surprised, but nowhere near as much as you would've expected. She smiles as you as Lillian hands you over to her with a giggle and leaves quickly. Now that you were standing on her palm, you had no idea what she was up to, though since you've been friends for a while and have never done anything to earn any ill feelings on her part, you hope that she just helps you out however she can. The way she looks at you, however, doesn't make anything clear to you. Still, it can't be worse than anything Lillian would do, or so you hope...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Chahna, Yamile's eldest sister, answered the door.<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello there. My name is...\" Lillian politely tried to introduce herself but was cut off by her<br>\r\n\"Lillian, I know...\" She replied with a slight smile<br>\r\n\"H-Huh? How do you...?\" She wondered out loud. It was weird for you to see Lillian this surprised, she always seemed confident and looked like she always knew what she was doing. This had to be a first.<br>\r\n\"I read the messages. Yamile's taking a shower, so she asked me to pick up the <b>gift</b> that you were bringing\" She said<br>\r\n\"Uh... well, about that...\" Lillian scratched the back of her head and laughed awkwardly, this was a situation she completely overlooked, but she knew she didn't have any way to cover you to pass off as an actual gift.<br>\r\n\"I know what the little gift is, I told you I read the text messages you sent her...\" Chahna said, still smiling confidently. Lillian was caught like a deer in front of headlights for perhaps the first time you ever recalled. Even without seeing her, the way Yamile's sister spoke made you nervous, and you wondered if it was the rather infamous older sister Yamile herself claimed she'd protect you from. <br>\r\n\"You have him in your hand, don't you?\" Chahna said as she took a single step forward, getting closer to Lillian, who had been standing still.<br>\r\n'If she trusted her enough to let her know about this, I guess it's fine...' She said, though she couldn't say she was entirely sold on handing her best friend to someone she didn't personally know.<br>\r\n\"Relax. I'm just gonna watch over the little boy until Yamile gets out of the shower, that's all\" Chahna said, almost reading Lillian's mind, and she perfectly pulled off the 'cool big sis' aura while hiding her darker intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow, and still not entirely convinced, Lillian decided to hand you over, since she had already come all the way here. You gulped when you were set on her awaiting left palm and looked at her. She definitely resembled her younger sister, but had wilder looking hair and had absolutely massive curves. You couldn't know for sure, but after having experienced Lillian's huge ass at your diminutive size, you thought you had a pretty decent idea on how big things like Jen's chest would look, but it looked like this girl's chest alone was far bigger than hers. And when you looked down, your blood almost froze at the sight of her monstrous hips, much wider than even Lillian's. You could even see from the front a hint that she definitely sported a super massive ass. You prayed that this girl be any of Yamile's sisters other than Chahna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, he's smaller than I thought\" She said as she raised you to her eye level, and you felt that her green eyes pierced your soul as they scanned your entire being.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Lillian replied, still feeling awkward at the whole thing<br>\r\n\"Umm, sorry, I don't think I caught your name...\" She said, and the larger Indian girl enjoyed a hearty chuckle<br>\r\n\"I didn't tell you. Sorry about that. My name's Chahna... I'm Yamile's biggest sister\" She replied and offered her right hand to shake, which Lillian did. You, however, felt like you had petrified and shattered upon hearing the name.<br>\r\n\"Don't you mean oldest?\" Lillian raised an eyebrow, wondering if she mistranslated<br>\r\n\"That too!\" Chahna giggled and resumed looking you over. Snapping out of your panic-induced shock, you tried to shout to Lillian but she discreetly covered your head with her fingertip, making it look like she was petting you.<br>\r\n\"Oh... alright... Well, I have to get going, please tell Yamile I said 'hi' \" Lillian said<br>\r\n\"Sure. Be safe, it's getting late\" Chahna waved<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'll be\" Lillian waved back as she finally left. She reserved her judgement of people until she fully met them, but for now, Chahna seemed like a nice enough big sis like Ariadne was to Blaise, so she felt at ease about leaving him with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour only hope and lifeline walked out of your visual field just like that as you helplessly watched. You gulped harder and felt your heart go up to your throat. Chahna's fingertip stopped covering your face and she brought her palm closer to her face<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, little guy?\" She smiled mischievously in a way that reminded you of Lillian, and that only made you feel worse...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, hey there, Yamile. You got my texts right?\" Lillian said, however, she had no idea that it wasn't Yamile, but her twin sister Fulki. It was getting dark, and Lillian sometimes wasn't the most attentive to detail, so she missed the fact that they had differently colored eyes, though to be fair, the two looked very much alike. Although Yamile had longer hair, but again, that was something Lillian simply overlooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Fulki obviously had no idea what was going on<br>\r\n\"I know, it's hard to believe, but trust me that I wouldn't joke about something like this\" Lillian smiled and opened her palm, showing you to her.<br>\r\n\"Ooh\" Fulki was surprised when she saw you standing on Lillian's palm and playfully poked you, gasping when you tried to push her finger back, which confirmed that you were alive.<br>\r\n\"Blaise looks cute at that size, doesn't he?\" Lillian teased and Fulki nodded. Now you were thrown off, as you realized this girl wasn't Yamile, but she reacted to your name.<br>\r\n\"Well, he's all yours for the weekend, but do bring him back on Monday. Have fun!\" Lillian said and waved goodbye before walking away, leaving Fulki with more questions than answers, and overall confused by the whole thing. She walked back inside and closed the door, still holding you on her open palm. She raised you a bit higher and brought you closer to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi. Sorry about that, my friend mistook you for Yamile...\" You said, apologizing on Lillian's behalf out of force of habit more than anything else.<br>\r\n\"My name is...\" You decided to introduce yourself out of politeness<br>\r\n\"Blaise\" Fulki replied with a smile<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes...\" You stopped in your tracks and scratched your head while laughing awkwardly<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind me asking, when Lillian mentioned my name, it looked like you knew already. Why?\" You asked<br>\r\n\"Because Yamile has talked a lot about you. She said you're a good friend\" She replied with a kind smile, and that reassured you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no warning, she lowered you down to her chest and gave you a massive hug, almost plunging you into her gigantic chest, though her tank top ensured you didn't fall into her immense cleavage. That was rough, but still not a hostile gesture, though it made you slightly nervous that she seemed to be a bit careless, or rather, she seemed to be oblivious. You hoped that you were safe enough with her until Yamile arrived. But there was no way to know what Fulki herself was up to.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Note: Yamile went grocery shopping and will definitely take a whole to arrive, though because of Lillian's text, she knows what's up, although she has no idea Fulki has you.]<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Good morning!\" Lillian exclaimed in an exaggeratedly cheerful way as she almost slammed the door open and walked in. You'd have been surprised if this weren't a pretty common occurrence in your life. Given your mom's and hers long friendship, she's considered practically family as far as your parents and sister are concerned, and the same goes for her mom to you. Still, you are always slightly surprised because you never know when she'll do this or what she plans to do now that she's here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" You calmly wave at her, sort of countering her high energy with your straight-faced attempted calm state<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" You ask, wondering what she had in mind, but she knew you too well and smiled mischievously<br>\r\n\"Do I even need a reason to come see my best friend who also happens to be my neighbor?\" She asked with a smug/teasing tone, and as she walked past you she made sure to brush the side of your face with her butt, giggling quietly. She went to the fridge and grabbed five large bean burritos to put in the microwave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised an eyebrow, still not quite sure why everyone else treated it as a normal thing, but again, Sheila had told you countless times that in the rare event your house had no food left, you were free and welcome to help yourself in her kitchen. So, technically it was a fair thing. In any case, you weren't all that fond of burritos, and preferred other dishes, or your mom's homemade food, so, it'd either be up to her, Lillian, Sheila or Ariadne to eat those. Or Arianna, the few times she's come visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were having an inner monologue following your own train of thought, the microwave beeped, and she happily took her dish out to have breakfast alongside you.  You looked at the plate and noticed the five large burritos, raising an eyebrow again<br>\r\n\"Huh, I thought you only ate three of those for a meal\" You said<br>\r\n\"Usually you'd be correct. But I feel hungrier today\" She nonchalantly explained as she eagerly bit into one of them. It was amazing in its own way that she could eat much more than you at roughly the same speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ate your breakfast as normally as it gets, but in that time Lillian could easily devour three times as much. You two mostly ate in silence just for the sake of not choking on your food, and because you'd seemingly have plenty of time to talk after you were done, which again, was a fairly common thing in your life. Your mom joked that Lillian practically lived here, and Ariadne has teased that becoming your wife would be the easiest and most natural transition ever. You blush yet shudder at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you're both done with your meals, and she looked at you with a cryptic smile<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" You asked<br>\r\n\"I'm amazed at how easily I can read you like a book... is it because you're easy to figure out, or just because we've been friends for so long?\" She replied, further confusing you<br>\r\n\"Eh, I'd say it's the second option, I don't get that from other people, at least, not from people outside of family, or you...\" You said, scratching your head <br>\r\n\"Anyway, why did that even come up?\"<br>\r\n\"Because I'm 95% sure right now you have no idea what day is today, you probably were going to look at your phone when I got here\" She said and you slowly nodded<br>\r\n<i>'Have I really become that predictable?'</i> You thought<br>\r\n\"To me, yes. Besides, you've never been much of a morning person\" Lillian laughed, and your eyes widened at how easily she almost even read your mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then stood up and walked towards you swaying her hips as she did. You knew she was going to do something, but unlike you, she was too unpredictable, and you had no idea what it could possibly be. Despite her size and weight, she walks surprisingly fast when she wants to, and before you can even process the thought, she turns around and backs up into your face, easily engulfing it in her huge butt. No matter how many times she's already done this, it never fails to instantly arouse you, but it also makes you nervous. She presses onto you, wedging your face as deep as it could go, and right after that she lets out a massive 10 second long fart that shook you and the chair you sat on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian burst out laughing as she got off your face and you gagged<br>\r\n\"I've been holding that in since I woke up\" She laughed while you fanned the smelly fumes away from your face. Fortunately for you, it was far from the worst smell she's given you. You shot her an annoyed glare.<br>\r\n\"Aww... you know I only do these things to you...\" She said<br>\r\n\"I even had the decency to wait until you were done eating\" She laughed, and you just sighed, reluctantly acknowledging that point. She then smiled and grabbed both of your hands, putting them on her enormous cheeks. Even if you tried using them both you wouldn't be able to cup even one of her cheeks, and you had big hands. Lillian used your hands to give her big, squishy butt several squeezes, and also made them caress it for a few seconds. After that she shoved your right hand right into her crack, albeit through her clothes, but still, the two large soft masses engulfed it and you could feel their warmth, though you weren't quite as thrilled as you knew the origin of most of it right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian pulled it out after about half a minute and sat down on your lap, almost engulfing it in the process. She ground against your groin as she seemingly got comfortable, and with that done, she wrapped her right arm around your neck and brought your face close to her chest<br>\r\n\"Even if you get mad and gag, I know you don't mind my farts nearly as much as you'd like me to think\" She suddenly said, catching you off-guard, and to emphasize her point she pressed more of her weight on you, feeling a certain part of your anatomy become nestled between her largest pair of assets. That alone left you too stunned to retort, and further adding to that, she unleashed another big fart upon you, making you feel your groin vibrate under her. You sigh in resignation, as she always pulled something along these lines whenever she came to see you. She only showed a bit of restraint in Arianna's presence, and perhaps a tiny bit in Jen's. Getting back to the previous topic, you realize you still have no idea what day it is today, and what Lillian came here for, if she even had a reason... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, do you have any plans for today?\" You finally ask Lillian and she giggles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Paths]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's Saturday, and the first day of Summer Vacation, duh...\" Lillian cheekily replied, sticking her tongue out at you at your apparent stupidity<br>\r\n\"And that means...?\" You ask, still having no idea what she's up to<br>\r\n\"I want to go buy some new bikinis, all of the previous ones snapped already... hmm... I should probably buy new lingerie too... You know most thongs can't handle an ass this big\" She said, teasingly smacking her butt at that remark<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay, have fun...?\" You said feeling slightly awkward at the given info<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh. No have fun's. You're coming with me\" She replied in a surprisingly dominant tone<br>\r\n\"Huh? Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n\"You heard me...\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... don't girls usually do that with friends?\"<br>\r\n\"Exactly\" She stared at you with a deadpan look<br>\r\n\"I mean <u><i><b>female</b></i></u> friends\" You replied with the same deadpan look<br>\r\n\"Nah, girls' opinions on bikinis or lingerie are worthless to me\" Lillian shrugged <br>\r\n\"Maybe I'd listen to some recommendations for everyday wear, or dresses... But for these things <b><i>I need a man's opinion</i></b>\" She said in a flirty/alluring tone you didn't even know she was capable of. And with that, she dragged you by the arm to go shopping with her...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's Sunday, and we're on Summer Vacation, duh...\"<br>\r\n\"Yay?\" You said with little enthusiasm given the occasion<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I don't have any specific plans either, so I came to hang out with you. You know, we could watch stuff on Netflix, play videogames or whatever...\" She shrugged.<br>\r\nThat wasn't such a bad plan in your books, though, considering what she just ate, you knew you'd be in for quite the ride if you stuck around with her. And with no one else around, you can expect her to ramp up the teasing a lot more, though, will you two really be by yourselves all day?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I actually came to tell you that <i>someone</i> wants to see you...\" Lillian said in an usual cryptic way<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You tilt your head, slightly surprised<br>\r\n\"Who?\" You ask</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>[Options]</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>- \"Jen\" Lillian smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- \"My mom. I dunno why, but she wanted to see you asap\" She shrugged<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- \"Lulu... She asked me to tell you and to give you the directions to her house... Beats me why\" She said and sent to your phone the GPS info to get there. She smiled in the same way she did before messing with you.</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's Friday you dummy\" She flicked your forehead<br>\r\n\"So...?\" You asked, unsure on what exactly it meant<br>\r\n\"We still have to go to school even if it's the last day\" She gave you a deadpan look and you sighed, nodding in agreement<br>\r\n\"Uh, alright...\" You say, only to realize that you can't stand up since Lillian's sitting on you.<br>\r\n\"Do you mind?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah I do\" Lillian chuckled and bounced on you, making you struggle both with having a little wind knocked out of you, and with the increased arousal from feeling her huge, soft and squishy butt on your lap. You'd have to wait until she decided to get off you before you could grab your stuff. It was still fairly early, and school wasn't even that far. Hell, Lillian could probably drive you herself there, or her mom, as she works there too</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lillian easily dragged you by the arm and you two went outside, she had already grabbed her mom's car keys before she came to visit you.<br>\r\n\"Do I really have to come?\" You asked, still not quite on board with her plan, though you were already sitting at the copilot's seat<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I already told you why\" Lillian replied and instead of getting into the driver's seat, she went and sat on your lap again<br>\r\n\"It'll be worth it, I promise\" She whispered suggestively into your ear and got off you but not before a generous dose of grinding on you, and a teasing smack to her big butt, making it jiggle even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drove to the mall, and because of vacation time traffic, it took longer than it should, but not too much, and in about half an hour you arrived. She walked with you next to her and one of your arms wrapped around her waist, making it look like you were a couple, though the people that actually knew you knew it was just one more of Lillian's usual antics. Unknown to you, this was also one of her ways to ward off competition or to keep people like Celeste and Emily away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take too long to reach the store, it had both lingerie, various other types of underwear, and of course, what Lillian came for, bikinis. She pretty much ignored most other types of swimwear and headed straight for the thong section. Before you could look around to find a place to sit, she wrapped her arm around your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where you come in... I want you to pick a bikini thong for me\" She said softly while leaning her head close to your ear, but not whispering. You instantly blushed and gulped hard. Smiling, she grabbed a nearby thong.<br>\r\n\"Any that you choose will go straight into this big ass I know you love\" She said and held it in front of said butt, showing how puny it looked compared to her. She laughed and nonchalantly put it back.<br>\r\n\"I think I have a pretty good idea on some that I'll pick, but I definitely want your input, and I'll try the one you pick for me first\" She added and headed for the changing room, grabbing a few thongs along the way, making sure to sway her hips as much as she could get away with and to make her enormous cheeks jiggle for all they were worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know a whole lot about underwear, and knowing Lillian, that was probably the whole point, she said she wanted <i>a man's opinion</i>, and to be more accurate, she wanted <u><i>your</i></u> opinion. Even though this kind of request was far from being the first she asked of you, it never failed to make you flustered and nervous. Still, even without that, it was a pretty difficult task. You knew Lillian had to be wearing heavily undersized underwear and bikinis because she seldom set foot in the plus size section despite her height, weight and the size of her curves. But unlike her you had no idea what would be those clothes' limits, and how far they could be pushed, and you worried a lot about giving her clothes that would snap trying to contain her humongous' assets' sheer mass and getting in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured the plus size section probably had fewer choices, and simpler, plain designs that might be too bland for her, but still, you decided that'd be the safest bet. Besides, she'd take it as a compliment that you thought her butt too big for whatever, and it was no secret she wanted it to get even bigger, which is why she ate the way she did. Even Sheila joked that with that appetite and diet, Lillian would probably surpass her by the time she was her age. And given how massive she was, that made you shudder. You weren't sure if you could ever handle Lillian at such a size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first assumptions seemed to be right, though there were some bikinis that were legit just bigger versions of the ones in the ordinary sizes section. Ignoring the awkwardness of being a guy alone looking through bikinis in a store full of women (though you'd guess there'd be some disgruntled husbands/boyfriends around, although you saw none so far) , you find that even these don't seem to be big or durable enough to handle Lillian's booty. Funnily enough, you had even dropped looks out of the equation, because you were just focusing on giving her something that wouldn't snap, which has happened before, although she laughed off every single such incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were baffled that none of the thongs you could find seemed capable of withstanding Lillian's butt, and that made you wonder how other women you knew got their underwear. Jen's butt was pretty big, but it's likely she'd either get the upper \"normal sizes\" or she was covered within the plus size spectrum. How the likes of Sheila, Ms. McAllen or Arianna got their underwear or bikinis was anybody's guess. Sighing in frustration, you turn to a section that has stretchy ones, guessing that these should at least be strong enough. Although, many of these still look rather flimsy with you until you find a single skimpy red thong that looked pretty small, even for non plus-size derrieres, but it was advertised as extremely stretchy, super durable and capable of fitting any size. It looked like it was a new product. Still feeling like you're making a tough gamble, you decide to choose this one and bring it to her, wondering what her reaction will be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk to the changing room and since there's only one pair of feet to be seen, you guess that's Lillian's cubicle.<br>\r\n\"Did you find anything nice and sexy?\" Lillian asked with a laugh<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm only betting on the 'nice' part...\" You replied scratching your head<br>\r\n\"You underestimate my power! Even if it isn't, I'll make it look sexy\" She giggled. You couldn't help but quietly nod at that claim.<br>\r\n\"W-Well, how about you get out to grab these?\" You asked and she enjoyed a hearty laugh for a couple of seconds<br>\r\n\"Nice try. But I'm not wearing anything below my waist right now...\" She casually said and you felt your heart skip a few beats<br>\r\n\"Just slide it under the door, the gap's pretty big\" She added and made you gulp hard.<br>\r\n\"I'd say no peeking, but it's not even necessary, I'll let you have a <i>very thorough</i> look once I step out...\" She teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a step towards Lillian's cubicle and the entire world shifted as far as you were concerned. You felt incredibly dizzy and lost your balance, tumbling forward. You felt the entire room shift, but your senses were all in utter chaos and disarray, and adding to that, you felt your body quickly heat up to an incredible level, and a weird indescribable feeling as your body contracted into itself, a process that escaped your comprehension, but it felt tremendously painful, as if your entire being was getting squeezed and molded into a much smaller frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world went dark as your diminutive 1/10 inch tall body disappeared inside the stretchy red thong you were carrying moments ago. With your fall's momentum, that thong easily slid across the tiled floor and into Lillian's cubicle. You finally hit the floor with a thud that resonated across your entire body, and even though you didn't feel anything break, you got heavily stunned by that impact. It took you several seconds just to be able to regain your bearings and look around. You immediately freaked out when you found yourself laying on a giant piece of cloth, its color and material instantly giving away what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even try to stand up, the ground shakes once and an enormous shadow covers you. Lillian stood in front of you, and as per her claim, she wasn't wearing anything below her waist, but that wasn't the main issue here. She was utterly massive! Like a walking mountain, her toes alone were building sized to you, and you couldn't even begin to imagine how big and heavy her legs were, specially her thighs. She looked down at you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I underestimated your taste\" She said and excitedly picked the thong up<br>\r\n\"Where did you find this?\" She asked<br>\r\n\"W-Wait, Lillian!\" You shouted and waved, although the store's music easily drowned out any noise you made<br>\r\n\"It looks perfect... but, I think it's too small... do you really think my booty's that small?\" She asked in a teasing manner<br>\r\n\"Lillian!\" You shouted again to no avail<br>\r\n\"Hmm? It feels stretchy... Oh, I get it, it's one of those new one-size-fits-all ones, huh? I think the people that made this never saw an ass as big and juicy as mine though\" She boastfully laughed \"Anyway, you picked these out for me, so I'll try them on... I bet you're gonna <u><i>love</i></u> how it looks on me\" She giggled again as she lowered it to her waist level and tried to compare it with herself. Just one of her thighs seemed too thick for it by itself, but then again, that thing was advertised as super-stretchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought them around her waist and you were presented with the view that you dreaded the most, her gigantic butt. Her cheeks were planetoids in their own right, as far as you were concerned, so your previous classification of her as a living mountain was grossly inaccurate, and that only made you gulp harder. She seemed to be gauging how it'd fit her massive ass, and you hoped she'd ditch it, but after what she said, that hope flew right out the window. She then carefully set them on the floor and stepped into the leg holes to slide them up her incredibly thick thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Paths]</i><br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>By what statistically has to be nothing short of a miracle, Lillian looked down at her thong and gasped, spotting something off about it, and with a little more focus, she noticed your tiny struggles. She smiles at you in a way that made you shudder...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She happily starts to pull the thong up, and it's already struggling to fit her titanic thighs. Still, being as stubborn and persistent as she's always been, she stretches them more and slowly pulls them up, unknowingly carrying you as a stowaway. Soon, she managed to get it past her thighs and reached the thong's ultimate challenge, her monstrous booty. You were about to get a whole lot closer to Lillian's most prized assets...<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n-----------------</span></div></div>",

You know, we could watch stuff on Netflix, play videogames or whatever...\" She shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it for a moment. You definitely had no actual plans for the day, and it'd be fairly boring to just do stuff by yourself in your house, but then again, you knew she would be <i>loaded</i> for the day. But on the other hand, what she suggested was stuff you were going to do anyway, and it was better with company. Being your best friend and having spent time together for so long, she was arguably the person that knew you the best not counting your mom, and even Ariadne would face tough competition from her if they were to be compared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was definitely fun to be around, but you weren't so keen on having to suffer through the results of those burritos all day. Coupled with that, with you two alone in your house, she'll probably crank up her endless teasing with her huge ass up to eleven, which wouldn't be such a bad thing if it weren't for her gas. Coming to think of it, maybe you would've asked her out ages ago if it weren't for her farts, which would mean your mom's and Ariadne's claims about her being the right one for you would be true. Then again, maybe you'd be in a similar situation to your current one, with even higher stakes, as your friendship has run for far longer than Jen's. You quickly dismiss those thoughts, although you blush at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then are suddenly hit by a realization: As you just finished your sophomore year, that means you only have one more year of high school left. Potentially, that means this might be the last year you two get to spend time together like this on a regular basis. It's a common fact of life that friends drift apart upon choosing a college or university, but you hadn't really considered the idea that it was going to happen to you too until now. You got hit hard by a feeling of emptiness, a sense of future loss. All the times and fun you've had with your friends, but specially with Lillian, you've taken for granted for most of your life. It's only now that you stopped to think about it, and wonder if one day, these would become a distant memory, one that you'd even yearn for in later years. The emptiness in your heart feels almost real, like a miniature black hole appeared in it. However, you decide not to let that overcome you and ruin your day. You knew that it made no sense to get sad about things that haven't happened yet, or may not even happen. Who knows, if you two choose a local college or university, then things shouldn't change too much. Whatever happens in the future will be a bridge you'll have to cross then anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I guess this is the best thing I can do right now...'</i> You thought. Spending some more quality time with your best friends, quirks or not, feels like it's the best thing to do to at least avoid having future regrets, even though you may regret your choice short-term.<br>\r\n\"Well, that sounds like a solid plan to me\" You chuckled, and you saw her smile, just like always. However, before that, she looked at you, and you wondered for a moment if she caught your darker feeling moments ago. She was incredibly intuitive when it came to you, and she always boasted about being able to read you like a book, You hoped that for once she didn't pick up on that.<br>\r\n\"So, what is it gonna be?\" She asked, and you sighed on relief, it seems she missed your darker inner monologue from earlier<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Note: I know that the Netflix and Videogames choices may seem too similar and be pointless, but they both can open slightly different options, so I decided to separate them]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Paths]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You decide to watch Netflix together, which pretty much means cuddling, as Lillian loves to hug you while she watches, or have you lay on her lap, and against her belly.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feeling the need to chill out and soothe your mind, you don't feel like gaming at least for now.<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I feel like watching stuff for now\" You said, hoping that Lillian didn't catch on earlier.<br>\r\n\"Sounds fine by me\" She shrugged<br>\r\nYou then booted up Netflix on your tv and started browsing.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're watching that too?\" She suddenly said, seeing on the screen that there was an anime series you hadn't finished.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I kinda forgot about it, these last weeks were intense with the finals and whatnot\" You replied<br>\r\n\"I'm only like two episodes ahead, I don't mind re-watching them so you can catch up\" She chuckled<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" You then start playing from the last episode you had seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even 10 minutes in and she already wrapped her left arm around your neck and pulled you closer, your right side pressed into part of her chest and belly, which were so soft they simply squished into you, and that sent wild shivers down your spine. Most people would never imagine that someone who seemed so assertive and carefree had a certain fondness for hugging and cuddling, though you also knew that perhaps she took this fondness for physical contact to extremes only you knew about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, you didn't even realize that she pulled you more and more to her, lowering your upper body until your head was resting on her lap and against her belly. Its sounds were what snapped you from being lost in the anime. Surprisingly enough, it wasn't gurgling angrily like it usually did right before she unleashed a storm upon you. Instead, its sounds were rather peaceful sounding, just churning and processing the food in it. You raised an eyebrow, there was no way all those burritos wouldn't come back to haunt you later. The softness and warmth from her thighs beneath your neck and her belly pressed against the back of your head lull you away from those worries. Her softly caressing your hair seals the deal for you, and you just keep on watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime flies for you two, several episodes mean a couple hours have passed, and Lillian eventually has to get up, letting you sit like a normal person for the first time in a while. She went to the kitchen and brought more snacks, like popcorn and nachos. You would've been surprised if this weren't Lillian you were dealing with, even after wolfing down enough food for 3 people, she still had room for snacks. You were still full after your breakfast, which meant that these snacks, again, enough for 3 people, maybe 2 hungry ones, were all for herself yet again. At least your mom never seemed to mind how much food Lillian could consume during her regular visits, and in fact, she only encouraged her. Your father's theory that your mom was basically an adult version of her actually made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're roughly snapped out of your thoughts, however, as you feel a large weight upon your lap, and lots of warm, squishy pillowy material all over it. Lillian had just sat on your lap, pretty much engulfing it. You then hear her giggling.<br>\r\n\"I had you resting against me for a bit, it's only fair enough I get to do the same\" she said and playfully ground on you, getting more comfortable, and either unintentionally or not, wedging \"little you\" between her huge buns. You immediately struggle against the sudden and intense arousal from feeling a woman's flesh on such an intimate part of your own body, but that only intensifies it. You pray that her sheer weight can keep it pressed down so as not to notice it. Her insistence on wiggling her hips on top of you and pressing down with her full weight, as well as her continuous giggling, tells you she probably did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the anime proved to be an exercise in futility with Lillian pretty much giving you an assjob, even the most interesting thing in the world would become white noise as you tried to fight the sensory overload you were experiencing. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, she rips a massive 10-second long fart on your lap, which makes you feel your entire skeleton vibrate, specially the parts that were under her. Shortly after, the smell hit you, it definitely reeked of the beans from the burritos. You were speechless to such a degree you didn't even gag at first, which made her giggle even more. She then blasted a similarly long and loud one before she sat up, and just as she did, with her large butt in front of your face, she let out a third rumbling thunderous blast, intense enough to blow back your hair somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lillian!\" You complained<br>\r\n\"Whoops, those breakfast burritos kicked in earlier than I thought\" She laughed trying to appear innocent, but it was obvious that it was fake<br>\r\n\"Could you please let them out in the bathroom and, you know, not on me?\" You almost begged<br>\r\n\"Sure thing... but you probably won't want to use it until it airs out\" She gave a smug laugh as she walked towards it. Even after ripping those tremendous blasts, you couldn't help but stare at her enormous cheeks sway and jiggle exaggeratedly as she walked. You sigh in relief, but as you were in what was pretty much a cloud of her farts, you immediately coughed and gagged. And that was a mild reaction, as you knew she had been able to straight out knock people out cold with those. Still, you suddenly feel dizzy in an unusual way and before you can even shout to Lillian for help, you collapse. Unknowingly to you, your body contracted into itself and became smaller, much smaller than you'd ever have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unknown amount of time later, you woke up and felt like you were on drugs, the landscape looked unreal. Once you regained your eyes' focus, you noticed in the distance your TV and other things from your living room, but they were so enormous and so far away they looked rather blurry to you. Your eyes widened and you panicked as you looked down. You definitely were on your couch, but at an absurdly tiny size. Roughly 1/20th of an inch, give or take. Being trapped in a living room at that size was bad enough, but it was even worse considering that sans you, this house was pretty much all inhabited or visited by large women with larger butts, and in fact you were already trapped with one of the largest ones at that. You began hyperventilating, and soon, you heard the bathroom door open, albeit in a much more ominous and booming way, and titanic but rhythmic earthquakes followed before your entire world got covered in shadows. You looked up, Lillian looked bigger than ever, more like a celestial body than anything else. She swiftly turned around, with speed and grace that something that huge and heavy (to you) had no right to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer humongous backside was made up of twin jiggling, blubbery and fleshy planets, so enormous that you even wondered if they were closer to Jupiter's size than Earth's in your scale. And, giving no warning, they began to lower themselves down, and right over the cushion you were on. You trembled as the shadows around you got darker and darker, and even could hear the ominous sounds of two hyper-massive objects descending from the skies. You were absolutely screwed. The couch cushion you were alone might as well been continent or planet sized to you, and you'd need to be able to run all that distance for a chance to be spared, but that wasn't even guaranteed as you knew she easily took up more than an entire couch cushion when she sat down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Paths]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lillian simply sat down on the couch, not seeing you but guessing you went to wash your face or get something to help you rid of her smell, or even go for a gasmask you sometimes wore to \"exaggerate\" how bad her farts were. Going to the bathroom to get her gas out was a futile activity in itself, as she knew once she started blasting, she'd keep on until her body ran out of gas, and with the food she ate, and was still eating, that wouldn't happen anytime soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, she sat down on the couch unaware that her best friend was incredibly small. You could be trapped under her cosmic chasm-sized crack, or be pinned by the millions or maybe even billions of metric tons of soft blubbery flesh from one of her cheeks. And thinking that you were away, she'd take her chance to try and get most of her gas out...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Unknown to you, Lillian actually knew exactly what had happened, how small you had become and where you were, but instead of letting you know that, she decided she'd \"play unaware\" first with you, struggling to keep her giggling quiet. She was going to make you experience her gigantic ass like never before, and she had plenty of ideas to try, but the first one on her list was to make you her little personal <b>\"asstronaut\"</b>. Her massive booty was effectively a pair of vast planets in comparison to you, and she wanted you to thoroughly explore them, and extensively experience what it had to offer, its many noises and smells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo get started, she nonchalantly walked to the couch and sat down, looking like she had no idea about your location, but actually, and with almost surgical precision, creating a cataclysmic shockwave in your scale that sent you flying straight into her butt. However, despite her great calculations, she missed her goal by a bit, and instead of plunging you into the seemingly bottomless abyss of her crack, you flew straight into the marshmallow-like surface of one of her jiggling cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Eh, close enough...' Lillian thought and smiled mischievously, even if it wasn't exactly what she aimed for, she giggled quietly and decided she'd tease you with everything she got. She would sway her hips and make her cheeks bounce and clap. Most importantly (to her), even though you were on her cheek and technically outside her \"line of fire\", you'd still feel hurricane winds and literal <b>bootyquakes</b> whenever she farted, and she had become curious about what that'd be like... So, you're in for a very long afternoon...</i></span></div></div>",

There was a moderate amount of people, but not enough to consider that the place was crowded. Soon enough they saw Ms. McAllen, idly waiting while looking at her phone. <br>\r\n\"Hello. I hope we didn't make you wait for too long\" You decided to greet her first,<br>\r\n\"Hello there. Not at all. You didn't take all that long to arrive considering the distance\" She said with a smile, though that smile started to fade when she saw he didn't come alone.

Sorry, I didn't mention it, but I wasn't alone when you called and felt bad about leaving her out, so I brought her\"  You apologized while scratching your head.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that you little sweetheart. That's perfectly fine! In fact I wanted to bring more students, but they all stood me up for some reason...\" She said with a sigh \"And many needed the extra credit too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the museum wasn't entirely unknown to you, it had been a while since you last visited it, so you looked at the nearby posters out of pure curiosity. The art exhibits were actually pretty diverse, and there were also history, biology, astronomy and other interesting things. As you checked the info, unknown to you, Lillian and Lulu had a quick nonverbal conversation. Being friends with the quirky Art teacher, Lillian was 95% sure that Ms. Lulu had intended to lure in Blaise alone. Likewise, Ms. Lulu knew she got the 2nd best possible outcome, as she had an ally to make things easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad you brought Jen instead, even though she tolerated her antics, Lulu could tell that if things escalated she could get fiercely protective of you, though so far, she had appeared to \"fly under her radar\" by virtue of her age, and that she probably didn't believe she did nothing more than joke around a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that silent exchange...</span></div></div>",

The shock you feel from the sight is large, but its size is nothing compare to Lillian, who was face down in the ground, unconscious, and was far larger than the trees that tower over you. Your body could reach the height of her ankle and she was in her underwear like you, a pair of blue silk bra and panties/thong thanks to her huge ass. Just as you finished observing her, Lillian wakes up with a groan and sits up right.<br>\r\n\"My head... What the hell hap- Blaise!? Is that you?!\" Lillian shouts before noticing you covering your ears and apologies for it.<br>\r\nYou weren't the only one to hear Lillian's fart, as you could hear multiple giant footsteps walking over to your location. Coming down the beach were Jen in grey cotton pair of underwear; Celeste in black sports bra and white boxers; Yamile in a fluttery pink underwear; Ms. McAllen in a very skimpy black bra and thong; Ariadne in white polka-dotted sport bra and boxers; Veronica in some light green lace underwear; and finally, Arianna in a black garter belt fitted with thong and bra.<br>\r\n\"Lillian and... Blaise!? What is going on here?\" Your first cousin asks, unable to hide the shock as well as everyone else joining her in the same state.<br>\r\n\"Hey, you guys got dragged here too?\" \"Yeah, I was cleaning my room when the room shook and I backed out,\" Jen replies, all the girls nodding in agreement as the same thing happened to them as well.<br>\r\n\"Well, I found a weird sign, talking about a fetish harem game? Looking at you guys, I understand the giant part, but the &lt;Farting (no scat)&gt; part? Anyways, Lillian found an app and after that, here we are,\" you said, Lillian sheepishly chuckling as Arianna glares at her.<br>\r\n\"What are you eating, Celeste?\" Ariadne asks, Celeste holding something between her hands as her cheeks bulge from it before she gulps it down.<br>\r\nWhat seemed to a massive boar, the part where Celeste bitten off, was revealed to be the inner workings of a burrito.<br>\r\n\"I found it near a lake of white liquid and it came from a chili swamp, I think?\" Celeste confesses before taking another bite.<br>\r\n\"Okay, before things get too heated, how about we focus on what needs to be done? I'll focus on the building a place for us and Ariadne? Can you take care of exploring this... place? Meanwhile, Arianna can get help,\" Lulu steps in, and the principal calms down to agree with the art teacher.<br>\r\n\"Alright, we'll do that. Once we know what's going on, we can figure out what this harem game is and how to get out of it, agreed?\" Arianna says in a tired tone and everyone replies readily.<br>\r\nThe group splits into three groups: Ariadne leading Lillian and Celeste; Lulu with Veronica and Yamile; and Arianna with Jen.

The other teams have left already, maybe one of us should hold on to you for safe keeping.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll hold on to him,\" Yamile said.<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I'm sure we'd all like to watch over Blaise.\" Lulu stated.<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Veronica said quietly with her face flush red as she looked down at the ground. It was obvious she was still embarrassed after she had asked you out one hundred percent confident that you had a fart fetish.<br>\r\n\"Well draw straws... I mean trees, whoever has the shortest tree wins,\" Lulu said completely forgetting you could choose for yourself. She grabbed 3 trees, making sure one of them was smaller than the others. When she was done she held them in her fist so that they couldn't tell which one was the shortest and had them pick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl who got the winning tree was...</span></div></div>",

It was one of the seldom times neither Lillian or Jen were by your side. She had walked up to you with confidence and a smile. \"Hey Blaise,\" She said trying to sound sexy.<br>\r\n\"Hi, Veronica right, were in the same PE class,\" you said casually.<br>\r\n\"That's right, well I got a question for you,\"<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n\"Would you like to go out with me? There's this nice restaurant by-\"<br>\r\n\"Hold up,\" you said as you were caught off guard, \"this is like the second time I've talked to you, why do you want to go out with me?\"<br>\r\n\"Well I saw the way your Brazilian friend likes to great you and I figured if you like gassy girls why not go out with the undisputed fart queen.\" She said. You were about to say something but then she looked you right in the eyes and let loose the absolute worst fart you had ever smelled. It put all of Lillian's to shame with its stench alone and her butt was facing away from you. You looked at her in disgust as she continued to release her long putrid fart. As she looked into your eyes she realized what was happening. Her face became one of total fear, then her cheeks grew red with embarrassment. She ran away from you before you could say another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Back in the present Veronica was blushing like mad. \"Listen, about last week,\" Veronica began to apologize.<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" you said taking her by surprise. \"I wasn't trying to be rude to you or anything, and I didn't mean to make you feel bad. I'm not into farts but we can still be friends.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I'd like that, and I'm sorry for what I did too,\" Veronica said looking a little more relaxed. \"Now on to the issue at hand, I'm going to need both hands to collect tree's and as you can see I don't really have pockets. I'm not comfortable with keeping you in my bra and I'm definitely not keeping you by my pussy.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" you said realising your fate.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I promise I'll try to hold in my gas,\" Veronica said as she pulled back her lace green panties and dropped you down her enormous ass.</span></div></div>",

She smiled enjoying the feeling of a tiny boy in her powerful butt and thinking the smell would be better the further he was from her asshole. She could already feel gas building up inside her bowels like it always was, but she was determined to hold it in. She did not want to fart on her new friend, although the new thought of ripping ass on a miniscule man did turn her on a bit. Veronica bent down to start collecting trees, not thinking about how the movement would affect her passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were almost enjoying it in Veronica's butt. The smell wasn't too bad and her butt cheeks were soft yet firm. Then the two mountains that were her ass cheeks parted beneath you. You fell down the center of her butt crack on a direct path towards her massive anus. It was like sky diving without a parachute, and the smell got worse as you went down. You slammed into her butthole at terminal velocity and to your amazement none of your bones were broken, despite the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Veronica jumped in surprise as she felt Blaise slam into her asshole, then calmed down as she realized what happened. She bent back down, spreading her cheeks to make sure he could hear her. \"Uhh Blaise, could you climb away from there, it's going to be a danger zone pretty soon,\" she warned. She felt his tiny hands grab on to the skin of her anus. Her face turned red and she couldn't help but smile a little. Something was awaking in Veronica, this was a whole new world to her and she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were trying to climb up Veronica's asshole, it was like a giant, warm, rubbery, and greasy rock climbing wall. Her anus was at least twice your size, and you were in the center of it. The smell was atrocious, like a landfill filled with rotten eggs. You made your way to the top of her butthole and looked up at the mountainous climb ahead of you. There were no wrinkles going up Veronica's crack, once you got out of her butthole there would be nothing to hold on to. Nevertheless you had to try you grabbed a first full of Veronica's skin, then pulled yourself up to grab another with your free hand, repeating the process as you went up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Veronica could feel Blaise climbing up her butt crack, he felt like an itch as he kept grabbing miniscule handfuls of her skin. Still this turned her on even more, she was so large and powerful that this man was nothing more than a itch to her. She continued grabbing trees and tying them together focusing more her tiny passenger. She new Blaise didn't have a fart fetish but she did, and she really wanted to break wind on him, but she didn't as she had made him a promise. She felt more Gas building up, it began to push at her backdoor begging to be released, she clenched her sphincter to stop it from escaping. After a few minutes Veronica felt the need to release pass away and she relaxed again. She could feel Blaise at (what was to her) an inch away from her butthole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hours later you were still climbing up Veronica's ass crack. There were multiple times where you thought you were going to have to start over due to her sweat or your own exhaustion, but against all odds you powered through. You could hear the rumbling noises of her bowels and knew she had a lot of pent up gas, you were thankful that she was keeping her promise. You climbed out of her ass crack and rested on her butt cheek. Exhausted from your climb you wanted nothing more than to just fall asleep there on Veronica's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Girls had just finished setting up shelter and Mrs. McAllen had gone back to the meeting spot to wait and tell the others of the canyon when they showed up. Veronica and Yamile were clearing the canyon of any rock or debris when Veronica felt Blaise exit her Butt crack. She was a little disappointed at first and then she had an idea to get him back in. She bent over and felt her hours worth of gas struggling to escape her sphincter, she clenched it again to keep her fart in. She focused on feeling Blaise resting on her butt before giving her butt a very slight wiggle and feeling him tumble all the way back down. As he slammed into her asshole once more Veronica felt a rush of power, she just took away any hope you had of having a break with a slight movement of her hips. Then Veronica had another idea, now was the perfect time to fart on Blaise and play it off as an accident. The thought of her asshole letting loose a hurricane of her butt fumes was extremely enticing to her, then again she did promise.</span></div></div>",

However she had to make sure Blaise thought it was an accident. She brought herself low to the ground and raised her butt in the air, pretending she was investigating something. She felt the pressure building in her ass again, now more intense than ever. \"Uhh, Blaise, you climbed out right?\" Veronica said pretending not to know your location as she gave herself a wedgie. She smiled as she felt him squirming like mad against her asshole. \"Oh no,\" she said pretending to be concerned, \"well I'm sorry about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were paralyzed in fear by Veronica's words. Her anus twitched and throbbed as if warming up for her fart, wrapping around your face pulling you in just to spit you back out. Before you could register what happened her asshole began letting out a hurricane of gas. It started quietly but quickly became loud and bubbly. The nuclear winds of methane threw you against the back of her panties, which thanks to her oblivious positioning kept you pinned to her asshole. The smell was rancid like sewage leak right under your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Veronica was ecstatic, as far as she was concerned this was the hottest thing ever. Double checking that Yamile wasn't around, she slipped her fingers down the front of her panties and started stimulating her wet pussy. Her fart was still going on and it had already been ten seconds. She could feel Blaise, completely immobilized by her methane monster. An every day bodily function of hers was enough to subdue him and she loved, it was hard not to moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twenty seconds in and you were still at the mercy of Veronica's butthole. She had been holding her gas in all day and it showed. You were pretty sure that you would never smell the same again. It sounded like multiple explosions going off at once. It was a never ending wave of warm, stinky ass gas being blasted right on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a030 seconds in to Veronica's massive butt blast and she was loving every second. She was biting her lip as she fingered herself. She loved the feeling of power from being huge, it was a new fetish for her but a welcome one. She was already close to orgasming and she had just started. She started to moan as she fingered herself and farted on her tiny classmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A minute in and you were still at the mercy of her never-ending butt breeze. At this point you wished she had farted through out the day, at least they wouldn't be so long. There was zero sign of her fart dying out, you were certain Veronica had a medical problem if her farts were this long. The only reason you haven't passed out was that you had grown up with Lillian farting in your face every day. You didn't know how long this fart could go on for but you were hoping it would end soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A minute and twenty seconds in and Veronica's fart was still going on. She felt Blaise moving around like mad in her butthole, clearly in an effort to escape her comically long fart. She brought herself to climax thanks to his movements, letting out a loud moan as she shuddered with ecstasy. Finally letting her fart die out as her body relaxed. She thought about her choices, she could take Blaise out for a well deserved breath of fresh air or she could keep him in and go for round two.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><i>One day, for reasons that escape your comprehension, you shrink really small (ranging from about 1/2 inch to 1/10 inch or 1cm to 1 millimeters approx.), and you don't really know why. Did someone do it? Did something cause it? Who, or what? Unfortunately for you, you won't get many chances to find out, as you have to try your best and survive as you're not alone. The girls that you were just hanging out with or happened to be around are now seemingly impossibly gigantic. You might try to alert them of your presence, but that might not end up being the best idea.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>[This story is sort of a spiritual successor to TinyMan0001's 'Giantess/fart shrinking' stories, though not intended to be a carbon copy of it. One difference is that whether farts shrink you is up to whoever is writing, though I at least chose to leave the cause of shrinking mysterious at the beginning, and also because it slightly contradicts some backstory (I also left open the possibility for a girl to intentionally shrink you). However, like it, it's largely focused on the shrinking side, though I guess I can leave a branch dedicated for a giantess/growth route if anyone's interested on adding to that. Also, similarly, the girls may be aware or unaware of your shrunken form. Usually, I'd say they should progress from unaware to aware, depending on the girl and the situation though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, shrinking is a plot device, and it can be used in any way that helps keep the story going, as long as it doesn't contradict what was stated before. I probably won't have much time to do a whole lot of writing myself, so, besides setting up the initial routes, I'll be happy to let others unleash their creativity. I only ask for reasonable spelling (and this is coming from someone who has English as a 2nd language) and to at least make the chapter one or two paragraphs long. Let's not do choice one-liners, please.]</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<b>Main Characters:</b><br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Blaise (You):</b> 17 years old guy on his sophomore year of highschool. Tall (190 cm/6'3\") for your age, with a somewhat tanned skin tone and messy black hair and eyes. You're a quiet guy that likes to keep a low profile, slightly athletic with a bit of muscle (Blaise weighs around 198 lbs/90 kg), but never joined any sports team. You get decent grades with little studying, except on numerical things like Math, but you never fit in with the intellectual types either, although you enjoy reading quite a bit. You also like anime and videogames like most guys, and are rather introverted. You didn't have many friends, though you have quite a few acquaintances. You wonder if the friends that you do have are the reason for that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Additional notes: You have a crush on your friend Jen, but have never worked up the courage to ask her out, and at the same time, Lillian makes things extremely difficult and awkward. Also, while this won't be mentioned a lot in-story but is relevant for minor background stuff, Blaise is of Mexican origin]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lillian:</b> 17 years old. She's massive for a girl, standing at the same height as you (190 cm/6'3\") and weighing even more than you (105 kg/231 lbs). She's got fair skin, long straight black hair and emerald eyes. As these numbers suggest, she's on the chubby side, though she has a proportionately slim waist and somewhat large boobs, and instead, most of her weight is in a gigantic jiggling ass, the biggest in school that you know of, and thick thighs to go with it. She does have a bit of a tummy, but admittedly, this only gives her a cute look. Lillian has been your friend since kindergarten, and self-proclaimed best one at that, however, as you didn't really have any other friends for a long time, there was no contesting that claim. Still, you know each other very well, and she's comfortable around you beyond measure. Your relationship has also become a bit odd as you both hit puberty. The reason being that Lillian loves to tease you more than anything else in the world, and has practically no shame when it comes to it. She loves teasing you using her body, and specially her biggest feature, her ass. She often sits on your lap, chest, or even your face whenever she gets the chance, or lean her butt against you so you can feel it, or downright grab your hands and make them squeeze her rear, or shove them into her crack, and adores your shy/embarrassed reaction; she also tries to get you to rest your head or face on her butt whenever she gets an excuse for it. You wonder if you only put up with this because you've been friends for so long. She downplays all of this as just innocent teasing like old times, a claim that you can't deny since even since you were kids she often liked to sit on you or pin you under her weight in one way or the other. She doesn't exactly bully you, many times she just enjoyed the feeling of you resting on her soft body like a pillow, to the point that you've taken naps resting your head on her belly or lap/thighs sometimes, though she also enjoys the opposite, feeling you under her own mass. It just comes across as overwhelming because of her own sheer size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she loves to show off her big ass to you and tease you with it, she always wears extremely tight pants that make you wonder how she managed to fit into them, and isn't shy at flashing you her underwear, which, as far as you can tell from the times you've been at her house (and she lives next to you, to top things off), all consists of thongs and variants of that. She's cheerful, mischievous, playful and fairly lazy when it comes to physical work. Despite her appearance, she's surprisingly strong and athletic when she plays sports or does some activity for P.E, but only when forced to, or taunted into, otherwise she chooses to laze around whenever she can get away with it. Her rationale being that she doesn't want to do any serious amount of exercise because she doesn't want to burn off any fat, and specially her butt's. In fact, she wants it to get even bigger and fatter, much to your dismay and embarrassment. Because of this, and her aforementioned size, she loves to eat and eats a lot, most of it being fatty and sugary foods. And it's this habit which brings about her next 'quirk', so to speak; because of the immense volume of food she eats all the time (or whatever reason, as you can't think of any other) she's pretty much gassy all the time, and unlike most girls, isn't shy to let it rip right there and then (and she's practically incapable of sbd's, all of her releases are huge and loud, and even what she considers a small fart is pretty darn big to anyone else). In fact, she often farts when she sits on you, which she finds hilarious. Also, due to her hanging out in your house a lot, she fell in love with Mexican food, specially with burritos, which only make her even gassier. She practically eats at least one serving every day, and when she can, she gets away with eating much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's been friends with Jen for as long as you have, and while they're mostly on good terms, their relationship is also a bit odd, in that at times she's supportive to her, knowing she has a crush on you (unknown to you), but at other times, she stands as her rival over you. They also have a sort of rivalry regarding their 'best features', her boobs vs her ass. However, most of the time they hang out as good friends, with you most of those times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Measurements:</b> 37 - 32 - 56<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Additional notes: Admittedly, she's my favorite character, and I hope to see a lot from her]</i><br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jen:</b> 18 years old. She's also tall for a girl, but not as much as Lillian (180 cm / 5'10\"), and while she's also rather thick, she doesn't weigh as much (80 kg / 176 lbs). She has an hourglass shaped body (still bottom heavy despite her huge chest) and even though she sports the biggest bust in school, her butt is still bigger than it. It's considered to be second to Lillian's only, but Lillian's is easily twice as big as it despite that. She has creamy white skin and light brown wavy hair that she often wears as a ponytail, and her eyes are hazel colored. Unlike Lillian, she doesn't have a noticeable tummy, her stomach is smooth and mostly flat, though it has a tiny bit of pudge that makes it soft. She was rather chubby as a child, but that 'baby fat' is what ended up giving her her prodigious curves, and while she started out feeling self conscious about her body proportions and weight, she's come to feel comfortable in her body thanks to you. Now she carries her size and weight with unparalleled grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour second friend, she came into your life much later than Lillian, when you were 12 and entered middle school. Your friendship is on much more wholesome terms than Lillian's, and the two of you have developed a rather obvious crush on each other, but neither has realized nor acted upon it. To further complicate things, you seldom get alone time, as Lillian tags along 99% of the time as well. Jen's very kind, optimistic and affectionate, so she's hugged you a fair amount of times, making you intensely red with embarrassment, and when she sits next to you and you feel her soft hips leaning on yours, you struggle to retain your composure. You love everything about her, her personality and her looks both. She sometimes is annoyed by Lillian's 'hogging' you, and is surprisingly hostile to any other girl that shows any interest on you, though you're largely unaware of that. Her relationship with Lillian is a bit odd, as they're both good friends, but rivals at times, mostly over you, but also about their own perceived beauty. She considers most other girls aren't even competition when it comes to your affections, but will still make it clear you're off-limits (when you're not present).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn an unrelated note, she's become fond of anime, videogames and other stuff thanks to you. At school, she likes to play basketball or volleyball, the latter being her favorite sport; however, she turned down joining the school's team to have as much time as possible to hang out with you, even if Lillian were also part of the equation. Still, she tries to spend quality time with you (alone) whenever possibly, but only succeeding few times. Following Lillian's advice, Jen tries to use her butt to entice you, in addition to her boobs, though she's much more subtle about it than her. She often wears tight jeans at school, and short shorts/booty shorts when hanging out outside school. Neither Lillian nor her are fond of skirts or dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she's not Mexican, she was raised there up until she was around 10, and as such, she too is pretty fond of Mexican food. Unlike Lillian, however, she's never let loose around you, worried that that'd gross you out, despite Lillian's completely opposite behavior. She even told her that of all people, Blaise would be the most prepared one, having endured years and years of farts from her and that she should eventually reveal the truth about her gas, but she's chosen not to act upon that advice. By Lillian's own claim, she's got Jen beat in noise by a long shot and volume though not by much, but if Jen happens to eat anything with beans, even Lillian calls her farts 'downright toxic'. She's respected Jen's wishes so far and hasn't revealed this side of hers to you (yet).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Measurements:</b> 48 - 27 - 51<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Additional notes: Lillian lives next to your house, but Jen also lives within the same block/neighborhood.

She has a considerably large bust, almost tied with Jen's in size and a mostly flat stomach, though it does have a bit of pudge, which might be a sign that she either doesn't work out much or isn't as young as you may think. However, everything goes out of whack when you look below her waist, she has insanely wide hips and an absolute monster of an ass, whose heft is such that the floor slightly shakes whenever she walks, though you need to pay attention to feel it, and suspect she might be heavier than Lillian despite her apparent smaller size; her classroom chair, which seems to be a rather fancy executive leather one, constantly had a pair of unnaturally wide and deep indents. She seems to be aware of its tremendous size, and every single class she wears whatever accentuates it the most and fits her mood, mostly incredibly tight jeans or yoga pants that are a few sizes too small for her, giving students glimpses of her underwear at times, which all seem to be thongs, or panties so small that they got turned into thongs and got swallowed into her abyss of a crack; but on occasion she also surprises with pencil skirts capable of giving even the most chaste of men a heart attack. Her butt seemingly defies reality, it's absurdly huge, easily twice as big as Lillian's, but it's round and doesn't appear to have any noticeable cellulite, and it jiggles like jello even with her smallest motions, which makes it extremely difficult for guys to pay attention to her class. She has a quite bubbly personality and is a very enthusiast teacher, actually good at her job 'distractions' aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo further complicate things, she's also VERY playful and rather touchy-feely with students, specially male ones. And in your current group, you're the only guy, so you're her main, and likely only target whenever you have class with her. She's sat on your lap or sat very close next to you many more times than you'd be embarrassed to admit, has joked about you staring or getting distracted by her humongous 'assets' and also joked about waiting for your graduation to date you, and while all that is seen as all fun and jokes by the girls in your group, something about the way she looks at you makes you think she may not be quite joking, but you're afraid to find out. And it's not like she's been mean to you in any way, she's nothing but sweet, if perhaps a bit too playful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith people she's fond of or considers close, she often prefers to be called Lulu, Lourdes being her first name. The insane mass of her butt all but confirms she's rather lazy (at physical tasks) and enjoys food quite a lot. Despite having the appetite of a growing child or teen, her body's certainly not as young anymore. Owing to her butt's tremendous size, there's a recurring joke among students that her farts must be truly devastating, and some claim that the floor and chairs shook when she's let loose, when she thought she was alone in the classroom. Whether those rumors are true or not, you'd rather not ever find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Measurements:</b> 44 - 28 - 62<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Additional notes: Probably my personal 2nd favorite. Also, while Lillian is considered to have the biggest ass in school, that is only among students. Ms. McAllen easily blows her out of the water when teachers are also accounted, and even then, Ariana and Sheila have both bigger butts her. Also, She's actually good friends with her, and at least one possible route could involve Lillian finding you shrunken and give you to her, either aware or unaware. Neither Lillian nor Jen consider her an actual threat, and Lillian in particular enjoys her shenanigans with you.]</i><br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ariadne:</b> 22 years old. Your older sister (adopted though), she's even taller than you and Lillian at 197 cm / 6'5\". Like you, she has medium dark/tanned skin. Her hair is long and black, but also wavy. She's basically built like an Amazon, she's more athletic than anyone else you know, but is still not excessively ripped, albeit she sports some impressive abs. Her figure, however, is beyond impressive, she sports a huge ass that is about as big as Lillian's and despite her exercise and being fairly muscular, it has more than a generous layer of fat on it, making it soft and squishy, just like her bust, which is just as big (which makes it bigger than Jen's by a lot). She's in college, but comes back regularly to visit, specially on summer vacation and winter break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one would expect of an older sibling, she does a bit of bantering/teasing/light bullying to you, but she's not actually mean, and more often than not she's quite affectionate, and perhaps too much at times. She likes to hug you, sit on your lap or have you rest on hers among other things. She's also fairly protective of you, but she's more or less given Lillian a free pass, and sometimes teases that you should ask her out. She's the only person you know to regularly exercise (Jen being much more liberal about it, besides playing sports at school), but besides her arms, and some definition in her thighs, her enormous curves are soft and jiggly, much to your embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being adopted, she resembles your mom in a few ways, but her personality and preferences seem to be closer to your father's. Her love for sports arguably came from both, but she definitely got her fondness of exercising from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Measurements:</b> 54 - 26 - 54<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<b>Celeste:</b> 17 years old. A second cousin of yours. She's about average height (165 cm / 5' 5\") but she's heavier than she looks. She has a moderately sized bust, but also a surprisingly big (and literally fat) ass, where a lot of her weight (about 70 kg / 154 lbs) is concentrated, but funnily enough, besides that she looks rather skinny, and she gets baffled by the numbers she gets when weighing herself. She seems to not be quite aware of the full extent of her butt's size and weight. Her butt is no bigger than those of the other girls/women you know (maybe a bit close to Jen's in size), but it's definitely close to Lillian's in terms of jiggle, and it's even flabbier, as even Lillian's has a vague semblance of firmness, while Celeste's does not. However, it may feel heavier because nobody expects its weight, since her slender frame misleads anyone that's looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know her since kindergarten but haven't spent all that much time with her, and despite being aware of being related, she's been hitting on you since middle school. From what she observed from Lillian, she often tries to sit on your lap, chest or face whenever she gets the chance. Because of this, she's not on good terms with Lillian nor Jen, but she's managed to catch you alone a fair amount of times. You sometimes feel that you only manage to get away from her because of your size, strength, and perhaps the mercy of a deity up there. To your dismay, she sometimes gets you to be paired with her for school activities, much to the other girls' frustration. On a more wholesome note, you've always tried to make her feel comfortable in her own body, though not even you have dared to point out the source of the weighing numbers she dreads, she solely focus on her stomach and waist and doesn't understand how she's \"fat\" with her current measurements. She's a bit obssessed with dieting in an attempt to slim down, but nothing has ever worked so far, and she sucks at athletic stuff despite being physically lighter than most other girls here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Measurements:</b> 27 - 23 - 40<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Note: Both Jen and Lillian hate Celeste's guts, while Celeste seems to feel envious of Jen's body and is disgusted at Lillian's. Of the two, Lillian has less patience with her, as she's dealt with her for longer, and can quickly get aggressive, however, Celeste might trigger Jen's rage if she hits the wrong nerve when it comes to you. Celeste has no hope of beating either of them in a physical fight.]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yamile:</b> (Pronounced Yah-mee-leh) 16 years old. Originally an exchange student from India, but she ended up staying and her family moved here. Despite being in Freshman year, she's almost as tall as you and Lillian (185 cm / 6'1\") and has a bust that more or less matches Jen's, as well as an ass that is pretty much equal to Lillian's. Being in a different grade, you don't see her too often, but you met her because in 9th grade (8th for her), when she first arrived, you were the one to give her a tour of the school. Later, she asked you to teach her English to help her improve her fluency, and via other acquaintances you've hung out a bit. She seems interested in befriending you and sometimes teases you to make Lillian and Jen feel jealous, but other times, her behavior appears to be cryptic, nonetheless, she's fond of your company, and it looks like she wishes you two spent more time together. She also seems to be pretty skilled at belly dancing and at shaking her huge hips in an hypnotic way, which, combined with her habit of wearing short shorts that look like they're about to burst, makes it extremely hard for you to keep a straight face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's told you that she likes cooking, and most of her lunches are self made. You couldn't help but notice that they always seem to be curry or a variation of it, and from their scent alone, you'd say they're probably a bit too spicy, which is saying a lot, coming from yourself, a Mexican used to chili peppers and the like. Still, you're one of the few people that can taste her creations without your mouth burning, something she appreciates, and sometimes has made lunch for you, much to Jen's dismay and frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Measurements:</b> 47 - 28 - 55<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Note: Jen's not too fond of her, as she considers her an actual rival over your affections, though she remains polite. Lillian however is on friendlier terms with her, though they haven't hung out as much]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Miriam</b>: 37 years old. Blaise's (and thus your) mother. Going by her looks alone, she's a tall, imposing woman, standing just a little shorter than you (185 cm / 6' 1\"), however, she's an overly sweet, doting and highly protective mother (not quite overprotective, though, as she's given you plenty of autonomy over the years). You heavily took after her, your hair, skin tone, height and some of your facial features were indeed inherited from her. While she has quite the matronly figure, her face doesn't look her age, and has been mistaken to be in her early-mid 20's on many occasions. She's of Mexican origin like Blaise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's very joyful, fun-loving, kinda carefree and overly playful, though when needed, she can switch to 'wise parental figure mode' at will, though she seldom does, and you rarely give her motives to do so. When you were very young, you didn't notice it, but as you grew up, you realized your mom wasn't quite like others'. She watched anime and cartoons with you, played videogames with you, and even sports whenever your father was busy and couldn't do it himself. Eventually you learned, and got confirmation from your father, that your mom is basically an adult version of a tomboy. It was slightly shocking, but after giving it more thought, you realized you probably had one of the coolest moms ever, who wasn't shy to have fun with her son in ways many other mothers would've hesitated or downright refused. She's quite a sporty person about half of the time, but unlike Ariadne, she only enjoys it as a way to have fun with her kids, and doesn't really bother to exercise much otherwise, which gives her a slightly pudgy, and highly curvaceous figure owing to her relaxed approach to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also loves to tease you (rather lightly) about your love life, or lack thereof, pointing that you have two beautiful female friends who'd probably go out with you if you just asked. Surprisingly, she's a a bit more strict with Jen, feeling that she has yet to prove 'worthy' in her eyes and earn her blessing, however, she very much approves of Lillian, whom she's known since you two were in kindergarten, and has pretty much already accepted her as part of the family, to the point that she gave her keys to get in your house whenever she wanted, nor does she mind letting her in to go wake you up sometimes. According to your father, it's highly likely that she sees her younger self in Lillian, and probably thinks that's the best kind of woman for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since you started high school, she got a drastic promotion at her job, which has kept her mostly away from home, and frequently travels around the country with your father, but she still makes an effort to spend time with you whenever she can. And when she does, she loves to have you close, she often wraps her arm around your neck while she sits next to you, or outright keeps you hugged to her. Sometimes she teases about sitting on your lap as 'payback' for the countless times she had you on hers as a kid/baby. On occasion she's also joked about feeding you again like when you were a baby, but she's sensible enough to only do this when your friends aren't around. In general, she likes to physically show her affection for you, and tease the idea that you'll always be her baby, though at the same time, she trusts you to take care of yourself when she's not around. Still, with such a high drive maternal instinct, it shouldn't be difficult to trigger it to much higher levels should something happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terms of her figure, she has a very similar body to that of Lillian's, although her affection for outdoor activities keeps her a bit leaner than her. She weighs a bit more than yourself (95 kg  / 210 lbs) and her bust is considerably big, though not as big as Ariadne's, and her butt is close to Lillian's size, much to your embarrassment. It looks even bigger since her body frame is slightly smaller than hers. Similarly, she's quite athletic and agile despite her weight, and the way she walks is as if she were much lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the reason of your own Mexican roots, she loves to cook food from her homeland, or at least use its ingredients in her own interpretation of other dishes. She's quite fond of chili peppers (whose spiciness she seems to be immune to) and beans. Her homemade food is absolutely stellar, but as her job became more demanding, she got lazier in the kitchen and orders takeout (of questionable quality) much more often, which has made her get 'bigger' than she used to be. She's specially fond of American style tacos and burritos, and that's the reason your house seems to be perpetually stocked with those. At least, thanks to her, you learned to cook for yourself, but that doesn't spare you from the 'explosions' that ensue after she eats, if you happen to be around her, which she finds hilarious or downplays it. The fact that she buys many more burritos than she eats makes you suspect she may purposely have a surplus for whenever Lillian comes over, and easily got her hooked to them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Measurements:</b> 46 - 30 - 55<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sheila</b>: 38 years old. Lillian's mother, a big woman in all senses of the word. Standing as tall as yourself (190 cm / 6'3\"), but much heavier than either you or even Lillian herself, weighing a massive 150 kg / 330 lbs, most of which is below her waist, though she has a sizable bust, and a relatively thin waist in comparison, but her tummy is definitely a bit bigger and pudgier than her daughter's. She was apparently one of the most if not the most successful dancer back in Brazil, being an expert at shaking her enormous assets in ways not apt for the faint of heart, and boasts that she has the biggest booty in Brazil, and probably the whole world's, given the country's fame. By her appearance, that's a very difficult claim to challenge. Personality wise, she's even more carefree and relaxed than your mom, but like her, she's playful almost to a fault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's been your mom's best friend since high school, as they both went to the US to study abroad, and stayed in touch ever since until they finally moved there, and made sure to live in the same neighborhood (and literally next to each other). Given the massive quantity of money she earned in her youth, she's more or less unofficially retired, though she has a job for the sake of having something to do, teaching Portuguese at the school you attend to. Given her long friendship with your mom, she's also your unofficial 'aunt' and babysitter whenever needed, but as you grew up, she came to tease you nearly as much as Lillian does, and given her much greater weight, it comes across as far more overbearing. Your mom finds her antics with you hilarious, however. They've even joked that if you're not taken by the time you turn 18 she's willing to take you herself, or at least 'teach you how to be a man'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing Miriam's friend, she got hooked to Mexican food years before you were even born, but unlike her, she didn't get much of a resistance to some of the food's spiciness, thus, she's less fond of chili peppers and more of beans and other stuff. She often comes by to get some burritos from your mom's pantry or fridge, just like her daughter.  Lillian claims that both her big butt and 'gassy tendencies' came from her, though thankfully, for a long time you wouldn't know, besides her claims of her mom's farts being 'legendary' or that hers were nothing in comparison. Sheila has been mostly kind enough to spare you from them, though a few times, many on Lillian's request, she's let loose to show off her 'power'. A few other times you've been exposed to her massively powerful gas include visiting her while she's felt sick, or when she arrives to the house, not knowing you were there, and assuming it was only Lillian and herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Measurements:</b> 45 - 36 - 70<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Additional note: As it may be inferred from her description, she raised Lillian as a single mother, and in fact never married. On an unrelated note, she never stopped practicing her dancing despite retiring, a fact that she's made you VERY aware of, at times when you've gone to her house]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lynn</b>: 40 years old, Jen's mother. Slightly shorter than her daughter, standing at 175 cm / 5' 9\" tall, she also possesses a voluptuous figure, and hardly looks her age. She seems to be of Nordic origin, though you've never personally asked her, although both her and Jen have made offhanded comments about having Viking blood from time to time. Lynn has even told you that Jen's sporty personality and toughness may very well come from it, but you weren't sure if she was serious or just joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair is golden as opposed to Jen's light brown and her eyes are blue, but has the same pale, but healthy looking complexion as her. She's quite curvaceous, but they're a little downscaled owing to her shorter stature, but said curves look about just as big on her body as Jen's do on her own. You don't know a whole lot about her, since she seems to be constantly traveling on business like your own mom, but you've met her, and have been to Jen's house with her present. She certainly seems to like you and approve of you, to the point that she's teased you about when you plan on asking her daughter out when she's not within earshot, making you blush madly. Despite having her apparent blessing, you don't feel quite sure, some things about her behavior seem cryptic to you, and often you can't quite discern what her true intentions may be. Her icy looking, soul-piercing gaze makes maintaining eye contact with her rather difficult for you. At least, she seems to trust you and doesn't seem to be overly strict with her daughter even when it's only you two hanging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Measurements:</b> 46 - 26 - 50<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ariana Abalos</b>: 26 years old. Your first cousin and the current school's principal. Very similar to your mother in appearance, minus the beauty mark over the right corner of her mouth and frozen cold blue eyes. With a slimmer waist and fatter butt, she has quite the stern streak amongst students, especially you and Celeste. As long as a problem turns up, she turns to you or Celeste with suspicions, but your mother said it was because she was very worried about you two. Celeste is terrified of her and would clam up in her presence and your friends were no better. Lillian would try to stand up to her, but eventually would be silence. As for you, she was as cryptic as possible and it was impossible to tell what was on her mind, something that scared you to no end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Measurements</b>: 45 - 26 - 64.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Veronica</b>: 18 years old, currently in her senior year of high school. Standing at a decent 174 cm/ 5'8\" tall with long straight red hair that went just past her shoulders and bright green eyes. She had a body that rivaled Celeste's with most of her weight being found around her butt except she was more physically active, giving her butt a mix of fat and muscle that made it look near perfect. She was known as the one of the gassiest girl in school (arguably tied with Lillian on that regard, though nobody knows for sure), and for good reason, she let loose farts that shook rooms or were easily mistaken for a sewage leak on a daily basis. She actually asked you out, thinking that you had a fetish after seeing Lillian fart in your face several times, but after you explained that you weren't really into farts she left in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Measurements:</b> 29 - 25 - 40<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Monique</b>: 17 years old and currently in her junior year, Monique stood at 168 cm/ 5'6\" tall with short brunette hair that almost reached her neck and deep brown eyes. She had a butt almost as large as Jen's, but she hated it. Monique would run, diet or workout on a daily basis but it never seemed to get rid of even an inch of her booty fat, however she had terrible case of swamp ass. Whenever she got hot or physically active she started sweating a ton, and a large wet line would appear on her clothes down her ass crack. Her swamp ass and her daily exercise meant there was almost always a sweat stain on her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Measurements:</b> 32 - 28 - 55<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Emily</b>: 18 years old and in her senior year, Emily stood at 185 cm / 6'1\" with long wavy blond hair and light blue eyes. She had a body similar to Jen's save her noticeably smaller tits. She was known for being supposedly extremely sadistic towards men. There were rumors of her seducing boys just to get them alone and torture them with her ass, most boys didn't want to admit they were overpowered by a girl but if they did it always came down to one word against the other. You heard her favorite thing to do was to smother them with her ass and when they were desperate and panicking for air, she would lift up her butt just enough to let them breath and fart on them. Luckily Jen and Lillian's protectiveness of you kept you from finding out if these rumors were true, though she looked innocent enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Measurements:</b> 36 - 26 - 53<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Coach Amber</b>: A 28 year old woman that has been known to be overenthusiastic over anything that drives her passion. That mainly means anything that involves doing any physical work or any exercise. While it's good for morale for the beginning, it eventually becomes too overbearing for the students and Amber seems to not notice it. She also fails to notice how sweaty she becomes and the stench it makes. Though you only heard it through teachers' rumors, Amber indulges a lot of protein food, so much protein that her farts are basically bombs at this point and Ms. McAllen joked about who would win a farting contest between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber is a redhead with her hair tied up into a bun and wears a white tank top with red shorts. She was once a fat kid, but after many years of working out, she developed curves from her childhood fat and it couldn't be helped as most of the boys lusted after her very muscular body, especially with her big tits and the two, firm dodgeballs she called an ass. With how big her assets are, they strain against her clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Measurements:</b> 46-29-55<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, those are the characters I've created for this plus some added by other authors. I hope to see stuff with them, but you're welcome to create more characters if you wish, and if they're used enough, I'll add them here. The last thing to do here is the rules, I guess<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's an imgur album with some visual references I got: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://imgur.com/a/PDV6Re6\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/a/PDV6Re6</a><br>\r\nYou're free to ignore that in favor of your own imagination and creativity however, though at least the ones I got for Lillian and Ms.McAllen are rather close to what I had in mind. Besides Lillian, however, the other girls are supposed to be slimmer than the pics I found, they're mostly for butt references.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<b>Rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.- The shrinking is supposed to make you incredibly tough, borderline invulnerable, but you'll still feel the weight and pressure you're subjected to, so, the main character shouldn't die, unless there's a decent build up, and an alternative, nonlethal route.<br>\r\n2.- Being a giantess type interactive, it's almost an unspoken rule, but, there should be no other males in this story.<br>\r\n3.- Let's try to have consistency across chapters even if they're written by different people, always check the previous one. Some changes can be made on request, and depending on the change itself, I may edit accordingly.<br>\r\n4.- Not an overly strict rule, but chapters should be at least 2 or 3 paragraphs long.<br>\r\n5.- No scat. Sorry, I'm fine with butts and farts, and those are the main point of the story, but I draw the line there. That doesn't mean there can't be some measure of toilet content though (main character gets farted into it for example). I don't care much for piss, but it's not my thing.<br>\r\n6.- Similar to #5, the main focus of this story is butt (it also includes crushing/sitting) and farts, but other types of content aren't strictly forbidden. Boobs are cool, and I'm indifferent to feet, but I'd rather not make them the focus.<br>\r\n7.- As mentioned before, the girls usually start off unaware, and later become aware, or even if they start off aware, they shouldn't exactly help the main character much. It's not quite a hard rule but more of a guideline, many routes I've set up have the girl aware in some way, lol.<br>\r\n8.- Again, not a straight rule per se, but, unless Blaise is buried under tons of flesh, he can usually be heard if he speaks, but that's personal preference.
