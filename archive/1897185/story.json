The two took a seat just in time for class to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swap had also caused another change in the two. Switching their dorms had also apparently altered their attitudes towards class. Since Slifer Red was the lowest dorm, Alexis had apparently become less interested in class and also did very poorly in it, which was now the reason she was in such a low ranking dorm despite her dueling ability not having been altered by the swap. She was now very bored and was barely paying any attention. She zoned out as she thought of other things. She definitely wasn't the model student she had been before the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as for Jaden, he had seemingly become a much better and more attentive student. He was paying close attention to the teacher's lesson, and was even taking notes. His grades had also risen and he was now the model student Alexis used to be, and at the top of his class with the highest grades in the girls dorm, and possibly even in the whole school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Swap Frog was wondering if it should do another, or just leave things be for now.</span></div></div>",

They weren't really sure why. Yusei looked himself over, but didn't see anything wrong. Though he did feel a bit weird dressed like he was, which was strange since this was how he always dressed. Looking to the others, he figured they also had this strange feeling. His eyes also landed specifically on Luna for a bit. He though what she was wearing was kinda cute. He wondered what it would be like to have clothes like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Akiza, she felt pretty uncofortable in what she was wearing. She wondered why she dressed like this, and contemplated what it would be like to where something more comfortable, like what Leo was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Yusei, I know this might sound weird, but do you think that I could maybe try on your clothes.\" Luna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought over her question, a thought popped into his head. \"Okay, but only if I can try on yours.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's brave question and Yusei's response was the trigger it took as everyone thought they same thing. \"Hey Akiza, since Yusei and Luna are swapping clothes, how about we do it too? I really like yours.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sure.\" she replied. \"I actually would like to try your clothes as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey Crow.\" Carly said. \"With all this clothes swapping going on, I was thinking that you and I could do it, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure. I was actually thinking the same thing.\" Crow replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this sure is surprising.\" Sherry said. \"I never expected this to happen when I stopped by for a visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sherry.\" Jack started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I would also like to switch clothes with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't cut me off when I was trying to talk! And don't assume you know what I'm going to say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, then what were you going to ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swap clothes with me.\" he said, not in the form of a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, everything was sorted out. Yusei and Akiza now wore the matching clothes of Luna and Leo respectively. Though because of the size difference, their clothes were a bit on the tight size. As for the twins, Luna now wore Yusei's clothes and Leo was dressed in Akiza's, though their new attire was pretty lose and baggy on them. Carly and Crow were now dressed in one another's clothes, though Carly still had her glasses. And lastly, Jack and Sherry now wore the clothes of the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Swap Frog had exhanged their clothing preferences between one another. Yusei now had Luna's taste in clothing, Akiza had Leo's, Crow had Carly's, and Jack had Sherry's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is kinda big, but I like it.\" Leo said, admiring Akiza's clothes that were now his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Akiza said. \"Its kinda cool that we've got matching clothes now, Yusei.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might have to get these touched up a bit so that they actually fit, though.\" Yusei said.</span></div></div>",

He now wore an elegant blue dress with a symbol that looked like the one on his usual shirt, a white cardigan, blue high-heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason for this was that the Swap Frog had swapped his occupation with Misty, and when it did, it altered reality greatly. In this new reality, Yusei was the top model for women's fashion, even though he was male. He was also still part of Team 5D's, though not their best duelist anymore, and used his earnings from his model job to fund and sponsor the team, which included a much larger home. It was a small mansion that the group opperated out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver near the Duel Runners was Misty herself, who was currently kneeled down by the green Duel Runner, which was hers. She was currently wearing a clothes that looked like more feminine versions of Yusei's clothes. A green jacket over a black sleeveless shirt with a snake-like design on it that partly exposed her midriff. She also had on a pair of tight shorts and boots. Misty was also on the team, and was their mechanic as well. She was the teams best duelist.</span></div></div>",

Soon enough Leo's arms disappeared with a magical \"POP\" from his torso. He let out a shocked \"WHAAAAA!!!!\". He didn't feel anything on the armslots on his sides. He had no arms and couldn't move anything that felt like an appendage from where his arms were. His sides were bare and it looked as though there were no arms there to begin with.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza felt something growing on her sides. \"Ehhh, whats this tingle that I'm.. OH!\" She screamed as she felt two growths come from her sides. The growths ripped from her dress' sides and grew into an extra pair of short arms right below her real arms. The tips of the stubs of the arms soon morphed into hands and grew fingers, one after the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza felt a loss of balance and a new control between her new arms and her brain. She could move the arms at her will, but was still disoriented from this new link and more body parts on her upper body. \"Ugh, getting dizzy with all these hands\" she said. Leo on the other hand, felt himself completely handicapped and unsure what to do, as well as dizzy and unbalanced with no weight on his upper body. His own arms had been stolen from is body and placed onto Akiza's body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-WHAT HAPPENED. MY HANDS AND ARMS. THEY'RE GONE\". Leo screamed out. Luna simply looked in horror at what the frog had done. \"I-I have, Leos hands\"? Akiza asked. She lifted her new appendages as well as her own arms. She opened her palms and Leo's palms and clenched all 4 of her fists. The arms were shorter compared to her long slender arms, and looked kind of silly. But at the same time she looked like some sort of multi-limbed goddess or amazoness with four arms. Leo was struggling to cope with this. He had no movement of anything on his sides. The only limbs he had left were his legs.  He was struggling to stand upright as he wobbled armless. <br>\r\n\u201cChange me BACK NOW FROG\u201d Leo said. The frog kept a calm demeanor as Leo stared at him with anger in his face and nothing on his sides. He looked like a silly angry ragdoll with its limbs torn off. The frog simply looked at Leo and calmly said \u201cDon\u2019t you wish to see how life is without your arms?\u201d Leo looked at him for a second and continued to glare with anger. He had no arms or hands and it felt like there was nothing on his torso in the first place. How was he supposed to lift things? \u201cAnd besides boy, your adolescent friend there looks like she\u2019s enjoying having 4 arms\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t you wish to see how she handles it\u201d? Leo looked at Akiza. She looked like she was curious as to having 4 hands were like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was waving Leo\u2019s arms up and down, her own hands waving as well. She then clapped her hands and Leo\u2019s hands that were attached to her body together and started dancing, shaking her wide hips and dancing with her hands clasped together.  She was dancing and shaking her hips with all 4 of her arms shaking wildly. She was really having fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoohoo\u201d she went as she shook her arms and placed her lower arms on top of her higher arms\u2019 biceps. She could feel her lower hands touching her upper arms. They were a part of her. She could feel the dexterity between 2 sets of appendages as she could feel each one of her new fingers. She put her lower hands on her hips and crossed her upper arms. \u201cThis is so much fun\u201d she said. Luna simply looked on while still in shock. Leo however, looked down in sadness. He was gonna be called a freak and a weirdo. He looked as though he was about to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza bent over to him and said \u201cHey Leo, don\u2019t worry about it, you\u2019ll get your arms back\u201d she said reassuringly, putting Leo\u2019s own hand on his armless shoulder. \u201cBut, could I..use these for a bit\u201d she said clapping her old and new hands together. She waved her arms, swinging them in a dancing motion. Her own real arms swinging down while Leo\u2019s arms swung up as she rhythmically swayed her 4 arms. Leo saw how happy she was and said \u201cOk then, you can go ahead and use my hands if you want\u201d. \u201cOh YAY\u201d Akiza said all giddy as she grabbed Leo in a hug with 4 arms wrapping around him. He could feel the tightness of her arms and his arms squeezing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, so what now\u201d Luna said, finally saying something after witnessing the shocking arm transference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u201d the frog said. \u201cI could show you some more swaps if you wish. Or you can enjoy yourselves as you are now\u201d he said. The three looked at each other and said\u2026.     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her breasts start to get smaller and smaller until they receded into her body, leaving no trace of them ever being there. Akiza's chest was completely flat like a male's. She pulled at her dress neckline. \"Wha-wha happened. My breasts\" she went as she turned to Leo who was making a puffing noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo started to feel really warm in his chest. He was breathing heavily as he huffed an puffed while holding his chest. \"Huffff, Huffff, Haaaa\" he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna immediately concerned for her brother. \"LEO, are you ok\" she went as she walked toward him. He knelt to the ground as he held his chest tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Leo felt something grow on his chest. Two small mounds started growing on his boy pecs. They were morphing as they grew and grew rounder and rounder. It looked like two balloons were inflating from his chest. The mounds of flesh inflated bigger and bigger until they were pushing Leo's shirt and jacket. They pushed harder and harder, stretching his shirt. They grew to the size of softballs. Leo breathed heavily as he looked down to see two ball like flesh sacks protrude from his chest. And they didn't stop growing. They grew and grew until they jiggled around and squished together. With a \"BOING\" they stopped growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo gathered himself together. Instantly he was losing his center of balance and tipped forward a but thanks to the pair of breasts he now sported. He looked down to his shock and horror to see two jiggling healthy breasts. They were like two jiggling softballs squished together in a pair. They showed off how round they were and how smooth and clear their skin was through Leo's shirt as they were partially exposed, a huge line of cleavage showing from his shirt due to how huge they were and how small he and his shirt were, stretching his neckline greatly  He poked one curiously. It felt soft and squeezable. He squished them between his fingers and said \"AAAAaah, wha-what are these. I have two balls on my chest. What are they- he shouted in horror. He meshed them again between his fingers. They were soft and squishy but felt like they were a part of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza then said \"Leo, stop touching my breasts\" as she grabbed his hand. Wiggling her finger with a stern look on her face she said \"that's not right for a little boy to do\". Leo looked up at the now flat chested Akiza, a flat surface where her breasts used to be. He looked down at his own pair of breasts, huge and round. Once they were Akiza's, now they were his. \"Ok Akiza\" he went as she smiled at him for listening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna watched the entire thing as she had not been a victim of swapping. She,Akiza and Leo all turned to the swap frog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DID YOU DO\" Leo and Akiza shouted at the frog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I simply demonstrated my powers is all\" he said calmly while sitting on his card. \"Well change us back\" Akiza said. The frog responded by saying.\"surely you wish to see more of my powers. I simply transferred your breasts onto the boy. Let him enjoy it for a while\" he said. \"there is much more i am capable of. Do you not wish to see it first?\" he went on to say. The three looked at the frog and Leo was holding his breasts in his hands to retain his balance since they were so heavy. Akiza thought about it and said \"fine, but you better reverse everything back\" she said angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course milady\" the frog said, gesturing a servant pose by bowing his head while his webbed hand held his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lets see\" he said....     </span></div></div>",

Her ovaries became testicles and a new \"part\" appeared between her legs. She felt a pushing sensation but it was at her crotch, and was slowly showing outside her skirt. Once it faded her panties felt tighter then they were a few seconds ago. Then her groin area became slightly hairy \"Wha-wha happened. My crotch\" she went as she turned to Leo who was making a groan noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo started to feel really smooth in his groin. He was breathing heavily as he huffed an puffed while holding his groin. \"Aw, aw\" he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna immediately concerned for her brother. \"LEO, are you ok\" she went as she walked toward him. He knelt to the ground as he held his groin tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Leo felt something shrink where his part is. His penis was slowly retreating to his groin. Then it fully tucked inside it. Then finally his public hairs in his groin area become fully smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo gathered himself together. He poked his crotch out of curiously. It felt relaxing. He squished it between his fingers and said \"AAAAaah, wha-what is it. What are they-\" he shouted in horror. He meshed it again between his fingers. It felt smooth but felt like they were a part of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza then said \"Leo, stop touching my crotch\" as she grabbed his hand. Wiggling her finger with a stern look on her face she said \"that's not right for a little boy to do\". Leo looked up at the now she-male Akiza, a pointed part showing out where her crotch used to be. He looked down at his own crotch, smooth and empty. Once they were Akiza's, now they were his. \"Ok Akiza\" he went as she smiled at him for listening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna watched the entire thing as she had not been a victim of swapping. She,Akiza and Leo all turned to the swap frog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DID YOU DO\" Leo and Akiza shouted at the frog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I simply demonstrated my powers is all\" he said calmly while sitting on his card. \"Well change us back\" Akiza said. The frog responded by saying.\"surely you wish to see more of my powers. I simply transferred your crotch onto the boy. Let him enjoy it for a while\" he said. \"there is much more I am capable of. Do you not wish to see it first?\" he went on to say. The three looked at the frog. Akiza thought about it and said \"fine, but you better reverse everything back\" she said angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course milady\" the frog said, gesturing a servant pose by bowing his head while his webbed hand held his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lets see\" he said....</span></div></div>",
