But then, she also insisted I was a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I want to be clear: I am not trans, and nobody claimed that I was trans. For eight years, she told me I was a boy, even though I was a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was six when my best friend, John Scooter, told me the truth: I was finishing up in the bathroom when he walked in on me. He took one look at me and said, \"Sam,... You're a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was like a light went on. I knew why I was interested in girl's clothing, and why I wanted to wear my hair long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, when I went home and told Ma Stone about it, she just said John was playing a trick on me. \"Of <i>course</i> you're a boy, Sam. Don't you think I would know if you weren't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the summer I turned 11 when everything changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was August, about a month before the start of school. A bunch of us decided to play baseball in the vacant lot next to Ravenscroft Academy, an exclusive school down the road from us. Scooter had been accepted there, but said he wasn't allowed to tell us much about it. <i>Okay, Scooter,</i> I thought, <i>two can play that game. You can just wait until I ask Ma Stone if she believes I'm a girl, or if she thinks I'm a boy who needs a training bra.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I was plenty girly, but I loved playing baseball. I took a swing at one of Scooter's pitches, and knocked it out of the park,... or, in this case, over the wall and onto the grounds of Ravenscroft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it,\" Scooter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" I replied, \"I hit the ball, I should go get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll let me in, I'm going there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm faster,\" I said, and ran to the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pressed the intercom button, and a woman came on the screen. \"May I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi, my name's Sam. I hit a baseball over the fence, sorry. Can I come get it? Or can you bring it to the gate? Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman leaned closer to the camera, presumably to get a closer look at me on the screen. \"You said your name is Sam? Samuel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm a Samantha, but my adoptive mother won't admit it. Could you buzz me in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reacted when I said I was Samantha. \"Remain at the gate, Samantha. Wardwell will escort you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know what I expected, but it wasn't who showed up at the gate. Wardwell was a mountain of a man. If you told me he was so much as an inch under seven and a half feet tall, I'd have told you to double-check your tape measure. And yet, something about him seemed so... <i>familiar.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at me and smiled. \"Samantha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wardwell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the gate for me. \"Follow me, little missy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I entered, Wardwell threw the ball to the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Wardwell to a large building, flanked by four smaller buildings. In we went, then up the stairs, then down a hall toward two offices next to each other. A plaque on one identified it as the office of HEATHER GARDNER, MAGISTRA, with the other claimed by DANIEL COCHRANE, MAGISTER. Wardwell knocked on Ms. Gardner's door, and said, \"Here she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened. \"Come in, Samantha. There is someone here who you should meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI entered. Seated at the desk was a middle-aged woman, no doubt Ms. Gardner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso in the room was a woman in her mid-twenties. She turned as I approached, and I saw her face. It was a face I'd seen in my dreams many times. A face a little like the face I saw in the mirror. Could it be... ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knelt before me. \"Samantha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe hugged as if we would be separated again if we let go.</span></div></div>",

She needed you to play the part of a boy, perhaps until she forgot why.\" She took out a wand and pointed it at me. A bright light shot out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light faded, I had long hair. \"It's magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it is, Samantha. Ravenscroft is no cowan school, but a school for witches. Both your parents learned magick here, and so will you. Now, is there anything else you'd like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't have to think twice. \"A training bra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done.\" Another flash, and I could feel the bra on my skin. \"Vanessa, why don't you take Samantha to your office? Introduce her to Maddalena? Get your husband on the phone, and let Samantha talk to her father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Magistra. Come, Samantha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked, I asked, \"Who's Maddalena? Do I have a little sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Sam. Maddalena is my familiar.

Sam, this is Maddalena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started petting Maddalena. \"So a familiar is a pet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Maddalena swatted my nose. <i>*Manners!*</i> said a voice in my head. Then, Maddalena flashed her claws at me, as if to warn me about my choice of words next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A familiar is much more than a pet,\" Mom said. \"They lend their magick to us, and their lives are extended in return. You might consider an apology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Maddalena. I didn't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*All is forgiven,*</i> she replied. <i>*Welcome back to the family.

I could not hear what was being said, but the girl was clearly upset about something. She had been crying, and she occasionally stomped a single foot to emphasize her frustrations. Mom kept a calm expression as she talked to the girl before sending her on her way. Curious, I walked up, with Tia following. \"Did something happen to her?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom gave a patient smile. \"That was Cire Child.\" Calmly, she explained. \"She was a boy until she got pranked by one of the seventh-years during orientation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But pranks during official school functions are forbidden.\" Worried, Tia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"The seventh-year girl would have been reprimanded for her actions, had Cire had not counter-pranked her.\" Remaining calm, Mom replied. \"You see, magick duels and prank wars are strictly forbidden between first and seventh years, so we had to punish them both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was their punishment?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cire is surprisingly talented for her age.\" Smiling, Mom explained. \"She returned the favor, turning the seventh year girl into a boy, thus beginning the magick duel.\" Her smile vanished. \"Now they both must finish this year as the opposite gender, to remind them there are laws to the use of magick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we just got a lecture...\" Wincing, Tia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"Blessed be, girls.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The girls are Samantha and Tia. Everybody calls me Scooter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cire Child. It's insanely hard to find your place when you're in the wrong body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Scooter said, \"you're the one who tried to start a... what did they call it?... a prank war?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call it defending myself. And now the guidance counselor says I have to stay this way for the whole school year.\" She snorted. \"She's probably just too dumb to figure out how to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to walk that back, Cire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the woman you just called dumb?

Not much. But you should definitely be worried about her. She didn't get a reputation as the Queen of Pranks by just sipping tea. I knew one girl who tried her? For a month, whenever Wardwell's hounds got too close, she turned into a cat. Would you like to see if Fancy Feast is as good as the commercials say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCire took a breath. \"Perhaps...

Cire, however, still seemed depressed. \"I can still hear my little sister laughing at me, all the way back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,... My dad told me that, when life hands you something, make it your own.\" Softly, Tia said. \"I think this applies here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it does.\" Smiling, I said. \"You are a girl for the year, so make the experience your own, something you can use to your advantage when you become a boy again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean...?\" Confused, Cire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was forced to live the life of a boy since I was kidnapped.\" Serious, I replied. \"Now that I am with my family, I have to get used to the life of a girl again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- What's the point?\" Shaking her head, Cire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having lived the life of a boy for so long, I have a far better understanding of how they tick than most girls on campus.\" Smiling, I said. \"Do you have any idea what some boys would pay to know how girls tick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Catching on, Tia said. \"By being a girl, you get first hand knowledge of how and why girls do what they do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are scaring me....\" Slouching, Cire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit up straight, young lady.\" Imitating my mom, I scolded. \"It's bad posture, and it will cost you back pain later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCire sighed, sitting up right. \"It's not comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No pain, no gain.\" Smiling, Tia said. \"Good posture strengthens the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you two want to teach me how to be a proper girl...\" Wincing, Cire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a <i>proper</i> girl, so much.\" Smiling, I said. \"Still, if I can survive having to act like a boy, you can survive acting like a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, and we'll help you.\" Kindly, Tia said. She shrugged. \"What do you have to lose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCire sighed. \"Fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia and I smiled, before our conversation moved to the importance of a girl keeping her legs closer together than a boy, proper stance, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to me until later, Mom was watching from a distance with a warm smile on her face. I guess she had a feeling that Tia and I would be a good influence on her as, that night, we found that she had been bunked with us.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All seventh-years were pranked when it was their turn, and were constantly reminded of the penalty of going too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do we start?\" Interrupting my thoughts, Cire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We start with your walk.\" Motioning to her feet, I replied. \"Both boys and girls alike have an unspoken language in all that they do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know this?\" Wincing, Cire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was taught this when Ma Stone insisted I was a boy.\" Ruefully, I replied. \"I am relearning everything I need to know as a girl, and passing it on to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When a girl walks, she does not sway her hips as much as you are unless she wants a boy's attention.\" Softly, Tia added. \"I learned that from Dad... relax your stride a little, and you won't get as many looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I'll try.\" Uncertain, Cire said. \"I just can't get used to this... breeze under the skirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what leggings are for.\" Calmly, I said. \"I think I have a fresh pair I can give you until you can get to the school store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCire sighed. \"Mrs Procter told me that, although I was a boy and could be a boy again, no one here will see or treat me that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Smiling, Tia said. \"You are just as much a girl as Sam and I right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe reached our dorm room, where Tia and I led Cire to the vanity.
