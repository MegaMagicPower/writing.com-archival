Despite your best efforts, you found yourself being separated from your brother and carried away by the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BIG BROTHER!\", Cole despertly called out as he was distanced from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself blacking out as the ground drawer closer. You prayed to any God out there to help you and Cole.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nYou soon felt yourself coming too. Immediately you noticed the soft and warm ground. Opening your eyes, you saw the ground was peach colored and had the lines that covered a palm. You soon felt the ground shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey you're awake!\", a loud and somewhat familar voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking forward you saw a giant wrist with a blue band. Further up you saw a toned bicep, a pair of large pecs, and the face of Son Goku!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in shock. Not only was Goku in front of you, he was a giant! Looking around you noticed finally that you were in his palm. You were smaller then his thumb and for right in the center. You couldn't help but bring your hand to the holder of your life. However a voice suddenly called out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWidening you eyes, you looked up to see Cole waving at you from atop of Goku's large broad shoulder. Goku chuckled before bringing his other hand up to his shoulder, letting Cole hop on. The Saiyan then lowered the tips of his fingers to the hand holding you, creating a bridge for your brother to cross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole rushed across the palm and embraced you, and you got over your shock and hugged him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cole....what happened? How...did you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother smiled before pointing up at Goku. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr.Goku helped me! He found me and when I said I was lost he offered to help me find you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at the Saiyan, walking out of the embraced you approached the blue wristband.  \"Go-Mr.Goku, thank you helping me and my brother, I'm very grateful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku gave a big grin while flashing a thumbs up. \"No problem! I sensed two energy signatures come out of nowhere. When I investigated, i found your brother laying on a flower. I offered to help find you, and we did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku brought up a fist to the edge of his palm. Cole laughed and gave a hard fistbump, Goku chuckled in return. He then moved his fist over to you. You very a little perplexed, but looking up at Goku's friendly smile you felt calm and returned the fist bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! Wow you punch hard, I bet you'll win the tournament in one swing!\", Goku let out a good laugh and Cole joined in. You found you couldn't resist your laughs either. <br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nYou tried to explain the situation the best you could. You left out how Goku was an anime character, rather saying that you and Cole got sucked into a portal and ended up here at this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku took to the story and offered to let them stay with him intill they could figure how to return them to their world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Cole sat in the center of Goku's palm as he closed his fist around the both of you, to secure you for the flight back. As  Goku flew, a little light poured into the warm and dark fist. Cole leaned against you as you rubbed his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we'll be safe?\", your brother asked. You smiled and ruffled his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Don't you remember, Goku helps protect earth. He saves planets and defeat bad guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....He reminds me of dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed out. Much like your father, Goku smiled and laughed with them. He helped you and Cole when there was trouble. He even fistbumped and then gave a hearty laugh afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....he is.\", looking down you saw Cole had fallen asleep. You smiled before laying down on the soft palm and let sleep consume you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku soon landed outside his house. As he opened his hand he saw you and Cole huddled up together fast asleep. The Saiyan smiled at the both of you before walking over to a hill and laying down. He then gently placed you and Cole on his right pectoral before putting his arms behind his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku saw the brotherly bond you had. He felt a connection to the two boys and could sense some sort of sadness in you both. Frowning, Goku gently used his finger to rub the top of the brothers heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Nick and Cole. I promise I'll protect you, and no danger will come to you as long as I'm around.\", smiling Goku looked out at the setting sun and felt sleep affect him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the morning came and......</span></div></div>",
