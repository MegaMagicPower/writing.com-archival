The heart meeter next to her is going in a strait line, poor girl. She has light brown hair that goes to her neck, and she has a stained, bloody yellow short skirt, and a green shirt that was too ruined to tell what it use to say. Her eyes where closed, and her face looked like, \"Would you like to by some girl scout cookies?\" Then you fell a sucking felling to the little girl, and you finally open your eyes, in human form. <br>\r\nYou feel uncomfortable, not like yourself, but you don't have time to notice that as the sounds go off, the auto breather doing the breathing for you, and the heart meeter beeping at last. People rush in, pushing past the woman who had moved your soul. They swarm around you, putting more needles in your new arm, and making so much noise you almost scream. After hours of looking and sticking shots in your limbs, the doctors leave you feeling worse than you felt waking up. <br>\r\nThe nurse walks over to you, unhooks the auto breather, and asks, \"How are you sweetie?\"<br>\r\n\"Um, where am I?\" you ask in a cute little girl voice. You stumble with your breath and can hardly breath. Before the doctors could rush back in, she hooks the auto breather back up to you, and you relax again. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry we couldn't find a boy body for you,\" she tells you in a pleasing voice. \"I know this is very uncomfortable, but this girl needed help, and you did to, so we had to compromise.\" Well, since she mentioned it, you where really uncomfortable.

There are so many question you want to hammer he with, why was I here, why am I in this body, why do I feel so uncomfortable? But right now, you are really tiered, so you sleep. <br>\r\nYou wake up with sores all around your body, needles in your arm, and weaker that before. You lay there for what seems like a million years, till the nurse comes in, her red hair in a pony tail. She comes over and runs some tests you've never herd of.<br>\r\n\" Are you ready to try the breather again?\" she says with such light Australian you didn't notice it until now. You are terrified that you will not be able to breath again, but you wanted to breath on your own. She unhooks the breather from you, and you are able to breath. <br>\r\n\"Whew, I can breath,\" you say. You jump a bit on how little girl like your voice sounds. <br>\r\n\"Yes, you can,\" the nurse says relived. You try to sit up, but you can't even tighten your stomach. You weakly pull your hands up to your hair, which is long and to your shoulder, but it is very wild and all over the place. <br>\r\n\"Why do I look like this,\" you start. Then, you can't breath and you gasp for air. She hooks the breather on, and you relax again. <br>\r\nShe goes back in the hall way, and returns with a TV. She sets up a movie, The Last One Standing, which is kind of babyish. You watch the movie, disabled, and the nurse pops in and gives you an orange tasting liquid ever now and then. Then you hear a screaming across the hall right when the movie gets good. You hear the screaming again and a \"AH AH!\" sound. After a little while, you hear a \"Awwwww,\" and a baby screaming. You know you just heard a baby being born, and you want to close the door right then. You can't move your small body so you try to use the force. No luck, why couldn't be in the body of darth vader or something. Then the nurse pops in and shuts the door behind her. She gives you an IV's in your arm,and inserts some clear liquid, and then she sits next to you. <br>\r\n\"I know you can't look at yourself, but you look really cute,\" she tells you. Then she gets you to open your mouth, and she gives you a slushy. You manage to put your lips around it, and you sip it.
