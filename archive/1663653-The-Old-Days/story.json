They I saw him, his eyes were dark green, having the light of the flames reflecting on his eye glasses making it look like tears inside his eyes, his brown hair long and loose on his shoulders, his muscles fit and strong. I was swayed when I saw him, but the feeling wasn\u2019t mutual when he saw me, the anger filed his face and yelled \u201cGET OUT, YOU CANNOT STAY, HE WILL IMPRISON YOU THE SAME HE DID TO ME LEAVE NOW.\u201d  He grabbed me arm and pushed me out from the throne room and yelled out again. </span></div></div>",

I saw a huge creature coming towards me, once I was thrown out of the throne room, a huge red, creature with blue eyes, and very harsh skin. The creature grabbed me and sent me back to the throne room, when the man said in anger \u201cI TOLD TO LEAVE\u201d the creature then looked at him and said \u201cwell you got company of your own kind and not just that, instead of the thrown room the two of you are going to spend your whole life in my castle in the dungeons zone\u201d the man put his hand on his forehead and in a furious gesture said \u201couch\u201d</span></div></div>",

I felt the contrast of the lucious grass and the cold hard earth collide with my face and body as I rolled to a stop just in front of a tall oak tree a few feet in front and a little to the right of the large wooden doors that held bewildering secrets and that strong, wild looking man behind them. I sat up and put my hands on the earth and thrust upward with my arms to raise myself onto my feet. Now that I was finally standing up, it was time to take a few steps forward and try to help that man inside. If it were me, I would certainly want help. The way he talked to me did not leave the impression that he wanted to be there. I didn't leave room for any more thoughts to wiggle their way into my head to keep me from changing my mind. Then it was decided, moving each foot in front of the other one at a time, I reached the doors, sighed, and then pushed the heavy door open and crept inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis must not have been the way I came in because it was dark, and all i could hear were mice and rats scurrying about the room and the pitter patter of my own two converse adorned feet. My heart began to race, prespiration was building up at the beginning of my hairline, above my lip, and any other crevices along my body. I had never liked the dark, but being in a place that wasn't my home made it that much worse. I heard myself let out a blood curdling scream as I felt two, strong arms sweep me up and lift me far away from the cold stone floors. Raising me higher to his face, it was the man I had seen before, but closer to his face he was more handsome than I had recalled from a few minutes before. His dark green eyes seemed to boar into my very soul, and it was a connection I had never felt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh!\" He dragged his big beefy index finger up to his thin lips, and made an annoyed, but yet worried face. \"I told you not to come in here! What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to listen to what he was saying, but the words drifted out as I saw a large, black, odd looking figure approach behind him. I tried to speak and tell him to look out, but the words would not reach the surface of my lips. Then I heard him curse and yell as he was being drug farther into the darkness, and my behind landed with a loud crack as I hit the floor. Everything went black in just a matter of seconds. Who would help the man now?</span></div></div>",

The crazy hippies were at it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one thought much of it when the rag tag bunch of pot-polluted, guitar playing folks moved in to the abandoned copper mine. They brought their crafts, their fashions, their music and yes, their drugs. I watched them from afar, fascinated by a lifestyle so completely different from my own. They were aliens from normal society and now, at this very moment, I could somehow understand -- at least in part -- how they must feel and what drove them to such a strange existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, I felt that the stranger's agitation toward me was drug induced. My sudden presence startled him and fuel some type of \"fight or flight\" response. I raised my arm in front of me, faced my palm toward him, and sang ever so gently, \"Picture yourself in a boat on a river...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped. His muscles relaxed. A slow smile came over his handsome face. He cast a gentle look toward me and said \"Lucy. You are Lucy. The sky. The diamonds. It's you, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my face redden. He was gorgeous. At that moment, I would have done anything for him, including changing my name to Lucy. So of course I said, \"Yes, I'm Lucy. And the diamonds are in your eyes, the sky is in your heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no idea what that meant, but he seemed to like it. He reached for my outstretched arm and took my hand in his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, come with me. I have something to show you.\" He was laughing now and so was I. Momentarily, I thought of my best friend and how she would simply curl up and die with jealously if she could see me at this moment. But before I could dwell on that thought, my new friend had me scurrying back through the marble covered passageways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" I asked my new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morrison,\" he said. \"But my friends call me ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't finish the sentence because at that moment, we emerged into the light of day. But this was not in the same place where I had entered the building. It was an outside garden, of sorts. I had never seen plants like these. And throughout the garden, there were strange colored objects, metal contraptions that had been painted and twisted into unusual forms. Swirly objects that reached for the heavens, pointed objects that hinted at every direction imaginable, some with water endlessly flowing across their surfaces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stood in silence as we looked across the magical landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Morrison said, \"This is why you came here, isn't it?\" His smile broadened and his eyes twinkled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know what to say, so I dodged the question. \"Well, Morrison, what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed out loud and did a little dance in a circle. \"I knew it! I knew it! Lucy, I had the vision that you would come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached in his pocket and pulled out a small, red, velvet pouch. \"I've been saving this for you,\" he said as he handed it to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI held the pouch in my hands for a moment, not knowing what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open it. Go ahead,\" he urged, ever more excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at him and then back at the pouch. I shook it, and objects rattled in its belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy! Open it!\" He was clapping his hands together in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly undid the ribbon that held the contents inside, and then I spilled the contents out upon my hand. I gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are these... are these....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Morrison laughed. \"Yes, Lucy! They are diamonds!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lightning split the diamonds resting on their satin pouch held upon my palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brilliant luster of the jewels faded. Before our eyes now lay small lumps of coal in their sted. \"I told you,\" wailed Morrison, flinging himself back to the entrance bringing us here. It closed around his escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world I had entered held me captive. The storm gathered and flung each colorful metal contraption I thought of as surreal art, into a warlike threatening pose.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear drenching me to the bone with each tear falling from the sky, I threw the coal stones at the threatening horde advancing upon me.  </span></div></div>",
