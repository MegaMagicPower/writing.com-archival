In the last weeks, Shinji had cooked more than usual. Not because he wanted to intentionally fatten up the girls that lived in one house with him, but because he simply liked to cook. If there wouldn't have been the angels he had to fight against, he would have liked to become a cook himself. Asuka and Rei did not eat much more than usual. When they had enough they just stopped eating. But not so Misato. It seemed like she had to continue eating until all the leftovers were gone, even if she wasn't hungry at all. Shinji did not know that, so he cooked a bit more from meal to meal because he allways thought that the curvy young women was still hungry. </span></div></div>",

This resulted in him cooking more tan unusual and because Misato always ate the leftovers, it slowly started to show. She stood in her room, putting on her bra. She noticed that it was a bit more difficult than usual to close it at the back. \"How can it be the twins are still growing at my age. Besides I always had the opinion that they are already big enough\", she thought. Misato pulled out white trousers and put them on. Here she had to pull afew times to get them over her ass. \"Must have shrunk in the wash\", she thought. She just didn't want it to be true, that she had gained a little. Misato left the room and entered the bathroom. A penguin just came out of it. \"Morning Penpen\", she moaned, scratching her back. When Misato entered the kitchen, she saw Shinji making breakfast. \"Oh, good morning Shinji-kun\", she said. Shinji turned around to carry another plate of pancakes to the table. There were eight plates of pancakes now, all of them having ten pencakes on them. Soon afterwards Asuka also entered the room. \"Morning Shinji-Idiot\", she said. Suddenly the doorbell rang. \"Coming\", shouted Shinji. Rei stood in the doorway. \"Good morning Shinji-kun\", she said with her shy and timid voice. \"Good morgning Ayanami\", replied Shinji and guided her in. \"Oh, Misato, I forgot to mention that I invited Rei over for breakfast\", he told Misato. \"Oh, that's bad, because we also have anothrer Eva-Pilot as a visitor\", replied Misato. \"Another one?\", thought Asuka, her mouth filled with a pencake. Just then the doorbell rang again. There stood a young girl with brown hair which she had made to two pony-tails. She wore glasses, but that didn't make her less attractive. She had a beautifull face and a curvy figure. She wore a white button up shirt and a skirt. Her E-cup boobs pushed against the shirt. \"Hello Mari\", Shinji said, guiding the pilot of EVA-05 into the house. \"Very kind of you to invite me\", she said gently. The four girls sat down at the table, and Shinji carried in the pancakes. Misato opened a can of beer and started to instantly dig in. The three girls first looked a bit puzzled, but than also helped theirselves to some pancakes. Shinji ate two pancakes, as usual. He was surprised, that Mari, the new EVA- pilot was able to put away eight pencakes, before she leaned back with a belly that was a little swollen. After her fourth pencake, which she had eaten very slowly, Ayanami said: \"I'm sorry but I can not eat anymore.\" So there was more left for the other two girls. </span></div></div>",

Although Misato still had eaten those enthusiastically, there were about 50 pancakes left yet. Seeing the pile of big pancakes again, Misato said with her mouth full by 9th pancake. \"I'm always trying to eat everything that has been served, but yes, today's are a little too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinji scratched his cheek in awkwardly. \"Well, Now that you say that, I have a feeling so...would you like another one, Asuka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I'm replete.\" Asuka refused and patted her barely noticeable bloated tummy. She was unaware of the fact that the amount of her meals had increased little by little recently. \"I think, Shinji, you have to take the responsibility and eat every leftover. You shouldn't waste these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No way!\" said Shinji hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, Mari?\" Asuka gave a glance to the glasses-wearing girl, but then looked at her in disbelief. She was eating her 11th pancakes! \"You don't finished yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I had just rest for a bit.\" Mari grinned. \"I had never eaten the meal cooked by you, Shinji-kun, but that's soooo good! You have a flair for cooking. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mari.\" Shinji smiled shyly. \"But are you really alright? You look like already full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll be...\" Mari paused, let out a big unladylike belch, and blushed slightly. To tell the truth, she felt much bloated but she was unwilling to stop eating. \"...Excuse me. Anyway, I'll be able to eat more than Misato-san. These are *<i>Urp</i>* too good to stop eating!\" Rubbing her visibly swollen belly, Mari eagerly bit into 12th pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It almost made the other three feel uncomfortable how much the two young women were able to stuff into her former flat stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whole hour later, Mari and Misato both had eaten 20 pencakes more. Now they laid back on the ground, moaning in pain because of all the food they had eaten. \"Puh\", said Mari and let out an unladylike belch. Both of them were trying to rub their overstuffed tummies. \"Shinji, you're a good cook indeed\", said Misato. \"Yes, but if this is kept up, I'll have problems fitting into my fighting suit\", said Mari, patting her belly. Shinji just stared at the two of them. He knew that they were sort of crazy, but only in terms of fighting angels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm gonna take a nap\", said Asuka and stood up. She made her way to hers and Shinjis room. \"May I sleep on the couch?\", Rei asked shyly, and some kind of color was showing in her pale face. \"Yes, I think so\", said the young boy. \"Is this OK Misato San...?\", he wanted to ask, but he saw that the other two girls had already fallen asleep in their chairs. Penpen walked into the room and looked a little confused. But without taking any further notice of the humans he went into the bathroom again. \"Well then\", the boy told himself. He took all the plates and started cleaning up. But he was trying not to be too loud, to not awaken one of the girls. He somehow liked how they were looking, with their bellies stuffed. He decided to do those big meals more often. </span></div></div>",

So the girls did much less sports than usual and on top of that ate more than ever before in their lives. So Misato wasn't the only one having trouble with her dresses. In the beginning, Asuka was about 130 cm tall and weight 45 kilos. This would be 5'1 and about 100lbs. Rei on the other hand was a little curvier but of the same height. She was also about 5'1 but weight 104 lbs/ 47 kg. Captain Misato Katsuragi was much taller than the two teenagers. Let's assume she was 163 cm/ 5'4 and weight 74kg/ 163lbs. The new EVA-Pilot Mari was about 161 cm tall and weight about 62 kilos which would be 5'3 and 137 lbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all the stuffing had not only taken an impact on Misato, but also on the other three. Shinji seemed to be the only one who didn't gain weight at all, but he enjoyed the sight of the girls doing so. Rei had gained the smallest amount. But even though there were 8 kilos more on her bones. Most of the weight went to her belly, making it look as if she was pregnant but also her boobs and her butt moved out a little. She was now at 55 kilos. Seeing that Shinji light bigger girls, Asuka tried hard to become bigger than Rei. She gained 10 kilos in the same time, making her also 55 kg. Most of the weight she gained went into her ass, making it look like the start of a ghetto-booty. She began having problems fitting into her hot-pants. Misato, who had already gained four kilos before now gained a whooping 17 kilos in this time. But she didn't have much problems with it because most of the weight went into her boobs, which now were a J-Cup instead of the usual F-cup. Mari seemed to be on a mission to complete her hourglass-shape. It seemed like not a single pound had gone to her belly, but it all was showing in her boobs and hips. She had gained 14 kilos which were really visible on her 161 cm. It was even more difficult for her to find a fitting plugsuit now, but at least she wasn't the only one, having this problem. </span></div></div>",

But I also don't want to abandon Kaede\", thought Yuka. \"Even though she is peacefull now, I have to think of a way to keep it all save, even if she goes mad again.\" Yuka looked out of the window, where Nana and Kaede played in the garden. Nana wore a blue robe whereas Kaede had decided to put on a yellow top and tight hot-pants. Yuka had to admit she was a little jealous of Kaedes body. Nana and the other diclonious played with a little red ball. They both put so much effort in it, as if they both had to win this competition at all costs. It was always the same. The two girls always wanted to beat each other in each and every contest possible, even if it would only be about cleaning the house. Yuka looked at the food she had prepared. Than she had an idea. \"That's it! If I tell Kaede, she is always eating way less than Nana, maybe she'll eat more. That would have two advantages: First of all she'd be less dangerous and what's far more important, she will get fat and ugly eventually. Than Kota will be all mine.\" Yuka smiled. She was happy about her idea and continued cooking. Todays evening, she would prepare a meal like never before. \"Hey Yuka, can I help you?\", Kota asked from behind. \"Oh yes, you might help me prepare dinner, favorite cousin\", Yuka said. \"OK\", replied Kota. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they cooked for a while and both enjoyed each others company. \"Isn't that a bit much?\", Kota asked as they were about to cook the eighth pot, instead of usually having one pot for five people. \"I don't think so, but you could call the three girls in\", said Yuka smiling at him. \"OK\", he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later, Kota and the four girls sat around the table. They spoke a little prayer and started to eat. In front of each of them there was a big bowl of rice, meat and vegetables. There was so much food, it didn't even fit on the table. It all went as Yuka had planned. Kota, Mayu and Yuka herself only ate two plates as usual. Kaede and Nana both ate four plates and they were about to finish. But Yuka said: \"Don't let it go to waste. Here take another one\", and so she handed another plate to Nana, but only a small one. At least she didn't want Nana to get fat. Nana dug in and the rest worked on it's own. Kaede filled a plate herself. One that was much bigger than Nanas. When the little girl was finished, she saw the taller one had taken more and went for another plate. So did Kaede. Slowly but surely their bellies got rounder and rounder, pushing against their trousers. None of them wanted to lose. They didn't even slow down but just shoveled in more and more food. Nana clearly ate far less, but that didn't seem to wonder anyone. Kota didn't dare to interfere, as the dicloniis bellies got bigger and rounder. Now they even used their vectors, to shovel in so much food, that a normal human would have died by the sheer amount. Lucy now was way quicker and another two hours later, all the food in the entire house was gone and there laid two girls on the floor with huge bellies, unable to move.   </span></div></div>",

There were so many, that the room appeared to be totally grey. \"Hey police-girl. I guess this is goodbye\", he said and fired his gun again. Every shot hit a head and the Vampires died, but there were just too many and they ran to quickly. Seras fired a rocket. A giant explosion killed several enemies. But another one came through the room, and bit Pit's neck. Blood came out, and Pit fell down, smiling. Seras screamed in anger. She fired another two rockets. One went to the vampires, and one made part of the room come down, so that a few zombies died under the pure pressure. The wall of garbage gave them a little time to breathe. Seras kneeled down beside Pit, breathing heavily which made her G-cup boobs lift and fall. She was out of breath. Suddenly she heared Pit's voice whisper: \"Miss police-girl.\" She ran towards him. \"I'm gonna die\", he said. Seras was about to cry. \"Oh, don't you cry about me. You shall know I loved you, police-girl\", he said. She staid calm. \"Drink my blood, so that you can become a full vampire and defeat those nazis\", said Pit. And so she did. She felt a strange Sensation, and than she felt stronger than ever before. She stood up. Shadows grew behin the girl and as soon as the Zombis came in sight, they grew and flew towards them. Afterwards the shadows ripped the enemies into pieces. \"REVENGE!\", shouted Seras. She rushed out and killed everyone who came near her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo Zombie survived and soon the vanished from the Hellsing-Headquater. Her masters zombies were also gone. Alucard, now in his form of Vlad Dracul had extincted the last battalion, including his former friend and Integra Hellsings butler Walter. Slowly the city was built up again. At night, Seras helped as much as she could, at day she sleeped. But a few days later, she noticed something: becoming a full vampire had not only effected her powers</span></div></div>",
