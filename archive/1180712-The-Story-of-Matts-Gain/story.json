In time the blades of light woke Matt up from his slumber, breaking through his deep dreams of the days on stage in the band. Within seconds Matt came back to reality and remembered how his band had split just one month ago. The split was still painful to Matt, and he was in no mood to face the press once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a stumble Matt picked his sculpted body out of bed, closed the blinds, and went back to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust minutes later Matt's phone began to ring, and woke him yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hullo?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey Matt' the voice replied, and Matt recognized it as the voice of the bands previous manager, 'gotta rush but just to let you know we've been talking about you guys and we've decided we want to take you forward into a solo career!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I...I just, well, don't know what to say?!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No need to say anything Matt, just meet us at the studio tomorrow at 10am, sharp! Bye dude.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll be there! Thanks!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt felt great! He decided it was time for a celebration. He got up, put on his 30'' jeans and tight muscle tee, and tidied up the flat. He invited his best mates Jason and Aaron over to share a pizza or three, a few beers and a glass or two of champagne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Matt didn't have to tour yet, and had light at the end of the tunnel with a solo career, he debating whether to take a month to relax. Things like forgetting the gym and eating whatever whenever for a while, to chill out. Then again if Matt's going to launch a solo career it might be good if he goes to the gym more and bulk up weight wise so that he can boast larger arm muscles at least!</span></div></div>",

However the phone just kept ringing and ringing until Matt had had enough and decided to get the phone. Picking up the phone Matt recognised the voice of his manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManager - \"Hey Matt I just wanted the give you the good news. I got a call from a company about half an hour ago saying that they wanted to sponsor you and help fund your career in anyway possible. They said that you have the look that they were after or something like that...\"<br>\r\nMatt - \"That's fantastic! What's the company?\"<br>\r\nManager - \"They're a bakery I believe. I was a little unsure about it, but judging by the amount of money they're going to be paying us, I could tell they really wanted this sponsorship. They did have some odd terms and conditions though. Essentially you just have to promote their products in any music videos you do.\"<br>\r\nMatt - \"That sounds good to me. I just can't believe how well my career's going and it hasn't even been twenty four hours.\"<br>\r\nManager - \"Well I'm happy for you. I've got some guys coming in tomorrow who'll write some song lyrics for you first single. I'll call you when we're ready for you to start rehearsing.\"<br>\r\nMatt - \"Okay thanks. Bye.\"<br>\r\nManager - \"Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was still taken a back by the news. His solo career was off to a flying start and he was very happy. It looked like he was going to have nothing to do for the next few weeks so without much deliberation Matt decided he'd relax and just watch TV and order takeaways for the meantime.</span></div></div>",

Last night he'd ordered a couple of large pizzas and had eaten the lot. Patting his stomach Matt was unaware as it jiggled and bounced with each pat. Matt reached down to button up his jeans which had been tight around his swollen stomach. However as he tried to pull the the two flaps together he was greeted with an unexpected resistance. Slight confused Matt glanced down but had to rub his eyes to make sure he was seeing okay. Before him was the soft and doughy beginnings of his pot belly. Intrigued Matt poked and slapped it, surprised by how far he could poke his finger into it. Matt was able to grab a handful of flab which he shook disappointingly. As he let it drop, Matt's belly lay over his jeans. Matt tried to pull his jean flaps again and by sucking in his new gut as much as he could, was able to button them up. Unfortunately he now had a rather impressive muffin top that circled his waist and jiggled as he jumped up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt forced him self to go and stand on his scale and was surprised when he saw that he'd gained..</span></div></div>",

And just like that, Matt forgot all about his weight gain and carried on eating just as much junk food as he had been. For Matt simply pushing any thoughts about getting fat to the back of his mind was enough to let him stay in denial about his gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Matt stuck to wearing sweat pants and a baggy jumper as they were more comfortable. As his clothes were no longer constrictive Matt was unaware that he was continuing to gain weight so just carried on eating and eating and eating...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********************<br>\r\n*Another week later*<br>\r\n***********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending over to pick up the bag of jam doughnuts he'd just dropped on the floor, Matt stuck his expanded rear in the air. This caused the already strained fabric of his sweat pants to be stretched tight across his butt, gathering a few stares from a passing group of women. Matt licked his lips and hurriedly grabbed a doughnut from the bag and took a large bite of it. As Matt began walking to the recording studio the first bite of that doughnut was replaced by the second and then the next doughnut until he'd eaten all six in the bag. A filling snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the studio, the security guard had to ask Matt for ID as he barely recognized his new, expanded form. Matt now sported a noticeable double chin. Along with that chin had come some flabbier and jigglier arms, thick thighs that shook when he walked, a significantly more noticeable belly that hung of the waistband of Matt's sweatpants and a butt that was practically bursting out of clothes. Stunned to silence the guard let Matt into the studio where he met his manager for the first time in 3 weeks.</span></div></div>",

Where he was always a healthy eater and not much of a pizza and beer guy, he was giving Aaron a run for his money.<br>\r\nMatt thought that between his two friends, one with a big appetite and the other a fitness freak, he would get the perfect mix of ying and yang.  He'd get help with eating more to add some bulk to his body and a workout buddy to make sure that the new pounds were muscle.  As the afternoon continued both his buds vacuumed up the food.  Matt watched in amazement when Jason put down his plate and fumbled under a round ball of belly to unbutton his stressed jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAH,\" he sighed and drained his beer.  \"That's more like it.\"  He rubbed the mound and smiled. <br>\r\n\"You gonna share, fatboy?\"  <br>\r\nAaron shoved a pizza across to Jason.<br>\r\n\"Watch who you're calling fatboy.  I'm not the one popping out of my pants.  I think you are about one pizza short of a full blowout.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, let up chubby.  You know that I'm just bulking right now.  It is so much easier to add the weight and then convert it to muscle.  It was hell just getting to 185 and 5 % fat and nothing seemed to get me higher with the heavy workouts.  I just couldn't get enough calories to bulk up.  So I just laid off the workouts and started eating just like you.  Three months and I'm up 30 pounds.  When I get back on the program, I'll probably settle at 210 or so with 5%.  You'll still be 250 and 30%.\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever!\" Aaron got up to get another beer and slapped Jasons gut on the way.  It quivered softly.<br>\r\n\"That's no 5%.\"  He laughed.<br>\r\n\"That's great!\"  Matt took some pizza.  \"Because I want to beef up some for the tour.  Girls like some muscle in the chest and arms.  I guess I'm looking for a bulking phase too.  Gotta eat more and start working out so I was looking for you two guys to inspire and encourage me.  You know I'm not much of an eater and I've never worked out.  I need lots of help.\"<br>\r\nMatt hope that both of his friends can move in to help him get bigger.<br>\r\nAre they both available?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Aaron was also concerned that Matt was under the healthy body fat percentile to get himself to squeeze into those 30 inch jeans. He was also afraid of telling Matt his passions, as it could ruin a good friendship they had. It would be a little awkward to be friends if Matt knew Aaron loved him while Aaron knew that Matt only thought of him as a friend. Aaron had told Jason about the plan to fatten Matt, but Jason believed it was just some fun joke. Jason always had a twisted sense of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three had each fallen asleep in Matt\u2019s dorm. Matt woke up first to find his arms wrapped around Aaron. Matt had loved Aaron, but he was worried and frightened about how Aaron would react if Matt told the truth. Matt also enjoyed Aaron as a friend and was worried that the revelation of his affectation might ruin their amity. Matt managed to maneuver his muscular arms off Aaron without waking his friend. Matt felt a major hangover settling in, and it was only two in the afternoon of the same day. Through the haze of the head pains, he got to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt then got into his fridge, feeling painfully hungry again. He looked around and spotted some leftovers that were turning green. He pitched these, not wanting to eat them again in another drunken state. He then spotted some ice cream and a fresh few things of sushi. Did Matt eat the sushi or the ice cream?</span></div></div>",
