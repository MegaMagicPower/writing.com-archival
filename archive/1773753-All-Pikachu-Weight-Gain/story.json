He entered his room, where Pikachu was sleeping, set the bags on a table and started taking food out them. Pikachu woke up to the sound of rustling wrappers and walked up to his trainer, curious about what was going on. Ash noticed this and greeted his Chu \"Hi there, Pikachu! Are you hungry? I brought you some food.\" He unwrapped a super large cheeseburger and gave it to Pikachu, who started munching on it after curiously examining it. It was completely different from the usual Pok\u00e9 chow Ash fed him. Ash watched smiling and gave Pikachu a huge glass of cola. \"Here. You can wash it down with this.\" Pikachu happily did so and was soon finished with the burger. Ash smiled at his hungry friend again, dug into the bags and said \"Did you like it? There's plenty more for you, buddy.\" Ash handed another steaming burger to Pikachu, who replied with a happy \"Pika!\" and chowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Pikachu had miraculously managed to eat almost all of the food Ash had bought and was now lying on his back, his belly bloated to the point of almost bursting. Ash offered him one last burger, but got only a tired \"Urp... 'kachu.\" in response. Ash chuckled a bit, patted Pikachu's belly and said \"I guess you're completely satiated now. Fine, I'll just eat this last one myself. You can rest now.\" He still filled his bloated friend a bowl of chips in case he got peckish later on, before sitting down to enjoy his own burger. Pikachu just lied there and wondered why his trainer suddenly gave him so much delicious food before dozing off.</span></div></div>",

Since Pikachus digest food really quickly, he had already digested all the burgers Ash fed him the day before and now his stretched stomach was begging to be refilled. He checked the bowl of chips Ash had left him, but found it empty, remembering that he woke up in the middle of night feeling a little peckish and already ate all the chips then. The delicious smell coming from the kitchen didn't help Pikachu's hunger, so he decided to go investigate the source of it. Turned out it was Ash frying pancakes for his famished friend. \"Oh, you're already awake?\" Ash asked with a smile. \"I've been making you breakfast.\" Ash then picked up Pikachu and placed him on the table, noticing his newly-grown double chin and giving it a playful squeeze, saying \"Looks like you're already growing extra chins. Cute!\" Next Ash piled a towering stack of pancakes in front of Pikachu and drenched them with a generous helping of syrup. \"Dig in!\" Ash commanded and Pikachu was more than happy to oblige. It didn't take long for the hungry rodent to eat the entire stack of pancakes, but he still found himself hungry. Fortunately Ash was making more pancakes as fast as Pikachu could eat them, so there was a steady supply of them. Ash was all smiles the whole time, happy about seeing his friend get bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Pikachu found himself getting full and once more lied on his back, letting out a little belch. He was even more stuffed than the day before, prompting Ash to rub his bloated belly, which both of them enjoyed immensely. \"I'm glad you liked the pancakes, buddy.\" Ash said \"Later today I'm going to...\"</span></div></div>",

It was then Pikachu recalled the bowl of chips.  He picked up the bowl and brought it out of the room so he wouldn't disturb Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he felt he was far enough away so he wouldn't disturb anyone, Pikachu eyed the chips.  It was another food that was not part of his normal diet, but figured if it was anything like the burgers it had to be good.  He bit into one and instantly began hooked.  He ate them down by the handful finding the grease and salted chips to be quite addictive.  So much, in fact that before he knew it he had munched down every last crumb.  Still, it was not enough.  He wanted more to eat so he decided to see what was in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked down the stairs on all fours, feeling his belly felt a little bigger than normal.

At first, he didn't find anything of interest, just different cooking ingredients, and was feeling hungrier every moment. Just as Pikachu was about to give up, he found a box of sugary breakfast cereal. He remembered seeing Ash eat it, so he decided to give it a curious sniff and taste, finding the taste very nice, especially compared to the Pok\u00e9 chow he was usually fed. Since the box wasn't full, it didn't take long for Pikachu to empty it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hunger still not completely satiated, he continued searching the pantries. This time he got lucky and found a big box of chocolate chip cookies. He tore the box open and stuck a paw in, pulling out a big, delicious-smelling cookie. He first gave it a deep sniff and then a big bite, savoring the sweet taste. He ate the cookie in no time and dug in the box again, eating more and more cookies until the box was completely empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu patted his growing belly, enjoying the full feeling. Still, he wondered if he should have a little extra snack on top of all that, since he had found so many pleasant new flavours that night and was having such great fun stuffing himself.</span></div></div>",

Pikachu looked around before his eyes locked onto the fridge.  To a person it was a place to keep food cold, but to Pikachu it some place nice to rest by on a hot day.  He moved closer to it and tried to pry it open, but despite being unlocked he couldn't managed to budge it.  This only increased his determination.  he looked around for something to help him when he saw the broom resting against the wall.  He carried it to the fridge and placed it through the handle.  He then pushed against it to help him pry the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he door opened light was emitted before Pikachu making the sight before him even more wonderous.  Pikachu's mouth opened wide seeing it packed full of food.  The cold air felt nice against his fur and he searched the items on the first shelf.  He found a box of chocolate donuts and removed it from the fridge.  He found it wasn't even opened giving himself a dozen donuts to eat.  He gave the first one a few experimental bites before he started stuffing his mouth full of them, coating his mouth all over with chocolate.  After his third he grew thirsty and climbed the shelves to the top where the milk was and cautiously brought it down.  He was glad it was only half full or he'd have never been able to bring it down.  He then held uncapped it and held it over his head as he let it flow into his mouth and down his throat.  After three big gulps he returns to the donuts and scarfs some more down chasing them with more milk.  He repeated this process this he finished them both off and his belly wobbled from all the food.  Pikachu let out a belch that made him pause for a moment thinking he might wake somebody up, but he soon found his worry was for nothing.  With that he returned to the fridge.

With some effort, he pulled it out of the fridge and sat down on his widened rear, admiring the yellow, delicious treat. It was completely untouched, Ash had probably just purchased it with Pikachu in mind. Next, Pikachu closed his eyes and took a deep whiff of the wheel, savoring the moment, before biting into it. The rich, creamy taste hit his taste buds, making him moan in delight. Starting with small nibbles, Pikachu soon found himself biting out bigger and bigger chunks. His mouth was full of the tasty cheese which he munched with contented bliss, losing any track of time and, before he knew it, nothing but a small piece was left. Pikachu picked it up, leaned backwards and threw final bit of cheese in his mouth. As he swallowed it, he noticed how much his belly was bulging. It had positively ballooned thanks to all the food he had been filling it with and was finally getting rather full. Pikachu wondered if he should go back to sleep or if he should have one more little snack.</span></div></div>",

With his hands he held his large gut and brought himself to his feet.  He then waddled to the door and pushed at it with his rear, feeling just how much larger it had become as it pressed against the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it closed with a \"click\" he let out a yawn and rubbed his eyes causing his belly to plop down and cause him to tumble forward till he bumped into the wall.  He laid in a daze for a moment before he got up again and actually took a good look at his body.  It was certainly a good deal pudgier than he or any other Pikachu should have been.  Even when food was abundant Pikachu didn't have an appetite one might expect from a Munchlax and Pikachu himself didn't consider him an exception to the rule, at least until now.  He recounted all the food he ate and noted it was completely off from his usual diet, not to mention a lot more delicious and addictive.  Just thinking about it made Pikachu drool a bit.  He was lost in his fantasy of all the foods he got to taste that he almost dozed off in the kitchen, but he snapped out of it and returned his focus to getting up to Ash's room.  The stairs proved a lot harder going up now, but it only slowed him down a bit.  At the top he quietly made his way to Ash's room and made it to his spot on the bed and curled into a ball, noticing his newly formed fat acted like an extra comfy pillow.  He smiled figuring if Ash wanted him to eat more and change his diet why should he complain?  He was liking the extra pudge.  Just as he was about to sleep he turned to Ash, thinking he was looking at him, but he was still sound asleep.  As Pikachu slept, visions of all the goodies he wanted to eat tomorrow swirled in his head.</span></div></div>",

Bite in!\" Pikachu eagerly did so as, thanks to his little night time adventure, he had slept until noon and was getting quite peckish. The pancakes were absolutely drenched in syrup, with a large slab of butter on top, and tasted wonderful as Pikachu soon discovered. Ash just smiled as he watched Pikachu fill his belly. \"I noticed that someone had raided the kitchen last night.\" Ash remarked \"Don't worry, I'm not upset. Wouldn't want you to starve, buddy. You could've just woken me up though, I wouldn't mind fixing you up a little late night snack.\" he continued with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Pikachu had eaten all the pancakes and was lying on his back, satiated, as Ash rubbed his belly. \"You're getting pudgier.\" Ash noted and playfully pinched Pikachu's newly-developed fat roll \"...and all the more cuter.

In order to cope, he watched the Pokemon workers helping out.  There was a duo or Machops kneading the dough and getting it in shape.  There was also a few fire type pokemon that that worked to cook the pizzas in the oven.  He watched them work and before he knew it, it was their turn to order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you like today, sir?\" asked the girl at the register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think buddy?\" asked Ash to Pikachu.  \"Will a small pizza be enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pi pika pi!\" Pikachu answered holding his arms to make a circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, a medium then,\" replied Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pi!

His trainer had once again started another journey and as per usual left all his other Pokemon, save for Pikachu, at Professor Oak's Lab so he could work to train a new team of Pokemon.  Unfortunately, Ash had little luck in the first few weeks they arrived.  Ash had yet to capture any Pokemon and to make matters worse they were lost and hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu had hoped that Ash would find some more human companions to travel with him, but they had yet to see a tomboyish girl on a bicycle or Brock suddenly showing up out of the blue.  As much as Pikachu knew Ash would take care of him he knew that Ash wasn't the most capable when it came to things like cooking and Pokemon care.  That and the fact that a group of three can carry more supplies than one also made a difference considering how long it could be before they find another Pokemon center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pikachu's stomach grumbled again Ash decided to stop so they could have lunch.  He went into his pack and poured Pikachu what was left inside a can of Pokemon Food into Pikachu's bowl, but it was only enough to fill half his bowl.  Out of worry for his friend, Ash took his last sandwich he had for himself and gave half to Pikachu as well.  Not wanting to be ungrateful and just from sheer hungry Pikachu hopped of Ash's shoulder and gobbled down all his food in no time at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu gave a slight burp, happy that his stomach wasn't starving, but it was hardly enough to fill him up.  He looked around the trees for some berries, but they had little luck fighting any let alone one that wasn't already taken by a group of Pokemon that weren't eager to share.  As Pikachu waited for Ash to finish eating he couldn't help imagining tons and tons of food to eat.  He didn't care if he got a little pudgy, he didn't even care if he ended up so obese he couldn't walk; the delight of being able to feel stuffed never sounded so appealing to him, but he shook such thoughts from his head.  He would have liked for his dream to come true, but for now he figured thinking about food would only make him hungry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Pikachu,\" said Ash walking up to his friend.  \"Time to get going.\"  Pikachu climbed up on his trainer's shoulder and they were off.</span></div></div>",

Not wasting a moment, Ash ran inside and up to the Nurse Joy inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there,\" she said.  \"How may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please take care of my Pikachu,\" he asked.  \"It's been a while since we've been to a Pokemon Center.  I think if nothing else, a good meal tonight would help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash handed Pikachu to Nurse Joy she replied.  \"Don't worry.  He'll be taken care of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ash went to get himself something to eat and talk to some of the other trainers resting.  Nurse Joy brought Pikachu in the back and did the usual tests to make sure he was health.  \"Everything looks normal,\" she told Pikachu.  \"You just need some food and a little rest and you'll be right as rain.  She walked over to the computer and input it into the computer to add Pikachu to the list of Pokemon that need to be fed for dinner.  No sooner had she done it another trainer rushed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nurse Joy!\" he cried cradling his Pokemon in his arms.  \"My Skitty isn't feeling well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the little Pokemon's forehead and answered.  \"Looks like it's got a fever.  Come with me into the next room and we'll make it feel all better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they left Pikachu patted its stomach, feeling hungry again and recalling his earlier desires to eat as much food as he could.  He knew such a thing wouldn't happen at the Pokemon Center since they made sure to keep all the Pokemon on a balanced diet.  He saw how they input how much food each Pokemon would need on the computer.  He saw other Nurse Joys use it during past checkups.  It was then he noticed that after getting distracted by that other trainer, Nurse Joy had forgot to submit Pikachu's information into the system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way over and took a look.  All the information was present, but it just wasn't submitted, meaning Pikachu could change it by himself, he did see it done in the past.  It was a touch screen and all one needed to do was go through a list of Pokemon to indicate how much food they required.  Looking at the results for a Pikachu, it was only a single bowl.  Pikachu felt he could eat more than that and decided to test some other Pokemon out.  He started with a Snorlax and his eyes opened wide as it would be given a ton of food all to itself.  Naturally, Pikachu figured he couldn't get away with something like that.  It was too noticeable and they'd change it.  He tried a Munchlax and found they get ten bowls of Pokemon food.  That sounded more acceptable, but the list had  a lot of other Pokemon in it too.</span></div></div>",

This foods amazing!\" He managed to call out between subsequent mouthfuls.<br>\r\n\"Pika-pi!\" Pikachu agreed loudly between mouthfuls of his own.<br>\r\nDelia let out a delighted laugh as she walked back into the dining room, carrying two more plates of food for when the hungry pair finished their first. \"I'm glad you two are enjoying it, I didn't have much time to prepare because you just showed up rather than giving me any warning!\" She said pointedly at Ash as she placed the second round of plates down.<br>\r\n\"Shorry mum~\" Ash managed to say with a full mouth, spraying crumbs across the table.<br>\r\nDelia simply laughed again, happy to have her son home. \"Don't worry about it, just enjoy your food~\" She said, quickly striding back into the kitchen to continue cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following hour passed in a flash for Pikachu and Ash, the two travellers caught up in eating every plate of food Delia put in front of them, their usual limits obliterated by their hunger and the delicious taste of Delia's cooking.<br>\r\nFinally, the plates stopped, and Pikachu and Ash finished off their sixth plate and lay back in their chairs, their stuffed tummies sticking out.<br>\r\n\"Sorry dears, I would love to give you more but I've run out of food, I don't keep much around here for just myself.\" Delia apologised, a truly sad look on her face.<br>\r\n\"Don't *URP* worry mum, I *URP* couldn't each much more *URP* anyway.\" Ash said, slowly rubbing her bloated tummy as his eyes drooped low.<br>\r\n\"Well I promise to have more for breakfast tomorrow.
