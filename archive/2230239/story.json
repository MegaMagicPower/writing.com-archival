You are no longer a well equipped hero with the finest weapons, or a powerful dark lord with a multitude of spells at your disposal. No. You are just a mere hermit living in a forested area in a shack you built living off on the land. Over the last year your memories of your life in the old world, your life as a hero, and your life as a villain are returning. You find it hard to believe that once upon a time a regular person like yourself could rise up to be a champion of goodness and justice, only to be reborn as black hearted monster. You occasionally find yourself musing about how far reaching your legacies are in the current state of Illyrium. You haven't been to any town or city in forever now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rain beats on your cloaked self on the way back to your shack you ponder on what your next course of action will be with the slowly returning memories coming back to you. You open the door to your shack, take off your rain coak, and reveal yourself to be? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: Male <br>\r\nOption #2: Female. You used to be male in your past lives, but for some reason you're female in this one<br>\r\nOption #3: Female. You were born a girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It stinks but it's the only thing you can think of at the moment. You are lost and aimless now. Where can you go from here? What can you do that you have not already done in your last two lives? Far as you know adventuring has probably changed since your last death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of death, what is going to happen when you inevitably die again? Will you truly die this time, or will you merely come back to life after a Truck-Kun only knows how long set of time? Are you even capable of being released from this mortal coil now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these questions and the doubts you brought about after thinking of more questionable past actions have ridden you with uncertainty. Perhaps only time will tell when you escape this hole you dug for yourself. You do know however; returning to your old world is absolutely out of the question. It wouldn't matter if you could go back. For better or worse Illyrium is your home now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guess it isn't all bad. You can feel some of power of your old lives returning at a glacial pace, and you retained a few spells too. Furthermore, your third life's body is physically around the late teens-early twenties range and you do keep yourself in shape. You believe yourself capable of handling most threats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a deep yawn as you head to your bed. Tomorrow may be a big day for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: You wake up to a female scream for help<br>\r\nOption #2: You wake up to go explore parts of the forest you have yet to walk in. There could be a lot things there. Like the path to an ancient pyramid full of treasure, spooky scary stuff like ghouls/certain Navajo shape shifters that also exist in this world waiting for you in the deep woods, or campers who need help. <br>\r\nOption #3: You wake to find a Wood Elf thief girl making breakfast out of your provisions.<br>\r\nOption #4: You set off to explore further than your forest<br>\r\nOption #5: Reader's choice </span></div></div>",

You feel as if you can never be a hero again, but maybe in the service of the divine you can try to atone for your sins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #3: The allure of power and your old dark lady outfit is too much for you.

Something that struck fear into millions of people after Spielberg released his film and caused some deaths. Fortunately for you in Illyrium this thing exists. In this world there are three types of sharkgirls, but all three types are known for their strength, excellent swimming skills, being notorious horndogs around human men, and their boldness. By Truck-Kun are they bold. You know from experience that they're incredibly audacious as their teeth is sharp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your first life early hero career you and a befriended native of Illyrium who saved your skin more times than you can count were tasked to deal with a band of sharkgirls causing trouble for a seaside town. When you arrived at the beach you and your friend soon made contact with the troublemakers. You were quickly at the mercy of this band of four led by their mother. She gave your friend an ultimatum you are still surprised about; have sex with her and her daughters right then and there, become their husband, or else they would sink their fangs into you and continue to stir trouble for the town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't really blame them for being interested in your friend. The guy looked exactly like the Chad meme from your old life's internet. Heck, you were even got jealous watching them get his baby batter pumped into them. The day ended with watching your friend cut ties with you as his new wives took him back to their cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if his descendents are out there in the oceans swimming around and harassing men too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier today while you were searching for a few extra ingredients for your monstergirl potion you found something awfully convenient on the bank of the a that runs in the forest. A bull shark's carcass that the scanvers of the forest kindly left enough for you to use. This works out for you as you can take the bull shark's ability to swim in salt and fresh waters for yourself. Most sharkgirls have to use spells and magical items for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only downside you see to becoming a sharkgirl is the issue of the whole lust thing. You've heard of instance of sharkgirls going after boys young as eleven, and even saw one case of this happening. You're kinda sure that in some places in Illyrium /ss/ time is okay and even encouraged, and you were into that particular fetish since your early highschool days. So maybe it depends on where it happens? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you worked on the potion you reached the point of where you have to decide on how much shark essence as this will determine what kind of sharkgirl you will become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\"><b>20%: Type A:</b></span> Type A sharkgirls look like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://rule34.xxx/index.php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=3952195\" target=\"_blank\">https://rule34.xxx/index.php?page=post&amp;s...</a> minus the size of the endowments as that varies from sharkgirl to sharkgirl. Type As are regarded as the weakest of the three classes, but still have the ability to bite through iron shield and can easily overpower an average human man. They can easily match the swimming skills of expert swimmers of any race. They also have the ability to travel further on land than any other type without needing to refresh with water more frequently, and can go without attracting too much attention. A Type A sharkgirl can only give birth to Type As and human children. If a Type A's child is a girl her chances of becoming a sharkgirl is 75%. Even a seeming human girl can eventually become like her mother as she gets older, or drinks shark blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>50%: Type B:</b></span> Type B sharkgirls are regarded as the perfect blend between shark and woman. Your typical Type B looks like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1597948370746.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1597948370746.jp...</a> and do not possess tails or fins as the other two do. They are stronger than Type As and average humans, being able to bite through steel shields, and are able to dive further into bodies of water than a Type A. Their range on dry land is rather limited compared to Type As, and have to use magic and items to refresh themselves every 5 hours when on land. A Type B will prefer to stay in a body of water than say a hotel or inn when they're in land. They give birth only to sharkgirls 80% of the time and regular human males. If a girl is born human to a Type B she will become the same kind of monstergirl her mother is the moment she hits puberty. Though this can be suppressed artificially. It is quite popular for Type As born from a Type B to accelerate the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">75%: Type C:</span> A Type C sharkgirl is more related to merpeople than any other type of sharkgirl. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/monster-girl-island/images/7/76/Mako_body_1.png/revision/latest?cb=20160728004219\" target=\"_blank\">https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/monste...</a> for reference. They are awkward on dry land, but in the ocean they are the masters of that domain. They are able to dive even further than Type Bs, and able to bite entire chunks out of solid steel. 90% of the time their young are hatched from eggs, but occasionally a Type B will be born the normal way. Type As are usually mocked by Type Cs for being more human than shark. They usually can only stay in saltwater without aid, but those who can swim in fresh and saltwater are seen throughout their communities as blessed by the gods of Illyrium they pay heed too. Some have the ability to telepathically command regular sharks which is regarded as a blessing too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad to fix a link for the Type B reference. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So I've decided to spitball some ideas for everyone on certain things. I'll leave a lot of things up to you guys, but I will leave a framework to work with on these things so this can be more than just your standard fantasy world with anime stuff thrown in. Let's start off with the types of elves that live in Illyrium. Because what fantasy world isn't complete with at least 10 types of elves? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Sea Elves:</span> Sea Elves are elves who obviously live by the sea. Your typical Sea Elf community lives in a coastal area. Sea Elves are known for their adventurous drive, fun loving and carefree attitudes. Sea Elves who choose darker career paths tend to become the most famous pirates of Illyrium. They are also the most approachable bunch of elves as they are essentially surfer dudes and dudettes. Sea Elves have the shortest natural lifespans of all elves with most dying of old age at 125. This hasn't always been the case, and most assume the Sea Elves have been cursed in the last one thousand years.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">Wood Elves:</span> Wood Elves are a mysterious bunch that are hard to pin down. Aside from living in deep forests the most learned scholar can have difficulties on what constitutes as a \"Wood Elf\". Even their lifespans are a mystery as some of died of old age at 112 years while some have died around the age of 5000. The most commonly accepted theory is that there are two groups calling themselves \"Wood Elves\". One is the actual racial group \"Wood Elves\" known for their deep respect for nature and plant based magic, and the other are collections of elves and half elves who form bands after leaving their homes for reasons they only know. It is very possible for you to walk into a forest and to meet an actual Wood Elf girl who would ask if you want a tour of the deep woods. On the other hand, it is also very possible once you get done with that tour that your town who is close to the forest got sacked by a band of the other \"wood elves\" who were formed out of murderers and rapists from all elven societies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">Jungle Elves:</span> Jungle Elves are a subset of Wood Elves that have abandoned temperate forests for humid and moist jungles in the tropical area of Illyrium. The reason for this spilt is unknown and seemingly complicated. If you were to ask an actual Wood Elf why the split they would spout the things such as the Jungle Elves' took up degenerate practices such as the worship of bloodthirsty gods who demand hearts to be ripped out. Then you would have a Jungle Elf coming out of nowhere saying their ancestors did nothing wrong other than breaking away from a society that grew dark, decadent, and tyrannical. As you can imagine, Wood Elves and Jungle Elves do not like each other at all to say the least, and have made it illegal for one of their own to breed with the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJungle Elves typically live in great cities of stone deep in the jungle, and are known to be the 2nd most affable bunch of elves. So long as you respect their rules you'll be fine. Their women are known to be the most curvaceous of all elves according to some. They are also known for their fondness of jaguars. They live up to 1500 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">Desert Elves:</span> Desert Elves are a hardy group of elves who tend to live in deserts and sometimes badlands. They tend to be straightforward, having little patience for inane nonsense, and have blood as hot as the desert sun. Where as a High Elf would engage in some whiny navel gazing when faced with a great problem, a Dark Elf would spend most of their time trying to scheme how to dick said problem over, and an actual Wood Elf would spend half a day trying to contact the spirits of the forests on what to do about it, a Desert Elf would go straight in and solve it. As such they are the third most approachable group of elves. One notable group of Desert Elves is known as the \"Badlands Sultanate\" unofficially led by Sultan Halueve Chaedan<br>\r\na High Elf oddly enough. Haulueve was once a companion of yours during your hero days in his youth, and was nearly killed by you during your evil overlord days. A group of Desert Elves he saved during his wandering around a changing world after you died a 2nd time made him their sultan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesert Elves only live up to 500 years. For example, just imagine their skin like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/881/604/1f1.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/news...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">High Elves:</span> I imagine the High Elves of this world to be mostly like your typical High Elves in other settings. Snooty, great at archery and magic, and are in decline. They're mostly in decline due to your actions during your evil life and their own fault. They once had a mighty unified empire but due to the mini-apocalypse your 2nd death brought about ended all of that. Their once great kingdom is now scattered with only the strongest fragments not being tossed to the wind. Some fragments broke further while those that didn't became their own entities with equally unique cultures. I'll let everyone else fill in those blanks. High Elves tend to live up to two thousand years but some extremely rare cases had High Elves clocking out at the ripe age of ten thousand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Stone Elves:</span> Sometimes referred to as \"Wild Elves\" or \"Tundra Elves\" these are the Cavemen elves I mentioned in the rules. They are an offshoot of High Elves. In your failed attempt to become a god that nearly destroyed the world a great multitude of unnatural energies bathed over parts of the world doing only Truck-Kun knows what to the living things there. One such area was where a colony of High Elves were located. These divine and otherworldly cosmic energies altered these knife-ears, reducing them down to how primitive cavemen would act. Two of the main Stone Elf tribes live in areas like these <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/8/80/Gravelly_Mountains_Plus.png/revision/latest?cb=20130907110528\" target=\"_blank\">https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecr...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/0/0b/Snowy_Taiga_Mountains.png/revision/latest?cb=20130909091128\" target=\"_blank\">https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecr...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile there is one tribe that lives in a place like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/9/9a/Shattered_Savanna.png/revision/latest?cb=20200710082616\" target=\"_blank\">https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecr...</a> just you know less Minecraftly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are as I mentioned in the rules, fighting with humans who also met the same fate as them over resources and if OOGA is better than BOOGA. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">Dark Elves:</span> Dark Elves are said to be the yang of the High Elves' yin. They are known to be sneaky grey skinned knife-eared schemers known for plotting in the dark, their love of fire and spiders. They stayed mostly unified after your mini-apocalypse inducing death due to them tending to live underground, but you will find some fragmentation here and there. While you will encounter some who are outright evil you will find some who are just chaotic tricksters. The latter group tend to make some of the best friends one can ask for in Illyrium. If you were to ask a female High Elf she would say that your Dark Elf girlfriend is just a lewd SLUT with a human fetish. Your D-Elf girlfriend would reply she's honest about it unlike the High Elf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this assumes they don't use magic or magical items to buff their lifespans and they actually die of old age.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Once upon a time you were minding your own business in life when Truck-Kun decided an animesque fantasy world called Illyrium that needed a new hero, and picked you to be that hero before mowing you down. Like a typical isekai protagonist you became an overpowered hero, slaying monsters and villains left and right as if it was no one else's business but your own. Which it was at that point. At some point you died in this world, some saying you either died of old age or you sacrificed yourself at the cost of oblivion to save the world from one last threat. But this would not be the end of your tale. Far from it. After two hundred and fifty years you came back to life and performed a complete 180 in demeanour. Memoryless of your past life in this world and your heroics in the world you were sent to, you became an overpowered villain for this go. Became an overlord, established an empire, made demons you once fought fear you as you were the remorseless taskmaster towards them, and killed a few gods to name a few things. But you were stopped by a ragtag of heroes who sacrificed themselves as you tried performing a ritual to become a god yourself to satisfy your lust for even more power. The result was a mild apocalypse where only the strongest civilizations survived. Some parts of the world are in the stone age where caveman humans and elves are duking it out for resources for their tribes.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow after a time period of at least six hundred and fifty through one thousand years you have respawned with the memories of your past lives returning. The choice of what you do now is up to you. Will you become a great hero again to atone for your evil days' action, decide to give being an evil overlord a second shot, become a murderhobo with no real ideology, live as a hermit in a shack just fishing, or will you just screw that and just have sex with busty women and monstergirls all day every day? Or will you become a nun dedicated to a god or pantheon of Illyrium to atone as having the option of being a girl will be a thing for this story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules:<br>\r\n1: Killing is okay but don't go full gore wankfest. <br>\r\n2: Things that aren't okay: diaper, urine and scat, furry/anthro, unbirth, vore, and male on male sex. <br>\r\n3: Monstergirls are okay. There will be many options for the reader character to become a monstergirl/monsterboy if you wish it. <br>\r\n4: Genderbending, futa, and yuri? I guess just this once they're okay since there will be an option for the male reader character to end up in a Tanya the Evil type situation and to try to return to your original gender. Just this once. Those two things probably won't be everyone's cup of tea. <br>\r\n5: Like usual, the main character/reader character's name is Anon to stand for \"Anonymous Reader\" as typing \"*Your Name*\" over and over is dull. <br>\r\n6: Be really creative here. Like I said earlier, Illyrium is an animesque fantasy world with cavemen elves so go crazy. <br>\r\n7: No one sentence chapters. <br>\r\n8: New rules will be added if needed. <br>\r\n9: If there is something that violates the rules it gets deleted. Simple as. </td>",
