I'm not that overweight but I'm not exactly thin either, I'm 5'11\", and weigh about 175 lbs. I've always kept some semblance of control over my weight because of my parents, but have wanted to gain and be massive. Now that I am living on my own I have the ability to do so, especially with the help of my girlfriend Sarah, who wants to see me grow as well. I've always been secretive about my desires and I'm rather shy, but I hope that gaining may bring out my confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin: My friends just call me Kev. I'm 19 years old and I just got my first real job working as a cook at a local restaurant. I'm still living at home but I have plans to possibly move in with my boyfriend Mike. I'm fairly large at 6'0\" and about 220 lbs, but that is a mix of fat and muscle mind you! I'm rather feisty and take no shit from anyone, I'm not afraid to grow to a new size and take on the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris: I'm 20 years old and currently a student in college. Now that I'm in college I'm ready to start putting myself out there and begin dating. I weigh about 250 lbs and I'm only 5'9\", not exactly in peak physical position but it seems to be somewhat popular with both the guys and the girls here. I've made some friends who like my size but want me to grow bigger as well. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to begin dating, even if I need to change my size.</span></div></div>",

Now all I need to do is just start unpacking it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Dad and I had just finished moving everything into my new apartment, looking around, it was a seemingly endless sea of boxes in each room. It was going to take some serious time to get everything unboxed, set up, organized, and cleaned... I was tired just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know that your Mom and I would love to help you finish setting everything up, but we have to leave for my work conference in the morning and I haven't even packed for that trip! It's not like I haven't done enough packing today.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I get it Dad. Speaking of Mom, how much longer do you think she and Sarah are going to be at the store?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mom and my girlfriend Sarah had left to go to the store to buy some last few things that were still needed to finish moving in, but that was nearly two hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how your mother is son! She's been like this ever since we got married. She needs to hurry back though because we need to leave soon to make it back home in time to pack, and I know she is going to want to say goodbye before we leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, your right\" I said knowingly. \"But they should have only needed to buy cleaning supplies, that should only take twenty minutes tops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, that's just how she is, wanna soda while we wait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Dad had reached into the fridge and pulled out a Coke that we placed in their earlier and was offering it to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I could use a cold drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Sarah and my Mom finally returned from the store with a few more bags than expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing with all those bags!?\" I said exasperated, knowing that I had given them my card to help pay for the supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Steven!\" said Sarah, \"I just went ahead and got some food for the next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, took you long enough though!\" I said, half-jokingly, half-serious. \"Dad and I had to finish unloading all by ourselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously son, just relax. We all know that you could use the exercise.\" said my Mom, with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\", I did not appreciate the jab. I have struggled with my self-image for several years, I'm not fit, but I'm not in shape either. I would just like to pick a side of either toned or just fat, not this weird in the middle state that I'm in. It was difficult for me all through High-school do deal with this, and I have been trying for the last several years to work out and build some muscle, and then I met Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I met here at my last job in the grocery store. I worked as a stock-boy and she was in the deli department. She is gorgeous, at 5'6\" with long brown hair and some great curves (Beauty isn't everything but it sure helps!). After chatting in the breakroom for a few weeks, I was trying to work up the nerve to ask her out on a date, but she beat me to it and asked me out! I eventually shared with here my desires to get bigger and she told me about how she likes bigger men, and was secretly hoping that I would bulk out. She has been encouraging me to gain some weight, but that has been hard with my parents being fairly health-conscious and controlling of my weight, even at 23. Ever since we met we have become super close and when I got a new job at a tech company about three hours away, I asked her if she would move with me, and surprisingly she said yes!  We have been counting the days I to moving and really expand my size, and now the day is finally here. Now I could be proud of who I am and what I looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, we need to get going here\" said my Dad, obviously trying to get my Mom out the door and in the car. \"We need to go home and pack. We should leave these two alone and stop pestering them.\" He said suggestingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I guess we should go.\" My Mom said, starting to choke up. \"You know that I am so proud of you Steven and the man you have become. You better come and visit when you get vacation time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I will Mom,\" I said, trying not to cry along with my Mom. \"I will be out soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Dad finally pried my Mom off of my and got her to the car. We waved goodbye as they drove off and went back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now what do we do?\" said Sarah</span></div></div>",

I don't get a lot of house guests anymore, so my manners have taken a bit of a dip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you actually want to hear my story? I mean, it's not all bad, but it's not all good either. At times, I was stupid, insensitive, and engaged in what can only be described as self-destructive behavior. I was never suicidal, but there were times I did things to myself without thought to any long-term consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHence how I came to be here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut like I said, it's not all bad. I've been quite successful, despite or perhaps because of my frequent gastronomic excesses. I graduated college, paid off my student loans, met the love of my life, and started a family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, what you probably know me for most is my books. Well, that or my old live streams. Oh, who am I kidding? It's probably both. It caused one hell of a stink when those videos came to light. The tabloids ate it up, and I'm pretty sure my editor had an aneurysm. My old publisher dropped me, and I had to open my own publishing house to keep my books on the shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, it never seemed to hurt sales. Hell, sales actually went up in spite of the paparazzi having a field day. I even did another stream just to spite them after all that. Hindsight being what it is, that was a little embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Oh, of course you've seen it. And don't try to deny it, your blush has nearly entered the infrared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSay, could you tilt my bed forward a little, if you'd be so kind? I can't reach the controls from here. Keep going, keep going, right there. Ah, that's better. I hate talking to people while laying down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I'm afraid I've been rambling on a bit. So if you could pass me that box of brownies and the cinnamon buns next to it, you can ask your questions, and get some cohesion to this narrative. And I can have Mary Anne bring us up some pizza in a bit; I'm feeling a mite peckish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, don't look at me like that. You don't get to be my size by moderating your diet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmm, these are so good! What? That creak? Oh, it's probably just the bed. I've had this one for awhile, it'll be time to upgrade soon. So, where would you like to begin?</span></div></div>",

Sorry for getting ahead of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n... is that a reel-to-reel recorder? Where did you even <i>find</i> one of those? Haven't you heard of advancing with the times? Next you'll tell my you use an old type writer instead of a laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, of course you do. Your editor must hate you as much as mine does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, you're ready? Anyway, as I was saying, I had a fairly normal childhood. I was the youngest of four children, and my parents only biological child. My folks had a terrible time conceiving, and had given up on having children of their own. They adopted my siblings when they were 9, 6, and 5, and Mom became pregnant with me almost before the ink dried on the forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite what some people might think, we never had any major problems because of our origins. We had the usual sibling spats, but nothing unusual. Though my brother was quite fond of saying, \"They clearly love me more, since they chose me.\" Don't be too harsh on his teasing; he was always the first to come to my defense while we were kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only major fights we had we over the bathroom. Four kids and two adults in a house with only one bathroom was a recipe for disaster. Dad eventually had to enforce a strict schedule to keep everyone going through the bathroom at a decent pace, and when he and Uncle John redid the basement and put in an addition, they added two more bathrooms just to accommodate everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I should point out at this time that the women on both sides of my family err towards the larger end of the spectrum, and I was no exception to that rule. I was fairly chubby as a kid, thinning out during my growth spurts. I was pretty fast in spite of my size. I even won the 100 yard dash in Track and Field day in Grade 4. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, even as a kid, I loved nothing more then a sweet snack and a good book. My Mom always said I drew all the time until I discovered the written word, and then I never looked back. I read everything I could lay my hands on, and my allowance always found its way into the register at the local used book store. I especially loved mysteries, and the works of Agatha Christie, Gilbert Chesterton, and Conan Doyle were double stacked in my bookcases. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in terms of sweets, my house was never lacking in that. Mom was always baking, and there was typically no counter space in our kitchen because of all the pastries. Even though all us kids enjoyed the selection, none of my siblings could hope to match me. I doubt many kids could say they ate an entire jar of cookies as an after school snack, then had a double helping of supper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps Mom should have limited our intake a little more then she did, but Dad hated sweet foods, so I imagine she let herself cut loose far more then she should of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy problems really started around Grade 6. I was a shy, bookish kid, so I only had a couple of really close friends. That was also just after my last major growth spurt, so all the excess calories I was consuming only had one place to go: out. I quickly went from chubby to fat, and I was ballooning pretty quickly. Other kids were outgrowing clothes via height; I'd wake up one day, unable to button my pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy classmates were rather brutal about it, teasing me mercilessly. Of course, the outcome of that was to make me more introverted, spending more time at home reading, and naturally eating even more, making the problem worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around the time I needed two chairs in the dining room that I outgrew the desks at school. Despite the efforts of my brother and sisters, the bullying was at an all-time high, and my mother decided there was only one thing to be done. </span></div></div>",
