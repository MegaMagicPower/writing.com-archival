            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was last Friday when you'd been roped into letting Tyler stay with you and over the weekend you'd had and overwhelming since of buyers remorse, but the more you reflected throughout your work week and texted back and forth with Tyler you had become excited to see your baby brother again. Well maybe not baby as he was 19 now, but seeing as the last time you'd actually seen him was when you'd left home he was only a stringy 13 year old you couldn't help but think of Tyler as a little kid. Today though you were going to see firsthand the kind of man your kid brother had become. These thoughts buzzed in your mind all day at work and on the way home, but not entirely sure of his arrival time, just that it'd be later in the day as he had quite a drive to make, you tried not to dwell and go about your normal routine when you got home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreheating the oven for later and settling in to watch a few episodes of something you successfully killed an hour of time before there was a knock at the door. Your heart leapt a little as you began realizing how anxious you really were as you approached the door. Opening the door you were a bit surprised as you had been expecting your brother but the man standing there was enormous, positively dwarfing you, which was no small feat as you were 6'1, this guy must have been around 6'6, and those muscles were <b>ridiculous</b> as he was easily twice as wide as you with giant pectorals pushing his nipples, the right one pierced, out the sides of a slightly too small tank top. Looking up, you saw a still slightly boyish face adorned by brown partially spiked hair with the odd burst of blue adorning the tips, a small piercing in his left nostril, and two piercings in his right ear, all complimented by a pair of icy blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to ask the man who he was he pulled you into a big hug \"Hi Tim,\" he said \"again thank you so much!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler?!\" you were dumbfounded \"You look pretty different bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I guess,\" Tyler said letting go of you \"But kids do get taller you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well duh, but it's more than that dude you're frickin' jacked \" you said before getting embarrassed over how dumb you sounded. \"So, um, do you need help bringing anything in?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope I got it.\" Tyler said picking up a duffel bag. Damn was that really everything he had? As he let himself in you looked out into your driveway and saw the rustiest old shit shaker you'd ever seen. \"So how about a tour?\" Tyler inquired dropping his bag on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\" you answered showing him through your modest abode as he followed closely behind like a curious puppy rather than a huge muscle man. There was the living room and kitchen he'd already seen as the house entered directly to those rooms, leading him down the hallway you showed him your room, the bathroom, a small laundry room, and a cluttered spare room that, when cleared, could serve as his room, but for now the living room's pull out bed would have to suffice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly Taj Mahal.\" you joked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way man, this place is amazing!\" Tyler beamed \"It's soooo much nicer than my apartment was. By the way do you have anything to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue your oven then beeped \"Ha, speak of the devil, actually I put a couple of pizzas in the oven for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yeah! Oh sorry,\"  Tyler apologized, again displaying an uncanny disconnect between his imposing stature and an adorable innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't sweat it I'm your brother not your mom,\" you said dishing up the pizza \"now I was thinking we could catch up while eating then maybe watch a movie or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me.\" Tyler said, as you both grabbed your plates and went to sit on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next several hours you and your brother chatted about old times and told stories about what you'd been up to in the last few years before settling in to watch an old action movie. As the hour grew late you decided you were ready to turn in for the night and helped Tyler to unfold his bed for the night. You briefly apologized for the lackluster bed and for the second time you found yourself wondering just how bad Tyler'd had it when he said he was just excited to sleep in his first proper bed in a while. On that slightly depressing note you wished your brother a goodnight and went to your room collapsing in bed feeling emotionally drained, but thankfully satisfied with your reunion as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning you woke up early in the morning and made your way to the bathroom. After relieving yourself you trudged into the kitchen and started brewing your morning coffee, but when you turned towards the living room you got the shock of your life as you saw Tyler was snoring away butt ass naked, having kicked away his blanket in the night, with some of the angriest morning wood ever jutting out of his crotch. Well, this was a possible wrinkle you hadn't considered in a roommate.</span></div></div>",

Setting your mug down rather loudly, and for the third time, your brother began stirring from his slumber. As Tyler sat up, yawning and stretching, he groggily said \"Mornin' Tim,\" apparently completely unfazed and casually conversing as if he wasn't nude and hard as hell. \"Mmm that smells really good, I haven't been able to afford coffee in ages.\" he eagerly mused almost like an excited puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure thing, but...um...could you deal with \"that\" first.\" you awkwardly asked gesturing towards your brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, uh sure thing.\" Tyler responded a little confused before standing up and displaying what was a ridiculously large and toned body as he walked past his brother with his thick 11 inch meat bobbing up and down. As Tyler passed his brother Tim was again daunted by the staggering size of his \"baby brother\" all accentuated by Tyler's level of self confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tyler walked past you and down the hall to the bathroom you just assumed he was just going to use the bathroom before getting dressed, yeah that's it. Returning to pouring yourself some coffee you were abruptly corrected in what was perhaps the most stunning method possible when you heard Tyler loudly grunting and moaning producing the most carnal sexual sound you'd ever heard before he gave one elongated grunt that was unmistakably orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tyler emerged from the bathroom you didn't know what to do with yourself, locked in a state of shock until Tyler joined you in the kitchen and pulled you into a hug as he cooed \"good suggestion bro,\" he all but purred with his enormous nude hard-body grinding into you're back \"So where are you're cups? Nothing goes as well with a morning jerk as coffee.\" he teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're in that cupboard.\" You meekly gestured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome,\" Tyler said chipperly as he got himself some coffee and made his way into the small breakfast nook. \"So what do you want to do today?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally mustering up the courage to look at your brother again you turned to him and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you looked at Tyler again you saw your brother was already hard as rock, again, despite having literally just \"relieved\" himself. It apparently had't taken Tyler long to notice either as he soon openly grabbed his length and began fapping away saying, \"Don't worry bro I got this.\" Your brain reentered a state of panic for a million and one reasons, but shockingly your highest concern wasn't just how...<i>wrong</i> this all was it was, to your terror, how little you seemed to mind deep down, that part of you almost wanted this to be the norm...NO, no that's utterly impossible! Now grappling with this newly discovered...<i>thing</i>...you'd found inside yourself you barely noticed your brother's moans becoming fevered panting until he finally, with another roar of climax, painted the underside of your dining table \"Oopsie...sorry bro,\" Tyler panted, clearly not the least bit sorry as he bathed in the afterglow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was too much, this was all just more than you could handle so you told your brother you'd be taking your regular morning walk, that was in no way part of your routine, and after getting dressed you booked it out the door. Several minutes in the morning air was, surprisingly, already beginning to help as your nerves were becoming marginally less frayed. Before long though you saw an odd looking corner shop you'd never noticed before. Almost compelled to go in you did just that and found a bizarre store that appeared to be an herbalists, but almost nothing was labeled and what was had some writing of a language you couldn't even comprehend adorning them. You were then startled as a cloaked figure behind the desk, whom you could almost swear hadn't been there moments earlier, called out to you, \"Come here my boy,\" they called in a voice so raspy you could pin it as neither male nor female. The abrupt start passed, you walked to the counter and they asked, \"Now my boy, what is your name? What ails you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm Tim,\" you replied, not thrilled with being referred to as a \"boy,\" but suspecting the raspy voice came from someone of seniority you let it go, \"I'm not really sick I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah good, but that is not what I asked Tim. What ails you?\" they asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's kind of personal...\" you admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then lend me your hand,\" they said and after doing so they read your palm letting out the occasional \"Ah\" sound like they were reading the very secrets of the universe, \"You did not tell me it was your brother who troubles you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart leapt into your throat at this and you double checked your hand to make sure it didn't say <i>I'm worried I might be attracted to my brother</i>, \"What in the...?\" you began to ask, but the storekeeper then produced two, what looked like, teabags one red and one orange \"What are these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These will fix what ails you,\" they stated simply, as if this made all the sense in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what do they do?\" you pushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They shall give you some...<i>control</i>...over your situation,\" the cloaked person explained, \"All you must do is prepare you and your brother some tea and this will do the rest, but whatever you do <b>do not</b> confuse these mixtures. The red is for yourself and the orange your brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you say control...what do you mean?\" you asked nervously \"I don't want to hurt my brother or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you shall not Tim, nothing shall occur unless the <i>both</i> of you desire it,\" they explained, appearing to grow short of temper, \"Now go my child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to let the \"child\" grate on your nerves you picked up the teabags unsure of payment, but they neither asked nor appeared as if they were going to so you made your way outside. The instant both feet were out the door you felt your mind become slightly blurry. Looking behind you you saw the same old 7/11 that was always there with the same zitty clerk picking his nose behind the desk, but you didn't question it, the strange herbs and herbalist apparently wiped from your mind. Recalling the tea you'd just purchased, for some reason it had just seemed it would be the answer to your problems, you began your walk back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you did arrive home you found a distinct lack of your brother in the immediate area, but soon heard the rumblings of your washing machine, guess he just had stuff to clean. You then called out for your brother and what walked down the hall was a still \"nude as they day he was born\" Tyler revealing a bellybutton piercing and a formerly hidden tattoo of a tangle of roses along the right side of his eight pack, previously missed as your brain panicked earlier. At least he wasn't hard, or that hard, it was hard to tell considering the kid was hung like a horse. \"Whatcha need bro?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...where are your...\" you fumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry, my outfit is in the wash,\" he explained, his sorry betrayed by his casual nudity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy outfit? As in one outfit? Jesus how bad did this kid have it after you left, maybe you could go clothes shopping later, for now you told him \"I got this new kind of tea I wanna try and I think you should to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, sure thing Tim just let me know when it's ready,\" Tyler said strolling back to the laundry room and revealing a small embroidery tramp stamp above his bubble butt, who even was Tyler anymore you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later the tea was ready and you called for your brother once more, his clothes now in the dryer, he sauntered in ready to sip tea with his brother as if he weren't casually naked. The two of you drank from your respective cups and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After you and your brother drank your tea the two of you sat in silence for a time until Tyler got up from the breakfast nook and began stretching. Your jaw nearly went slack as your \"baby brother\" loomed in front of you bending from side to side, muscles contorting with effort, causing his abdominal roses to dance and the monster between his legs to sway obscenely. As your brain was beginning to melt you caught the barest glimpse of Tyler looking down at you with the very <i>faintest</i> glimmer of a smirk. \"Not good!\" your mind panicked \"Uh...Tyler would you go get dressed...\" you asked, before remembering his clothes were still drying, shit! Shockingly though Tyler just said sure and walked off to the laundry room before returning shortly in his damp, still dripping, attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I do that?\" Tyler asked, utterly bewildered by his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't know...\" you admitted as the both of you just stood awkwardly for a moment before attempting to return to some normalcy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later you were just back to chilling with your brother, the both of you engrossed by whatever was on your phone, but that bizarre incident earlier still nagged at the back of your mind. Maybe, just maybe, there was something weird going on here, after all people don't generally go put wet clothes on. Daring to try and experiment you looked to Tyler, who was sprawled out on the couch, and asked, \"Tyler, would you mind sitting up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Tim...\" he said giving you a weird look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, bad start, that was definitely to simple to figure anything out. Wracking your mind for a more telling task you finally asked, \"Would you stand on your head for me Ty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...ok,\" he said before dropping his phone on the couch and standing on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...thanks, you can stop now,\" you said gaining a little confidence in your theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure...\" Tyler said sounding confused as he returned to his battered old phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok think of something big this time,\" you thought, daring to push a little more. \"Hey Ty would you clean my house for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha...fuck that,\" he joked, not even looking up from his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait why didn't that one work,\" you wondered growing confused. If he was doing whatever you said he should have hopped up and gone to work, right? Then a thought crossed your mind, maybe he had to want to do it or at least be willing to, so much  for \"I promise I'll do all the housework.\" After considering another pair of tasks to test that theory you told Tyler to go and bring you nearly half of what was in the refrigerator, which he did, but when you tried to get him to clean it all up he was predictably annoyed by the obtuse request instead of accommodating. This was enough for you to bring it up \"So Ty, this is gonna sound crazy, but I think I can...like...make you do...stuff for some reason,\" you put forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit,\" Tyler said, \"That's insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you remember you put on your wet stuff earlier, and you just randomly stood on your head for no reason,\" you pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim I just did that stuff because I felt like it...that's all...\" he said sounding doubtful of his own words. \"Besides if I did everything you said why aren't I cleaning the house? Or putting all this crap away?\" he gestured to all various foodstuff he'd gotten out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because apparently I can't make you do stuff you don't wanna do, and you apparently <i>hate</i> to clean,\" you told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still that makes no sense, how would this even happen?\" Tyler asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" you admitted, the mystical teabags becoming just as lost to you as the shop you got them from, \"But at least I can't accidentally make you do something weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Tyler asked, both a bit wide-eyed and concerned at the whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, if I beat you at COD or something and told you to suck it you wouldn't actually...you know...try to suck it,\" you explained awkwardly. However Tyler promptly shocked you as he made a grab for your pants, wholly intending to pull them down and \"suck it.\" \"TYLER! Hey Tyler knock it off!\" you yelled fending off you big little brother's advances, your jeans around your ankles already and boxers threatening to follow. As Tyler stuck his fingers into your waistband you finally snapped and slapped him across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler momentarily froze before he awkwardly apologized \"So-sorry I don't know what came over me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell you don't! It seems like you really wanted to suck me off! Me, your own brother!\" you yelled, hypocritical fury rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, I just really like dick ok,\" Tyler said plainly, as if that was how everyone came out of the closet \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Besides you aren't exactly bad looking</font>.\" he murmured just loud enough for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were frankly stunned to hear that your brother, like yourself, was about as straight as a three dollar bill. For a moment your splitting brain even fired off the briefest unconscious feeling of hope that maybe he was harboring similarly forbidden feelings towards you before your conscious mind promptly shut that thought down. \"That's ridiculous, <i>ridiculous</i>,\" you thought, \"Just because a guy is gay doesn't automatically mean he wants to jump your bone. Although he literally did just...No Tim! You literally <i>just</i> climbed out of that rabbit hole!\" you internally yelled at yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you were snapped back to the situation at hand when Tyler asked, \"Hey Tim, how much do you think we can actually do with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you said coming out of your stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like do you think we can do any like...freaky supernatural shit?\" he elaborated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would I know,\" you responded, \"If you want to try it think of something you'd be willing to have happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I got one,\" Tyler said almost immediately, \"I think it'd be really fucking cool to be even bigger. I've always thought it was super hot how well all gains have paid off and I love being so tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alrighty then,\" you said a bit apprehensively at your brother's unnecessarily detailed admission, \"Tyler would grow bigger for me?\"</span></div></div>",

Fucking! Way!\" Tyler exclaimed, \"This is incredible!\" Your younger brother, now out and out growing, soon hit the ceiling forcing him to sit down as his shirt tore away, unable to contain the beast any longer, his piercings though were strangely growing with him. His pants were hardly fairing any better than his shirt had but before he could outgrow them Tyler simply tore them of with a satisfied grin, \"There, now little Tyler can breathe,\" he joked as his less then little dick flopped onto the floor and grew along with the rest of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty...I...you...\" you stammered, fearful of just what might happen. \"Tyler, I want you to stop,\" you tried commanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spoil sport,\" Tyler said sticking his tongue out and crossing his arms, before it became abundantly clear he wasn't stopping when his head hit the roof again. \"Ouch,\" he said reflexively, rather than from any actual pain, \"Tough luck Tim, looks like baby bro ain't done yet,\" and it then dawned on you that you never actually said how big Tyler should get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck...\" you said in a combination of terrified admiration as your brother began to get hard, and the realization that your house now had a very real, very imminent, expiration date. \"Uh...Ty, I'm gonna go wait for you outside...ok...?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Tim,\" he beamed down at you while beginning to play with his arousal, realizing for himself he was about to outgrow your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking it out to the sidewalk you turned back and waited for the inevitable and Tyler didn't disappoint as in minutes the audible grunting and...wet sounds...were joined by the noise of splintering wood. Then, in an instant, the roof caved and the walls tumbled all giving way to Tyler who simply sat cross-legged and enjoyed the experience with a shiteating grin. \"Did you see that Tim? Did you fucking see that?\" Tyler boomed as a panic enveloped the neighborhood. \"I'm so damn strong I destroyed a house by just <i>being there</i>! Seriously bro I love you so much for this!\" he said reaching out to pick you up and hug you as his growing body only gained in size and speed, now taking out neighboring building without having even moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty! TY! TYLER!\" you yelled after a few minutes of the embrace, \"It's getting hard to breathe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Tim,\" he said letting you go free from what passed for a hug, and slide down to his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding on your brother's pelvis you couldn't help but be enamored by the sight of his godly dick that now positively loomed over you and filled the air with a pungent musk, there was also a telltale stickiness coating his skin and pubes that told you despite releasing once in the house he'd become instantly cocked and ready for another round, though frankly you couldn't blame him as you too were enjoying his ascension. You simply enjoyed the feeling of existing on your growing brother as you decided that since this much damage was done already there'd be no point in hiding your feelings any longer, and Tyler had long since forgone modesty. Feeling a pair of fingertips pinch at your shirt you realized your brother was about to lift you, and when he did you just barely managed to hold on to your breakfast as you rose higher and higher thanks to the forewarning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Tim I can't help, but feel like I owe you for this,\" Tyler said in as soft a voice he could manage, \"and considering I'm already enormous if you really <i>really</i> want me to...I'll try and stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gazed into an eyeball that was your equal in size you pondered what your truly wanted...</span></div></div>",

They looked more toned than they did before, you wondered if he had actually grown or if your mind was just playing tricks on you. You glanced down to see if something else had possibly grown until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, Tim? Anyone home?\" Tyler asked as he noticed you were kind of zoned out.

I'll do whatever you want to do today Tyler.\" Tyler acknowledged you and walked to the other side of the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over at him again to make sure your mind wasn't playing tricks on you. He did seem to look bigger than he did before. You wondered if you should just ask him or see if he actually grew later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did you decide to do?</span></div></div>",

You knew that bastard wall would win, he always did, but something told you if you closed your eyes you'd see the scene behind you all over again and that was, frankly, a sight you had no clue how to process. Thankfully during your furious contest against thy drywall Tyler gave a sharp snort and had apparently awoken himself, hopefully this would lead to your salvation. Hesitantly turning around, after what felt like hours, you faced Tyler again this time freezing like a deer in headlights as you caught his gaze \"Mornin' bro\" Tyler greeted you, still nude as the day he was born. Before you could even think of a way to respond Tyler's entire body blanched white and his face flushed red with realization \"Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, holy shit!\" he said frantically gathering his discarded clothes while trying, and failing, to cover his massive genitals, and In a blur he sprinted to the bathroom. Thankfully this little hurdle was cleared, or so you thought, but it was becoming increasingly apparent that Tyler had no immediate plans to vacate the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes had passed and still nothing not a single sound, resolving yourself to go and check on your brother. \"Tyler?\" you said knock at the door. Nothing. \"Tyler?\" you tried again only to be met with the same silence. \"All right Ty I'm gonna open the door.\" you said. The sight that met you utterly broke your heart as Tyler sat atop the toilet, head downcast with tears streaking his face. \"Tyler...\" you started, placing your hand firmly on his shoulder \"it's ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I ruined it\" Tyler said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Tyler, you didn't ruin anything.\" you reassured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to lie Tim,\" Tyler sobbed \"I fucked it up like I always do.....I'll get my things and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what leave?!\" you interrupted \"Tyler you didn't fuck <i>anything</i> up. You were naked, so what? That's no reason to beat yourself up like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the way you looked at me I...\" he sniffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling tons of weight drop into your stomach you explained \"No Tyler, I was surprised. That's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts,\" you said stopping him \"besides you're my baby brother it's not the first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looked like you hated me though.\" Tyler said teary eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your own eyes begin to tear as your heart shattered anew \"Listen to me,\" you said grasping his shoulders firmly and looking him square in the eye \"there is <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>Nothing</b></font> you could do to make me hate you. Ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were both silent for a moment before Tyler sniffled and asked \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, not one single thing.\" you said before standing \"Now I'm going to go make us breakfast you come out when you're ready, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which Tyler started to smile and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Tyler emerged from the bathroom wiping his face, which you took as the cue to set the table. As you and Tyler ate it was still silent, but at least he was smiling. When both of you had finished you gathered the plates and began to wash up, and Tyler insisted he wanted to help but you simply told him to sit and calm down for now. While you washed you internally laughed at the situation, your little brother had become a behemoth of a man, but was still a little boy on the inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing up you joined your brother in the living room and asked \"Soooo... do you wanna talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha,\" Tyler laughed a little despondently \"Not really, I already feel like I've been flayed to the bones.\" he admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" you told him \"what do you want to do?\"</span></div></div>",

By the time night had rolled around Tyler was back to his normal innocent adorable self, casting an intimidating visage while internally being a little puppy. Once the final credits had rolled you decided to celebrate your successful binge by retrieving a couple beers for the both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you offered Tyler a beer he became slightly flustered saying \"B-but I'm only 19.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Ty,\" you said \"surely you've had a beer before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...no.\" Tyler blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then live a little, bro.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ok.\" Tyler said taking one with a mix of eagerness and nervousness.

Wake Up!\" you yelled, but the dude was out like a light. \"The hell with this, I'll just sleep on the couch myself,\" but when you tried extricating yourself you found your brother's strong arms to be an insurmountable obstacle as his unconscious mind refused to let you go, like a child and his teddy bear. Suddenly terror rushed through your entire being as a very warm and very thick <i>something</i> jabbed you in the buttcheek \"No, no, no,\" you cried fruitlessly wriggling. \"This can't be, <i>can't be</i>, happening,\" you thought, but the situation continued to deteriorate as you felt yourself begin to stir, perhaps at the overwhelming musk that had begun emanating from the monstrous <i>thing</i> that was now climbing up your back. \"Ignore it!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun was starting to peek through your window as the alarm on your phone was blaring unsympathetically, ugh mornings, wiping the sleep from your eyes you began the painful process of waking up. Stretching out in your bed in a desperate attempt to get your tired muscles limbered, and finding it the smallest bit strange you could do such a thing at all. After stretches yielded sub-optimal results you decided to bring out the big guns and plodded off towards the kitchen to start your morning coffee. As you waited in the kitchen, coffee pot torturing you with the sweet sounds of peculation, you realized with a grimace you'd probably better shower before heading in to work. Daring to lift your arm and check with a quick \"sniff test\" you were heartbroken to find that you very much would need to get clean, when you lowered your arm though your eyes caught sight of a note on the fridge that just said \"Tim, I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling instantly like you'd been hit by a truck you realized your brother was gone, \"Fuck, fuck, fuck, Tim you dumb piece shit how didn't you notice!\" you berated yourself while frantically looking around the house, desperate for Tyler just to be in a different room. This was provably not the case though as Tyler was nowhere to be seen, his duffel bag containing all his worldly goods was gone, and the little shit shaker car he'd arrived in was no longer parked outside. \"Ty what the hell are you thinking?\" you asked aloud before a rush of epiphany hit you, \"Oh God...\" was all you could think or say when you remembered last night your brother had climbed in to bed with you wearing fuck all. After his reaction yesterday morning there was no telling how he would have taken waking up in his state. WHY, <i>why</i>, why, had you let him drink, no you didn't let him drink you'd <i>encouraged</i> him \"Tim you are a real fucking piece of work,\" you said pulling out your phone to try and call him, \"No, beat yourself up later. Ty comes first.\" Predictably his phone went straight to voicemail \"Damn it!\" you swore before dialing anew to call in sick to work, there was no way you'd just let your little brother aimlessly wander as he tormented himself, least of all when it was your fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWork, shower, and coffee forgone, needing nothing more than adrenaline and a rising sense of panic as stimulant, you dressed as quickly as possible in yesterday's clothes and made for the garage. You weren't exactly sure where to start looking, but you'd be damned if you didn't. After two odd hours of aimless driving, desperately hoping to see his car somewhere or for him to just magically be walking down the street, your adrenaline was officially fighting a losing battle against your fear and guilt. Stopping for gas you decided to check your phone again as you waited on the pump, hoping it'd suddenly produce a detailed map to your brother's location. Since this morning you'd devotedly hunted all his social medias down, desperate for a clue, but site after site was proving to be useless. Hanging your head as you returned the pump you got back in your car and were about to head off again. With one last look at your phone though your mood instantly brightened as you noticed an automatic check-in on one of his feeds, thank you invasive technology! It was the slightest bit dated after thirty or so minutes and it wasn't his exact location by any stretch, but it was more than you'd had all day and by God it gave you hope again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reached the neighborhood he'd been in, if it could even be called that, your heart sank again when you spotted his rusty old car hoisted up on cinder blocks and Tyler nowhere to be seen. An unparalleled terror overcame you as your mind was flooded with all sorts of terrible scenarios before you began patrolling around the general area in search of him. Pulling past an alley your heart nearly exploded when you saw your little brother face down next to a dumpster. Not even waiting for the car to come to a full stop you jumped out and desperately ran to him, \"Tyler! Tyler, are you alright?!\" you frantically yelled when you got close enough to see all the cuts he know wore, as well as being soaked in something green and foul smelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanking every God of every religion you could think of, and some you couldn't, your brother lightly stirred before weakly muttering, \"Tim? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ty, of course it is! Now c'mon let's get you back home,\" you said beginning the arduous task of hoisting him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but I...I...\" he whimpered while you walked him to your car, voice clearly on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of that is important Tyler,\" you interrupted him, \"All that matters is we get you home.\" With that the both of you got into your car and started home, though Tyler was fiercely determined to remain silent and simply look out the window the whole way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home you helped your brother to the bathroom so that you could dress his wounds and draw him a bath to wash away the grime. \"Tim I'm...I'm really sorry about...about everything...\" Tyler said as rushing water filled the background. \"I just...I didn't mean to...\" he confessed, tears welling in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many times do I have to tell you Tyler?\" you asked as you put iodine on another cut, \"You did absolutely nothing wrong. If anyone is to blame it's me for being such a shitty older brother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh,\" Tyler immediately protested, \"You've done so much for me, you're <i>doing</i> so much for me. You opened up to me when I had nowhere to go and now you're trying to fix this whole stupid mess I made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I should have known you needed somewhere to go before it came to you practically begging for sanctuary, what kind of person knows so little about what's happening to his own brother?\" you fought against the praise, riddled with guilt, \"And what kind of idiot let's things get so out of hands in the first place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop,\" Tyler told you plainly as he put his hand under your head and tilted it up to meet his gaze. When your eyes locked though it was proving difficult for either of you to continue the conversation, something magnetic about each other's deep mysterious glance was rendering the both of you silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an imperceptible amount of time you managed to free yourself from those icy blues and divert focus, \"So...it looks like the bath is ready,\" you said turning of the faucet, \"Are you sure you don't need a hand? You still seem a little shaky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you, but I'll be alright,\" Tyler said limping over to the tub and giving you his best reassuring smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you left to relax in the living room and finally take a moment to process the insanity that had consumed your morning.</span></div></div>",

All of these barely repressed questions were interrupted however when a loud metal tearing sound, followed by a wet thud, came from the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost instantaneous how quickly you rushed to the bathroom, raw instinct fueling you yet again. Bursting through the door you saw Tyler was alternating between rubbing his back and elbow with a pained expression, and had apparently torn the faucet head loose from the wall. \"Tyler, what happened? Are you alright?\" you asked your brother a bit frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother's head swiveled so fast when he realized you'd came in you were shocked it didn't simply rocket of his neck, apparently he hadn't heard you slam the door open through his pain. \"T-Tim, Oh my god!\" he exclaimed trying to sink as deeply in the tub as possible \"Wh-what are you doing?\" he asked before becoming visibly unbalanced, clearly reeling from having moved too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm checking on you stupid,\" you asserted \"Obviously you weren't as ready for this as you thought, you clearly just fell over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm nak-\" he started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter,\" you cut him off, \"What's important is I make sure you don't go and kill yourself pushing too hard. Now what do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I...uh...pff...\" he floundered before admitting, \"I...I need you to do my back for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" you approach the tub and noticed your kid brother really had gone all out on the punk aesthetic, despite being about as soft as a marshmallow. He had, in addition to everything else, a piercing through his navel and an elaborate bramble of roses along the right side of the abdominal on his eight pack. When you made your way behind the tub though you found the biggest surprise yet, or maybe not considering his stories, your sweet little brother had an actual fucking tramp stamp. While lathering a washcloth you told him, \"I'm about to start...and nice ink,\" you couldn't resist teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">...ok...</font>\" was all he squeaked, having turned wholly red and on the verge of causing the water to boil with the heat of his embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashing some of the muck off of Tyler, as he handled his front, was making you regret your actions all over again. At least that's what you were trying to convince yourself because...honestly...you weren't <i>totally</i> hating this and that was something you were <b>not</b> ready to consider. It's just his wide back was so...so brawny, so firm, utterly packed with muscles, like the rest of him. Then you noticed beneath the water just how globular his butt was beneath that kinky little tattoo and thoughts began racing through your...<b>NO</b>, stop it Tim! And stop you did, the both of you did, as Tyler accidentally let out an unmistakable moan of pleasure. The both of you were hopelessly frozen in place for what must have been hours as you were petrified by the realization that your brother may very possibly have been having similar thoughts to yours passing through his mind, at least he may have been, and now you didn't doubt that this timid creature was frantically testing to see if he could will himself to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only sound that filled the room was the rippling of the water against the tub until...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Your name is Tim, you're a fairly normal 24 year old with sandy blonde hair, blue eyes, and a healthy amount of good fortune landing you in to home ownership at 22. Though you certainly didn't shy away from hosting the odd party you had definitely begun to develop an appreciation for your solitude. One day, out of the blue, you received a call from your younger brother Tyler which was already strange in itself as you probably hadn't spoken in the last 3 years, thankfully not from ill will it just sort of happened. When he eventually managed to stop beating around the bush he began telling you about his roommate from hell, how he'd been stuck paying the rent for the both of the multiple times, how the guy basically treated their already cramped apartment like a dumpster, and how he'd do <i>anything</i> to get out of there if <i>only</i> he had <i>somewhere</i> to go. Feeling like you were getting frostbite from the snow-job you attempted to change the subject, but Tyler, having none of it, kept pushing until, dropping all pretext, he finally asked about moving in with you. After about 5 minutes of humming and hawing Tyler began practically begging, swearing left, right, and center he'd find a job and do all the housework until he did. After all the arm twisting you finally caved and said you'd be willing to try it out, to which Tyler audibly gasped with joy saying he'd be out from under his lease in a week and he couldn't wait. Hearing the unbridled excitement in his voice did help to warm you to the idea though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically you can take these 2 brothers and do almost whatever you want with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll relationships will be m/m (you can have female characters but guys only for the juicy bits)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease no diapers, scat, overly-detailed gore, and well body fetishes are fine I'd prefer no one became a blob outright or had giant feet but nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to add and I'll try to add back, but if you'd like you can send your submissions to me and I can add for you, or just feel free to talk about a story direction with me.</td>",
