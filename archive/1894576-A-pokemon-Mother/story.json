As a sixteen-year-old human male who had lost both parents at a young age to a car accident, you had always grown jealous of those that had parents, someone to support them as they grow successful in whatever want to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving nobody but a fully paid house and a sizable life insurance payment to help support your own efforts, you moped around your village town for ten years, performing different jobs to help keep yourself busy and going to school. You used to have dreams of becoming a Pokemon master, but that was before. Now, you lacked the proper motivation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday though, this rumor of a mystical forest had motivated you to check it out. Truly, the first real adventure you had in ten years. Perhaps it was desperation to find *someone* to live with you and care for you like a child. Of course, finding a human woman to become your mother wasn't going to happen, especially at your age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Pokemon would be nice to have as a friend, but ultimately, they were more like partners and pets to people than caretakers. So imagine your surprise to hear about human-like Pokemon. Of course, nobody ever saw one and this supposed magical forest couldn't exist. If such a land were found and human-like creatures existed, it would throw the whole world on its head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and yet, after searching for weeks for this forest by asking various towns and people who had claimed to seen it, you are now in front of a Jigglypuff in the supposed unverified forest. The sight completely makes you go frozen in disbelief at the exact form of such creature because it wasn't round in the slightest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://rule34.xxx/index.php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=1866628\">Preview</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://rule34.xxx/index.php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=1866628\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe JigglyPuff notices you and stops her singing. She seems equally frozen to be seen by a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to speak, but you cannot make words. Could it be that after traveling for so long, you had gone mad? Seriously, even if you were curious enough to travel to find such appearances, you had lowered your expectation to figure it wasn't real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, unsure what to do, you run back to the main path you came from, leaving the JigglyPuff surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

It might be just a fellow human dressed up to look like a JigglyPuff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think, trying to come up with various reasons but failed to keep attention to your surroundings as you bump into something soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel something soft pressing against your cheeks and a sweet scent filling your nose. Panicking, you attempt to pull out of whatever you buried yourself into but your hands end up drowning into something just as softer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ah~ Not there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh? Could it be that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push out, gasping for air and then paled as you see a different anthropomorphic Pokemon, two feet higher than your body, standing around seven foot tall. What you ended up grabbing...or rather, groping was two sizeable breasts that were bare and leaking streams of milk as you squeezed them by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the Pokemon, who had similar human features like the JigglyPuff but was much taller was...</span></div></div>",

She recognized you had bumped into her by accident and your groping was unintentional. Now, it felt sorry for scaring you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human,\" she spoke, not telepathically but with her own lips, \"It's okay. I'm not angry. Would you please remove your hands from my chest though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...s-sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally managed to say some words and regained some control over your arms, but your legs were quivering. The Gardevoir sees this and searches your emotions more. You had run after seeing one of her special kind and her presence only made it worse. Knowing she had to express that she isn't a threat, she moved it and buries your face into her cleavage again. You find that she had control over red triangular extrusion between her breasts as she quickly makes it recede deeper into her cleavage. Given that you had bumped into her, you could have ended up dead if your head was split open by the same extrusion. It seems she had quick reaction to ensure you weren't harmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion is though, have you calmed down?</span></div></div>",

Adding to that, you hear her heartbeat which adds to your growing calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir searches through your feelings, trying to understand how a human stumbled into this forest. Through emotions, it's only possible to guess but she does feel loneliness and longing within you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze grows softer and she hugs you tighter. \"Oh...you poor thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice calls out to you and reminds you of the position you are in. Although you are no longer afraid, you are still wary and so you try to wiggle out of the Pokemon's embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your desire to part, she lets go and watches as you take a step back with confused and worried eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who...what are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir smiles, somehow expecting this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a Gardevoir, but unlike ones that you know of. Within this special forest, myself and other Pokemon are gifted an additional evolution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...another evolution? How is that possible? Are you saying that...this is your fourth form?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoirs nods, placing her hands in front of her. It is rare for anyone to speak with a human and not have them run away in tears. For this reason, Gardevoir wanted to make sure she could explain the circumstances in hopes that you would feel more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she answers, \"...I was a Gardevoir that you would know of until I evolved an additional time. As for the reason, you could say this is a special dimension created by Arceus. It began as a simple wish by Pokemon who encountered an abandoned baby long ago. The Pokemon wanted to care for this child but had limited means. Knowing about humans, she wished to be able to take responsibility for the child without the limitations of her form. Arceus heard this Pokemon's wish and within this special forest, enacted a rule for Pokemon to be granted an addition form if they met the requirements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is too much for you to take in. Curling your lips as you try to comprehend this story, you wonder if you should just call it a day and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...is that so? Well, I guess that's nice but...I think I'll go back home now, if you don't mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gardevoir smiles sadly. \"I see. I understand this is too much to take in. If you leave now, Arceus will ensure that your memory will be cleared to ensure the safety of the Pokemon in this forest. Will that be fine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you thought about the rumors of the forest but without any clear evidence, the idea of people's memories being erased does make sense. Perhaps that's the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I have no choice, but that's probably for the best,\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, the Gardevoir lowers her gaze and fiddles with her hands. It's clear she wants to talk more but above all else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-before you go, I sense a loneliness and longing in you. Could you tell me why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widen your eyes but remember that this is still a Gardevoir. Of course, she would have the ability to sense through people's emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...it's hard to explain,\" you begin and turn away, \"...besides, you won't see me again, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir hums, \"...Then, may I tell you the requirements for Pokemon in the forest to evolve again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, you are curious but what does it matter if she tells you now? Your memories will apparently be wiped if you are to believe her. Sighing, you return to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir places a hand to her large chest. \"To evolve in this forest, a Pokemon needs to want to be human-like, each for their own reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and your reason?\" you urge, wondering what she's getting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My reason is that I wanted to provide for someone just like the first. I originally had a trainer who was young, but he died due to illness a long time ago. I couldn't do...anything. I ran and I came upon this forest in desperation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your eyebrows, wondering why she agreed to tell you seemingly so personal.
