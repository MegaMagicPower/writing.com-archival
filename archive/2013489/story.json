A loafer rests near you, heat and foot funk radiating out of the hole that once held Annie's bare foot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gag a little as Annie giggles above you, stomping a foot down with a wet slump in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run like your life depends on it.... because, well, it might. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah!\" You hear the girl say teasingly.

You hear Annie give another laugh as she moves her foot off of you and starts to replace it with the shoe. You look up at the insides of the shoe and you are completely shocked at  the amount of wear that is shown on the insole. Judging by her age the shoes that Annie has can't be that old, but looking at the insole, there was a deep, dark impression of her foot imprinted on it, the impression was filled with the grime and filth that built up over the repeated wear on the Rift. The sweat that has built up inside starts to pour out onto your body. You were disgusted as this reeking liquid poured from this girls shoes, and all you heard was her laughing at your predicament. The smell that was emanating from Annie's loafer was one that caused your nose to burn with a stench that you were sure would never leave your nose.

At the same time you notice that she was getting bigger every second, but you see that everything else around you is getting bigger as well meaning you are getting smaller. What's worse is that the smell coming from the Annie's feet is getting stronger as you get smaller. After a few more seconds you see the Annie's face turn from confusion to anger. Curious as to why she is angry you then here her say, \"Hey,  where did you go!?\" she asked. If she can't see you that could only mean that you are to small to be seen, you then take in your even larger surroundings and figure you must be the size of a flea now. At first you think its a good thing because Annie can't find you, but on the other hand it means there is more danger than her now. Right before you could figure out what to do now Annie begins walking your direction with her bare feet shaking the ground. Not wanting to be stepped on you begin running away, but unfortunately at your tiny size you don't make it far and soon a shadow created by Annie's foot appears around you. You look up to see the dirty underside of her foot coming down on you. Then her foot lands on you and you now find yourself....</span></div></div>",

Shockwaves and the stench of rank little girl feet wash over you in a cloud of dirt, sending you flying like a mite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land with a rough rolling, on something that wasn't quite ground. It was wetter.. smoother... softer, but.. the stench was unmistakable. You cower and follow the huge arch of the girl's loafer above, seeing it go on and on. You were in Annie's well used shoe, as well evidenced by the sweat lazily dripping from the black walls and pooling in massive lakes to the far north, where Annie's gargantuan toes had worn their imprints. The crater caused by her skipping into the insole was like an entire city block to you now.  And the smell hung in the air like a cheesy, vinegary and.. ashy cloud. You shudder as the booms get louder.  Five plush, filthy toes loom over the mouth of the loafer, covered in a striped legwarmer. They wiggle eagerly. \"Come out come out, where ever you are!\" Annie says in a singing tone, slamming her foot into the shoe.  </span></div></div>",

From this height you were certain the fall would horribly kill or maim you! The ground rushed up to you at an alarming speed, but your sheer horror made the fall, which took only a second or two, seem like hours, before you hit the ground. You let out a loud howl of pain, as you smashed into the hard ground. Practically on instinct, you sprung up and spun around to face your tormentor. It was at that moment you realized something odd...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's with that cry?\" Jinx laughed down at you. \"You don't look thaaat bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. Aside from some dust on you, you didn't even see a bruise. Your entire body ached and pain coursed through you, but you didn't seem to be injured! And even the pain was starting to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't worry. If you want to scream so much, I'll give you something to REALLY scream about!\" Jinx stated with a psychotic glee in her voice, and lifted her booted foot over your head. Your eyes bulge out of your head, and you turn to run. But a hair too slow. Jinx's boot came stomping down on top of you, crushing you down into the dirt again. This time the pain was even worse, but your attempt to scream in pain again, only awards you a mouthful of dirt. Oh geez.... why? Why, of all the champions did it have to be JINX? Why couldn't it have been someone kind like Karma, or Sona? Hell, you'd have even taken someone like Katarina at this point! Katarina might have thought it more than fun to torture you, but at least she knew how much people could take and when to stop! Jinx was completely insane, and would keep going way past your breaking point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....Figuratively and literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt her boot come off of you and suddenly Jinx burst out laughing again. \"Haha! I've heard of squashed flat, but now I've really seen it!\" She howls, and reaches under you, and picks you up. Your vision is suddenly filled with a mad, violet eye as Jinx examines you closely with glee. Her eye fills your entire vision, but you can imagine the wide, toothy grin on her face. And in her eye you can see your reflection and realize you've LITERALLY been squashed flat. Your body seems to have been compressed to the thinness of paper! How you're still alive you have no idea... But then you see yourself slowly inflate, and a spark of recognition appears in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! I think I've got a new toy! Let's see how much you can take!\" And then you were falling again, and struck the ground. It still hurt like hell, though now, perhaps because you had the pain of Jinx stomping on you for comparison, it didn't feel QUITE so bad. So long as she didn't stomp on you again.... Oh god. No. No, no, no....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx had taken Pow-Pow off her back and was pointing it right at you. The barrel was right in your tiny face. You unpleasantly noticed you were small enough to FIT down the barrel. Best to keep your mouth shut on that, to avoid giving Jinx more ideas. Then Jinx's finger pulled the trigger, and a bullet as big as you were blasted into you at point blank range. And then another. And another. Bullets blazed into you, and you were certain you were dead, and just hadn't realized it. Your vision swam and then you blacked out from the sheer pain, certain that, as horrible as this experience was at least you wouldn't have to deal with it any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....You awoke an indeterminate time later to a prodding feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.... am I in heaven?\" You ask woozily. A piercing laugh above you fills your ears. \"Awww, you think this is heaven? That's great!\" Oh no... Jinx continues to tower over you, that giant grin on her face. \"Guess what! Not even Pow-Pow made you go boom! What a bad gun, I'll have to punish him later!\" She giggles manically. \"I'm so glad my toy is so tough to break!\" She lifts her foot up again over you, and this time you realize what was poking you. You wish it could have been her finger, but you weren't so lucky. Jinx had pulled off one of her boots, and the wriggling digits of her foot were undoubtedly what she'd been prodding you with. Your nostrils were filled with the sharpest stink you could have possibly imagined! Then again. Jinx didn't seem much for hygiene. Seriously. Why.... why of why did it have to be her!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx....</span></div></div>",

You had not been paralyzed with fear. Rather there were no orders at all. You could not move shocked by the sudden realization of your powerlessness. You were powerless to escape. Powerless to retaliate. You were powerless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And worst of all, you had accepted it. The sole thing you could do was... surrender to the soles of the beautiful blue haired psycho, and hope that she would allow you to survive. Though if she did, it would merely be to torment you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the smell of jinx's foot awoke you from your train of thought. Her sole now was a sweaty wall of flesh, right in front of you, so close that, if you leaned forward, you forehead would graze it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one swift motion, her toes grasped your head! Gently enough to not crush it, but with enough force to make you yelp in pain. You immediately regretted it. The reeking stench of her footsweat was tenfold worse than the pain. And even worse, you gulped down some sweat. You cringed at the foul taste of it. You wanted to cough, but dared not open your mouth again. Your tongue was burning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do with you?\" You heard Jinx wonder high above.<br>\r\nAfter a brief pause, she squealed in excitement . <br>\r\n\"I know just the thing tiny guy! You will love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begged to differ. Not that it did matter. You felt her move her foot, and loosening her grip on your head. Suddenly you were falling downwards, you screamed instinctively, but then you remembered that you had a similar experience a while ago and you had came out unscathed. Indeed your fall was abruptly halted with you pummeling down on a damp surface. Pain was shooting through your whole body, but you were still alive. It seemed that not only you had shrunk, but also had gained some level of invulnerability. Well you'd rather had lost your sense of smell or pain, but at least this meant you had a chance of survival. The flame of hope was rekindling inside of you. If you played along with jinx rules and became her loyal foot licking puppy, you could find an opportunity to escape sometime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly the smell hit you. Never before had you though you could describe a smell as thick, but this was the best word to describe this foul odor. Wondering where you were you looked up to see a circular opening from where light reached down on your smelly prison.<br>\r\nThen it struck you! You knew exactly where you were! Inside jinx's smelly worn out boot. You grimaced as you felt the stench enter your nose lungs and brain.<br>\r\nTerror filled you as you saw Jin'x feet enter the opening of the boot. \"I hope you are comfortable down there.\" You heard Jinx say melodically.<br>\r\nShe laughed hysterically as her foot slowly entered the boot. Darkness engulfed you. You felt her toes pass over and the arch of her smelly sole came to rest gently on top of you. The stench of her feet intensified the odor inside her putrid damp boot. You wanted to cry. What had you done to deserve this? And then she began to apply pressure down on you, It hurt like fucking hell. You gritted your teeth, wondering how much longer you could last in there. You heard Jinx mumble something above but you could not hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the she stomped down her foot. You screamed in pain, gulping down gallons of disgusting footsweat.  You did not care anymore. Each passing second things were getting even worse, if possible. You were not sure which was the worst part of this torture, the pain or the reek? But definitely it was the most inhumane thing you had ever gone through. There was no escape. Never! Now you fully realized it. There was only serving and worshipping jinx for the rest of your pathetic life.<br>\r\nYou open you mouth and let some more footsweat in. It was foul, but if you were going to spend the remaining of your life in it, you might as well get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then jinx, began walking. She walk for a long time, with lots of unnecessary stomping and twisting her foot, just to torture you. You did not care anymore. You embraced it all as your new life. You screamed every now and then, tasting more of her foul footsweat, and breathed in deeply in the reek of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stench made you dizzy, as if you were high. Soon enough the sole thing you could think was this putrid smell filling you whole being. And whatever hopes you had burning inside of you were slowly being extinguished, as the heavy smell of Jinx\u2019s feet, took over your conscious.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSoon you began mumbling things. Things you did not even realized yourself at the beginning.<br>\r\nthings like:<br>\r\n\"Thank you , Mistress Jinx.\" After each stomp,<br>\r\nOr periodically,<br>\r\n\"I love the smell of your feet, mistress jinx.\" <br>\r\nAnd even<br>\r\n\"Please keep me here forever, Mistress jinx.\"<br>\r\nYou even caught yourself planting kisses at Jin'x sole and taking small licks of it.<br>\r\nYou were surprised, but you did not really care. You could not care. Your conscious had almost faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens next: Jinx...<br>\r\na) Has felt your kissing her foot, and takes you out eventually to reward you<br>\r\nb) Takes you out, saying she needs to blow off some steam. Stomps you relentlessly.<br>\r\nc) Takes you out demanding that you tend to some other part of her body.</span></div></div>",

She plucks one of the tattered shoes up from the dirt, scuffed and worn- and proceeds to give you a view you never wanted to see. Her pale foot dangles above the mouth of the tarnished combat boot, revealing a beat-in footprint the size of a lake - and with puddles of sweat to match, you fear. in the dim light below you see five sharp indentations for each of jinx's writhing, sweaty toes, and a crater for the ball of her foot to match. The insole is torn and tattered, worn away by running, stomping, and crushing bugs like you. And you had a front row seat as the miasma of hot foot wafted up, making your eyes water and your nose burn. Jinx - </span></div></div>",

You don't know how much longer you would be able to last as Vi's slave, the smell and taste of her feet alone will kill you, and you don't even know how much harsher it will get if you don't obey her. Not wanting to anger her you go in for another lick, and another one after that. You slowly start to make progress on her feet. The vile stench never improved and the sicking taste didn't go away. In some spots the filth was so ingrained into her sole that mere licking wouldn't suffice, you actually had to bite it off of her foot, and as you would bite into these disgusting lumps of filth, old sweat would start to drip out and into your mouth, adding to the already rancid taste that was permanently in mouth at this point. Hours of this torture go by and you finally find yourself and the worst part of the task, her toes.<br>\r\n     \"Well,well.\" you hear Vi say \"Looks like you were definitely the right choice for this task! I mean look how clean you made my foot! All that is left are the toes, and whats in-between them.\" you start to shake, this is not headed anywhere good Vi continues \"By this point you must be starved! Why don't we kill two birds with one stone, why don't you just eat all of my toe jam! that why my feet still get clean and you get fed! I will not except no for an answer, so you better eat ALL of it.\" <br>\r\nYou try your best not to puke, this was going too far. You stared at the lumps of toe jam that were in between her toes, the black lumps of goo look completely inedible, and the horrific smell that was being emitted from between her toes beat out anything you have came across before. and to think that she expected you to stick your head in there and EAT all of her toe jam. Tears come to your eyes as your head approaches the depths of her toe cleavage, both from the reek of her feet and from how tired and broken you where at this point. <br>\r\n   Your nose burns from the stale reek of foot sweat, the air was think with the stench of feet and sweat you leaned forward to bite the lump of toe jam, your face in pressed into the horrid substance. You take your first bite and just about die. The indescribable taste of weeks and weeks of wearing the same socks with out washing them or her feet. The feeling of the soft, warm, goo fill your mouth with its vile substances was far to much for you to handle you force yourself to swallow it before looking back at the hell hole that was in between Vi's toes.</span></div></div>",

Continued like this for a some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing job foot boy. You deserve a reward.\" Then she pointed both hands to you. A beam of light hits to your eyes. For a some time, your eyes are blinded; but the blindness wore of in less than a minute. \"Take a closer look.\" You looked to her towering feet. Even she curled his toes forward and her toes are closer to the ground, it's still like some apartment to you. \"I shrunk you more so you can take my feet a closer look.\" Then she giggled. \"How about to lick my heel? You have just a five minutes so you'd better get running to my heel.\" She giggled his toes just a bit; and even the wind caused by a little movement of her toes are hard to stand up to. \"It's a hard life in your size i guess. So if you'll be obeident, i may change your size.\" She giggled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you going to do. If you obey to her, she can change to normal.

A breath escaped her lips as she chuckled softly at how effortlessly she had overpowered you, without even intending to. \"Quite a special little bug I've found on the Rift~\" She said in a tone that was laden with teasing. Before you even had a chance to stand back up, she easily scooped you up in one hand, bringing her up, past her well curved hips and washboard abdominals, past her considerable breasts and up to her face. \"Whatever are you doing here, little bug?\" She taunted you, hot breath washing over you like a gust of wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's dangerous here. Don't you know I could have stepped on you?\" Her voice broke off in a low chuckle, her eyes shining down on you, enthralled at her new toy. You try to speak up, but she takes her other finger and pushes it against your face, smothering you for an instant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shhhh.\" She tells you. \"I don't need to hear your reasons. No. Not at all...\" Her lips curl into a wicked smirk. \"Afterall.\" She begins. \"You're mine now~\" You most certainly do <i>not</i> like the tone of her voice as she says it. It's a voice of authority and power. A voice dripping with the intonation of unpleasant things to come. \"But I'm afraid we'll have to play later.\" She determines. \"I'll learn everything I have to about you in good time. For now, I'll need to put you away somewhere.\" She seems to ponder this for a moment, giving you space to look and admire her near perfect form and body. Which you do. You can hardly help yourself. Clearly, the woman put as much time into her appearance as she did into training. Apart from the scars that dotted her body, her skin was flawless and unblemished. A tapestry of beauty and history that should have belonged to a war goddess. And it seemed that the powers that be had granted her a form to match her features. You almost forgot where you were, in the heat of the moment. Until you heard that deadly chuckle once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy your look?\" She teased you once more. \"I'm glad. Perhaps you've noticed, however, that I am rather lacking in places to put you.\" You looked again, and indeed, saw few pockets on her outfit. Your eyes travelled up, towards her cleavage. A woman's natural pocket. Katarina laughed then, a sound you thought might have sounded charming, but it was far from. Her laugh sent chills down your spine, and evoked all the images of a lion about to pounce on its prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not today my little bug. Not today. You have not earned the honor of that...\" She said, reaching down with her free hand, and tugging off one of her leather boots. You gulp in apprehension, immediately suspecting where this is going, peering over the edge of the woman's palm. A foot to match the rest of her, it was immaculate and beautiful, with long and slender toes. Quite a woman indeed for even her feet to be so beautiful. It took you a moment, though, but then it hit you. She had been going barefoot in black leather boots with the sun beating down-- Oh no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis realization hit you at about the same time as the smell wafted up from the woman's foot. At your diminished height, it seemed your senses were greatly enhanced. Or perhaps the smell was just that potent. Your eyes and nose burned, and you staggered back from the edge of her hand, hoping to put <i>anything</i> between you and the scent of feet that had been sweating and walking in hot leather for what must have been hours already. Even Katarina's eyes widened in surprise at the scent, her mouth forming a soft \"o\" in a half-gasp. Then chuckled again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I'll need to do something about that after my battle today.\" She jests at you, her eyes gleaming. \"Or perhaps you can do something about it, my little bug. I've not had a chance to see how durable you are, so I'll be nice..... for now~\" She smirks at you as she pinches your head between her fingers, lifting you up. The pressure is intense, and you try to scream. But although Katarina can see your face contort in pain, your scream is little more than buzzing in her ears. Your face alone, however, is more than enough to garner her amusement. \"Maybe you can do something about my awful sweat while you're in there.\" She mocks you, lowering you towards the ground and then lifting her foot, snatching you between her toes. The smell is overwhelming and the scream of pain you had meant to emit from the crushing pressure of her third and second toes, pinning you between them is completely lost in the choking gags you emit as the scent of smelly, sweaty feet overload your senses. Her skin is soft and delicate to the touch, and overwhelmingly warm. You feel yourself sinking into the hot, sweat coated toeflesh as Kataria squeezes you with her powerful digits. You feel dizzy, as you feel the foot start to move.... and begin to re-enter the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye bye my little bug.\" Katarina taunts you. \"I'll be sure to think up something <i>extra</i> special for you when I get home after this battle.\" And then her face disappears from sight, and you are swallowed up by the darkness of her boot.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You lost track of the time you spent, trapped in Katarina's boot. Once the battle was underway, you were pummeled relentlessly. The Noxian assassin's soft and velvet-like feet did not seem nearly so yielding or pleasant when they were slamming and crushing into you at what felt like hundreds of miles an hour, with the equivalent mass of a very (VERY) large building. For hours Katarina danced across the rift, spinning and leaping. Her weight shifting from foot to foot, at one moment giving you relief from the crushing pressure, and at other times she would shift entirely up to the ball of her foot, driving what felt like the weight of her entire body atop of you. And that saying nothing of the smell or dampness. Both only grew worse. Katarina had selected boots which fit her perfectly. No additional wiggle room whatsoever, so as to prevent her foot sliding around inside. They were a tight, and perfect fit. The consequence being that the smell could not escape them until she removed her foot. Leather was not the most breathable of materials, and so the reeking stink and boiling heat only raised. There was a point at which all you could do was squeeze your eyes shut to avoid the smell from burning them. But there was nothing you could do for your nose, as the pungent odor scoured your nostrils. To call it pungent though was an understatement, for you had never experienced anything like this. You'd experienced some bad smells in your life. Who hasn't? But never had you experienced the scent of an assassin's foot while it was still inside such a horrid boot, in mid-battle, sweat streaming off of it, and to make matters worse, you were acutely aware that your sense of smell had indeed been intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweat itself nearly drowned you several times. You suspected, with what little processing power your mind had beyond reeling at the wretched stink and pressure, that the opposing team must have had a Brand or Annie present, for there were several moments when the heat spiked immensely, and sweat flowed even more profusely. You were certain you must have been sweating yourself, but it was impossible to say, drenched in Katarina's. And this sweat lubricated your body. As the hours dragged on, you began to slip out from the crushing grip of her toes, your damp form sliding across the slippery, sweat coated footflesh. Katarina was far more focused on the battle-- on evading the blows of her adversaries and dealing back in turn, to leave any focus on the little bug she had found at the start of the match. You tried to issue a cry as you slowly but surely began to slip beneath the scarlet haired assassin's perfect soles, but, your throat scorched by the smell inside her boots, you could issue little more than a croak. You felt her feet fly off the ground, as, in the world of the normal sized beings, Katarina sprang into her Shunpo technique to attack. Helpless to resist, you slipped beneath the ball of Katarina's foot as she landed, her entire body weight crushing down on you. Death. Sweet release from this hell. You were ready for it now, feeling the hundreds, no thousands, maybe even millions of tons that was Katarina's weight all come crushing down on you. You felt your chest compress, and felt your body flatten beneath her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you did not die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the instant, this new horror of your situation began to set in, Katarina began her Death Lotus, spinning rapidly in place. Spinning on the ball of her foot. The same foot that was crushing you. Unable to move. Unable to scream. Unable to do anything but stare into the blackness, and endure the pressure as the Assassin's foot ground you into the insole of her boot, plastering you to her sweat-soaked sole like little more than a sticker. You mentally prayed for release. For mercy. But there was none. Katarina, for the time being, had forgotten you had even existed, and, had she known, the cruel Noxian would likely have found your situation to be positively hysterical, rather than offer any form of help. Katarina had a streak of malice a mile wide. She was unquestionably the worst person you could possibly have run afoul of. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You did not know how long the battle continued after that. You wished you could say that was because you had passed out. But that was not so. Whatever horrid enchantment had made you this size, in addition to preventing your easy demise, seemed to prevent you losing consciousness as well. You were forced to endure every second of the time you spent in the stinking boot of Katarina, the Sinister Blade. But the battle must have ended at some point, for eventually you felt Katarina move into an easier pace. She had ceased her continual running, and leaping about. Her pace was even now. Walking. The battle must have been over. So why... why did it feel even hotter now? You heard Katarina's distant voice, cursing above. She seemed extremely displeased with something, though you did not know what. Then she stopped. Her weight pressed down upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I almost forgot about you, little bug.\" You could make out. \"I hope I didn't crush you flat during the battle.\" She said, her tone hardly sounding concerned. Almost.... mocking, albeit with a note of disappointment at the idea she had lost her victim. You felt the weight lift off of you, completely, and you realized Katarina must have sat down. You felt motion again, as she took the boot off. And then you finally saw light! But fate, it seemed, was a cruel mistress (though not nearly as cruel as your captor), for the light you had thought would bring you some measure of solace did anything but. If anything, it filled you with dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was what you saw. An ocean of sand, beneath you, and as Katarina set her foot down, sole facing out to inspect her toes and look for you, you saw it stretched out for miles in all directions. You realized, with a small measure of horror, that you were in a desert. That certainly explained why it had gotten hotter, at least. But it meant that Katarina's feet, the same feet to which you found yourself plastered, would only get hotter and sweatier and... gulp... smellier, as time went on. Not less. You were snapped out of your horror, by Katarina's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. He's not here. He must have slipped out from between my toes during the match.\" She hissed, and you saw her move her boot, inspecting it. Katarina tried to look inside, but quickly thought better of it, catching a tiny whiff of the smell you had been forced to endure for what had felt like hours. \"Ooof... if he's even still alive in here.\" She commented, turning the boot upside down and shaking it to see if anything would come out. Of course, you didn't, and this only increased Katarina's frustration. \"Where is he...?\" She asked, and then turned her foot to check her sole, to see if she could find you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected her to find you nearly instantly. Instead, she merely squinted at her sole for a moment.... then you saw a spark of recognition in her eyes. She'd seen you! ....And she began to laugh, that same chilling, mocking laugh you'd heard before. But she quickly found herself unable to stop. Tears entered Katarina's eyes as she laughed harder and harder. She released her foot so she could hold her stomach, laughing and stomping a foot (the one you were stuck to of course) into the sand in hysterics. After several moments she seemed to compose herself and lifted her foot again. \"Well, well, it seems you had quite an adventure, didn't you little bug?\" She teased you, pulling out a knife and sliding it in front of her foot so you could see your reflection. A gasp of horror emitted from you, and you realized why Katarina had taken a moment to find you. The events of the battle had crushed you completely flat. You were little more than a sticker, pasted just below the ball of the Noxian assassin's foot. You blended in nearly seamlessly with her sole, in fact even staring at yourself, it became hard to see where your body ended and the assassin's foot began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatarina chuckled some more, and filled you in, as she drank in your terror. \"As you can see, the Institute's mages did not return me to my home of Noxus as I'd hoped.\" She said, with disdain in her voice. \"Someone seems to have screwed up and dropped us off in Shurima.\" But then she smirked again. \"So I'm afraid I certainly won't be able to wash my feet off anytime soon little bug...\" She said, lightly tapping her foot against the sands of Shurima, pressing you down each time. \"But it's good to know you and my feet have gotten to know each other so well~\" She taunted you. \"I might be inclined to leave you with them for awhile more then, since you're now so close~\"</span></div></div>",

Afterall, she could always put you back there, anytime she wanted to. She smiled wickedly at you, and pressed her foot into the sands of Shurima. \"Now hold still little bug.... This will only hurt a <i>lot</i>.\" She said, gleefully, as she vigorously twisted her bare, sweaty foot back and forth into the Shuriman sands. The rough sands pulled and teared at you, causing you incredible pain, but slowly began to rip you off the assassin's foot, grain by grain. Finally, Katarina, finished the job, reaching out and peeling you off her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're much more durable than I gave you credit for, little bug.\" She said. You struggled to regain your voice, while Katarina's piercing gaze held you, and she continued speaking. \"I'm glad~ It means I'll get to try out all sorts of things on you.\" She said with a sinister tone in her voice, and she licked her lips. You finally found your voice and began to rasp out your protests, but your throat was still scorched from the time you'd spent in her boots, and Katarina could not hear a word you said. \"Trying to talk, little bug? I'm afraid you'll have to speak up.\" She taunted. \"But that's alright. I don't need to hear what you have to say.\" She dropped you onto a nearby stone and pinned you down with one toe-- and her little toe at that, crushing your abdominals and below with ease. The familiar scent of her feet stung your nostrils as Katarina looked down on you with a gleam in her eye, and a few beads of sweat, that were less beads to you, and more like the amount of water you'd find in a city fountain, splashed over your face, soaking you in Katarina's foot scent. You retched as more than a little of the scent flowed into your mouth and down your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you not like that?\" She mocked. \"Well I'm afraid, so far from home, my feet won't be smelling any better anytime soon, my little bug.\" She smirked at you. \"Not unless a little bug was willing to help...\" You blanced in terror as Katarina lifted her foot off of you. You tried to scramble up, but it seemed that although the damage to your lower body was not to be permanent, it was enough to keep you down. Katarina had effectively crushed you with nothing more than her little toe. It was humiliating. Katarina hovered her foot over you. You could see filthy toejam had begun to form between her toes, sand coated the bottom of her sole, and it literally shone with sweat. \"While we're here, I may as well get a rest from that battle. And while I rest, <i>you</i> can clean my feet, since you so desperately want to get rid of their smell.\" She teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or....\" She began, looking down at you devilishly. \"Maybe instead, I can test just how durable you are. You survived all that time under my feet. Not a small accomplishment~ If the pressure didn't kill you, the smell certainly should have.\" She taunted. \"So perhaps we can test it another way.... A way I'm sure I'll enjoy but you certainly won't...\" She said, stroking a finger across her belly as she said so, and licking her lips in anticipation as she stared down at you, deliberating your fate.</span></div></div>",

You gave a dry gulp in fear of what was to come, as she flexed her toes, brushing your face with them and scraping sand, sweat and grit off of them onto your face. \"I think I've made my choice, little bug.\" She told you. \"Much as I'd <i>love</i> to feel you squirming inside my belly...\" She began, rubbing her belly, and snapping her teeth at you threateningly. \"After all that time you've spent marinating in my boot, you'd probably taste absolutely disgusting. You get to live another day. At least until I find something to wash you off first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.... Joy.\" You grumble back at her, finding so many issues with her tone like you should be grateful to her for this. Like the fact that eating you would be more of an inconvenience to her. Katarina's looks were stunning, but you were quickly getting over that in the wake of her sheer malice towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course the first chance I get, I'll be sure to test how well you handle my digestive system.\" She warned you. \"But maybe I can be persuaded otherwise. Who knows~ I might even be willing to help you.\" <i>Now</i> she had your attention. You almost weren't sure if it was simply false hope she was giving you, to take away later, but you'd take it. She said that she'd be willing to help you! ...Maybe. The scarlet assassin didn't miss your reaction, small as you were and she gave a deep, throaty chuckle. \"Well, you've got to do something for me first. And that....\" As she spoke, she lifted up her sole, which was now covered in a fine layer of sand. \"Is to clean my feet.\" She declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared up at the monolithic behemoth of a foot that towered above you. Katarina's feet, although normally dainty and fairly small, loomed above like skyscrapers. Cleaning them could take you hours! But her cold eyes told you, you had little choice in the matter. If you ever wanted to go back to your normal size, you'd need her cooperation. Slowly, apprehensively, you approached Katarina's sweaty sole. The smell was not as bad as it had been in her boot, now that the desert air was around to help diffuse it. But that didn't mean it was perfect. Your eyes watered as you approached her soles and you slowly began to rub the sand away. Katarina's chuckle met your ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like that, little ant.\" She said. \"You're not showing your master proper devotion. I want you to use your <i>tongue</i> to clean my feet. And add a few kisses in there for good measure. I'll let you decide how many. Just keep in mind, the more devotion you show to your master, the more likely I am to be merciful with you.\" She added with a deadly smirk, her eyes glittering with amusement. You grit your teeth and began your work, and gave Katarina's sand coated heel the first lick. The taste stung your mouth and you nearly vomited, doubling over and giving several heaving motions as you struggled to keep the contents of your stomach down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say stop!\" Katarina snapped. You grudgingly returned to your task. The second lick of her foot was almost as bad as the first, and the salty taste of her sweat overwhelmed your taste buds. But you trudged on through the humiliating task, literally licking Katarina's feet clean. Lick by lick, centimeter by centimeter. Katarina's mirth was palpable, as she wiggled her toes in glee above your head, at the torment she was putting you through. You didn't forget to kiss her sole, either beginning each new section with several kisses, which Katarina appeared to approve of. Cleaning her foot this way, it took nearly an hour just to clean the bottom of her heel, despite trying as fast as you could. Every time Katarina scrunched her toes above you, sweat dripped off of them, splashing onto your head and forcing you to your knees as though you were worshipping her foot. The Noxian woman giggled at this, and your pitiful progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well. Aren't you a motivated one. You actually did better than I thought.\" She said, dropping her foot back down. Unfortunately, she dropped it down on top of you, crushing you under her sole. You felt her sole scraping above you, rolling you up to her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I've waited an hour, and you're not even close to finished. Not that I expected someone like <i>you</i> to accomplish this. But for that lovely devotion you showed my soles, I'll give you one more chance.\" Suddenly you found yourself in the shade as Katarina's gigantic hand reached over you.... And then her finger pressed your face deep between her toes. Right, face first into the fresh, grimy toejam you had seen forming earlier. It was awful. A marshy, swampy stink that completely enveloped your face. You swore you were getting light headed, but that went away, replaced by cold horror when you heard Katarina's next line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not a request. Not a challenge. Not a cutesy little \"If you don't eat this, I won't help you.\" It wasn't even a demand. It was an order. An irrefutable order. This wasn't just bossing you around. The tone didn't have any amusement in it. Katarina was showing you the difference between you and her. An immeasurable difference, that you didn't have a prayer of refusing her command. Her edicts. She wasn't your master. She was your goddess. And as you realized this, something inside you broke. With tears welling in your eyes... you obeyed her, and began to eat away at the disgusting substance that covered your face. Katarina felt this and gave you a wicked smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it. Hmm... I suppose I should come up with something to name you. Bug? Speck? Toejam? Afterall, you are what you eat.\" She declared mockingly. You tried to block her out, tried to block out what it was you were doing, with each chewy, disgusting mouthful. After only a few minutes, the space between Katarina's toes was clear, and you were pretty certain you were about to be sick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare throw that up.\" Katarina warned you. \"You're going to digest it. It's part of you. Part of who you are. Besides, you'd better get used to the taste. Afterall... I have ten toes.\" She purred. Your face, if it wasn't pale enough already, lost even more color at this declaration. You would have stumbled back, but Katarina's toes held you like a vice. They lifted you up, hovering you above her boot. You swore you could see the smell trying to escape the boot like steam. Wafting right up in your face. Katarina's edict that you not expel the toejam you had just eaten, and the fear of what she would do if you disobeyed, kept you from hurling, but only just. As Katarina slowly lowered you back into the warm, sweaty, smelly darkness that awaited you, you heard her grant you one last order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have this foot cleaned up by my next break, alright? If you do...\" She just flashed you a deadly smile, not finishing her sentence. And then she was gone, as her foot swallowed up all the light in her boot, and you were back in that sauna. Even in the darkness, you could feel her powerful toes wrap and bind you, like great, powerful pythons. You wanted to weep. Instead, you miserably began to feel your way between the toes to begin your next meal....</span></div></div>",

More than just the faint smell of yordle footsweat getting to your head.  Your body starts to dwindle, the material of the legwear growing larger and larger with each second. Your handholds in the material begin to slip, too large for your fingers to get around. Luckily, you don't seem to be shrinking all that much.  Unluckily, you seem to be in danger of falling, and as the purple toes slam into the dirt of the rift after another successful jump, that's exactly what you do. Your hands slip from the material, but you aren't a splat just yet- Your last motion is to throw your weight towards the toes, and slip between the leather strap and the bare purple toes.<br>\r\n     The strap opens like a hungry mouth before snapping back to it's place, pinning you firmly against Tristana's toecrotch. That's when your journey really takes a turn for the worst. You never thought about this, but it makes sense that bare leather on hot skin in the heat of battle would make for some unfortunate results. Dirt from the rift mixed with a truly surprising amount of perspiration here, creating a disgusting mix of toejam all sealed inside by the leather strap. And you had a front row seat to the whole show, as the strap tenses, the warm, wet gunk accepting you into itself like a nightmare quicksand. Your nose burns, your eyes start to water, and the sticky gunk pins you to the glistening purple toeflesh as Tristana recalls. Your struggles tickle, but not quite enough to get the Gunner's attention as she points to the taller items in the shop, baking you into her toejam all while new sweat forms and rolls down your tiny body. It was not going to get better. </span></div></div>",

The leather tightly trapping you in the rank crevice of Tristana's toes also helped to tightly compact you with the thick gunk that had previously built up during the match. Even worse, as Tristana began to make her way back into the game the stirrup began tightening and shifting along with the movement and flexing of her rank bare foot. What this really did was force your body even more tightly into the foot flesh squeezing copious amounts of the rotten foot sweat onto your essentially toe jam bound body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then you realized something even more horrifying. As Tristana battled against Missfortune, dodging and weaving as she blasted her massive cannon, she began kicking up and swallowing more dirt and filth between and under her foot. What this meant for you was that, as you were pressed into the smey toe cleavage by her meager footcovering, more dirt was being swallowed into the gaping maw of leather heat and sweat. Slowly the buildup began to form, but this time behind you. And as leather flakes and sweat began to merge with the filthy foot sweat that now burned your eyes, nose, and mouth with its salty pungency, more and more toe jam was forming behind you. You could feel the gooey thickness taking form and realized that you were now not just surrounded by the thick jammy filth, but were now becoming encased in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could have cried but instead chose to scream, which was when the real torture began. As soon as you opened your mouth the disgusting gooey substance forced its way into your mouth, desperate to escape somewhere in the tight squishy confines of the leather toe prison. The taste was unlike anything you had experienced. Like you could taste every part of the map from the filthy mud of the river to the trampled foot paths of mid and bot all fused with the bitter taste of the sweat from each ponding step the tiny yordle girl during the whole match. In other words, an unfathomable foot hell in edible (debatably) form. And it just wouldn't stop filling your mouth to the point you could no longer chew. So you only had to writhe and squirm and scream into the filth praying for freedom, lest you would have to wait for the mouthful of toe jam to dissolve in your saliva before you would be free of it. </span></div></div>",

She barely seemed to notice in fact as she sat in the dirt and used her free hand to crack the seal of her leather boots around her feet. A small bust of hot air hit you even at your elevated position which didn't help to quell your fears in any way. Finally the bare foot was bulled from the inside revealing a small foot maybe slightly taller than you. The sole was slick and greasy with sweat and the gaps of the toes seemed to have small deposits of gooey toe jam.

You knew it was useless to struggle and yet you couldn't help yourself. Anywhere but in there would have been fine.

Finally the fist unclenched as you went plummeting into the dark depths of her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed on the insole of the boot with a wet squish as hot sweat splashed onto your body covering you in the disgusting liquid and blinding you with the salty fluid.

No matter what you tried to do you couldn't escape the fetid scent of her feet, and as if it wasn't bad enough suddenly all light faded as her pudgy foot soon filled out the inside of her boot, kicking you over and pressing you between her sweltering hot foot and the squishy insole beneath you.

When you were forced into the worn-down footwear, and the bright bluish ped lowered down to squash you into the insole, your legs were pushed apart, leaving you spread eagle against the soft foot flesh. The damp toes wiggled in your face. They were almost taunting you, daring you to attempt escape, knowing that it was a useless endeavor that would only leave you even further in their clutches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Yordle girl took her first step with you inside, your head was pushed deeply into the embrace of her toe arches, moistening your face with hints of salty perspiration, already present from her run to lane. While your body was trampled, your position was ever so slightly changed; your clothes were twisted and torn, allowing the heft of Poppy\u2019s sole to rub against your bare skin. Luckily, the slickness of the pudgy foot flesh prevented you from getting rug burns; instead, you were gradually coated in a layer of her sudor, swamping you with her sour smell. Though you closed your mouth\u2014not eager to introduce your tongue to anyone\u2019s feet, much less the giant, reeking, sweaty beasts before you\u2014the one thing you couldn\u2019t mitigate was the smell. You held your breath in a desperate bid to avoid the inevitable, but eventually, you had to get air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a gas junkie sniffing gasoline, you huffed the strong, heady odor of Poppy\u2019s foot straight from the source. You couldn\u2019t help but gag, your lungs soiled by the cheesy musk. Unfortunately for you, this little slip-up meant that the surplus of sweat she worked up was primed to leak down into your helpless little throat. The second you opened your mouth, it was met with the burning taste of freshly-excreted sweat, the spongy flesh pushing its way into your mouth. The salty liquid poured into your yap by the gallon, and even though you woke up with a moderate thirst, you\u2019d much rather be parched than have it be quenched by some girl\u2019s toe sweat. You tried to spit it out, but that only forced it deeper, guaranteeing that you\u2019d be savoring the aftertaste for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis torment continued on as the stout Yordle played out her lane, working up a sweat all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoppy was in the middle of catching Mundo off guard, when suddenly, Kha\u2019Zix leapt out at her; thinking quickly, she grabbed Orlon\u2019s Hammer in both hands, tilted on one foot, and smashed it into the ground, knocking both of the enemy champions all the way back to their tower. Then, she decided to recall back to base, standing still in a bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, your body was crushed by a terrible pressure, the air was crushed out of your lungs, and your face was shoved into a dirty, squishy toe crevice. Was your \u2018savior\u2019 putting all her weight onto the one foot you were under?! Ugh, she was probably holding that huge-looking hammer, too\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god, she still wasn\u2019t lifting her foot! Your face was going blue and your eyes were bulging out of your skull; you couldn\u2019t survive this much longer. Even if it smells terrible in here, breathing this muggy fog in is better than dying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the weight was lifted off your battered body, and the foot that dominated your senses was lifted up into the air. Before you could even think about what you were doing, you inhaled sharply, your nose buried deep in the filthy webbing between her second and third toe. A spicy, putrid, and utterly horrendous cocktail of cheddar, vinegar, and toejam surged through your nostrils and was shot directly to your brain, pure and undiluted. An electric shock spread throughout your body, and you let out an involuntary scream, your senses overloaded by the intensely putrid stench of her beat-up peds. Your jaw slacked and you hyperventilated, no longer able to control your breath after that horrific experience; the stench now passed over your lips and through your gums, gifting your tongue with an olfactory assault that shocked you further into a stupor. The filth between her toes ever so slightly made its way into your mouth, adding a zesty punch to the briny odor infecting your body. All you could do was suck in more breaths full of her potent stench in the hopes that there was enough oxygen to keep you conscious\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoppy was having a blast top lane; even with his cleavers, Mundo didn\u2019t stand a chance against her or her hammer\u2014<i>hero\u2019s hammer, Poppy. Don\u2019t forget your mission!</i> Aw, whatever! He didn\u2019t even get close to killing her! <i>His flames did kind of heat me up, though\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh! That reminded her! <i>How\u2019s the little guy doing in my boot? It\u2019s probably terrible in there, but the whole \u2018fighting other people who are trying to kill you\u2019 thing didn\u2019t exactly leave her a lot of options on where to put him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she felt pretty bad about stuffing you into her footwear, but as time went on, and her feet got sore, she noticed how comfortable you felt under her hot, tired sole. Your body cushioned her foot completely; it was almost like the boot you were in was brand new! Of course, it wasn\u2019t nearly the same experience for you, being flattened like a pancake and covered in her filth. She supposed that you and her aching feet should take a breather, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting distance between herself and the shopkeeper, Poppy pops off her 'unoccupied' boot, and pulls her foot out into the open. She cringed at the smell, knowing that it must be a hundred times worse for you. That didn't stop her from secretly enjoying the feeling of your form underneath her, though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting the bullet, she pulls off the boot you're in. Being under her sweaty, sticky soles for so long essentially glued you to them, your body coming along with the foot and into the relatively cool open air. You gasp for breath, your atmosphere still tinged with the smack of her sweat, but at this point you couldn't be happier for a mouthful of something other than sweat, whether liquid or mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour 'savior' stared at the bottom of her foot for a second, taking in the mesmerizing sight of you plastered to her sole. Some weird, tingly feeling ran down her spine, and her thoughts drifted to what would happen if she just kept you under her sole like this forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gah! NO, Poppy! You're supposed to be a hero! Don't give in to temptation...</i> she scolded herself, feeling guilty about her lack of consideration for you. <i>Hnngh...but it feels so good...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally regaining enough oxygen to use your voice, you pushed your head away from the sweaty Yordle toes that made your life hell and shout, \"H-hey! Could you <i>get me off your foot?!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh! Right!\" she replies, grabbing you gently by your shoulder and slowly peeling you off of her sole. It takes a bit; you were <i>really</i> stuck deep in there. She eventually laid you down on the ground, being careful not to put too much force on your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY THE HELL DID YOU PUT ME IN YOUR BOOT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I had nowhere else to put you. Do you know where we are? This place is a battlefield; if I put you anywhere else, you'd probably be completely crushed by now! Not to mention some of the magic these guys have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suppose she had a point, but anger clouded your mind. You'd expect her to have at least a little bit of hesitation before stashing you in such an awful place! Deciding to give her a piece of your mind, you really laid it in to her how much you detested where she put you. You even threw in a few insults about the disgusting stench of her feet--probably not the best idea, given that she's the only one who currently knows you exist. After you finish, you scooch away from her bare foot, which was still resting against the cool cobblestone of the fountain floor. Those things tore your clothes clean off, leaving you only in your underwear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoppy gazed at you and frowned, her face contorting into a confused, conflicted expression. \u201cWell, if you hate it so much, then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were now debating whether insulting her admittedly repulsive feet was really the right move or not. The yordle girl was nervously biting her bottom lip as she stared down at her own bare foot with a look of deep contemplation causing your nerves to only grow worse and worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but what?

Sure she expected you to be a bit upset but breaking out into a sprint? Not exactly what she had in mind. She began to pull her boot back on to go after you, as the many cracks in the cobblestone of the base would provide way to many places to hide. Noticing you were making some headway though she simply left it as she gave chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprisingly good at running, weaving into the cracks of the nexus and crawling along the gaps between the stones on the floor to get to the inhibitor. Poppy was getting frustrated as her teammates stared at the scattered yordle with concern, but decided she was doing well enough against her opponent to ignore it. Poppy was sure she had lost you before catching the slightest glimpse of the tiny person wedge his way into a crack in the stone of the inhibitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dashed over to the structure and tried to reach in a fist finding it was much too small of a place for her to get her hand into, definitely a first for the generally small yordle. She let out a frustrated groan still not able to get that little person back under her foot. Wait that wasn\u2019t what I meant. <i>Well maybe it was\u2026 but it\u2019s only to keep him safe. I mean imagine if Jinx or Katarina got their hands on him. This is definitely the right thing to do. And the fact he feels so good beneath my soles is just, a bonus.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she needed to get the little man out, and she had just the idea. After all there was no other way out of the hiding spot aside where he went in. And now that she knew just how he felt about her feet drawing him out would be easy. Removing her ther boot with a wet pop that sickened even her a bit she placed the opening in front of the crack in the wall that he used to escape her. Now all she had to do was wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally felt free from the yordle girl. You had no idea what had gotten into the half sized hero but the way she was trying to keep possession of you like some sort of prisoner was downright psychotic. When you saw her hand fail to try and pry you from your hiding spot you finally felt like you were safe. That was until the hole went black, and everything got much much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horribly overwhelming scent of the yordles feet slowly begins to grow and fester in your confined space. You couldn\u2019t believe this, she was trying to smoke you out with her foot stench. The smell of her cheesy sweat and toe jam began to grow and swirl and your confines grew hotter and hotter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel your head swimming once more from the foot funk being all that you could breath and fell to your knees. You wretched but promised yourself not to let these little yordles feet get the better of you with no such luck. The scent of her feet was as horrible if not more so than all of your time in her boot. You swear it was like you could see those pudgy toes wiggling now even if all you had to go on was the scent. But you knew all you had to do was persevere. Eventually she would have to give up on this, and by proxy you, right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your breath hitches in your throat, and you cringe, the swampy stench of used boot zapping your nostrils.

You tried in vain to hold your head high, but the pain in your neck becomes too great, and you're forced to peer down into the murky, musky void of her footwear. The hot, cheesy miasma seems to worsen when you\u2019re made to look at its source.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHuffing and puffing as your miniscule erection is steadily pumped, unwillingly inhaling the boot's hot, vinegary musk, you feel your thoughts become sluggish. You want to curl up and cry. You were just trying to disprove the \u2018Forests of Insanity\u2019 boogeyman that the important figures in your village blatantly used as an excuse for why people who went against the status quo disappeared. How could you have possibly known that your mission would lead to this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Yordle\u2019s fingers pinch harder around your dick, jerking you more fervently than before. You clenched your teeth, terrified of the pain that would inevitably come\u2026but\u2026there wasn\u2019t any. Only insane, mind-boggling pleasure. You can hardly believe anyone could exact the amount of finesse this perfect fingerjob required.

You stare numbly into the dank, sweaty hell beneath you as you take in the strong, heady vapors of evaporated sweat that escaped from the yawning maw of Lulu's boot. Your legs shake instinctively as waves of pleasure crash against your psyche, the increasing pace of Lulu\u2019s digits shaking you to your core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin the rise to a regretful climax, a free finger shoves itself into your sternum, knocking the wind out of you. It stays there, leaving you unable to breathe; and yet, you continue a speedy ascent to orgasm, the sudden lack of air somehow sending your balls into overdrive! You choke, and wriggle, and thrust, the mixed messages streaming through your consciousness all coming together at once: Escape, breathe, cum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't\u2014hold on\u2014much longer\u2014!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finger constricting your breathing releases its hold on your chest. Desperate for air, and all too aware of what comes next, you accept defeat. You take an immense, automatic breath, pumping all of the potent, omnipresent foot funk into your lungs, and let out a strained moan as you ejaculate into the small, delicate, yet frighteningly competent fingers of the Yordle mage. The sexual high is, mortifyingly enough, not dampened in the least by the presence of Lulu\u2019s foot stench. Rather, the sheer physical relief you experienced in that one moment, getting any air at all, fresh or not, in addition to the sexual euphoria you felt from that amazing ejaculation, were now something you subconsciously associated with grimy, hard-working Yordle feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t have the mental capacity to think about this, though; right now, you\u2019re laying limp in Lulu\u2019s hands, simultaneously panting for breath and nuzzling your tired head into the soft, almost pillow-like plushness of the mage\u2019s hands. Your body is gently encompassed in them. A thumb points down and rubs your back, working out some kinks in your muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulu looks down at your frail, exhausted form and says, <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Aww, did my cute little servant tucker himself out?

You screamed as you plummeted into the stuffy depths if the used footwear. The air slowly grew more and more humid as what could only be vile foot vapors began consuming your senses. As you reached out to grab the edge in an attempt to perhaps delay if not save you from the fate of resting in the same place her foot had marinated in its own salty juices for who knows how long, you slipped. Your hand slid along a surface clearly coated in creasy foot sweat and grime and your fate was sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell farther and farther down as the fetid cheesy scent of the yordles bare foot grew worse and worse by the second. First your eyes watered, then your nose burned, and by the tine you landed on the insole with a wet sloppy slap, you were fighting the urge to vomit all along the already filthy boot padding. Sweat seeped into large puddles wherever you made contact with the ground causing the warm slick liquid to coat your body on impact. The air was like a thick miasma feeling poisonous to even breath, fitting for the purple as poison girl that had trapped you as...well you still wasn't sure what she saw you as besides tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you let out a yelp, sure he could taste the scent from just the briefest opening of his mouth, as his whole world began to tilt. This psycho was trying to force him to the toe, the place that would surely have the most condensed and potent foot stench of the whole boot. You scrambled to your hands and knees as you tried to fight to keep yourself under the opening of the boot. But each desperate scramble was only met with a new puddle of sweat forming and handfuls of...maybe it was better not to think about it. With the surface being too slippery to climb you could do nothing by descend down the sweat coated slip and slide to the depths of the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air at the toe end was so thick you could practically chew it, causing you to suffocate in the scent of the normally tiny yordle's feet. Just as you thought it could get no worse, stewing in the stench of the purple yordle's feet, it began. The light playful humming followed by the slight shaking of the boot, an earthquake for you freshly basting you in a new coat of the fetid foot sweat that coated every surface. And then, the toes of the dainty purple stench machines. Toes wiggling hungrily as if eager to chew on the new plaything that wandered its way into their den. You panicked as you tried to put as much distance between you and them as possible. But being at the toe of the boot it was practically impossible. With nowhere to go, you could only cry in fear and agony as the purple toes suddenly found a home squeezing your body beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stench only grew as the dank source of the smell now curled around your naked body, once again coating in another fresh coat of sweat. The taste had now easily found its way to your mouth coating it in the salty unimaginable taste of her fetid foot sweat. How one girl's feet, especially a pair so small, could smell and taste so bad was unimaginable to you. And then it began, the hungry toes began to feast as they scrunched and squished you body, practically waterboarding you with the cheesy sweat that squeezed out in nearly gallons at your size. Worst of all though, was your nethers. The hot sweaty flesh of her smaller toes wrapped, squeezed, and scrunched over your genetalia causing a pleasurable sensation that you detested. But as the wiggling and scrunching continued you knew what she wanted. She wanted you to cum at her smelly repulsive feet and as the hot slick skin continued to assault you, you weren't sure you could last. You could truly think of nothing more humiliating than cumming qt the the smelly sweaty skin of her toes, but her devious giggles and cute taunts she seemed to be battering you with said she wouldn't't allow any resistance. With no chance of resisting you simply laid back, eyes watering in disgust at the ever present scent of her feet as\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When one hears of the aspect of twilight, being the embodiment of mischief, imagination and change, one has a generally pleasant picture in their mind. Aside from arguably mischief no one could argue that those were generally good things. So you wouldn\u2019t exactly expect cults to an aspect like that to exist right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are cults dedicated to that aspect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such cult happened to be sparking some less than legal activities in and around the demcain area and, being a member of the guard, you had to investigate. It took an admittedly long time to connect all the dots to find said cult but once you had all you would have to do was storm the place, arrest the members, and clean up the mess. Easy right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became clear that whatever experiments were taking place here you wanted no part of. People with limbs of mismatched size and portions of their body that looked almost cropped off. Scary stuff to be sure. But not nearly as scary as the part where you were hit over the head, knocked unconscious, and dragged onto a stone ritual platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there some swearing was done by you, some struggling, a couple of failed attempts at throwing a punch. Nothing that would really help your situation but it did help you feel a bit better in a way to fight back. Still when the man in the spooky black robe said what was going to happen next would change everything you weren\u2019t exactly hyped. And as a blinding light took you you were sure you were dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now wish you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke in a starry plane that seemed to stretch on for infinity. What exactly you were standing on wasn\u2019t very clear but it seemed solid enough. All you could do was stare into the distance in shock and awe. An awe that grew even more potent as a shadow appeared over you. Turning around you couldn\u2019t believe your eyes. The Aspect of Twilight, Zoe floated above you with a look of wonder and joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey finally didn\u2019t fail! Those people finally sent me a toy person I can have fun with! I have to remember to give them lots of good dreams in the future.\u201d She says doing small spins in the air and yelling in a shrill voice that rattled your ears at this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of this size you were small. Like even though this girl was supposed to be maybe waist height at best to you, you were only slightly smaller than her already small feet. Then it hit you, toy person? What does that mean or even entail. You unfortunatly barely had time to ask as you were scooped up in a two handed grip that was just a bit to hard causing you to gran and Zoe to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty, let\u2019s not waste any time my little follower! I\u2019ve been thinking of what I would do when someone finally got here for centuries so I got tons of ideas and the power here to do whatever I want! Lets start wiiiiith...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
