His arm was the first to bulge much more bigger than before. It kept to increase and became much more bigger. Next was his biceps which are piling up with mountainous pounds of muscles and power. It now looks like 3 cannonballs are stuffed inside of his arm. Then the growth went to his body. His pecs began to enlarge and were filing up nicely with his new body, it increase as it looked like a slabs of muscle was implanted inside his chest. Then his abs were beginning to form much more defined shape and are bulging with muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final wave of muscle growth went down to his legs, it began to pile up with mound of muscle and so does his calf which are swelling up at a fast rate.His legs now was swelling with muscle and strength. After 3 hours of pain, the pain dies away and the growth slows down and then stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got on his feet and began to examine his new figure.
