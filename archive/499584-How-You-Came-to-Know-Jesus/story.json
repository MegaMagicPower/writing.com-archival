            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It all started while I was studying at Purdue University. Even though I was raised Catholic and was very active in my local church growing up, I was TOTALLY clueless. A classic overachieving perfectionist in high school, straight A's and all. I eventually burned out near the end of HS, and it carried over to freshman year at Purdue. I came within a letter grade of flunking out my 2nd semester. I was at the end of my rope emotionally, and no one else really knew. Counseling didn't work; NROTC fell through. I hadn't pay much attention at the time, but I actually knew Christians in my dorm from Day 1. They always seemed upbeat no matter what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in my sophomore year, I was in the Math building tutor room, getting help for calculus. I ended up helping this one Christian guy, and we started talking about what each of us did over the summer. He told me about the big Promise Keeper's rally in DC he went to with a few of his friends. I was all ears at that point (the Holy Spirit was drawing me in). He also told me about the bible study he helped lead---right in my dorm! So I checked it out one day, and never stopped coming. Sure, I was carnal, came late most times, but I felt compelled to be there. I became very close to the other leader there named Kevin; I was at his dorm every other night, asking questions and pouring my heart out. I also started going to their church, called Christ's Place (Chi Alpha), my 4th semester, although sporadically at the time. After I received Jesus, though, my attendance there was regular throughout college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the following summer I got my first job working at the city park where I live. I just felt uplifted and sang praise and worship while I worked; I couldn't help it. God's presence around me only increased the following fall of my 3rd year at Purdue. I started going to church more and more, to the bible study, wherever and whomever would show me more of Jesus. Then a good Christian friend named Phil prophesied over me that I would soon receive the gift of the Holy Spirit 3 weeks in. I had dreams based on that prophecy, what and who I would receive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen 6 weeks later, on October 30, 1998. I received the Holy Spirit at Whitehorse Christian Center, Phil's church; his church was having a prophetic conference. They were very charismatic and radical for Christ, the likes of which I had never seen before. So I was sitting there in church when they had 1st round of altar calls. I had a perfectly sound mind when I heard a still small voice say \"Go, go, go.\" I was so scared I couldn't believe it, but I couldn't deny it. I told Phil, who encouraged me to go. I went for the 2nd round. I stood there, waiting with my arms raised. Then, I started trembling all over. When the pastor came to me, he simply breathed on me, and I fell back. It was just the LORD and me for what seemed to be an eternity (Phil later told me it was 45 minutes). My mind, though still there, couldn't understand this spirit-to-spirit encounter with the Living God. My needs were met, one by one.  As I repented of my sins, tears streamed down my face, and what felt like a fountain started welling up in my chest until I spoke in tongues a couple times. In the end, I opened my eyes and started laughing uncontrollably for a while. The proverbial laughter being the best medicine was so true at that moment; I was totally healed. I rolled around, enjoying the LORD's presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night after church, I was totally drunk with the Holy Spirit. In this state, I called Kevin telling him what happened. The next night, I didn't even wait for Phil to pick me up for the prophetic conference. I walked 5 miles to Whitehorse, totally inspired. To my pleasant surprise, Kevin, Phil and 10 other Christian friends were all there, inspired by my message to Kevin. I simply laughed and laughed; I had never laughed so hard in my life, while pointing at others receiving God. My life has never been the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPRAISE GOD!!!!</span></div></div>",

My father was an end-stage diabetic who passed away when I was 10. He suffered with vascular problems and was nearly blind. One night he was in tremendous pain because of the poor circulation in his feet, one of his toes was nearly gangrenous and I could hear him crying in pain, his and my mother's voices raising intercessions to the Lord. It must be noted that we lived on a ranch, some 60 miles from the nearest medical facilities and in those days, emergency medicine wasn't what we take for granted now. The next morning, I was awakened by excited shouts of praise and saw with my own eyes the miracle that had taken place in the night. The diseased toe lay in the bed, but the gangrenous area was healed over--no open wound, no indication that only hours before he'd been in such physical pain. Witnessing God's mighty hand at work in such an amazing way touched me deeply and while there have been periods of time in my life that I haven't followed in His path as closely as I should have, I've never strayed off the path for any distance. Because there is no doubt that my Redeemer lives, and lives in me, and I know this because I have seen Him perform mighty works in my own life as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo those who would question His existence, I would offer these suggestions; Search for meaning in your life. It's okay to question, after all, scripture tells us, \"Seek and Ye shall find; knock and the door shall be made open to you.\" If you search for Him, you will find Him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContact me if you'd like. In closing, just a short verse from one of my favorite passages: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friends, may you grow in grace <br>\r\nAnd in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior <br>\r\nMy friends, may you grow in grace <br>\r\nAnd in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.</span></div></div>",

My daddy was always the town drunk. He was one of the on again, off again, Christians. To the point, that once when I was playing at a neighbor's house, my friend's mother asked how my daddy was doing. I said, \"He's fine. He's drunk again.\" Her eyes widened in disbelief, and she gasped, \"Oh, my, I thought your daddy was a Christian!\"<br>\r\nMy innocent reply was, \"Oh no ma'am, that was last week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when he wasn't drinking, we went to church. When he was drinking, there was always a way for me to go to church. My Grandma Kelly talked about God all the time. My mama told me about Jesus. I heard about Him at church. The neighbors talked about Him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I reached the age that I knew right from wrong, my conscience would bother me, when I did wrong. I'd be afraid to go sleep at night because I was afraid I'd die and go to Hell. Yet when I'd be at church and the invitation was given, I'd resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I could no longer resist the tugging at me heart. I made my way to the altar. When Jesus came into my heart, it felt like the weight of the world was lifted off my shoulders. I felt like I had been cleansed on the inside. That's exactly what had happened. The blood of Jesus had cleansed my heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess because of Daddy's drinking and instability, I had developed a bitter attitude. But the morning after I received Jesus as my Savior, I remember waking up. I had a fan sitting on the nightstand beside my bed. The first thing I did was stick my finger in the fan. At first I felt anger, but it disappeared in a flash. I remembered that I was a new person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked out the window. The sky had never looked so blue. The grass looked greener. When I went downstairs to eat breakfast, I couldn't help but notice how beautiful everyone was. My whole outlook on life had changed in a split second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've been through a lot of spiritual valleys since then, but I know the Lily of the valley. I've been on the mountain tops, and I know the man who made the mountains. The mountains that have been too high for me to climb, He simply moved them for me. He has become my constant companion; a friend that sticketh closer than a brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep; for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety.\" Psalm 4:8</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>very nice writing I must say, however, there seems to be a lack of understanding concerning how you make your choices as to choosing a church.  How must we choose what to believe?  Can we believe anything we want to believe.  If this is so then we must say that it doesn't matter what we believe.  How can this be?  If we can gO to Heaven believing  anything we want to then we believe nothing.  What is the value of the doctrine in the bible?  Will I go to Heaven believing what I believe, because I do believe differently than you do so much so that I see no truth in what you believe.  Can we trust how we feel as a measuring stick for truth?  I think not because our feelings are in direct relation to what we have been taught.  If we have been taught untruths we will accept untruths as the truth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod has always taught in specifics never in generalities.  If we are given specific instructions then we are expected to follow without question.  To believe is not enough.  WE are told that \"...even the demons believe and tremble.\"  The scriptures tell us that \"there will be those who will teach for doctrine, the laws of man\" and also that we \"must not add to nor take away from the scripture\" as it has been given to us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you would not be willing to leave the church that you have become a part of and worship at anothers church ie Muslom, Catholic, Buddisim etc then you must admit that you are teaching that everyone believe only one way and so this point made, let me ask you, what church is teaching the teachings of Jesus as it is written? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince only christians will enter Heaven, what does the scripture say about the steps we must take in order to become a Christian? We read where it says \"..not everyone who says Lord Lord will enter in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At the time I knew the general story of Christ,but hadn't read it for myself. Also my Jewish friend began to have an influence over me (unknowingly)so I was very confused about what I believed concerning Jesus. I told people that I believed in Him,but I realized that I was slowly coming to the conclusion that I didn't believe he had come yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy immediate family is not spiritually inclined. The only person who was died nearly nine years ago and that was my Grandma Marie. No one is saved except me,but thats not for a lack of trying on my part. In fact my younger sister is a Satanist. I have tried numerous ways to get her to at least hear me out,but no such luck. The more I fight her the harder she pushes so I am just going to be patient and wait to see what is going to be done.  Who knows,maybe she was meant to find Jesus through someone else. Anyways. . .my parents just let us do what ever we want.  I know that sounds bad and as far as our spiritual growth goes it is,but some children just need to be given the chance to prove they know how to make good choices--I was one of those children.  My younger brother and sister weren't, though. I guess you get the hint now that I wasn't raised in the greatest of environments,but who is? Back to how I found Jesus. . .or rather, how He found me. . ..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning it happened I had just woke up.  I used to have my radio on cause it helped me sleep better.  This song about Jesus came on as I was looking up at the bottom of my sisters bed,and then I had what I could only describe as a vision. It was like I was looking out my window into our front yard. As I watch I saw myself. I drew nearer and behind the tree was Jesus. Of course, I don't remember what He looked like,but as soon as I saw Him in the vision I knew who He was.  He had His arms stretched out as if to say, \"see. I did come to die for you.\" I covered my face,turned,and fell to the ground weeping.  Then,I came out of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then I have believed in Jesus. There is not a doubt in my mind that He is alive. My friend and I have progressed in our walk with the LORD. I only wish my sister would hear what He has to say. I have seen the fingerprints of His work in my life,unfortunately, only in retrospect,though. It's great how He works.  I would like to leave you with one of my favorite verses:  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,LORD, that a person's life is not his own. No one is able to plan his own course. So correct me,LORD,but please be gentle. Don't correct me in anger,for I would die\" (Jer. 10:23-24,NLT). </span></div></div>",

I don't remember before their divorce so the actual divorce did not cause me to fall out of faith, but somewhere along the line, the situation did. During my early years I had a passion for Christ that surpassed most children's. But when I hit my preteen years something happened. I became self-destructive and told my friends that I was going to commit suicide. I was sent to a counselor, but absolutely hated going. It was about then when I started writing. I began a book (which I finished last summer...four years after beggining it). Writing was very theraputic and it began to replace cutting for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe year I was to begin Middle School(7th grade) I made an important decision. I decided to move in with my father, step mother, and two of my three half brothers. This was probably the best decision I ever made. My mother suffers from depression and bulimia and by staying with her I was only making my condition worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeventh grade in a new school and a new state was not easy. I still did not have Christ, but I also was not cutting. My writing continued and I worked daily on my book. Then, the summer after Eighth grade, I made another life-changing decision. I had just completed confirmation(by my parents' wishes) and had the opportunity to attend a Group Work Camp. This camp is made up of about four hundred or so Christian teenagers who get together and go to the homes of people who can't afford to fix up their houses. We construct wheelchair ramps, paint houses, patch leaking roofs, put up drywall, and anything else that can be done. The thursday night of that week I had a most amazing experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Thursday night, we revisit the death of Christ. After a powerful presentation, we were given some time to be alone and pray. I found myself in a dark corner of the gymnasium, tears rolling down my face. That night, I had an actual physical struggle with God. He wanted me and I was reluctant to let go. Fortunately for me, God won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have been a Christian for almost three years :)After college I plan on doing a Two-year mission trip to Haiti or the Dominican Republic. There was a time when I wanted to die instead of live; now I want to give my life to the one who gave it to me.</span></div></div>",

Before then I had been an athiest, with an unhealthy interest in Paganism and devil worship. Let me just say that I got what I deserved for provoking satan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor two years I was ill with something that completely puzzled everyone I went to for help. Apparently there was nothing wrong with me, but people don't suffer chronic pain for no reason, right? I had an MRI scan and loads of tests, but they all showed a completely normal, healthy girl. I tried billions of pills and two types of acupuncture, but nothing did anything to ease the pain. First they thought it was just a chronic migraine, then they thought it was Nerve Damage Syndrome, then Chronic Fatigue, ... in truth they hadn't a clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew what it was. I couldn't tell the doctors because they would think I was mad or something. But I knew what was wrong with me. I was being oppressed by demons. After all, I had \"summoned\" a demon using a book of Black Magic, in front of about 30 people, without drawing a stupid circle thing round me that it strongly reccomended for self-protection. (Not that a mere circle could have protected me. This was only meant as a joke to freak my teacher out). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got depressed and wanted to kill myself. But I couldn't because I was too afraid of what might happen to me afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that I started getting immoral and blasphemous thoughts that I couldn't get rid of, no matter how hard I tried. The stronger I rebuked them and \"screamed\" at them, the stronger they got. I have recently found out that unwanted thoughts are one of the symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. It seems to match up quite nicely, but I'm still not sure if I should consider it as being linked with the demon thing and the illness thing. Were they even my thoughts? I don't know. Sometimes I thought they were, and sometimes I knew they weren't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still do ocassionally get the headaches, but they're not chronic and they're not that bad. I also sometimes get the unwanted thoughts, but again not quite as badly. They still do, however, make me feel extremely guilty and sinful. At one point I was slashing myself because I hated my flesh so much. Sometimes I considered it self-punishment, sometimes just self-rebuke. It was what I had to do to \"conquer\" my flesh and gain control of my life. But it only distanced me from the Lord. I knew He didn't approve of self-harm, but I felt there was no other way to gain control over my sinful flesh. It had to be rebuked. Or so I felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy life has improved dramatically since I turned to Him and gave Him my heart, but I still do struggle a bit. This is my own fault, and I know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI love to write poetry and lyrics about Him and what He has done for me, but nothing I can write could ever explain how I felt when I saw Him in my dream. It wasn't just a dream. There He was, hung on MY cross for MY sins, screaming in agony. All the words I had ever spoken against Him lashed at His flesh like whips. And He just hung there screaming. Then He looked right into my eyes and saw EVERYTHING. I can't say how much I wanted to shield my eyes from His glare and run away. I would have ripped them from their sockets if I could. For they were the door into my soul and heart. I was so ashamed of what I had done. I was so ashamed of what I was. A sinner. A filthy sinner. And He knew. He knew EVERYTHING. The first thing my blessed Lord taught me was true fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA passage that reminded me of how I felt concerning my conversion was Isaiah 12:1. It hit me very hard the first time I read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I will praise you, O LORD. <br>\r\nAlthough you were angry with me, <br>\r\nyour anger has turned away <br>\r\nand you have comforted me. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease feel free to email me if you want to talk about anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod bless you!</span></div></div>",

I didn't have a reason to live and I sure didn't want to die if a fiery lake of hell is what awaited me. It seemed that each time I opened the Bible I was left feeling condemned. Surely the adulterous woman shall not go unpunished. It was as if I didn't have a reason to live or die. Slowly, Jesus began his work in my heart. I remember flipping through the television set and a lady named, Joyce Meyer caught my attention. She introduced me to the Jesus that had lived and died for me. I then invited him into my heart. Strangely enough, the Bible no longer left me feeling condemned and slowly but surely He began a total renewing of my mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sure wasn't made perfect the day his seed was planted in my spirit. In fact, I think I actually got worse but there was no denying that Jesus had begun his work within me. I have since divorced, I have struggled with addictions, I have done some ungodly things during the years that I have been saved. It has taken me quite a while to realize that he asks from us, 'progress not perfection.' My relationship with Jesus has grown and hopefully will continue to grow for all of my life. I will never be perfect but because of Him and what he did for you and me, I am the righteousness of God through Christ. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you ! <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I knew from a young age the clear difference between right and wrong. I also knew there is a heaven and a hell, and those who aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s children go to hell. That scared me a lot because I knew I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like sinning, and my conscience made me feel really bad. I struggled a lot against bad attitudes and self-pity. When I saw other people working cheerfully, it made me angry at myself. I wondered why I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything right and some people just seemed to do it without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI became more and more aware of my sin, God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s holiness and my need for forgiveness.  <br>\r\nI often tried to imagine eternity and hell and it terrified me to realize there is no end to either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to get depressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn January, my siblings were planning to go for a holiday with some friends, and I had really looked forward to this for a long time. <br>\r\nBut a few days before we planned to leave, Mum and Dad confronted me and said that they had noticed I had a bad attitude, and they wanted to fix this before it became too late. So they said I was to stay home with them. <br>\r\nI took this really hard, but saw the sense in it. Dad talked to me about attitudes and self-pity, encouraging me to try to have a good attitude. I worked hard at it all week, and found out it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too difficult for me. <br>\r\nI am glad that Mum and Dad made me stay home, because I realize now that God was working through them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn February, Mum and Dad said that they had noticed I had been working really hard to have a good attitude. As a reward, I could go to Auckland to stay with my friend and from there we could go to a Christian girls camp in Hamilton. We were both really excited about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we went to the camp, I saw other girls with the same problems as me. Some of the girls were saved, and bravely shared their testimonies. Listening to the testimonies and teaching and talking to the girls really encouraged me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI came home elated, knowing that God could forgive me, implant in me His hope and peace like He had done for many others. Not long after that, I went to God in prayer and asked Him earnestly to forgive me. I told Him that I was serious, that I wanted to have His forgiveness and love; I was prepared to follow Him wherever He would lead me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod heard my prayer and He forgave me. I began experiencing His love and feeling an eagerness for His word. Every day I read the Bible and pray, and now my prayers aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t empty. I was baptised on 19 September \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it was the best experience of my life. Now I live my life for Christ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t easy and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a tough time. But God changed me, is still changing me and will continue to change me until I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need anymore changing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that is, when He calls me home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese two verses from a favourite hymn, \u00e2\u0080\u0098And Can It Be?\u00e2\u0080\u0099, reflect my life in a few lines:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cLong my imprisoned spirit lay,\u2028<br>\r\nFast bound in sin and nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s night;<br>\r\nThine eye diffused a quickening ray\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u2028<br>\r\nI woke, the dungeon flamed with light;<br>\r\n\u2028My chains fell off, my heart was free,\u2028<br>\r\nI rose, went forth, and followed Thee.\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo condemnation now I dread;\u2028<br>\r\nJesus, and all in Him, is mine;\u2028<br>\r\nAlive in Him, my living Head,\u2028<br>\r\nAnd clothed in righteousness divine,\u2028<br>\r\nBold I approach the eternal throne,\u2028<br>\r\nAnd claim the crown, through Christ my own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriend, Christ has done an amazing thing for us \u00e2\u0080\u0093 He died on the cross, bearing our sins, and rose again! Now we are all invited into the Kingdom of Heaven for all eternity. But we must turn from our sin and repent before Almighty God. Then He will be with us no matter where we go, ever loving, protecting, encouraging, carrying our burdens and giving us His peace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do not try to make this sound easy. Life as a follower of Christ is not easy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in fact, Christians are mocked, scorned and hated wherever they go. It's a challenge, but Christ will always be with us. So I encourage you, I <i>challenge</i> you, turn from your sin to God before it is too late! Please, at least think about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n99%, maybe even 100%, of you will walk away from this offended or indifferent. But I can say this: I have written this, I have tried, I have shared my testimony, I have shone on a hilltop for my God \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for the 1%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ONE LIFE.

This happened one night after I got home from attending a kids club called AWANA. A young man named Greg had shared his testimony and had talked about how Hell is a real place and that if you don't believe in Christ you will go there. I remember being really impacted by what he had to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night when I went home i told my parents that I wanted to ask Jesus to come into my heart. So we knelt in my bedroom and prayed. After we had finished praying they told me that Jesus would tell me if He would come inot my heart. They said that when he answered to come and get them. I remember they had barely left the room when I yelled out, \"He said yes!\" They came back into the room and we talked some more and I prayed my first personal prayer to the Lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember the next day I told a lie to my mom, and.....she caught me. When she confronted me I just broke down in tears and asked her how i could be Christian if I was still sinning. She then explained to me that even though I now had Jesus in my heart I would still sin. She told me He would forgive me, but that being a Christian also meant I had to repent. She told me that repentence is being truly sorry for what you did and believing that God is faithful and just to forgive us these trespasses. Then making a real effort to stop doing that thing. Let me tell you I felt much better after that talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow after having been a Christian for 9 years I grow more thankful with each day for what Jesus did on the cross for me 2000 years ago. I have been through all sorts of ups and downs, When I have been very close to my Savior and other times I felt so far a way from Him that I thought we were a thousand miles apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have learned that being a Christian is not just being at church and sunday school. It is drawing closer to Him. In order to grow stronger in your faith you have to be willing to sacrifice your time and energy, your money and you life to truly live for Him.<br>\r\nMy life verses are:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 Corinthians 10:31<br>\r\nTherefore, whether you eat or drink or whatsoever you do, do it all to the gory of God.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColossians 3:23<br>\r\nWhatever you do, do your work heartily as to the Lord, rather than for men.</span></div></div>",

My mom was doing a kids Bible study or something with me, and told me that just because my family are Christians, it doesn't make me a Christian. She told me what to say, and that's when I \"prayed the prayer\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I feel that's the beginning of it all, and at the same time, I feel as if it isn't. In a way I was a Christian; if I died, I think I would've gone to heaven, but things weren't <i>happening</i>. I was just... dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A few years back I went on a trip to Hungary. Another lady who went gave my mom and I a book. It was about listening for God. I read that, and things came alive. It was a huge turning point in my life. God started to work, but I believe the devil did too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After that I went through this spell of guilt. For months after that (not right away, but some time after I read the book) I felt guilty, guilty guilty. I would lie in my bed at night, crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I believed with all my heart then, as I do now, 1 John 1:9 \"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" But I could only believe it in my mind. I did not, could not <i>feel</i> forgiven. I felt so guilty for my sins. I cried, prayed, and begged God for forgiveness. I know it came, I just didn't feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I talked to both my mom and my youth pastor about that. They helped me out a little, but finally, one day, I quit feeling guilty. It wasn't a wonderful, airy feeling where I felt I could walk on clouds, I just didn't have the weight on my back anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But after that, a new feeling took over. I'm an emotional person, and one thing I have trouble with is trusting my feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The new feeling was a deep emptiness. For so long, I felt nothing. I felt like a skeleton with cold, dead fingers, holding on to something equally dead. I couldn't let God go, but where was He? Again, I would lay awake at night, crying, begging God, this time for Him to come near, so I could feel His presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Last week, I went to a training camp so I could teach boys and girls the gospel of Christ. I will be teaching what are called 5-Day Clubs, Monday through Friday, at day cares, day camps, peoples' homes, and churches, for an hour each day, usually with a partner, I will teach kids. It will be mostly evangelism, although there are a few things for the saved child as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was an eleven day camp, starting on a Tuesday, ending on a Friday. Sometime during the second week, I was in my room, and God came. He was probably always there, but I felt Him! I was praying and sobbing with joy. I was on the phone with my mom later, but I got cut off because I ran out of minutes, and I never finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Praise the Lord, He is here. I am on a special journey getting to know Him. I can't wait to find out what the next thing He will teach me. I just hope it won't be as painful as before. I know God isn't the only one working- Satan is too.</span></div></div>",

I was introduced to alcohol by some of my friends. \u00a0I started smoking and learned to use a different vocabulary than what I heard in my home. \u00a0I developed the type of relationship with my girlfriend that I knew my parents would not have approved of. \u00a0My parents soon moved to Florida while my younger brother and I stayed in Ohio.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI took an evening course in Psyc 101 at a local community college. \u00a0One point really made an impact. \u00a0Religion was a crutch. \u00a0To avoid the pitfall, one had to build up many supports in one's life. \u00a0So, I developed my own variety: dance roller skating, my job, my car and my girl friend.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nOne by one things started to crumble apart in my life. \u00a0An accident at the roller rink caused my left knee to dislocate, tearing vital tendons. \u00a0I lost my job, my girlfriend, my car and finally my self-esteem. \u00a0I was despondent. \u00a0My spying brother kept my parents informed of what trouble I was getting into. \u00a0They decided to buy me a plane ticket to sunny Florida.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNothing really changed except for the scenery and the people... I was the same. \u00a0I still smoked, drank, partied and went to the beach a lot. \u00a0 <br>\r\nOn one Monday afternoon, I was soaking up some sun at the beach and this cute girl, Fran, came up to me and asked if I would like to go to a beach party with her that night. \u00a0I consented and she agreed to pick me up that evening. \u00a0Little did I know what kind of party it was.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen we got to the beach, there was a gathering of young people singing around a band and the band was playing country gospel music! \u00a0They called themselves the \"THE MONDAY NIGHT POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY.\" \u00a0I then learned that this gospel group met at that same location every Monday night. \u00a0A tall, dark haired man with a Bible in his hand took the floor after the band finished. \u00a0To this day, I do not remember what he was talking about. I was too interested in the girl that brought me.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter the meeting, Fran introduced me to the tall man. \u00a0His name was Dr. Jarl Malwin, a local dentist. \u00a0He invited Fran and me to his home about a half a mile away. \u00a0There Fran went into the living room with his wife and he sat with me in the family room and there opened the Word of God... and I read.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI learned that I was a sinner, lost, without hope, doomed to hell for eternity. I learned that God loved me so much that He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross, to take my place, to pay my price so I would not have to. That night, June 29, 1970, through tears of joy, I believed and received Jesus Christ as my Lord and my Savior.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFor 32 years now, with a devoted wife and four children, I have been walking with Him, waiting and hoping for that blessed day to come when he returns to take me \"Home.\" \u00a0Until then, I will continue to talk about my Jesus, my Lord and Savior, to whomever will take the time to listen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy life since then has not been easy. Like the song goes, \"Life is hard, But God is good.\" \u00a0Jesus has always been there to help me, strengthen me and encourage me through all my trials. <br>\r\nLord Jesus, come quickly. Amen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/view/218143\" title=\"Preferred Author  [#4000]\nOfficially approved Writing.Com Preferred Author logo.\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/trans.gif\" title=\"Preferred Author  [#4000]\nOfficially approved Writing.Com Preferred Author logo.\" height=\"0\" width=\"0\" id=\"protectWMLImg1\"><img onmouseover=\"protectMe(this, 'protectWMLImg1');\" title=\"Preferred Author  [#4000]\nOfficially approved Writing.Com Preferred Author logo.\" alt=\"Officially approved Writing.Com Preferred Author logo.\" src=\"https://www.writing.com/main/images/action/display/ver/1243950235/item_id/4000.png\" width=\"202\" border=\"0\" height=\"31\"></a> <br>\r\n ** Image ID #630421 Unavailable **  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As one of the original \"Babyboomers\" this doesn't seem possible as I still see myself running about as an active teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grew up in a non-Christian home, the youngest of two children. I know from having talked to my mother prior to her death that <b>her</b> mother was a Christian -- she died when I was only 6 months old. Somehow, though, I think God blessed me through her because from the time I was just a little girl clear until I reached my teen years, God was someone I was very close too -- often singing songs to him when I swung on my swingset, and talking to him in the still of the night. It was really strange. And yet I hadn't even really been introduced to Him yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was 15, a friend at school invited me to a weekend Youth for Christ camp just before Thanksgiving. I didn't care for some of the adults trying to \"counsel\" me but I did enjoy the Bible studies and the preaching -- enough to where I finally asked some questions and responded to one of their altar calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings moved very quickly after that and I think my parents were distressed that every weekend I was busy with Youth for Christ activities, but I had never been happier in my life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany years have passed since then -- but I have lots of memories of fun retreats as a teenager, singing duets in church in my 20's along with playing the organ, experiencing the greatest joy of my life when God gave me my only son in my early 30's, many foster children in my 40's, the gift of writing and being published in my 50's -- and now that I've reached 60? I just don't know but I'm still that little girl in the crevices of my heart and I know I'll be clinging to him throughout every heartache and joy until I finally see Him face to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Judy</span></div></div>",

Christmas and Easter were special times for us--always the spiritual side (Jesus' birth and death) played parts in those events. Yet I always felt there had to be, as is said, more to being a Christian than all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hit my teens and found myself drawn to a Christian summer camp in the area. There I found for the first time people who actually KNEW the Lord--not just some pie in the sky by and by lip service to an ideal. Here I met people who understood it's not a religion, it's a RELATIONSHIP with a very real, living Person: Jesus Christ, God's Son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, God was very real to me. Then stress piled on stress; life handed me lemons and I couldn't make lemonade no matter how I tried. There was a long period of searching, of dabbling with the occult, crystals and the like. Still I felt empty.  At the very lowest point, a friend led me back to God's loving arms. I had finally learned that when God seems far away, it is NEVER He who has moved.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My story is long, so I will try to give just the highlights here.  While I was a child, my parents would sometimes go to the Lutheran church.  When I heard the pastor tell the story where Jesus said, \"Follow me\", I LONGED to do that. But how could I, when Jesus was no longer here on earth?  My mom tried to answer my question, but she simply gave the gospel story, without making it a point of personal decision. When I was old enough to go to Catechism, I asked the pastor the same question.  He gave me an answer from Luther's catechism, which I could not really understand. (I was 12.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCut to a young woman, age 28, mired in sin. She searches the Bible to learn that she is indeed, living a sinful life.  One day, she inadvertently hears an aquaintance say that she is cleaning her house because she is having a Bible study there.  \"A BIBLE STUDY???  Can anyone come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, yes, would you and your husband like to come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about him, but I would LOVE to come!\u201d  (My husband wanted nothing of religion or church.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut someone he knew from a previous job called and invited him to it. (The guy happened to be a cousin to the woman whose home it was at.)  My husband didn\u2019t know how to turn the guy down, so he went with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat first study began a five-week study of Romans.  We learned how God had sought to bring all of mankind close to him.  How he had given man over to sin, then brought his own son to earth to die and pay the penalty for our sin.  On the third week, we had the question put to us. \u201cWhat will you do with Jesus?\u201d We were shown from the bible how we were either \u201cfor him or against him\u201d and there were no other options.  So I chose to \u201cfollow him\u201d, as I had always longed to do.  The great thing was, my husband did too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur marriage was not instantly healed, but it was better!  I asked my husband\u2019s forgiveness, and he forgave me.  And as we learned how to die to ourselves, we forged a bond that was unlike anything previous in our relationship. Also, he had previously not wanted children (without telling ME\u2014he always skirted the issue), as he thought they should not be brought into such a terrible world. (This had been a crushing disappointment to me, as I wanted children, and never dreamed I might not have that life.) Now he had hope, and we became pregnant. (This was after ten years of marriage.) We have three children now.  All grown, home schooled so that we could teach them godly ways, and all are walking with the Lord.  Not only that, now my brother, my mother, my sister-in-law, my sister, her husband, their 3 kids, other members of the family and several friends have come to know Christ.  Why God chose us to be the first believers in the family is so humbling to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more thing: I love my husband more now than ever before, and we have been married for 35 years.  Just over half of what Billy and Ruth Graham were married when she passed away this week. That encourages me. However, to live is Christ and to die is gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way, years after that bible study we learned that the missionary couple who held that study prayed for three years for \"one couple\" to be saved when they came home on furlough. That prayer was answered in us. But notice the ripple effect of that prayer.  God multiplied it many many times. And who knows how far it will reach?  May His Name and His Name alone be praised.</span></div></div>",

My father is a flat-out atheist, my mother does believe there is something 'out there' but still thinks we made God up. It has taken me fourteen years or so to take this step to become a christian, and it scared me half to death before I actually made it. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nFor years, I was looking for something beyond that which my eyes could see. When I was still living with my parents, I looked for it everywhere: witchcraft, reincarnation, buddhism, zen, past-lives meditation, aura photography; you name it, I investigated it. Because of my parents' adversity against christianity, I never really took the time to investigate that properly. I had simply written it off. When I went out, I was with those who mocked the people with their Jesus Saves signs outside the pubs in the middle of the night, who clung to you when you were doing your shopping to tell you about being saved, who came to collect for the Salvation Army.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt was only after I moved out that I could finally start thinking for myself on matters of faith. Still, for a couple of years I didn't think about it at all. As a matter of fact, I spent five months in Israel in 1998-1999, the most religious place you could be, and all I was thinking about was cheap wine, cheap cigarettes and cheap fun. Oh, and to see all the religious crazies walking around the street, of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept at one point, I went into a bookshop - which I always do when I get a little lonely - and the man behind the counter looked at me and started up a conversation. He wanted to know where I was from, what I was doing here. And when he found out I was from Holland, he smiled and said 'I have something for you'. And from under the counter he got out a book, which I accepted (because only an idiot would not accept a free book, in my opinion). It turned out to be a New Testament, with one page in Hebrew and the opposite page in Dutch throughout. I was a little overwhelmed and fled the shop as soon as was possible without seeming impolite. I took the bible out and read a bit, but I felt like crying, so I put it away again and got back to where I was best at at the time - not thinking, drinking and partying.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen I got back home, for a while, that attitude stuck with me. I decided a was 'charmed' by the little bible and the man who had given it to me - such a pretty, non-descriptive word, isn't it? - and nothing more. A couple of years again went by, where I slowly began reading more and more about christianity. Still, nothing indicated to me that christianity was any better than any other religion. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd then one morning, in december 2002, about a week before Christmas - and believe me, I know how corny that sounds - I suddenly woke up on a Saturday and said to myself: \"I'm going to church tomorrow.\" And I did, I went to church, and the minister there told me about an Alpha course that they did, where you could learn more about christianity. So I partook in it and was perhaps the most annoying person you could have at a table full of christians. I questioned everything and understood nothing - or I chose not to understand even if I did, just to provoke everybody else.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nStill, it had me thinking and going to church for a while. But the church was in the town where my mother lived, and I lived an hour away, and in my home town I simply didn't want to look for a church - after all, it really wasn't that important - so slowly I stopped going. But the interest was still there, and I started praying to God. Not to Jesus - I wasn't comfortable with Jesus, or with the concept of sin. I despised the word 'sin'. It made me feel unworthy, and because of personal experiences I had had, I felt I'd experienced enough of that for a lifetime. But God was okay with me. I accepted him as the creator, and that was good enough for me.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nStill, something kept on telling me: this, what you're doing, is not enough. You're praying to God and at the same time acting in a way contrary to everything he stands for the moment you stop praying. You're praying to God and behaving in a way that contradicts what he says. And you're justifying yourself doing it. You're being a total hypocrite, and you know it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSo when I moved again, to a town not far away, I decided to go look for a church, and found one that appealed to me. It had music, and dancing, and clapping. And it had study groups. In that study group I met great women of faith, women who were not afraid to speak out, women who made Christ the centre of their universe without any shame or fear. And they looked so happy. <br>\r\nI tried my sarcastic approach for a while, but finally I started to listen to them. And when I did, I learned so much that you can't get from books. I learned about God's love. I learned about his Spirit, his guidance. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd I learned how scared, how absolutely terrified I was to become a christian. What if I was wrong? What if God was really the God of the Jews, and Jesus was a false messiah? What if my family found out? What would they say? What would my friends say, for that matter?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd then I realised something wonderful: nobody could ever love me more than someone who would give his life for me. There can be no greater love, and Jesus was the one willing to do it. That's when I decided to take the leap of faith - and I really understand what that means, too. It was the scariest thing I have ever done in my life, and telling my family I had become a christian was even scarier, but it felt so good. I felt whole, and loved, and covered.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI told you this so you would know how I came to believe and what a long road I took to get here. When I was first presented with Jesus - the man in the bookshop giving me the bible - I knew, from within my heart, that I wanted him, but I rejected my longing for him. Every time I was confronted with him, I found something else to do, some project to bury myself in, something life-consuming. I reacted with agression to anyone trying to tell me anything about Jesus, with sarcasm, with sharp jabs under the belt, with disrespect, with loathing even, with arrogance, with pride.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nEver since I became a christian, things have been different. I have felt loved and I feel that God wants me to get to know him. I feel compelled to reach those people that are like I was, all those people who are like the old me. I am still not sure if this is my 'ministry', as they say; I'm not sure if I know God well enough to know his will for me yet, but I'm pretty sure it's His will to share my faith with others (after all, it says so in the bible). And this to the point of ridicule, agression, loathing, disrespect, sarcasm, arrogance, and pride.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd that scares me. It numbs me. It terrifies me. I know how people react to christians - I've been one of those people. My collegues mock christians, my best friend claims to want to vomit every time she hears the word 'God', my family accepts my choice but wants nothing to do with my faith.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBut if it is His will, then I will do what He sends me to do. No matter if it's something big like becoming a missionary or a bible-smuggler, or something small, like sharing my faith at work. I will follow where He leads me, because His path leads to mercy, love, and peace.</span></div></div>",

It's not that I have anything against other religions, it's just that this is where I found my salvation and felt the incomparable and unconditional love of God for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought that going to mass every Sunday and other holy days and by praying the rosary and other novena's are enough. I am charitable to those who need and as much as possible avoid sinning.  But as I grew up, I realized that what I have been doing my whole life is not enough to give back to Jesus everything that He is giving me.  All my life I never experience hardships and trials. I am an only child and my parents are well off. As I grew up I always get what I want and my needs, so I felt that I'm okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\uf0b7 The real awakening happened to me just last year; I was already working in a university as a professor and am standing as the head of my family. The year before that, my father came home from his work as a seaman. Every time he arrives, he always went to the office and get his pay and report as well to the captain. The day ended without my father going home. My mom was already getting worried because it is not like my father to not come home after going to the office. Funny, but I was not bothered at all about my father's absence. I believe that I shouldn't worry a lot because Jesus will take care of my father and that He is always there for us. But I still have this uneasiness in me because we still don't know where my father was. My mom hasn't slept the entire night waiting for my dad to arrive but he hasn't. She was crying already and been calling everyone we knew where my father could have been. I didn't plan on going to work that day because I want to be with my mom and calm her but she told me to go. I was at my office studying for a license exam when my mom called the office and told me to come to the precinct because my father was said to be there. I immediately went to the said precinct and truthfully, my father was there, sleeping, groggy and tired-looking. He was slouched in the police's bench, his left arm hanging and his back bent down. When I saw my dad looking like that I found myself crying uncontrollably and rushed to where my father was sitting. He was already half-awake but was still groggy.  We later found out from the police that my dad was brought there by a taxi-driver and was robbed and drugged by a gang. All my dad's jewelry, even his wedding ring was taken, his shoes, all his papers, passports, visa, you-name-it was taken, all his money that he worked for 6 months was taken. It doesn't matter what was lost, we thought, we were so happy that those evil-possessed people didn't left my dad dead on the streets. Praise God because He has been watching my dad the whole time. He had heard our cries and prayers the entire time my dad was away from us. Even though we've lost a lot we were thankful because Jesus our Savior saved my dad and gave him another chance in life. After that my dad had a problem sleeping, he was emotionally stressed and bothered by the events and he was always thinking of the face of his assailant. We prayed together and help each other forgive and forget. It has been a year and four months since my dad's second life and we're very very grateful to Jesus for that miracle. That incident left us financially unstable, but that was not a problem because I had my job and we had our savings.  But then when I landed myself in the job at the university, everything went wrong. My life was twisted and stained from events that I am forever regretful happening. In that job I fell in love and I thought when I truly fell in love everything will be perfect but it has not been. That love was dirty, wrong. It turned me into a completely different person. I lived my life just for that guy alone. I forgot about my parents, I lied to them, I even push them to leave me alone and just go to the province. I treat them as if they don't exist and our relationship was starting to break because of miscommunication. I hardly ever pray and I completely forget the values I hold dear in my life. I was not afraid if I break any of the Ten Commandments. I was not afraid of God's anger anymore. My boyfriend taught me many things that are unfavorable to God and I don't care. I was blinded by my love. I was not serious about my job anymore. I'm taking everything else for granted because of that relationship. One day my mom told me that both she and my dad had a dream. It was about me. In my mom's dream I was falling in a deep and dark well and she was screaming because I was falling away from her. In my dad's dream I was being taken away by a man he don't know. I immediately know what their dreams meant. I was falling into sin and the man in my dad's dream was my boyfriend. I realized I have to wake up and stop my wrong doings, I decide to confess my sins. Two days after that I received a very bad news that rocked not only my world but also my whole family. I resigned from my work and planned to look for another, entirely different environment.  I was lonely and depressed because of our financial status and the fact that my boyfriend and I will be separated. A week after that I went to confession and obtained my forgiveness by God. And just a day after that I broke up with my boyfriend. I was so devastated because within a week I lost two of the most important part in my life. I tried to make it with my ex but he refused and that hurt me a lot. I felt that I died that time. I was so gloomy, always out of my mind, and my tears are all dried up from crying day and night. I lost weight because of that. I was loveless and jobless that time. And my parents are worried and problematic about our bills and other stuffs. Three weeks after that I attended a seminar. It was called PREX (Parish Renewal Experience Seminar). It went for three days and two nights. That was were I was awakened completely. The realization of what I was doing hit me and I was healed of my pains. I accepted my mistakes and accepted God's love for me. I was so stupid and foolish to have done what I did and hurt my parents and most especially, I hurt God that way. It was hard for me to forgive myself because the past and the pain of it haunt me. But eventually I have to forgive myself because Jesus died on the cross for my sins. He died because He forgave me. He loved me so much that He sacrificed Himself for my sins.  After that seminar, everything went back to normal. Actually, it even became greater than before. Even though I don't have a special someone in my life, I had my parents, who like Jesus, loved me unconditionally and understood what I've been through.  Our relationship became even better than before and our love for each other is evident.  I feel warm and secure just thinking about it. Just a month after I resigned, God gave me a job at a company I could never have dreamt working into. The job Jesus gave me was great! Everything was wonderful. After two months of working, I was promoted to another position and my salary increased. Even though we don't have any money at all, we have each other, our possessions and our God. My salary help my family and with the added blessings Jesus is showering us everyday. When we think that we don't have much, Jesus is always there giving us just what we need. God is truly alive and working in our lives. He watches us and takes care of us always. There are times that I just feel like crying because I feel so guilty to God. He loves me so much that I feel like I'm not worthy because I am a sinner. Like right now, I had been bad again but I continue to pray and pray to help me be strong and to fight temptation. I remember a quote I love by heart, it says: 'God is Himself the source of all mercy. He does not ask if were worthy of His love, but He pours upon us the riches of His love to make us worthy.' And I say Amen! To that. Praise God!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I once and still am a diligent student and I love reading. Most of all, back in the temporal vicinity of 1999, Grade 4, I loved devouring all the reference books I could get. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThing was, I lived for the moment, for the present--- I was still only 9 years old back then and did not give much thought to the future, or to eternity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was a Wednesday, July 28--- right after my school's Foundation Day Convocation. Almost immediately after the celebration, I dashed to the Library, eager to finish the book on biology that I'd started just that week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened it to... I do not remember the excact details but what I do recall is that the chapter was explaining the behavior of wolves and how this demonstrates evolution's \"survival of the fittest\". If one is sick or injured, the pack would leave it so that they are not weighed down by the loss; the pack always cooperates to bring down big prey, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without even a creak, the door opened and I started from my seat. My nose must have been black with ink and my eyes wide with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the Assisstant Directress of the school, Teacher Fe. She asked me what I was reading and I showed her. She frowned, musing, then asked me what i thought would happen to the soul of the ripped-up elk in the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyebrow twitched. What does happen to the souls of the dead, I wondered? I then ventured to answer that it'd go to Heaven if it was good and because it was persecuted by the wolves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a slight clucking of amused disagreement, then asked, \"If you die today, where will you go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do not remember the exact words I gave, but, the gist went, \"I think, if my soul was fit enough, it'd...\" I did not get to finish my bemused, stumbling sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you believe in Jesus Christ as God?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know that He died so that your sins can be forgiven?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood dumbfounded for a moment. My mind raced back to my first eschatological-existentialist moment. It was sometime in Prep, when, in my grandfather's car, we'd passed through a rather seedy part of town and I saw some \"bad\" graffiti. I accidentally blurted the thing out later on and got whopped by my parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I lay in bed that night, aching both in body and in heart, I imagined a sort of spiritual half-life: every time I commit some \"great mistake\" or sin, half of my soul would go into Hell. I imagined that it would go on and on until so little was left to enter Heaven...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...like the rats that entered my room under the crack of the door. I looked at it and it looked at me. Between two seemingly shame-faced beings, there passed a knowing sigh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy vision slipped back into the present with astonishing clarity. I saw Teacher Fe's wrinkled, bespectacled eyes boring into mine. It seemed that they were not merely gauging my response, but also gauging my spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally answered, \"No\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then propounded to me the truly wondrous thing that Christ did for everyone. She went first into John 3:16's \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life\", then from there went through the story Jesus. Not that my parents had not taught me about Him, it was just that they had yet to get to His sacrifice...truth to tell, I do not remember it rightly now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe that as it may, I listened, enraptured, and she guided me through the prayer of accepting Him as my Lord and Savior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since then, through trial and tribulation, I KNOW that I have grown in both my faith and my relationship with my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  I have undergone some really tough trials recently. I once believed that depression and a disintegration of resolve were things that true Christians cannot experience. Yet I am still human and I underwent these. Those dark days are over now for I know that help and forgiveness are just a prayer away.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It came as a surprise, and I didn't understand why all people believed what I thought made perfect sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fifth or sixth grade, I began to question my faith.  \"How do we &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; what we believe is true?\" After a dreadful time of spiritual doubt, I finally decided my faith was my own on a youth group white-water rafting trip the summer after seventh grade.  It was the last night before we were going to make the 10-hour drive home, and we had been through a lot together.  A bear had come into camp, I nearly drowned when caught under a raft in the rapids, we were all dirty, sunburned, and uncomfortable, but the journey we had taken was amazing.  Our group was really close, like family, each with amazing experiences.  The last time of worship on that trip was one that really changed me.  All week, the leaders had amazed me with their stories of faith.  That final night, as we sat on an exceedingly rocky beach, our leader Ryan told us to take a stone, and tell that stone all of our sadness, burdens, pain, anger and fear, in fact telling God Himself, and then when we were done, to throw that stone into the river, symbolically giving God control of our lives.  I did that, and as I described my burdens, I began to sob.  I was so overwhelmed, but I kept going.  When I reached the river and threw my stone, listened for the splash, I at first felt tired and heavy.  But as we walked back to camp and I talked with my friends, I felt lighter, and lighter, and as we laid down to go to sleep under the stars, I gazed up into the sky, and sighed, and asked my friend, \"Have you ever had one of those moments when everything seems absolutely perfect?\" I prayed for longer than I ever had, thanking God for everything He had done in my life.<br>\r\nI came back to Washington a different person, and even when the sunburns had peeled away, and I used a real toilet, and had gotten a proper shower, I was changed forever on the inside.  I try as hard as I can to build a personal relationship with God, because it is the least I can do for Him saving me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you, Lord, thank you.    </span></div></div>",

I held onto the bench in front of me because I was afraid to walk the aisle, and went to the car as soon as possible, but the conviction was still heavy on me during the car ride home.  I started to cry because I knew that if I died in a car accident on the way home, I would have gone to Hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I reached the stoop at the front door of our home, I just started to bellow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dad asked, \"Son, what is wrong?\"<br>\r\nI said, \"Daddy, I thought I ought to have gone down forward, tonight!\"<br>\r\n\"That's okay, Son,\" he comforted.  \"We'll take care of that right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe led me into the living room and sat me down on the sofa, which was next to the door of the dining room.  He showed me verses of Scripture, like John 3:16 and The Romans Road, (I am pretty sure he did this because that was his practice, even though I can't remember every verse he used that night to this very day.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI prayed and asked The Lord into my heart to be my Savior.  Being unsure of every little thing, I asked, \"Daddy, do you think The LORD will let me live long enough so I can go back to church to get saved tomorrow night?\"  He assured me, that I didn't have to wait to be saved.  Doing business with The LORD that very night was all that was necessary to being saved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI certainly rested peacefully that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, I nearly ran down the aisle the following night during the altar call to make my salvation experience public.  However, I was still a little timid about expressing that testimony to the crowd.  So, my dad had to speak the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have felt a little ashamed of my responses to people as I left the church that night.  I told people, \"Wish me luck!\"  (I have since learned about the origins of the term, \"luck,\" and as such I have stopped using that expression, but it does remain a part of my testimony I wish I could \"do over,\" even though I realize it was just the inexperience of a little boy, who had picked up a phrase on television.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days later on Sunday, I was baptized and partook of The LORD's Supper for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYay!  Everything is new!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew eternal destination?  YES!<br>\r\nNew desire to please The LORD?  YES!<br>\r\nStopped being a little boy?  NO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first time my dad had to paddle me for some interpersonal infraction and/or sin, after I got saved, I broke down and cried.  \"I thought I got saved and that I wouldn't sin any more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLesson #1 on the Upward Way:  We get saved, but learning how to live a righteous and a holy life in a lifelong process.  It is completed at physical death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a little disheartening.<br>\r\nDoubts about salvation, during the low spots of my Christian walk have been disheartening.<br>\r\nDeliverance from being afflicted by demons in 2011 has helped immensely, but still the Upward Way is a climb.  It's not a run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComfort has come in many forms, not the least of which is others telling me that they see Jesus in me.  Furthermore, an expression I learned a few years ago has become a dear friend and companion, who walks with The LORD and with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The evidence of the reality of salvation is a long obedience in the same direction.
