Promise.\" Harper said, smiling as her mother shot her a look that said she didn't believe her, but Harper determinedly returned her mother's gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\" Her mother replied before returning her attention to the television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper sighed to herself and sagged back into the armchair as she blinked a few times. She wasn't quite ready to tell her parents about her late night discovery. No, it was better if they didn't know yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper's stomach let out a low growl as she felt her belly twisting with hunger. Her parents glanced at her momentarily as she got to her feet, the armchair creaking slightly as she stood. She walked behind the couch, biting her lip as she passed the picture of Jesus hanging on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but cast her eyes to the floor, feeling her stomach fluttering from more than just hunger. She kept her eyes down until she was out of the living room and into the short hall that lead towards the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran her fingers along one of the walls as she walked, feeling the cool paint beneath them sliding easily under her touch. Her feet padded silently on the beige carpet as she continued into the brightly lit kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was fairly large, though that was more because it was the kitchen and dining room together. A worn counter divided the kitchen area from the dining area like a lone white finger extending into the middle of the pale wooden floor. The floor had probably been a darker brown at one point, but years of use had long since faded and colored it, especially along the path from the door to the fridge and around the old table. The table was in desperate need of being refinished, though Harper's father always used the excuse that the weather wasn't right whenever her mother brought it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper made her way towards one of the cupboards, throwing it open as she scanned the contents. She removed her hand from her belly, realizing she'd been rubbing it, and grabbed a couple of individually wrapped cupcakes. She tore into the plastic which crackled and ruffled in her hands before shoving the whole cupcake into her mouth and biting into the sweet sugary treat. She tossed the empty wrapper onto the counter, as she continued scanning the contents of the cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really should be careful about how much junk food you've been eating lately. It's starting to show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper jumped, spinning to spot her mother entering the kitchen. She took a deep breath as she tried to get her heart under control, \"Don't sneak up on people like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sweetie, I'm just worried about how much sugar you've been eating lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper finished swallowing the first cupcake and opened the second as she returned her attention to the cupboard, \"I'm fine. I'm just a little bloated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper didn't even have to look to know the look that her mother was giving her, but she wasn't really in the mood for a debate right now. She was starving and these cupcakes weren't near enough. She reached up and grabbed a box of cereal and another cupcake. Stepping around her mother, she placed the cereal box on the counter and watched as her mother just shook her head and made her way back towards the living room before the commercials were over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper rolled her eyes, waiting until her mother had left before shoving the third cupcake into her mouth. Her mother had been dropping not so subtle hints about Harper's slight belly lately, and it was really starting to annoy her. Still, she should probably get used to it since it was just going to keep getting bigger. Though then her mother would probably be having a different conversation than just complaining about her daughter's weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scoffed slightly as she glanced at the empty wrappers on the counter, then to the cupboard which was loaded with treats and other goodies. She really wasn't looking forward to that conversation. Though, if her mother thought she was just gaining weight, she might be able to delay it for a few more months. Still, that would mean trying to gain weight to hide her pregnancy and she wasn't sure she was fond of that idea. However, she probably would be putting on weight anyway with the pregnancy and this could give her an excuse to indulge herself without feeling too guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper smiled and grabbed another cupcake, shoving it into her mouth. Honestly, being pregnant might not be that bad she thought to herself as she poured herself a large bowl of sugary cereal. She could get used to this.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harper moaned in pleasure as she rubbed her hard belly with one hand, while shoving another cupcake into her mouth with the other. She adjusted herself on her bed, causing several of the wrappers that surrounded her to to crinkle. A rapping on her door, brought her back to reality as she jumped slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember you have dance practice in an hour,\" her mother's voice said through the door, \"I hope you haven't been overeating on snacks again. You really are starting to get a little on the chubby side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper rolled her eyes as she waited for her mother to leave. After a few moments, she brought herself to a sitting position amidst the pile of wrappers that surrounded her. She could feel her belly touching the top of her thighs as she shoved another cupcake into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother wasn't wrong, she thought as she got off her bed. She stepped in front of the large mirror in her room, taking in her new body. Her belly had almost tripled in size, however, she would hardly call that an accomplishment with how small it had been before. Her arms and legs were also thicker and she was developing a nice double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't really planned on gaining weight this quickly, but she couldn't help herself when it came to all the sugary foods she was enjoying. Still, she was worried that her mom might make her go on a diet soon if she kept gaining as fast as she was. She was hoping that maybe going to dance classes again would help slow her gain down, and hide her pregnancy from her overprotective parents. At least for a little while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a twirl in the mirror, admiring how tight her clothes were starting to look on her expanding frame. Her jeans were unbuttoned, as she didn't like how tightly they cut into her waist, and her shirt was starting to conform to her expanding belly. There was still room to grow though, she thought as she noticed that the fabric wasn't completely form fitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way back to her bed and grabbed a cookie from an almost empty box. She closed her eyes, savoring the flavor as she shoved it into her mouth. She just couldn't seem to stop eating these sugary treats. She glanced at her dance clothes laid over the back of a chair. She really didn't feel like going to class right now, she just wanted to keep eating. In just the last week her appetite had grown significantly. She had kept telling herself that she was eating for two now, but that had just turned into a slippery slope and left her eating more and more at every meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strode over to the chair with her dance clothes, loving the feeling of her belly bouncing slightly with each step as she stripped out of her t-shirt and jeans. She hadn't worn her dance clothes in a couple weeks, since they had been on a break, but now she was going to have to go every night after school, and Saturdays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a big sign and began to ease herself into the tight outfit, wincing as she tried to squeeze it around her chubby belly. It was incredibly tight, and though the pants stretched easily around her growing butt and thighs, her shirt was struggling to contain her growing belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt way too restricted in these clothes, but all her other pairs were the same size. She really would need to get some new clothes if she was going to keep getting fatter. Though, even if she didn't, she would need new clothes eventually with her pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper smiled to herself. Maybe her mother would let her skip class tonight if she told her that she needed to go get new dance clothes. That would be admitting to her mother that she was getting chubby, but at least it would give her an excuse to go eat some food while she was shopping. Still, she could always pretend she was going to dance class and just go get some food, and use that excuse on Monday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at the chubby girl in the mirror. She hadn't really wanted to get super fat anyway though, so maybe she should go to dance class. She really should show some self-restraint. She was really jumping into this gaining thing quicker than she'd planned. </span></div></div>",

Harper was sitting on the bus wearing a white north face jacket, a pair of pink gloves, and a white puff ball hat with tassles hanging with puff balls. Harper is a short fifteen year old girl with blonde hair, a white smile, and normal toned skin. Hidden behind Harper's north face was a belly bunched up since she was sitting down. Harper wasn't fat or overweight. Since she was a dancer, she had always been short and instead of growing up, she was slowly growing out. People labled her as a skinny girl, but deep down, she wanted to be a little bit bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus stopped in front of the mall. Harper slowly rose up out of her seat and walked off the bus and into the mall. She was amazed at how big this mall was. She had been there many times before, but each time, the mall felt different since stores moved in and out of it and the mall was constantly remodeled. Harper started walking through the mall and even stopped at a couple of clothes stores, but didn't find anything she really liked. She stopped by Auntie Anne's Pretzel place and grabbed a cinnamon pretzel and even had some chinese food at the food court for lunch. After exploring the mall, Harper was growing tired and was about to head out of the mall when....</span></div></div>",

She looked at the sign for the place, noticing it saying \"Lisa's Ice Cream Parlor.\" Intrigued at the new place, Harper decided to go inside of the place. As she got in there, she noticed that the whole place was empty. The parlor looked nice as there was a red colored bar with red bar stools, white shining tiles, and pictures of ice cream hanging around. Harper then noticed the freezer of ice cream in front of her, which was directly next to the bar. Harper licked her lips as she noticed delicious flavors of ice cream that she had never had before. As Harper sat down at a bar stool, a lady walked in from the back of the place. The lady was young with black hair and a skinny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello there! Welcome to my ice cream parlor. I'm Lisa. What can I get you?\" Lisa asked Harper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I get a large cup of your brownie lovers ice cream?\" Harper asked politely in her innocent voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, the ice cream was placed in front of Harper as she dug in with ease. Lisa watched the girl eat as she became intrigued with how quick Harper was eating her ice cream. Lisa came up with an idea that could benefit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's your name?\" Lisa asked Harper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Harper. I'm assuming you're Lisa?\" Harper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right. How old are you?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am currently fifteen,\" Harper said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You are adorable for a fifteen year old,\" Lisa said with a laugh as Harper kept on grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you. I try,\" Harper said as she pulled her hat down, trying to look innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell you what. You seem like a lot of fun and you seem like you love to eat. Would you like to have a job here?\" Lisa asked quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds nice, but what kinds of things would I be doing?\" Harper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if anything, you would serve customers. I mean, if we are not busy, you would taste test my ice cream, which will probably be a lot. On top of that, you could advertise outside the mall for me. I mean, you are dressed properly for that. And don't worry. Your hours would be flexible and I would pay you well. So what do you say? You could start now if you want by taste testing my other ice creams,\" Lisa said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper felt that Lisa was right. She really couldn't turn down an offer like that.</span></div></div>",

Just follow me to the back room!\" Lisa said with a grin to Harper as she pointed to the back room.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOnce in the back room of the shop, Lisa stood in front of Harper and explained to her what to do.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"So each day, there will be at least ten new ice cream flavors for you to try. You must eat and finish three scoops of each. If you would like, feel free to eat more than that. After trying each kind, fill out an evaluation sheet and tell me your thoughts about the ice cream. You will start off at $10.00 an hour with raises later on. Any questions?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Do I need a uniform?\" Harper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, but not right now. Just wear what you have on for now and you should be good. I'll get it for you later. Dig in!\" Lisa said to Harper as she left her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll take these ones here,\" said Harper to herself, who was a little worried about the amount of ice cream she would be eating.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHarper finished her first five ice creams quickly and efficiently. She leaned back in her chair and burped lightly before rubbing her belly in relief. Even though she was at least half way through, she was feeling very full. Even though she felt full, Harper continued on through her four other ice creams until she reached the double chocolate fudge ice cream with white fudge pieces. She ate it very slowly while rubbing her belly with the other hand. By the time she was finished, she had eaten thirty scoops. She felt like she could eat no more.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I'm so bloated right now. I need to just fill out the evaluation and go home,\" groaned Harper.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nQuickly, Harper began to fill out her sheet. After doing so, she gave the forms to Lisa and left the ice cream parlor. Even though she felt full, Harper didn't care about what to do next. It was at that point that Harper put a hand on her belly, noticing it felt hard. With that, she went into the girl's bathroom with no one around and began to look at herself. Harper could tell that she had put on a few pounds from her dairy binge as she grabbed her belly. In some way, she felt she looked like she was at the start of a pregnancy, but she knew that only she would really notice this weight gain for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting out of the bathroom, Harper wonders what she needs to do next.</span></div></div>",

Her room was very colorful as she was someone with a very colorful personality. She walked into her bathroom that was attached to her room, stopped and looked in the mirror. She was smiling at herself in the mirror and just staring at her body. She was wearing a white t-shirt with a pair of short shorts that were bright pink. She moved her eyes down her body until she hit a speed bump. Literally. Her whole body was slim until she reached her belly. You see, Harper was short for her age and because of dance, she was not that tall and would be short for a little while. Because she wasn't growing, much stuff went to her belly. Her belly stuck out a few inches, giving her a pregnant look to her belly. Her belly was still in her shirt, which meant that she wasn't super fat. In fact, she really didn't mind her belly, especially since people still labled her small and skinny. Part of her wanted to get fatter, but she knew that it would be pretty hard. She was tired of being labled as the short, small person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should try gaining weight,\" Harper said to herself, trying to picture the idea in her head. Harper was trying to imagine being fatter, with love handles that were thick and chunky, multiple chins, and even be a few inches taller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmm.... the idea seems good. I'll try it!\" Harper said to herself, rubbing her small belly and smiling at herself in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter observing herself, Harper moved out of the bathroom and ran downstairs, trying to think of what to do next.

Cereal is gone. So I need to eat something else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the refrigerator and soon her eye saw something. Two sticks of butter. Why not? If she wanted to gain weight, butter was very fattening.<br>\r\nFastly, she unwrapped the butter and started to stuff it in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! That does taste pretty good! Why did I never eat this before?\" She mumbled with her full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two sticks of butter found their way to her belly. Harper got up and looked in the cupboards, finding a box of cookies. She looked, smiling at how much fat the cookies contained and ripped the box open. Harper then started to stuff her face with cookies. After the cookies were gone, she ate a entire bag of pretzels. <br>\r\nHarper laid back and belched. She felt kind of stuffed in a good way. She rubbed her belly and smiled.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"All right girl,\" She said to her belly. \"You're gonna be big, round and fat from this day on! Understand?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe slowly rubbed her stuffed belly. Harper started thinking if there were other ways to get fat fast.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She fould two boxes of twinkies, a box of thin mints, a jar of peanut butter and marshmellow fluff, and a bag of chips. Harper then opened up the freezer and found a box of ice cream sandwiches and a bin of cookie dough ice cream. Harper then grabbed a few spoons and quietly brought the food up to her room, passing her sister, Gracie. She didn't want her sister to know that she was trying to fatten up yet. Also since her parents weren't home, if they noticed the food was gone, she knew that they would blame it on Gracie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper went into her room and shut her door. She even locked her door just to make sure no one walked in on her feast. Harper turned on her T.V and put on some Saturday morning cartoons. She then grabbed the box of thin mints and started to dig into the food. Harper was lying flat on her bed, eeating the thin mints one by one with no end in sight. After about 15 minutes, Harper reached into the box and found it empty. She threw the box to the floor, brushed the black cookie crumbs off her,and grabbed both boxes of twinkies. Like with the cookies, Harper grabbed the twinkies one by one and stuffed it down her throat, not noticing how many calories she was adding to her body. It took about a half hour for Harper to notice that both boxes were empty. She had really eaten a lot of food! After throwing the boxes down again, Harper grabbed the marshmellow fluff with a spoon. As she was watching cartoons, she kept on digging and digging into the fluff, eating the fat, sugary fluff. Harper scraped the jar until it was empty. Harper was very full and decided she needed to use the bathroom. Harper dropped the empty container of marshmellow fluff to the floor and stood up. She noticed that...</span></div></div>",

They had a surprising amount of shared interests and really hit it off. All the while though he did give her stomach a lot of attention, rubbing it affectionately. Not that it bothered her really, his soft touch felt great. It\u2019s just that she couldn\u2019t help wondering if it was a requirement for his love. Gathering up the courage she asked. \u201cHey Max, if I didn\u2019t have this belly would I still be your girlfriend.\u201d She looked at him imploring an answer, he was obviously taken aback, contemplating the best response. The belly was obviously a draw but he didn\u2019t want it to seem like that was all he was interested in, after a moment of reflection his confidence returned and he explained. \u201cOf course, babe this is just the cherry on top of a very sweet treat.\u201d He said patting her belly, he wrapped his arm around her reassuringly and started kissing her neck. \u201cSo, I\u2019m a sweet treat?\u201d She said as Max\u2019s tender pecks caused her to moan. \u201cThe sweetest and besides I don\u2019t imagine a conversation with a belly is going to be very interesting do you.\u201d Max replied, once again giving her stomach a rub. \u201cNo, I guess it wouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Olivia said with a chuckle, feeling a little more confident in their relationship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake no mistake I do love your lovely belly; I\u2019m amazed by how big you are it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d He said as he stared at her belly in awe. \u201cHow\u2019d you get so big, have you been stuffing, drinking water, anal inflation.\u201d His inquiry causing Olivia\u2019s face to become even redder. \u201cWhat, no I haven\u2019t done any of that.\u201d She screeched embarrassed at what he was implying. This information left Max truly flabbergasted. \u201cWhat, then how are you so big, I know you didn\u2019t have this before, I would have definitely noticed.\u201d He asked, Olivia was hesitant to tell him the truth considering how strange it would sound. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d she started to say obviously reluctant to continue. \u201cCome on sweetie, you can tell me.\u201d Max implored giving Olivia an irresistibly charming smile and prying an answer from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may have wished for this, to get your attention.\u201d She nervously explained, as she nervously rubbed her stomach. \u201cThen I started to dream about you and a when I woke up my belly would be bigger.\u201d Max listened to her explanation, his face clearly showing his doubt, but as he thought about it, he said something that Olivia didn\u2019t expect. \u201cThat\u2019s very interesting, you know I\u2019ve wished for a long time that I could meet a sweet girl that wouldn\u2019t mind indulging my little fetish, and recently I dreamed of a girl that seemed a little bit like you.\u201d Max said coyly, giving Olivia a mischievous smile. For a moment Olivia believed him before she realized how unlikely it was and stared at Max skeptically. \u201cWait are you telling me that you\u2019ve seen me in your dreams, or are you just humoring me?\u201d She inquired, to which Max just shrugged and gave her a cheeky smile. \u201cMaybe.\u201d This annoying response caused Olivia to pout at Max\u2019s teasing attitude, he leaned in and kissed her cheek before he headed back to class. \u201cCall you later babe. I\u2019ll dream about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, back in class Olivia was feeling drowsy again listening to the teacher drone on for the lesson.

Max ignored her pleas and just stared at the glowing ball with the same excitement of a child with a new toy. \u201cDoes it taste like it though.\u201d He inquired leaning in to kiss the orb, Olivia panicked knowing what would happen and cried out. \u201cNo don\u2019t do that I\u2019ll blow up.\u201d She yelped as she yanked the orb away, to Max\u2019s surprise. \u201cYou\u2019ll what?\u201d Max asked taking a step back as if thinking she meant she would explode like a bomb. Olivia sighed as she started to clarify. \u201cIn my dreams when you kiss the orb it grows bigger and I grow bigger.\u201d Max\u2019s expression swiftly shifted into a mischievous smile. \u201cOh really!\u201d Olivia glared at him in annoyance. \u201cOh no, don\u2019t you start, I\u2019m big enough thank you very much.\u201d Olivia said cradling her orb protectively, Max just winked gave her a wry smile. \u201cOh, come on babe, it\u2019s not that bad is it?\u201d<br>\r\nHe asked playfully walking his fingers up her orb. \u201cNo, I guess not.\u201d Olivia answered her apprehension waning. \u201cI don\u2019t know Max, my mom is already worried, I don\u2019t even know how to explain what\u2019s happening to me.\u201d Olivia exclaimed trying to maintain her resolve. \u201cWhatever\u2019s happening it\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d Max said playfully fiddling the orb Olivia held, as he nibbled on her shoulder. \u201cIt is, which is why I can\u2019t get any bigger.\u201d Olivia groaned as her hand slipped into her skirt. \u201cIf I do, I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t want to stop.\u201d Olivia panted her resolve had already broken a passionate inferno ignited with in her. \u201cThis is so fucking hot!\u201d Max\u2019s moaned as he took the orb from Olivia. \u201cGrow for me.\u201d He said looking intensely into her eyes.

She was holding her orb as usual and she looked around for the Max of her dreams. She noticed someone else was in the room but it was not the person she expected. It was her chubby classmate Laura. Laura was already slightly chubby her face and limbs larger than Olivia\u2019s. She wore a light blue blouse over her short deep blue dress and a frilly skirt under that. \u201cOlivia is that you?\u201d Laura said noticing her classmate. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d She asked nervously, confused by this whole event. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream Laura, I fell asleep listening to Mr. Reynolds.\u201d Laura shared a knowing glance with her. \u201cOh yeah, same, that guy is more boring than watching paint dry.\u201d Olivia nodded in agreement and further said. \u201cI\u2019m more surprised to see you here, I didn\u2019t expect you to invader my dreams.\u201d Laura sneered at her in annoyance. \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t invade your dreams alright, your dream abducted me, got that and hey what happened to your belly.\u201d Laura exclaimed noticing the gravid bulge missing from Olivia\u2019s middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that, it\u2019s here!\u201d Olivia said pointing out the orb she held. \u201cWhat are you talking about.\u201d Laura said, confused with the concept. \u201cThis is my belly, or at least I can feel everything as if it were.\u201d Olivia said showing the large orb to her classmate. Laura poked it experimentally eliciting a giggle from Olivia. \u201cDoes this have something to do with those dreams you talked about.\u201d Laura asked giving Olivia an intimidating look. \u201cWell\u2026  actually yeah, in my dreams the orb would grow when Max played with it and then I\u2019d be bigger in real life.\u201d Olivia explained nervously. \u201cWhat Max has been here.\u201d Laura replied utterly surprised at that information. \u201cWell a dream version of Max.\u201d interjected but was interrupted as Laura snatched the orb from her grasp and walked away with it. \u201cHey what are you doing that\u2019s mine!\u201d Olivia shouted futilely at her classmate, who turned to confront her. \u201cI get it now, you tricked him, you abducted poor Max from his dreams and used this orb to make him your boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\nLaura anger frightened Olivia who chased after her, but Laura\u2019s sudden slap to the orb stopped her in her tracks. \u201cOw, you bitch.\u201d Olivia whined as she rubbed her stomach. \u201cThis should be mine and Max should be mine!\u201d Laura cried obviously going hysterical with envy. Laura stared intently at the orb, she noted how soft and pliable it felt. A crazy idea came to her mind, one spurned by an obsession for Max\u2019s love and the jealousy she felt toward Olivia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a chance Laura unexpectedly started trying to stuff the orb in her mouth. Olivia was rendered frozen in place as she both felt and saw the bizarre action of her classmate. Olivia cried out to Laura too overwhelmed by the whole situation to move. \u201cStop that right now, what the hell are you trying to do eat me, you\u2019ll choke!?\u201d Surprisingly to both of them the orb seemed to easily slide into her mouth, which then resulted in an intense squeezing sensation for Olivia. \u201cNo please\u2026 don\u2019t, you don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201d Laura just looked at her with a sinister smile, as if saying I don\u2019t care and continued to slide the orb deeper down her gullet. Olivia was overwhelmed by the constricting feeling, but then the feeling started to change, it became more like a painful emptiness. As the orb disappeared down Laura\u2019s mouth, she took a big gulp and they both awoke to find. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Am I Gretel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn oddly beautful lady in a witch's outfit appeared. \"Hello, lovely. I'm so glad to see that you're awake!

She was also quite curvy, and her fabric intended to show that off, and to top it all off, her voice sweet, almost hypnotizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie weakly responded, \"I guess I am a little hungry\", leaving the witch very excited. \"Alright!\", said the witch, \"Hansel, your sister would like a nice (fattening) meal.\" Soon, Hansel walked into the room with a plate of chocolate on his hand. \"Alright, here you go\", he said, and with that, he was off. No hi, no anything, just a disappointed look on his face when he left. \"Wonder why he looked so grim...\", she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down and layed the plate on her lap, hesitantly picking up the first piece, and then quickly shoved it in her mouth.Almost instantly amazing flavors flooded her taste buds,and she finally realized how hungry she was, and with that, she scarfed down the rest of the chocolates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was good until suddenly she began feeling strange. She looked around, examining her body, hoping she could find what was responsible, but she found much worse. Her belly began to slowly push outwards, tightening the fabric on her dress, followed by her rear, which splayed a few more inches while she sat, pulling up her dress just enough to reveal her thickening thighs, making it harder to sit criss cross, her breasts outgrowing her original C. Even worse, her stomach rumbled even louder than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone's still hungry...\", the witch smirked, and with just a snap, there was even more chocolate... </i></span></div></div>",

Marie looked at herself. She was wearing a white button up dress shirt with a black skirt. Although she usually wouldn't wear this, she thought it looked cute on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, Gretel!\" Marie heard as she continued to wake up. She lifted her head off of the ground to see who was calling that name. As she turned around, she saw someone standing up by her head looking down at her. It was a boy with blonde hair that covered his eyes a little, fair colored skin, and a skinny body. The boy looked like Cody Martin from \"The Suite Life Of Zack And Cody\" to Marie, but she ignored this and pointed to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you, Gretel. We need to walk on!\" The boy said. Marie got up as the boy started pulling her on. Marie started to think about what was happening. \"This has to be a dream! Maybe this is Hansel\" Marie said inside of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hansel, where are we going?\" Marie asked, hoping that that was the boy's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anywhere that will take us. Hopefully we can find a house,\" Hansel said to Marie. Marie was happy that she got his name right. They both kept on walking and talking to each other until finally, they saw a structure in the distance. It looked like a brown house decorated with colorful accents. The two of them continued to walk closer to see what kind of house the place was. It was then they came close enough to realize that it was a gingerbread house. As they looked at the house, Marie started to feel hunger in her belly. She wanted to eat some of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's eat!\" Hansel said, pulling Marie towards the house. But before Marie could start biting into the house....</span></div></div>",

She wasn't dreaming anymore. She looked at her clock and noticed that it was only 1 A.M in the morning. Although it was late, Marie felt really hungry for some reason. She felt like she had never eaten before. Marie moved her legs out of the covers to the side of her bed as she began to walk out of her room, down the stairs, and into the kitchen. She opened up her refridgerator to see what was in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm.... german chocolate cake? Twinkies? Left over steak? Hm... maybe I should just take all of these things upstairs,\" She said to herself as she grabbed all of these along with a bucket of ice cream, a spoon, fork, and knife. She quietly strolled upstairs into her room and sat on her bed. She started to eat the food at a tremendous rate. She first grabbed the ice cream to make sure it wouldn't melt. She shoved spoonful after spoonful into her gullet, indulging into this food like never before. She loved the feeling of eating in the middle of the night. She kept on eating the food, moving onto the steak. Although this food was tasting delicious, she wasn't thinking about the side effects it would have on her.....</span></div></div>",

Although it was weird, it was a dream that Marie had remembered very well. In all honestly, it was showing for Marie. Within the last week, Marie had been eating more food due to a small increase in her hunger. At breakfast, Marie would eat at least three or four pancakes drenched in syrup. Usually for lunch at school, Marie would grab about four slices of pizza usually with chips and coke. Dinner was a whole different story as Marie began to come back for second and sometimes thirds. None of this included the additional snacking or desserts after dinner. Marie did not really notice that her clothes were getting a bit snug on her. If anything, Marie had gained a noticeable ten pounds, which was not too big yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie had been stressed from school, family, and many other occurances in her life. She felt like the food was a comfort to her with no side effects. She was pretty wrong about the side effects, though. She still had not noticed. If anything, she kept on thinking her clothes must have shrunk or that she was going through a growth spurt or a period. But what Marie didn't really know is that the Hansel and Gretel-themed dreams were affecting her. And soon, it would affect her again. Marie got home from school, had her traditional snack and began to do her homework. She also grabbed some more food after homework before her dinner, grabbing the sweetest things she could find. She wasn't noticing what any of this food was doing to her.</span></div></div>",

She had been expecting a portly old woman as the witch, however, what she saw instead was a beautiful girl, who looked only a few years older than her, maybe in her early adulthood, wearing a black dress decorated by the face of an owl on its chest, on her head was a classic witches hat, with a crooked top, which slightly hid her young, beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, visitors.\" she said, looking to the two teens in her front garden, who both stared at her with guilty looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry ma'am...we were looking around for somewhere to stay and we saw your house...i-is it all made of candy?\" Marie asked, looking at the structure longingly, the young witch smiling a bit and nodding proudly. \"Yes, yes it is!\" she said, standing proud, hands on her hips as she smiled, before looking to the two. \"So I take it you're both hungry?\" she asked them with a smile, Marie and Hansel slowly nodding as the witch smiled, pulling them into a hug. \"Great, I've been wanting to try cooking for others for a while\" she said, smiling as she brought the two skinny youths into her home, closing the door and seating them at the table, which was made of chocolate and candycanes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie swallowed hard, knowing how the story went, she sat down, not wanting to make the obvious witch angry by refusing as she quickly got to work cooking. \"So um...whats your name miss?\" Marie asked, looking to their host, who smiled back at her while stirring a pot. \"Anastacia.\" she said, smiling and clicking her fingers, the mixture in the pot rising up into a pair of fabulous chocolate cakes, which she set on plates and brought over to the two famished teens, winking. \"But you can call me Annie sweetie~\" she said, an odd tone to her voice that made Marie blush as she looked to the cake in front of her, Hansel doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? what's wrong guys? eat your fill\" she said, smiling at them, Marie slowly working up the courage to pick up a slice and start eating. The moment the cake touched her tongue, she felt like she'd made a good choice, actually moaning some as she chewed the delectable delicacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie smiled as she watched the two eat their cakes, glad they were enjoying their meal as she set about preparing more treats for them, everything from fruitcake to tarts, to candycanes, to sweet rolls, all of which the two children devoured voraciously, their appetites belying their bodies protests as they ate and ate, bellies bulging in their formerly loose clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marie sat back, finished with her meal, she let out a long burp, sighing happily as she rubbed her gut. This might only have been a dream, but it sure was a fun one, she thought as she licked her fingers clean, savouring the last bits of frosting on them as she looked over to Hansel, but then arched a brow as she looked at him up and down, something seeming off as the boy's hair seemed longer than before, and unless she was hallucinating, he also seemed a bit more...feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you two look like you enjoyed your meals~\" Annie said, standing at the end of the table, hands on her hips as she smiled that kind smile at them, before she went over and offered Marie a hand, which the girl gladly took, standing up slowly, before Annie went around to Hansel, doing the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'll bet you two are sleepy.\" she said, smiling as both teens yawned, leading them into a bedroom with two really big beds, laying them down to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie smiled, closing her eyes in the dream, and when she opened them again...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marie awoke with a soft smile on her lips.  The dream was fading from her mind, but the memory of being pleasantly full stayed with her.  She moaned soft and moved her hands to her flat tummy.  She opened her eyes with a start and tossed her sheets off.  The clingy pink t-shirt she had gone to bed in was pushed up a few inches by something that was definitely not the trim middle she knew and loved.  Her stomach, like in her dream, was stuffed, maybe even more so.  She rubbed it and moaned, confused.  She got out of bed, finding it a little hard to bend in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving just admired her figure the night before it was easy for her to see the difference.  Her belly popped out gently, round and very firm.  She was able to pull her shirt down over it, although she thought it actually made her look pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhg,\" she said to herself as she cupped her poor tummy in her hands.  This was not the peaceful, content feeling from her dream.  She felt bloated, full, and embarrassed to even see herself.  Like anyone she had experienced bloating before, but it never felt like this.  She really felt like she had eaten a feast that was too much for her stomach to keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was glad it was Saturday.  The swelling, whatever it was, ought to go down by Monday.  She had plans to go shopping with Abbie, one of her best friends and former teammate on the school track team, but otherwise planned to take it easy.  If Marie had one flaw it was her laziness.  It was why she quit track in the first place.  Granted, she was one of the lesser members on the team, while Abbie was actually the star runner in the school.  Abbie, who like Marie spoke with a bluntness that others found disconcerting, warned Marie that even if she quit track they should still work out together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love your junk food and if you don't stay on top of it you'll blow up,\" Abbie had said, with her usual frankness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot me if that happens,\" Marie had said.  She might not have the tone of her friend, but she was still thin with just the right amount of softness on her body.  She didn't even want to entertain the prospect of gaining weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now here she was, only a few weeks out of her athletic life and already sporting a sad, round gut.  At least it wasn't fat, she thought rubbing her sour stomach.  Abbie might have been right after all.  Of course, that didn't explain why she woke up feeling stuffed to the gills despite not having gone to bed in such a state, but for the moment she was writing this off as really bad bloating.  Bloating that felt uncomfortably heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe texted Abbie that she was ready to meet up whenever she was, then showered, did her hair and make up, and donned a pair of jeans which pressed uncomfortably into her full tummy.  Every t-shirt and tank top she owned seemed to ride up over her engorged belly when she moved, and whenever she bent over she had the unpleasant sensation of thinking her jeans' button would pop open.  The worse part, aside from the discomfort and creeping thoughts of a full stomach turning into a fat stomach, would be that she knew Abbie would notice and say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe might even try to get her to work out.  Marie shuddered.  It would be the right thing to do.  One didn't just let a fine figure as hers go without a fight.  But she was dead set on taking it easy that such effort on a weekend was almost as distasteful to her as the bump now protruding from her previously perfect profile.</span></div></div>",

The effort did nothing but dislodge a few burps which she was happy to get rid of before Abbie arrived.  She grabbed her purse and went to meet her friend.  She wasn't fast enough.  Abbie was already entering through the front door as Marie walked down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Let's get moving.  I saw some shoes last week I wanted to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie interrupted her by raising her hands and staring, her eyes a little too wide to be anything but insulting, at Marie's tummy.  Marie sighed as Abbie spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoes? I think maybe you'll need some new pants soon,\" Abbie said it in as gentle a way as she could, but like Marie, was too naturally blunt to ease into the topic.  \"What's this here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe poked Marie's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard as a rock,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a little bloating,\" Marie said.  Her relaxing afternoon with her best friend was off to a bad start.  \"Lay off, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's more than a little.  You're starting to get a gut-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that,\" Marie snapped.  Hearing the words from somebody else sent a shiver down her spine.  \"It's just bloating, okay? It'll go away by tomorrow or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two walked out to their car, Marie couldn't help but resent that Abbie was wearing a shirt that proudly showed off some of her toned stomach while Marie kept having to tug at her shirt to keep her bloated one hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember our promise?  If either one of us starts showing any signs of gaining weight, we'd tell the other one.  I'd want you to do the same for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, like that would ever happen,</i> Marie thought.  For the first time in her life she had some small inkling of jealousy for her friend's figure.  She shook off the feeling.  It was as absurd for her to be depressed over being a little bloated as it was for Abbie to make such a big deal about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, let's work out later, fine?\" Marie said.  Abbie agreed, and dropped the subject.  She reiterated that she wasn't trying to be mean, just that she wanted to stop her friend from letting herself go right from the start before any serious damage could be done.  The net effect, by the time they got to the mall, was that Marie had to force herself to have a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the cutest jeans,\" Abbie said.  Marie agreed.  She did need some new ones . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a pair she knew was her size to try on.  She regretted it.  They pressed into her poor stomach painfully.  Standing up perfectly straight, her profile to the mirror, she experimentally pushed her stomach out just a little.  The button obliging popped open with a depressingly little struggle.  She didn't even ask Abbie how she looked in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, to the shoes,\" Marie said.  Her stomach, incredibly, suddenly growled loud enough to be heard of the din of the surrounding mall.  She blushed, rubbing it gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie laughed.  \"Yeah, I could go for some food, too.\"  Then, in what Marie could only interpret as Abbie just teasing for the sake of making her earlier point stick, she patted Abbie's stomach and briskly led the way to the food court.  Marie was stunned.  She didn't know whether to let it go or to call Abbie on it.  She just stood stock still for a moment, both her hands over her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a little bloating!\" she said, deciding to not make an issue out of it, as she ran after her friend.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The mall's food court had many small, cozey niches that Abbie and Marie, like many other teenagers, made much use of.  They could sit there for hours and talk, and often did.  Marie was looking for to one of her pleasant chats with Abbie less than usual, and it had something to do with her stomach growling loud enough to be heard by Abbie.  For her part, Abbie did pretend to ignore it, and only brought it up again when Marie grunted in frustration and held her stomach tightly hoping it would stop it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, how can I be hungry?  I already feel stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And look stuffed,\" Abbie added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Marie sneered.  She wasn't entirely certain her friend was really trying to get her to shape up before she lost her shape, or if she secretly enjoyed seeing her frustrated and bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have a vegie burger with light cheese.  And a water,\" Abbie said.  Marie approached next intending to order the same thing. <i>That'll show her who has self control,</i> she thought smugly as she looked up at the cashier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have . . .\" <i>woooooooorgle</i> \"two double cheeseburgers and an extra large fries.  Large soda, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped to the side and gave her friend a smug look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, Marie,\" Abbie said with a slight smile, \"No wonder you're bloated with all the grease you're eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-\" Marie smacked her head and made a frustrated groan.  She just now realized what she had ordered.  \"Shut up,\" she turned an accusing finger on her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce seated, Abbie spoke at length about her issues with Travis which Travis's sister was complicating by not minding her business and for some reason pretending to be into Travis annoying best friend Mark.  The tail held many twists and turns, many of which Marie was familiar with, but she had little to add.  She couldn't get a word out edgewise.  From the moment she sat down it was like her body went on auto pilot.  She munched on both burgers with a robotic efficiency, taking large gulps of her soda and breaking for a few fries every couple of bites.  She nodded and \"mmmm\"ed to Abbie when required.  As she approached the end of her second burger, Marie felt an unfamiliar feeling.  It wasn't completely unpleasant, but was uncomfortable, and soon began verging on painful.  She was sitting up straighter than usual now.  Abbie's story faltered as she saw the look of pain on Marie's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Abbie asked slowly, with the irritating hint of a smile on the corner of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I . . . I . . . \" having stopped eating for the first time since they sat down Marie realized she was having trouble breathing, \". . . hurts!\" was all she said.  She eyed the last bite of her last burger, and automatically popped it in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pain of her jeans digging into her immediately vanished, Marie blushed bright red, her eyes darted to her stomach and back to Abbie.  She had, incredibly, popped her jeans open.  Her tummy, puffy since she woke up, now looked rounded.  It was hard, heavy, and as Marie discovered as she pulled her shirt down over it, a little gassy.  She belched before she thought of something to say.  She could see the waves of reactions going over her friend's face.  Since both Abbie and Marie were very athletic and took their figures and health seriously, either one of them pigging out like this, especially in public, would have been cause for concern for one and humiliation for the other.  Abbie looked first worried, then disgusted, then she wore a strange mocking expression, then a concerned one again, and finally settled on a kind, condescending smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Marie,\" Abbie said as Marie hunched forward and hugged her arms across her stuffed middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Abbie!\" Marie said, then softened her tone.  She wasn't sure if Abbie was not-so-secretly enjoying this or not, but she definitely wanted to lash out at somebody other than herself for her bizarre lack of control today.  \"I'm sorry, I . . . I didn't mean that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Abbie said, \"It's no big deal, okay? We all go overboard sometimes.  And you have me to make sure it doesn't become a regular thing, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie found that reassuring.  Not that she was concerned for her figure.  Despite waking up bloated, and now stuffing her face with more calories than she usually ate in a day in a matter of minutes, she was sure this was just a temporary lapse in her normal, athletic diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight? But, still, there was something unnerving in the way Abbie had looked at her just then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to next?\" Abbie asked with a yawn and a muffled burp.</span></div></div>",

Her shirt rode back up over her bloated middle.  She pulled it down with a huff, but didn't try to button her jeans again.  The short, slim, bloated brunette walked awkwardly out of the mall next to her elegant friend.  Elegant, at least, compared to the tired looking and gassy Marie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither could decide on a movie once back at Abbie's, so they would up just relaxing in front of the TV.  Within minutes of the two sitting down Marie found herself drifting off to sleep.  Abbie either didn't notice or didn't care. She was busy looking at things on her phone, responding to other friends.  With a few quiet burps Marie dozed off next to her friend . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"My, you certainly can eat!\" the lovely young witch sat across from Marie and her friend/brother, who was now very obviously a slim blonde girl who reminded Marie of Abbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-urp-guess so, but I didn't eat that much, did I?\" Marie recalled vividly how she had just made a feast out of much of the witch's candy house. She looked over to her sister, \"Besides, Hannah (which is what Marie decided her name must be) ate way more. Look how bloated she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's sleepy face turned toward her. Her belly looked quiet massive. \"Then eat more,\" she said sleepily, \"so you can catch up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! No way,\" Marie said, thinking she was starting to see where this witch was coming from, \"You can fatten her but not me. I see your game and it won't work. This is as big as I'm ever going to get,\" Marie patted her full, and slightly bloated, tummy proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch didn't look annoyed. More bemused, really. She smiled sweetly at Marie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you came her to eat my house, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of, I think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And everything here are delicious sweets just for sweet girls like you,\" the witch smiled, \"Why, the table you were just eating off of is nothing more than a giant s'more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was true.  Marie licked her lips when she noticed this. Her taut tummy rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet you,\" she said, patting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm sure you have enough room left for one measly little table, mmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie shook her head. This was becoming very familiar.  The witch snapped her fingers and laughed pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up, Marie! You don't want to insult our host!\" Hannah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie dug in before she knew what she was doing. She squealed in protest but it was through a mouth full of graham cracker and thick, warm marshmallow. She simply leaned forward and dug in, shoveling handful after handful of the table itself into her mouth and swallowing with hardly any chewing.  She felt her tummy groan under the pressure, the fairy tale German-style dress she was in creaked around the middle as the seams struggled to contain her growing stomach.  It hurt, and though she could barely even taste the rich treat she was stuffing her face with, something about it felt too good to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours of this she was forced back upward and could no longer lean forward.  She tried, but something blocked her.  Something hard, round, and painfully full stood in the way.  She leaned back and gripped her belly tight with a loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, god. -urrrrrp!- Please, can I stop now?\" she said after catching her breath. Marie looked down at her belly, pregnant with food, and over at the delighted face of the sleepy Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps for now,\" the witch said as she made her way around the remains of the s'more table and laid her hands on Marie's bare, tight belly, \"But this isn't over.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie awoke slowly as the dream faded from her memory.  She heard Abbie telling her wake up first, and then as the details of the dream vanished the only memory left was the feeling of being massively, painfully stuffed.  She felt a hand on her stomach and threw her eyes open, angrily slapping Abbie's obtrusively hand away.  Then, she saw what Abbie did, felt what had changed, and made a sound best described as a yelp combined with a belch as her mind reeled at the sight.</span></div></div>",

Now, her stomach was flat our round, and her zipper was staring to be forced downward as her belly button crept into view. She stared wide-eyed at her full stomach, which now stuck out as far as her breasts. She pressed it with her hands. It was as hard as it felt. She belched as she tried to speak. She tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bwaaaarp!\" was all that came out. She blushed bright red both from the embarrassment and the strain she felt. It seemed to her that a solid rock had been jammed into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know what happened,\" Abbie said, unable to take her eyes from her. \"One minute, I was on my phone, then you started moaning in your sleep and your stomach was, um, bigger.  How does it feel?\" Abbie poked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bwuuuuuraaap!\" Marie's mouth opened wide. She slapped Abbie away again. \"So . . . so full . . .\" she wheezed. She tried to stand but the movement made her nauseous. \"How? Urrrrp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Abbie said with a sympathetic look and a strange smile. Marie saw her hand reaching for her middle again. She would have been angrier if she wasn't so worried. Abbie seemed to be enjoying her pain and humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should get up,\" Marie said softly. Slowly, she stood up, holding her stomach tightly. It felt worse as she tried to stand up straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need anything?\" Abbie asked, standing up with her. She put a helpful arm around her friend's shoulder while her other remained posed, ready to reach out for Marie's horribly bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie's head spun. She was exhausted as though she had just eaten a Thanksgiving feast, which is probably what happened. But she hadn't eaten anything in hours, and how could you get fuller just by dreaming about food? At least, she thought she dreamed about food.</span></div></div>",

Abbie looked her over, shaking her head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Marie asked, resting her hands on her poor, sore, stomach. The skin felt stretched tightly around her middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, you just look so, well, bloated,\" Abbie said, her voice only barely softening at the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay off,\" Marie said, laying her head back. She closed her eyes, feeling sleep come over her . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"My my my, back for more, are you?\" the witch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie looked across a table full of the food. The witch looked younger now, almost her age, and seemed very familiar. She reminded her of Abbie now. Hannah, the girl who she took to be Abbie before, sat stuffed, fattened, and comatose across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more,\" Marie said. She waved her hands on front of her. \"I'm too full. I don't want to get fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too late for that,\" the witch said in a sing songy voice as Marie felt a powerful groan in her stomach.  It inched outward, not just in front but oozing out along her sides as well. Her breasts began swelling in her bra. She panted, gasped, and finally screamed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie awoke, probably minutes later, and could have sworn she saw her already stuffed stomach push upward under hands. She rubbed it, now wide awake. Did it feel softer? She looked at it, noticing that her usually shallow naval did look a little deeper. Her jeans dug into her sides now, softness appearing there for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abbie, something's wrong,\" she said, but didn't sit up. \"Abbie? Don't let me fall asleep again, okay?\" Marie's breathing slowed. It was just a dream, but still, this new feeling around her middle did not feel like bloating. It felt uncomfortably, frightfully, like fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie turned her head, and was about to sit up when Abbie entered the room . . .</span></div></div>",

In the woody neighborhood outside of the main town, there was a group of children playing outside in the snow. One girl was behind a snow bank throwing snow balls at her friends. The girl behind the snow bank is named Shea. Shea is an 11 year old girl with brown wavy hair and brown eyes. Her skin is white but is darker than average. She used to play sports, but she had quit a while ago, but she was still popular at her school. But since she quit sports, she had put on a little bit of weight. Nothing too big, but she hada noticeable pot belly. It was covered right now with a blue puffy jacket, blue gloves, blue snow pants, and a puff ball hat that had a pink puff ball, the top part of the hat was pink with brown patterns, and the other part of the half was blue. No one knew why, but Shea was always wearing this hat. Deep down, she had a thing for wearing winter hats and clothes. But no matter what, she didn't care what anyone thought. At the house, Shea was playing with a group of family friends that were over for a little while. Shea turned her head and immediately, she was hit in the head with a snow ball. She cleared the snow off of her face to see who threw it. She looked over to a nearby snow bank to see a boy with his head out from behind, smiling. This was Shea's crush. His name was Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was the second oldest kid in his family. He was like Shea in many ways, except for the hat part. He has hair that is longer and brown, he was popular in school, he currently wasn't playing any sports, and he had a little of a belly. He was wearing a brown puffy jacket with gloves, boots, snow pants and a brown hat with tassles. Shea smiled back at him, admiring his friendly gesture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of throwing snow balls, the kids stopped and Nick's other three siblings headed inside, while Shea and Nick followed behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice job today, Shea,\" Nick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Shea said to him with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting bigger. I like what I'm seeing. keep it up,\" Nick said to Shea, walking inside and leaving her with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea paused in her tracks and smiled. Nick wanted her fatter? What does she start to think about?</span></div></div>",

She was trying to think of what she could do to make herself fatter quicker. As she was thinking about fattening up, her stomach let out a huge growl. Shea was getting hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" Shea said to herself. She thought of an idea to binge all night on sweet, junk food that would fill her up and bulge her out! After thinking about this, Shea opened her sliding glass door and went inside, noticing that Nick and his family was gone. She could hear her parents, but they were somewhere around the house. Shea didn't waste a moment. She took off her boots, leaving everything else on. She didn't care that her clothes were still on. All she cared about was eating and getting fatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately ran into her kitchen and started to grab left over food from the get together. After grabbing the huge amount of food, Shea ran upstairs, into her room and locked her door. She looked at all of the food she had grabbed. She grabbed 20 left over chicken wings, eight twinkies, five slices of german chocolate cake, a galloon bin of vanila ice cream, and she grabbed three two liters of coke. Shea knew that all of this food would help increase her weight gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea sat herself on her bed and started digging into the wings. She kept on grabbing and biting into the wings, tearing the chicken wings apart. Although they tasted spicy, Shea kept on sucking the succulent meat off the bones and took a swig of coke here and there. The more she ate, the more she knew that she was pleasing Nick. After a while of eating and eating, Shea noticed that all that was left of her wings were bones. Shea had eaten all twenty wings within a half hour! Although she felt full, she knew she had to keep on eating until all of the food was gone....</span></div></div>",

She swallowed, then rubbed her aching belly through her coat; although she was a big eater, she'd never tried to consume this much in one go before and her body was complaining. She took another Twinkie and ate it as quickly as she coquld, then another, then a fourth. Of she ate fast enough, she didn't feel the pain so much. After forcing down the final Twinkie she took another long drink from the bottle of Coke, half-emptying it before putting the lid back on and dropping it to the carpet where it joined the discarded bucket of bones and several Twinkie wrappers. <br>\r\nWith a long, agonised groan, she lay back on her bed, trying to ignore the feeling that someone had just jammed an entire watermelon down her throat and into her gut. With clumsy fingers, she unzipped her coat and jumper, then pulled up her shirt so she could massage herpoor tortured belly with both hands. It was swollen and distended, straining the button on her jeans. She undid it, sighing as some if the pressure was eased. Still, she couldn't bring herself to eat any more right now; she thought she might be sick if she tried. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door.</span></div></div>",

There was only one option; do her best to eat as much as she could, and hope no-one would notice. She rolled off the bed with a moan, then she shrugged out of her coat and sweater and dumped them on the floor as well. She needed to tidy everything up...<br>\r\nShe began the process of hiding all the rubbish, stuffing the wrappers into an old jewellery box, the Coke in her wardrobe and the rest under her bed. Hopefully, that'd do.<br>\r\nHer shirt had ridden up with the activity, revealing her distended midriff. She poked it curiously, feeling an inch or two of flab, then her stuffed gut beneath. Was this really what Nick wanted? He had said he liked what he was seeing, so it must be. This meal was like a tournrmant, and victory meant winning the girl. Or guy, in this case.<br>\r\nSmiling to herself, she headed downstairs to eat with her family.</span></div></div>",

Her mom laughed at her and said, \"Okay, but aren't you going to change your clothes first?\" \"That coat won't look too pretty if you get it smeared with chocolate!\" Shea rolled her eyes at her Mom. \"No. Quit being a worry wart. Give me that bowl.\" Shea licked the bowl and then threw it back in the sink and looked back at her Mom finishing the final touches on her cooking. \"How long until dinner?\" \"I am SO hungy I feel like I could pass out right now.\" Her mom held out her hand and said, \"five minutes.\" Shea sat at the table watching her Mom finish putting the food on the table and watched her take the devils food cake out of the oven and set it on the table, and she could savor all of that food so much that she actually started salivating. \"Food rules!\" she thought. \"I think I like food better than boys or at the very least they are a close tie.\" She laughed and then ran from the table and called her Father in to dinner like she did every night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad come on, it's time to eat. Hurry up! Chocolate cake tonight. Fresh out of the oven.\" Shea's Dad looked at her and rolled his eyes like he did every night, but then he ruffled her hair and said, \"One day you might not be so eager to eat like you do, if you ever have a weight problem.\" \"Have you thought about that, pumpkin?\" She giggled. \"Me have a weight problem? Never!\" Then she looked down again at her pot belly tummy and shrugged her shoulders. Well, it is a possibility, but tonight bring on the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gorging herself on three helpings of lasagna dinner with two large slices of cake, she let out a loud burp and sighed and realized she was a bit sick to her stomach. Maybe she should have omitted that cake batter before she ate. Oh well, she thought. \"I'll take a Tums and go lie down for 15 minutes and I'll be okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning up to her bedroom, she grabbed the Tums off of her bedroom dresser and took three Tums and then jumped on her unmade bed and grabbed the new book she had gotten at the library yesterday at school and was part way through the book, when she felt herself becoming sleepy and lazy and she drifted off to sleep for about 30 minutes. She felt a strange rumble in her stomach and looked at her tummy. Her stomach was as big as if she had stuffed three pillows underneath her shirt. \"Oh my goodness!\" \"What is going on?\" \"I feel like Violet from Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, who got so big she burst. \"I don't want that to happen to me.!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran to the adjoining bathroom to her room and hopped on the scale. Shea knew hew normal weight was 95 pounds. The scales now showed that she was 145 pounds. \"No way I am 145 pounds! No way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started screaming and calling to her parents downstairs and yelled down to them to come upstairs and check on her. \"Mom, Dad, come quick! Something is seriously wrong with my stomach!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her Mom met Shea at the top of the stairs, her Mother said, \"I can't believe this would happen again in our family.\" \"It ______<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We took this job, so we need to go and we just can't take you with us. We are glad Aunt Yenna said she wanted to take care of you. Now you can live with her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I need to leave all my friends behind. I don't wanna move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here is better then coming with us. You'll have friends before you know it. I heard there are a lot of kids in the neighborhood. In five weeks, school starts. I know you're a bit worried, but I'm sure you'll like Aunt Yenna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hardly know her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, we didn't visit often. But she often took care of kids if their parents went on vacation for a few weeks. She loves children!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why doesn't she have children of her own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. She also never married. She always said that man only like woman for sex....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true. Not entirely. I mean sure some men but not all. I mean Nick doesn't want me only for sex...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a sharp pain when she thought about Nick, her crush. Now that she moved, he would probably forget her and find a new girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, maybe Nick can visit you. Besides don't make drama about it. You also broke up with Zack, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he wanted to have sex with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother almost drove the car off the street and looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're eleven!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so that's why I broke up with him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really wanted a boyfriend. Lately her body was starting to change. Two months ago she got her first period and her mother was so happy with it and lately also her boobs started to grow. Some other girls in her class were so jealous. They were't too big yet. She didn't needed a bra but still they were noticeable even while wearing a sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look there it is!\" Her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea could't believe it. The house was way bigger then her parents house. She thought there was enough room for a family with four kids and grandma.<br>\r\nShea and her mother got out of the car and Shea's mother rang the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice weather here. You can go to the beach maybe. It's a short walk from here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must admit it was nice weather. She was a white T-shirt with short sleeves and short pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer the winter....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and a blond chubby woman opened. Shea looked with an open mouth. Sure, it was about five years since she last saw her aunt but still, now she saw her, Shea thought she looked beautiful. Sure she was a bit chubby but surely not fat with big firm DD breasts. She had perfect skin with pearl white teeth and long blond hair that fell like a waterfall over her shoulders with nice long perfect legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea wondered how was it possible she never found a man. She bet she could find hundreds of men who would want to go out with her. She also seemed pretty young, somewhere around 25. Could be? It was her father's younger sister and her father called Yenna always his baby sister and her father was about 33 years old.  <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"Shea! Nice to see you again.\" Yenna said. \"The last time i saw you you were playing with stuffed animals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her voice sounded perfect, Shea thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you too.\" Shea mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand you're not so happy that your parents are going away and leaving you here but give it some time. I'm sure you gonna like it here. Let's do our best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that sounded pretty good. Shea must admit. Yenna at least understood that Shea wasn't too happy about this. <br>\r\nHer mother was busy getting Shea's stuff out. She also gave Yenna a list with some rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so nice you wanted to take care of her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem really. She's my niece after all. I have too much room anyway and I get a bit lonely so it's really fine having a young girl to keep me company, and her friends when they come over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea's mother kissed and hugged Shea tight before she drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you wanna do first?\" Yenna asked.</span></div></div>",

In the mean time, why don't you just go and unpack some stuff and I'll make a feast that you will love?\" Aunt Yenna said to her niece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, that sounds good to me!\" Shea said, kind of excited for her meal and for her to be unpacked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they talked, Shea immediately went and ran up to her room, or at least try and run. Shea wasn't fat, but she had a little bit of a belly. She had the complexion of a skinny person, but had a belly sticking out. After speeding up the stairs, Shea entered her room and had her mouth gaped open. Her room was huge! Her room was twice the size of her old room and has big as her kitchen, which is bigger than a normal room. Her room was purple, her favorite color, and her room had a balcony, which gave her a view of the sea. All around her room, she saw that her Aunt had set jars of candy around for Shea. This women really understood Shea well for not seeing her that much. Shea's bed was king sized with purple and blue sheets. Shea jumped on her bed and began to smile, loving her new room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter enjoying her bed and room, Shea began to unpack her stuff. The first thing she went through was her clothes. She had a lot of long sleeve and winter clothing. For some reason, she liked winter clothing better than summer clothes. She hung up her clothes and even hung up her favorite winter hat on her bed post. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry hat, I'll wear you soon!\" Shea said to her hat, which if some one else saw that, they would consider Shea weird. Shea continued unpacking her clothes, electronics, basic items, and other things until....</span></div></div>",

Anyway, it smells delicious!\" Shea said as she ran downstairs and into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Shea! I'm really glad you decided to come here. I hope you like your room. If you don't like it, we could look for another room. I have several rooms...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?! My room is terrific. I love it! I love purple and I love candy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! I heard you liked candy so I decided to buy some for you. If you want, I also could put a T.V in your room. I have one I'm not doing anything with. Of course only if you want it!\" Aunt Yenna said to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea slowly started to smile. She always wanted a T.V in her room, but her parents were against it. Now, she was just offered one! Just less then two hours ago, she hated coming here and now, it seemed like this was terrific!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like a T.V. Can I have some of that food? It smells good!\" Shea asked, noticing the food sitting on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course dear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Yenna put a big bowl on table while Shea followed to the table. It had a yellow crust. Shea looked curious at it. She couldn't remember seeing anything like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful honey! The bowl is still hot. It's a gratin. It's made from potatoes, cheese, onion, cream, bacon... Oh my, you're not a vegetarian are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm not a vegetarian. I love meat. It smells delicious!\" Shea said, loving the smell of the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea picked up her knife and fork and took a small bite. She slowly chewed it and discovered it tasted delicious. This was great. Aunt Yenna was a really great cook. If she cooked like this everyday, she wouldn't mind staying here. Delicious food, a huge room in her favorite color, candy, a T.V, and a sea nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could get used to this! But still I do miss my friends. Especially my crush, Nick. He's so cool. But now I'm gone, I'm sure he'll find a new girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea and her friends of course talked about guys and she and her female friends all thought Nick looked cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm afraid I can't help you with that. But you know, sometimes you lose friends. That's too bad, but that's how it goes. Can't do anything about it. But you'll also get new friends. You know there are a lot of children around here. A lot go to your new school. But well, you still have five weeks vacation so you have time to know some of them. Maybe you can have a slumber party. I hope you don't mind but I might have told some kids you would come to live here. I think you get a lot of new friends here. Most kids here are pretty nice. The girls were happy I told them you were also a girl,\" Aunt Yenna said as Shea shoved forkful and forkful full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea suddenly noticed she ate the entire gratin. She was surprised she ate the entire gratin since it was pretty big. She was more hungry then she thought. Well, it also tasted pretty good to her and she did love to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well If you want to, you can go outside and meet some of the kids. But be home by 6:00 for dinner, alright? I will put the T.V in your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!

Shea looked at herself to make sure she looked suitable for meeting some of the kids. But as she looked down at herself, Shea noticed that her belly was a little bit bigger. It wasn't huge, but it was starting to become more noticeable as her shirt was a little tighter than usual. Shea ignorned this and started to walk down the driveway into the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea started walking and noticing there were more houses around here than she thought. Some of the houses were big and some were small, but one thing for sure was that her aunt's house was the biggest. Shea walked until she noticed a girl in the driveway of a house, sitting and eating ice cream. This girl had blonde hair, was at least as tall, maybe a little shorter, than Shea. This girl was as skinny as a rod with blue eyes and perfect complexion. She was wearing a pink shirt with skinny jeans that fit her perfectly. Shea was interested in meeting this girl. She continued walking when the girl looked up at Shea, who was walking past the house<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you there!\" the blonde girl yelled at Shea, who made Shea freeze in her footsteps. Shea looked at her to see what she wanted, but was happy the girl called her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like those shorts!

I usually go to Hollister more, but those shorts still look great!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Shea said, kind of happy the first person she met complimented her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, you're new around here. What's your name?\" The blonde girl asked Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Shea Hunter! I am not from here. Well, actually, I live here with my aunt now. My parents accepted a job somewhere else, so I am living with my Aunt Yenna now!\" Shea said in a friendly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! You're Ms. Yenna's nephew? She was telling my mom about you the other day. Although, I haven't really been over to Ms. Yenna's house, she seems very nice!\" The girl said as she finished her ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is very nice! Maybe you can come over later on!\" Shea said, liking this new girl so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! My name is Emily by the way,\" The blonde girl said as she stood up. When she stood up, Shea noticed how skinny Emily really was. Shea looked bigger compared to Emily, but she really didn't care. All she cared about was that she was making a new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Our town isn't the most exciting place in the world, but we often find something to do. Especially now when it's summer vacation!\" Emily said to Shea as they began walking down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personally, I like the winter more,\" Shea said to Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, winter is also great. We throw snowballs, build forts, make snowman and of course, sledge riding. But before we're there, we enjoy the summer. Over there is a forest. We have some tree houses there. We also often go swimming in the sea. We can always find some fun things to do. In autumn, we always go looking for nuts. Which school are you going to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I just arrived here a few hours ago. My parents signed me up for school. They forgot to tell me the name of the school,\" Shea said, guessing they were going to the same school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell I think it's our school. The Dune School. It's very close to your Aunt's house, so you can walk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Wait up Emily!\" Shea heard as someone was coming from behind the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small girl walked up to them. She was about four inches shorter the Shea but her blonde hair was even past her knees. She was kind of pail, but smiled with perfect white teeth. She was a bit chubbier than Shea and wore a nice dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Sandy, but mostly, we call her by her nickname, Rapunzel, because of her long hair!\" Emilt said as Rapunzel smiled at Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait for me!\" They all heard, turning around, as they heard a voice from an upstairs window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl with fire red hair looked out of her window on her top floor. She crawled out the window, slid down the drainpipe. Shea looked at her with an open mouth. She wouldn't even dare to do that from the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Jane. She dares to do anything. She trains a lot! She is by far the strongest girl in our class. Also stronger than most boys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello you all!\" Jane said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane had visible abs and tight clothing. Shea could see clearly that Jane breast were just like hers, starting to develop and becoming bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Jane! Rapunzel, Jane, this is Shea. She's new here. She's the niece of Ms. Yenna!\" Emily told them with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You live there? I have spent some nights there with my brother when my parents went on vacation. She's nice and is a great cook! And there so much room there! Guess you have a big room all by yourself!\" Sandy (Rapunzel) said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to be honest, yes I do!\" Shea said, smiling at the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that!\" Someone screamed from behind the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind, the girls saw a slender girl with black, shiny hair. Her clothes seemed pretty expensive. She even wore a lot of make up, a bit too much if you asked Shea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Victoria. This is Shea. She's new here,\" Emily said in a bored monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're the new one? Doesn't she need to pay some money to be accepted in the neighborhood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No she doesn't!\" Jane said softly but clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, new one, where do you live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With my Aunt Yenna. And my name is not new one. It's Shea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, new one. And don't think I believe you really live with your Aunt Yenna. Like you could live there!\" Victoria said as she turned around and started walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think she likes me so much,\" Shea said while watching Victoria walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, join the club,\" Emily said. \"Don't worry too much about Victoria. Sure, she may not like you, but on the other hand, she does't like anybody,\" Jane told Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except for the people who are stupid enough to do anything she wants. Her parents are rich. So she can buy anything she wants. She's very spoiled. Don't worry about it. She's all barking but no biting,\" Emily said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look! There's Leonard,\" Whispered Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the girls looked in the direction Jane looked. Shea also did and understood why. There was a dreamy guy. He was tall with muscles and had perfect skin with nice, brown hair. He showed a friendly smile with teeth just as white as Sandy's teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D... d... does he have a girlfriend?\" Shea asked, liking what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N... n... no,\" Emily said with a giggle. \"But not because he can't get one. He never says yes if someone asks him. If you like him, ask him. Maybe you're the lucky one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe another time,\" Shea said with a fast beating heart. She had a good feeling about him though.<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

The girls went to the swings and started to talk about school, fashion, and about themselves. Shea was feeling comfortable that the girls were being friendly and talking to her so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love to eat and make food, but I also love hanging out with my friends and art. How about you Shea?\" Sandy asked Shea, noticing Shea's belly as Shea was sitting on the swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I love to eat too! I don't make that much food really, but I may try to learn how to cook more things. I used to play sports like lacrosse, softball, and I even used to swim. But then I started thinking to myself I also liked to relax and not have to stress myself out with sports. So I decided to quit and I have been well since I have quit,\" Shea told her friends as she stared down at her small belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You played lacrosse? I love lacrosse! I mean I do a lot of sports and activities, but I love to play lacrosse. Maybe sometime I can challenge you to it for fun!\" Jane said to Shea as she smiled at Shea. Shea was realizing that she wasn't exactly like these girls, but with each girl, Shea had common interests with them, which was nice with friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am sort of athletic, but I don't eat a lot. But one thing I love is fashion. I really want to be a fashion designer someday! I like many different types of clothes and designing my own clothes,\" Emily said as all the other girls listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shea, you need to see some of the stuff she makes. She is amazing at what she does! She even made my dress!\" Sandy said as she looked down at her pink dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! The dress does look great!\" Shea said, amazed at all the things her friends did and how close they all were to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Shea! Maybe we can share some clothes!\" Emily said to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could. I mean I have more winter clothes than summer clothing, but we could still share anytime!\" Shea said. Shea didn't say anything, but she wondered if Emily would even fit in Shea's clothing since Shea was larger. Emily would need to be a little bigger to fit into Shea's clothing, but Shea wasn't worried about that right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids continued to talk and swing on the swing sets. They even started a game of tag and ran around. Although Sandy was the slowest, they still had fun. Shea wasn't too fast either, but she wasn't slow and sluggish yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of hanging out at the park, Shea noticed it was about 5:30. It was at that time when the girls started walking home as they all headed to Aunt Yenna's house. Shea wanted to hang out with her new friends more and see if they would like her house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I know you all just met me and I haven't fully moved in yet. But I was wondering, do you guys want to spend the night?\" Shea asked, hoping the new girls would want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked at each other and....</span></div></div>",

But I don't think that's a problem since it is vacation,\" Jane said to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask your aunt. Maybe we can get some pizza since I don't think she expected that three girls would come over,\" Sandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will come as soon as we ask our parents and pack our stuff. If we can't come, we will call you,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Hope to see you soon!\" Shea said, happy from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea ran home right away. She thought it was hard getting new friends but it became pretty easy today. She already had a sleepover on the first day. Maybe this was't so bad after all. But still, Shea missed her old friends. If she still lived near the old neighborhood then she wouldn't mind so much. But this place was very far away from her old neighborhood. She wondered if she would stay friends with her old ones now that she lived so far away. Maybe with Kelly. Shea and her were BFF's (best friends forever) since kindergarten. But she doubted her other friends would take the effort. How about Nick? She could ask Kelly. If he really forgot her and found a new girl, she could try to get Leonard to like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Aunt Yenna!\" Shea said as she walked into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Shea. Tell me! How was your first day? Made some friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I did. I meet Emily, Rapunzel, Jane, Victoria and Leonard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Victoria. Listen well, Shea. I rather you don't hang out with her. I do not want to decide who you can or can't hang out with. It's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I only met her. It was hate at first sight. She was acting like a mean, spoiled brat! Anyway, I invited the others except Leonard over for a sleepover if that's ok,\" Shea said, seeing if her Aunt was okay with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This soon?\" Aunt Yenna asked in a surprised tone. \"I mean I'm happy, but I wish you would had told me earlier. Then I would have made more food,\" Aunt Yenna said, pointing to the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we thought we could order some pizza. That's what we usually do at a sleepover,\" Shea told her Aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all right, but I worked hard to make this food. So I want you to eat some of it, please?\" Aunt Yenna asked her niece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea looked at her aunt. She didn't want to hurt her aunt's feelings, especially since she had been so nice to her. Besides, the food smelled really good. Besides, if she was full, she could choose to not have a pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well all right, but not too much! I want to be done eating when my friends come over,\" Shea said, telling her Aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food tasted delicious. Shea could easy eat the food with ease as she kept on digging into the food. Shea had become pretty hungry, happy, and all excited from all the excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you and your friends want, you can take a swim before you go to bed,\" Aunt Yenna told Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A swim? You mean in the sea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course not. I mean in the swimming pool. In the hall, last door at your right. It has sliding glass doors and a roof you can open. So on hot days, I usually open the roof,\" Aunt Yenna said, pointing to the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I bet you also have a jacuzzi,\" Shea said, amazed with her Aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah in the bathroom!\" Her Aunt said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Yenna, I don't get it. You look beautiful, you're a terrific cook and you're rich. How come you don't have a boyfriend?\" Shea asked as she continued to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I want a man who likes me for me. Not because of my looks, cooking or money or the sex. Well If I really love him, I probably will have sex with him once, but then because I also want it,\" Aunt Yenna said as she was being honest with Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" Shea said and swallowed the last crumb of the food. Shea ate a whole casserole along with a whole pie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I will put some mattresses in the living room. If you want you can pick a DVD, but not from the highest shelf in the living room. That's for when you are 16 years and older and I don't want a problem with the girl's parents about nightmares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea got up to help carry some mattresses with her Aunt. Aunt Yenna also put a big bowl of popcorn, another bowl of pretzels and a few 2 liter bottles of cola for the girls. After about a half hour, Aunt Yenna opened the front door and took a pile of pizzas into the kitchen. Shea didn't see how many pizzas there was as she continued getting the room ready. Shea was just ready when she heard the doorbell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea headed for the door. As she did, she noticed her belly was a little bigger than before. It was still under her shirt, but it wouldn't be under her shirt for too much longer if she continued eating the way she was. Shea opened the door. Emily, Sandy and Jane were all standing in the door opening.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey you guys! Welcome to my house!\" Shea said as she greeted her guest into the house. All three of the girls waled into the house, amazed at how big the house was. The floors were made of nice hard wood as the walls had designs normally seen in a rich person's house. There was so much space in the house, you could usually hear an echo. The girls were amazed with the house and the sheer size of it. Shea was still even in disbelief with the house. This was now her new home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well before I show you guys around and before we do stuff, how about we all eat first?\" Shea said as she started motioning her friends towards the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! I'm starved,\" Sandy said as the other girls shook their heads agreeing with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea then lead her girl friends down the main hall into the kitchen, where Shea finally saw how many pizzas her Aunt ordered. Her Aunt had ordered five large pizzas! Shea was suprised! But her Aunt Yenna was smiling at Shea and her friends as she got out plates and drinks for the guests. Shea introduced her friends to her Aunt as her friends greeted her warmly, athough the girls already knew Aunt Yenna a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, girls! Make yourselves at home! I'm going to get your beds ready. Go ahead and eat and hang out. Let me know if any of you guys need anything or want anything! Dig into the pizzas. There's a lot!\" Aunt Yenna said to the girls warmly as she exited the kitchen and headed for the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Aunt is so kind!\" Emily said staring at Shea and her some what bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! She is very amazing! Well, how about we eat some pizza now?\" Shea said as she motioned to the pizza with her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls headed over for the pizza right away. Jane grabbed herself two slices of pizza while Emily started off with one. Sandy grabbed three slices of pizza and started eating. Shea was thinking of not having any, but as she was thinking that, her stomach began to growl. Shea was hungry again? She was suprised at herself, but if she felt hungry, she felt hungry. Shea did the same as Sandy and grabbed three pieces of pizza. The girls devoured their pizza as they kept on talking and talking. After Emily finished her piece of pizza, she grabbed two more pieces since she still felt hungry. Jane also grabbed two more. Sandy on the other grabbed three more slices when she was done and Shea followed with three more slices. It was obvious that Shea and Sandy had the bigger appetites, but Sandy was still bigger than Shea. Shea still had a skinny body with developing boobs, but Shea had a belly like a pregnant lady. Sandy, on the other hand, was chubbier. She could be considered fat and she was bigger than Shea. But with the way Shea had eaten today, it wouldn't be a suprise if things changed soon. The girls continued to talk and after they were done eating the pizza, there was one full pizza left. Shea stuck this in the refridgerator and decided to eat it later since she wanted to go and do something with her new friends. She was thinking if she should either show them her new room or change and have her and the girls go swimming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea asked the girls.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her posters were hung in her room along with her items like jewelry, makeup, and many other personal items. Shea was shocked, but so happy her Aunt Yenna did all of this for her. She was loving living here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Shea! You unpacked really quickly!\" Jane said, amazed at the size and look of Shea's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I unpacked a few things, but I guess my Aunt Yenna unpacked everything else!\" Shea said, looking at the look on her friend's face. She could see that her friends loved her room. They even started looking around at her stuff. Jane went over to Shea's mirror and looked at the jewelry and makeup on her dresser. Sandy headed over to the candy and started eating some of it. Shea wasn't worried about it since it would be refilled eventually. Emily went over to the clothes right away. She grabbed Shea's winter hat off of Shea's bed post and placed it on her head as she looked through Shea's closet, looking at the clothes. Shea didn't mind this either since she thought Emily looked good in the hat. She was glad her friends liked her room. She was thinking maybe they could all sleep in their room instead of sleeping in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you guys want to go onto the beach now for a little bit and then swim in my pool?\" Shea asked her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a pool? Well, Sure! Let's do that,\" Emily said, complying to Shea along with her friends. Shea looked out her window and noticed it was dark outside. Before they went out on the beach, maybe they should all change into their swimsuits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, let's change into our swimsuits!\" Shea said as the girls shook their heads agreeing.

Emily and Jane didn't seem to bother and also started to take off their clothes. Since all her three friends did it, Shea didn't want to be left behind or give her three friends the idea that she was prudish. Shea started to take off her clothes too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have a bathing suit. My mom says I'm too young for a bikini. I can have one when I'm a teenager or when my big sister tells me when I have some cleavage for my bikini,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane and Shea, who both just pulled off their shirts, stopped a moment from what they were doing and noticed each other's chest. Both weakly smiled. Emily took one look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess you two don't have that problem. You already have tits,\" She said angry and pulled off her sweater revealing her flat chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. You will also get them. It's not our fault we got them earlier,\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily bowed her head. Shea saw she was sorry, but she understood that Emily was a bit frustrated that two of her friends already got some small boobs while her chest was still flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Emily finally mumbled. \"It's just that my big sister is always flaunting with hers. Boys are always looking at hers because they are so big and I still have nothing. Not even the smallest lump,\" She said as she felt her boobs.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Well look at the bright side. If your sister's boobs are big, yours will probably also become big since you have the same genes!\" Jane said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to cheer Emily up. Sandy in the meantime put her bikini on. Shea could clearly see the rolls on her friend's fat belly. Fastly, she put her bikini on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Shea, you already past our test!\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which test?\" Shea asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's nothing big. When you're new in the neighborhood, you need to do something fun with some of the others,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a dance party, or a trip to an amusement park, or a swimming pool,\" Sandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a party in your garden can also be fun,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or a sleepover like you did. It sort of makes you a member from our neighborhood. Just for fun,\" Jane said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery girl put their clothes back on over their bikinis/ swimsuits. Shea thought about what she just heard. She was suprised there was a test, but at least, on the other hand, she knew some clubs at school also had stupid tests before you could become a member. Like paint the guinea pig's purple, or show your naked butt to a teacher or kiss a girl with a pimple on her lips. All kind of stupid tests. Just doing something fun with some of the other kids of the neighborhood wasn't so bad. To be honest it was kind of... fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Lets go,\" Emily said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked downstairs and Shea stopped for a moment to tell Aunt Yenna they were heading to the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you all know how to swim, I'm fine with it,\" She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flashlight, just to be sure, the four girls walked outside and......</span></div></div>",

The girls were linking arms with each other as they were walking. Shea was happy that she was starting to gain pretty close friends. She thought this would've been very difficult, but she had never been more wrong. The girls kept on walking until they felt their bare feet hit the salty water. The water kept on swishing back and forth between the girl's toes as the sea kept on moving and moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this wonderful?\" Emily said as she patted Shea's back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is. The smell, the feel, just this moment. It's great. I'm glad I'm here,\" Shea said as she smiled to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love living by the sea! I was actually born here. That's why my parents named me Sandy,\" Sandy said, dipping her feet deep into the sand, feeling the sand run through her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls walked around the beach and continued to talk about their lives, growing closer and closer to eachother. They even started to play a little game of tag with each other on the beach. By the end of the game, all of the girls were laying on the ground, laughing and lying next to each other on the beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you guys want to go swimming in the pool now?\" Shea asked her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" They all said in unison. They used the flash light to find their way back to the house. They entered, walked down the hall until Shea and her friends stopped in front of a door that said \"Swimming Pool.\" Shea opened the door and her and her friend's faces turned into open mouths in heavenly shock. The swimming pool was huge! It was as big as an olympic size pool with a diving board and water slide! There was even a jacuzzi that the girls could enjoy themselves in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls scurried in and headed for the table by the pool and began to strip down.

She was smiling as she was enjoying her skinny dip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily, although jealous of Jane's body, smiled and began to laugh. Shea and Sandy even giggled along with Emily. Immediately, Sandy took off her swimsuit and threw it the ground. Sandy's boobs were big, but not as big as Jane's suprisingly.

Sandy jumped into the pool, making a huge splash with her fat cannon ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing this and seeing her two friends enjoying themselves in the food, Shea began to take off her swimsuit. After she pulled off her whole swimsuit, she threw it to the ground in the pile of swimsuits already thrown off. Shea was now standing on the side of the pool naked. Shea looked at herself. She was a little chubby. Her belly was noticeable and her arms, cheeks, and thighs were chubby. She even had a double chin. But she didn't care as she did a fat cannon ball into the pool. She came up to the surface, smiling and laughing out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in, Emily!\" Jane said, noticing Emily debating what she should do. After a moment of thought, Emily took off her swimsuit and placed it on top of the others. The girls looked at her naked body. She was the skinniest of them all! She had a stick like figure with no boobs. She was flat, but she was still skinny. Shea looked at her. Some part of her wanted to fatten up Emily a little bit. Shea had no idea why she was thinking this! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Emily jumped into the pool, making the girls cheer. After reaching the surface, Shea started to splash her.

She wondered if her aunt liked cartoons or if the old movies were from when Aunt Yenna was a kid herself.<br>\r\nShe rolled on her back and looked at the ceiling, thinking about yesterday.

I'm awake,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thinking about your old friends and neighborhood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit. They would never swim naked there. But I must admit, I liked it,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's because of Jane. She has a lot of courage. She dares to do almost everything. She likes a challenge, but she also likes to challenge someone else. So, it wasn't strange that she challenged Emily to swim naked and do it herself. Jane likes to do the strangest things,\" Sandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would she also swim naked with a boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know that. But maybe she would. But I think she challenges the boy to swim naked, too,\" Sandy said. Both started to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you miss your old friends?\" They heard the voice of Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm a bit. There's one very good friend. I miss her. Maybe I can ask her to visit sometime. There was also one guy... I really liked him. I wonder if he will find another girl now,\" Shea said to the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he does, he isn't worth it. Just another guy who thinks with his cock. After one girl is gone, he takes the first slut he sees!\" Sandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are also a lot of cute boys here. And you have a good body. We saw that yesterday! You also have a cute face. I don't think you will have much trouble finding a boyfriend,\" Emily said to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I would like it if he would still like me. Even while I'm here and he's there, but if I hear he found another, I could try to look here for one,\" Shea said, starting to think to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you are already awake?\" Jane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to watch some T.V?\" Emily asked while she took the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls watched T.V for the next hour until Sandy suddenly noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you girls smell that? Something here smells pretty good,\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right! I smell it too,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, all four girls still in their pajamas (or nighties) walked to the kitchen. There, they saw Aunt Yenna in a robe making breakfast. The table was full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, girls! I thought I should make you four girls a breakfast. I hope you're hungry,\" Aunt Yenna said to the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked at the table full of food. It seemed like enough for ten people, but it all smelled and looked very tasty.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Well, I'm hungry,\" Sandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, all four girls started to eat.     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shea went for the flapjacks and bacon while Sandy went for the eggs and hashbrowns. Jane and Emily grabbed some toast and flapjacks. Aunt Yenna walked out of the room, noticing all of the girls digging into the food. Shea was in ecstacy since the food was so delicious, it amazed her. Shea's friends also loved the food, finding that they wanted more like Shea. They kept eating until finally, the girls notcied they had eaten everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!! I'm so full!\" Emily said moaning with syrup on her face. Shea looked over at her and noticed that Emily had a small belly from the meal. This lead her to look at her own belly, seeing that it was even bigger than before. It was sort of noticeable, but she didn't care since she loved the weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the best meal I have eaten in a while,\" Jane said to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with that times infinity!\" Sandy said, rubbing her distended belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with you guys! That was an amazing breakfast! I sure am full,\" Shea told the other girls. She rubbed the chocolate off her face from the chocolate pudding, laughing at the fact it was on her nose. Shea was so happy that she had an amazing aunt. Now, they were all smiling with pleasure, wondering what would happen next.</span></div></div>",

Shea was again surprised about how big her room was. She thought about how angry she had been at her parents when she suddenly heard about their new job. Suddenly, they had a new job and couldn't take her with them. And on top of it, she needed to go live with an aunt she hardly knew. She threw a huge tantrum that had no effect. She felt just like Heidi, the girl from \"A Swiss Tale,\" that needed to suddenly live with her grandfather. She didn't want to and now she was here, she was very happy. If she would have known this, she would have been happy that she could live here. She only wondered why she hardly met Aunt Yenna before. They could have visited her more often, even if she did live far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Shea, you're a lucky girl! I must admit I'm a bit jealous. You have a great aunt, room, house, swimming pool...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I guess I am really lucky. I also like it here! the only thing is that I miss my old friends. Not that I don't like you guys! I do... but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We understand. It's hard to leave old friends,\" Jane said while she took of her pajamas and put on her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea remembered that they all swam together naked yesterday, so she didn't need to be ashamed if she pulled off her pajamas just to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you have us. Maybe your old friends can come visit,\" Emily said while she put on her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows? Maybe, but I don't think they'll come,\" Shea said while she put on her pants. Shea pulled her pants up as far as she could and noticed it was a bit harder to button them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Aunt Yenna washed it too hot to shrink it? No! That wasn't possible. Aunt Yenna didn't wash any of her clothes yet. This was just her second day here! Then she remembered the food from yesterday, the pizza, and the breakfast. All right, she gained a little, but it wasn't much. It didn't matter to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember what we planned yesterday? We would go explore the house?\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! I would like to see what's in here besides that swimming pool,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wonder how your aunt got all this!\" Sandy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Shea said while they walked downstairs. \"Maybe she was the girl of a gangster or perhaps she robbed a bank,\" Shea said jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe basement was huge! There was a room for the laundry, a pantry, and also a room that was part bathroom and the a wooden room! Emily's face lit up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a a sauna! In there, it's get very hot! It's kind of nice to just sweat for once,\" Emily said to her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, they saw a huge room full of stuff. There were arrows and bows, a home trainer, a table to play tennis, and also all kinds of balls with tennis rackets, bikes and all other kinds of junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This would be nice to play with some of this another day,\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily opened another door right by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here she keeps her wine,\" Emily said, laughing.

When she opened it up, Shea noticed it was a lady that was a little taller than her Aunt Yenna, but she wore glasses and had red hair past her shoulders. She was skinny and lean, but she resembled Jane. It was then that Shea realized that it was Jane's mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mom! What are you doing here right now?\" Jane asked her Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to pick you and Sandy up.

Most people who live here were born here. I was born here just like my parents and Jane and her parents. Everyone here knows each other. We also see the others at parties, walking through the town, at the beach, and at school or work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm a bit of an outsider,\" Shea said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Of course not! Some would see it that way, but most will like you. After all, you have me, Jane, and Sandy at your side! So I think most others will accept you very fast. Sure, you always have some kids that won't be your friend, but you can't become friends with everyone,\" Emily said to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad that's... Hey! This is Nick.

Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, remember we saw a sauna? I would like to go in there. I once went in it, but that was long ago. But normally, you go in there naked. But you have nothing to be ashamed of! You have a nice body, cute face and nice boobs. Guess it runs in the family. Just look at your aunt!

As she unchanged, she looked over at Emily. Emily was flat in the chest, but her belly curved out a little bit from breakfast earlier. She realized that Emily did have a hot body still. After observing, Shea went to a bench and sat herself down as her belly scrunched up. Emily looked over at the naked Shea, smiling at what she saw.

Yenna gathered together a gargantuan feast of crisps, sandwiches, pancakes, sweets and cola. The girls eyes widened st the site of all of this food. As soon as Yenna was back downstairs the two of them were stuffing there already distended bellies full of snack food and cola. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finished it was lunch time and Yenna called them down to a massive feast of spaghetti Bolognese and garlic bread. They had another feast after lunch of the same magnitude as the previous one and when they had finished their bellies had looked like they were both nine Months pregnant and they could barely stand. So when Yenna called them for Dinner they had to drag themselves along using the skirting boards. And bum slide down the stairs and finnaly waddle to the table. Yenna laid out two trays of creamy max and cheese for both of them and left them to devour the fattening cheese.</span></div></div>",

I'm sure your breasts will grow when you get older. In my old neighborhood, almost none of the girls in my class had boobs. They were all kind of jealous! I'm sure you'll get them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not only that,\" Emily said. \"It's true that I want to have boobs, but I mean just look at me! I look like a surfboard. I look like a skeleton. You can count my ribs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you're too thin? Some people would kill to be so thin like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Alicia Silverstone is jealous of my body,\" Emily said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea's eyes suddenly saw a timer. Shea set it for a maximum of fifteen minutes. She turned it and saw how the knob slowly turned. It was very warm in the sauna by now. Shea understood why you had to be naked in here. It was so warm in here, with clothes, you would fry to death. Shea swiped her hand over her forehead where already the first sweat glands appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're starting to sweat,\" Emily said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too,\" Shea said with a giggle. \"But why are you not happy? I mean, you're thin, but that's not bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would rather be super fat. I think fat looks sexy,\" Emily said to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Shea asked as she rubbed her own belly that was wet from her sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would really want to be a bit fatter, but I don't want to do it alone. Would you gain with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea didn't know what to do. Her friend wanted to gain. That was strange already, but she wanted to do it with her. Not that Shea cared so much about her body since Shea never used to be thin or slender, but she never was fat. Shea didn't mind if she gained a few pounds, but gaining on purpose was something different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there maybe another reason why you want to gain? I mean, a lot of people try to lose weight. So why do you want to gain? I think some people even think fat is... ugly. Not that I think fat is ugly, but many other people...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the modern world, maybe. But we're in a small village. Fat woman once were beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea remembered some of those old paintings. But gaining? At the other hand, why not? Her aunt made delicious food. She would probably gain anyway. She looked at her belly that was now dripping from sweat. Her entire body was wet from her sweat. She started thinking and then her eyes stared at the timer. There was a bit less than five minutes in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you gain with me? Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess since Aunt Yenna cooks so deliciously, I will gain a bit anyway. So, I guess I can gain a little!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily hugged Shea, letting their sweat mix all over their naked bodies. Both started talking about their hobbies, but after about nine minutes, Shea said, \"I'm getting out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too,\" Emily said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth took their clothes and went out. Outside were two towels and showers next to each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we first need to wash ourselves with cold water. At least that's what we did at that other place,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\nWhile they washed their bodies, Shea wondered if she did the right thing agreeing with Emily about gaining weight.</span></div></div>",

She looked up at the girls and smiled at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Just in time for lunch! Are you girls ready to eat?\" Aunt Yenna asked the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we are! Hey, is there any way we can eat this stuff in my room? I want to get some things done with Emily's help,\" Shea said with a smile to Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing! Here! You girls take some of the food up and I'll bring up the rest later,\" Aunt Yenna said to the girls, motioning to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Aunt Yenna!\" Shea said to her Aunt as the girls grabbed plates of food and headed up to Shea's room. The girls went up and down the stairs a few times to get more of the food and bring it up to Shea's room. When they got up into Shea's room finally, they shut the door and put all of the food on Shea's huge bed. Emily got Shea's hat from off the bed post and slipped it on as both of the girls sat on the bed. They had enough food to feed at least two families in one sitting! There were plates full of greasy chicken along with some hambugers, greasy fries, two chocolate cakes, tacos, nachos, and even deep fried ice cream. Both girls licked their lips in greed as they were ready to stuff themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Shea grabbed two chicken legs and licked the grease off of them before stuffing them into her mouth and taking the meat off the bones. Emily grabbed the plate full of tacos and shoved them down her gullet one by one as the taste of the food made her moan. After they finished their first plates, Shea and Emily eached grabbed one cake and started eating it with their hands. Both girls were in heaven as they were eating themselves fat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shea slowly opened her eyes. It was the first night she slept in her own bed and she slept wonderfully. Yesterday after lunch, she and Emily watched some T.V. Later on, Jane and Sandy came over and stayed for dinner. They had a huge lunch earlier and still, they ate all of their dinner until the last crumb was gone. They didn't tell Jane and Sandy about their plan. Shea herself still wasn't sure about the plan. Since it was still warm, she decided to sleep naked. She became a lot more used to it after doing it several times with her friends and she knew she never would have done that with her old friends. Shea wondered if they would have done it if they moved here. Maybe her friend, Kelly, but the others probably wouldn't. Suddenly, someone knocked on her door. Shea covered herself with her blanket and said: \"Come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Shea! Did you sleep well?\" Aunt Yenna asked while she carried two big boxes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, Aunt Yenna. What are those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Yenna put the boxes down and smiled at Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are old clothes of mine from when I was about your age. They don't fit me anymore,\" Aunt Yenna said with a grin and clapped on her belly. \"But maybe they will fit you! I would like it if you try some of these clothes on when you have time,\" Aunt Yenna said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! I have all vacation. That's more than enough time!\" Shea said to her Aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I have breakfast ready. So get dressed and come down!\" Aunt Yenna said as she closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea jumped out of bed and grabbed some clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Breakfast! It's the most important meal of the day!\" Shea said to herself. Shea never cared so much about breakfast before! Sometimes, she even skipped breakfast and bought something in the supermarket on her way to school. But with Aunt Yenna, breakfast was really delicious. Quickly, she put some clothes on. Shea was wearing a fire red sleeveless T-shirt and some short cut off jeans. Shea looked sadly at her winter hat, but it was way too warm for it today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope the summer is over fast!\" Shea said to herself. Shea ran downstairs and saw the table was full with food. Shea didn't understand why her Aunt cooked so much and also didn't understand how everything ended up in her stomach. She knew she had put on a few pounds. Her cut off jeans were pushing into her belly flesh. This made her think again about what she said to Emily. Shea still wasn't sure about the plan. However, with all this food, she would end up gaining weight anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, Shea?\" Aunt Yenna asked as she noticed Shea thinking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Emily asked me to gain weight with her. I wasn't sure about it, but some how, I said yes. But now, I'm not sure about it. She said she thinks fat looks sexy and beautiful. Who likes fat or a fat girl in general? No one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, excuse me, Shea, but you're very wrong about that. A lot of people like fat woman. They like woman with curves. Some people like something they can hold on to without feeling ribs,\" Aunt Yenna said as she grabbed Shea's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that makes sense when you put it that way,\" Shea mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It goes further! You even have people who want to fatten up a woman so she gets fat. Some woman see no problem in gaining weight and want to do it for their partner, for themselves, or both. Some couples also encourage the other to gain more. Some woman try to gain weight on purpose! So, a lot of people do like fat woman and think they're sexy and beautiful. Look it up on the Internet. You do have a computer, do you?\" Aunt Yenna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I do have a computer. Thanks, Aunt Yenna!\" Shea said to her Aunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also have an old music center if you want to have that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't nee... A music center. Hm... good idea! Then, I can listen to some music and use it like an alarm clock when I need to get up early for school again when it starts!\" Shea said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I will get it after breakfast. But look it up on the Internet! The people that fatten up woman are called feeders!\"<br>\r\n     <br>\r\nSuddenly, Shea remembered there also was another reason to use her computer. She wanted to go to the chat box to chat with Kelly, an old friend from her old neighborhood.  </span></div></div>",

Luckily enough, she saw her friend was on! After noticing, Shea began to type to her friend, wondering what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! How are you doing, Kelly? I miss you!\" Shea typed to her friend. After typing, Shea grabbed more of the food in front of her and kept on eating. Kelly immediately replied to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHEA! I miss you so much! I am doing well, but I really do miss you!\" Kelly wrote to Shea. Shea was very happy that she was talking to her old friend. The conversation continued like this for a little while as Shea continued to eat her breakfast at the same time. As the conversation continued, Shea began to wonder what happened to her crush, Nick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how is Nick doing, Kelly? Does he miss me? I do miss him,\" Shea typed to Kelly. After typing, Shea continued to eat while Kelly took her time to type back to Shea. After five minutes, Shea read Kelly's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Shea, to be honest, I think he has changed. I mean, he's gained some weight now. He has gained at least a few pounds since you left and his hair is longer. Do you remember Evaline? She has been hitting on Nick since you left. I believe that Nick may be falling for it. I'm sorry, Shea, but I think he is moving on now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea couldn't believe what she heard. Gaining weight and a new girl? She was in shock. Tears started to gather in her eyes as she became saddened at the thought of Nick moving on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. It's ok. Hey, can I talk to you later? I need to go do something. I miss you! I'll talk to you soon,\" Shea typed to Kelly quickly. Kelly also said good bye as Shea signed off. She had tears running down her face. Aunt Yenna was in the other room cleaning something. Shea looked at the food in front of her and started to shovel it down her gullet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the food was gone, Shea slowly started to calm down. It wasn't that she didn't see it coming. With her gone, why wouldn't Nick find a new girl? He was very handsome. But at the same time, why did the girl have to be Evaline? Shea couldn't stand Evaline and Evaline couldn't stand her either. She just need to accept the fact that she lost Nick. On the other hand, she could always try to get Leonard. She then remembered what Aunt Yenna said about feeders. She started to look feeders up on the internet, which made her busy for hours. Shea was surprised at how many sites there were about fattening a woman or a man. However, it were mostly woman. It seemed many people liked a fat person and there were also enough fat people who wanted to get fatter. Sometimes, it was because their partner wanted it, they both wanted it, or for the girl herself. There were many people visiting the websites. Fine, it wasn't half of the U.S.A, but still, a lot of people liked fat people or liked becoming fat. Fat was warm, soft, and you could eat what you wanted without counting calories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Shea also tried some of the clothes Aunt Yenna had. They were a bit wide to Shea's liking. Her Aunt seemed to be a fat girl when she was Shea's age, but if she was going to gain weight, some bigger clothes would come in handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Emily was coming over again for a sleepover. Both were in Shea's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I talked to Kelly today. Well, not really talking, but talked on the chat box,\" Shea said to Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Kelly?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of my best friends since kindergarden. Here's a picture of her. I chatted with her today,\" Shea said as she handed Emily a photo. Her voice got sad when she mumbled: \"I asked her about Nick and it seems that he has found a new girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How dares he! Hey, cheer up, Shea. There are a lot of cute boys here, too! With a body like yours, you can get almost any boy! You look really good and if boobs really are guy magnets, like my sister says, you can easily find someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will they also be attracted by some extra pounds of mine?\" Shea asked with a jolly laugh.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so. It's hard to gain for me since my mother likes healthy food,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Aunt Yenna does not really care about what kind of food I eat and all her food tastes so good. I can't believe how much I ate at dinner!\" Shea said as she felt her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Me neither! Even after that dinner, we are both still up here with a bowl of popcorn,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls had a big bowl of popcorn, which they were eating while talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can ask Kelly to come over for a few days. I'm sure you'd like her. Are you planning to tell Sandy and Jane about our plan to gain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think we tell them. Would they want to join? It would be fun to gain together,\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. I don't think Sandy really care about her weight. But Jane...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I wonder if she wants to do that. She dares anything of course... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I know how you can let Jane join! Just dare her to gain weight! She loves a challenge, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Jane needs to take it! She can't say no to a challenge!\" Emily said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, a lot of people like fat girls. There are even people who fatten up girls since they think it's more attractive. Also, some women want to gain weight just like we do!\" Shea said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea felt really confident about the gaining weight part after seeing all those sites. Besides, with the cooking of Aunt Yenna, she would gain and without a doubt, she might as well enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I wonder how your Aunt could afford all this. Maybe she was a gangster! Did she rob a bank like in ocean's eleven?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she did it, I hope she did it better than in ocean's eleven. They were such idiots! Who would glue themselves to a bomb? But, I doubt my Aunt did that. She's pretty young. I don't think she did that at her age,\" Shea said to Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's always the last ones you'd expect,\" Emily said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will ask her once. I'm also curious,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's pretty cool for an Aunt. I mean, you have a huge room with a T.V, music center, and now, she also gave you a lot of her clothes. Some of them are really cool! I never get this much from my Aunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm going to live here,\" Shea said. \"At least for seven years. Then I will be eighteen and I could be able to go live on my own. But, maybe I would stay a bit longer here. I don't know. I'll think about that when it's time,\" Shea said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suppose your Aunt passes away. She would probably leave this all to you,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but I hope she stays alive. Her food tastes much too well to miss it!\" She said as she rubbed her round belly that was getting rounder each day.  <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

It was seven in the morning, which was exceptionally early for Shea. She felt something on her as she started to wake up. She moved her head and noticed that what she was feeling was Emily. They both decided to sleep in Shea's bed together and somehow, Emily ended up grabbing onto Shea and cuddled with her while they slept. Shea laughed at this since she knew it was not intentional. As she laughed, she felt something different. She turned her head and look down by her butt. Emily was pressed up against her, but instead, Emily had a small belly pressing up against Shea's back. Shea was surprised to see that Emily was already showing results. She wondered if Emily would eventually become as fat as her. Maybe that would help her develop boobs, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Shea looked down at her belly and started to touch it. Over night, she had put on a few more pounds. Shea was surprised to see that her shirt was becoming more tighter each day and night. Her belly was bumping out like a woman with a pregnant belly. Shea was wondering if soon, her belly would peak out of her shirt. She was starting to get excited at the thought of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and quietly, Shea got herself up and out of bed. Shea wanted to let Emily sleep for a little bit longer since she wanted to make plans for the two today. Shea wanted to hang with Sandy and Jane later, too. But first, she wanted some more private time with Emily and their bellies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea looked over at her bed post and saw her hat. She knew it was warmer outside, but she wanted to wear it for once. After some thought, she put it on on top of her head and looked at herself in the mirror. She admired it for a little bit and smiled to herself. She really did miss it. After what happened with Nick, she was in the \"I don't care how I look\" mood. Shea decided that she would wear it for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that moment, Shea decided to... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aunt Yenna was probably making breakfast. She decided to wait with breakfast until Emily woke up. She looked around and noticed she had jars full of candy. At the least, the candy that wasn't eaten yet. There was still plenty of candy left. Shea grabbed a few jars and placed them in front of her and went sitting against the bed and spread her legs and looked at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought of becoming fat... and now... I want to become fat. It's a strange world!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe knew she did gain everyday thanks to Aunt Yenna's delicious, fattening food and the quantity of the food she made. If she wasn't trying to gain, she would probably have been angry at Aunt Yenna because of the food fattening her up. On the other hand, that wouldn't have been fair. Aunt Yenna didn't fatten her up, but just gave her a lot of fattening food. She was never forced to eat it. Shea started to put candy in her mouth, chewing on it when those thoughts went through her head. She did have so much fun here. Emily, Jane and Sandy weren't anything like her old friends, but she liked them very much. Without them, she maybe wouldn't be so happy to live here even if her Aunt did have a great house and stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a lucky girl that my parents dropped me off here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea must admit that she hated her parents. Sure, she was lucky here, but she and her parents couldn't know that. They wanted to do their work and couldn't use a child. So they just put her somewhere so she can't go. That's how she felt. Shea felt like a-throw-away-child. Sure, her parents promised to visit her every now and then, but still, she would be stuck here. She hardly knew Aunt Yenna. Sure, she was very nice, but for all she knew, her Aunt could be kind of mean. You couldn't do that. Just put your child somewhere because you couldn't take care of them.<br>\r\nShea suddenly noticed the jars were empty.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I eat all of them? Wow! I guess not only my body is growing, but so is my appetite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea grabbed a few other jars and went on the Internet, looking on some sites until she heard moaning sounds from Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise  and shine, Emily. How have you slept?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I slept fine, thank you. Shea, why do you wear that hat? I mean, it's summer and that one is for the winter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like winter clothes. Since I know Nick left me for that other slut, I decided to go for the: \"Don't care how I look\" look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it will help you much. Is that new girl really such a slut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I know her and she knew me.  We couldn't stand each other even before we got interested in guys. She maybe hated me because of Nick, but that can't be it since she hated me since kindergarten. Why did it have to be her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the bright side, Shea. You don't have to be angry at your friends or else one of them would maybe get a relation with Nick. Then you would hate him and your former friend. And now you're single. You can look for any boy you like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I could try to get a new boy, but not just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily went sitting up straight and dropped the blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! My belly got a bit bigger! I mean, sure, I may not be fat or chubby, but it's a start!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How fat do you want to get anyway?\" Shea said. \"So fat that your belly peaks out between your pants and shirt? So fat that some chairs break under your weight? So fat that you belly drags over the ground when you're on you hands and knees? So fat you won't fit through the door? How about so fat you wan't be able to walk anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really know. I always thought fat woman looked great. You know I once saw something on T.V about a bar for fat people. I saw a woman and she was so very fat! She looked almost spherical! I loved it! I wanted to look like that! The next moment, my mother turned off the T.V anf she said she found it disgusting. By that, she meant fat people,\" Emily said with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your mother hates it, it's going to be hard for you if you want to really get fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I worry about it then. Besides, my mother wants to meet you! I mean, I've been to your house several times. I liked it, don't get me wrong! But my mother wants to see you. She wants you to stay over at my house,\" Emily told Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Sounds like fun. Maybe I can come today. I have to ask Aunt Yenna, of course, but if she's fine with it, then yes,\" Shea said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't worry too much about it. I think your Aunt is fine with anything! Or maybe it's because we have vacation,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking about my aunt... I think breakfast is ready. Lets go!\"     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Immediately, they could smell the aroma of the delicious food made by Aunt Yenna. Aunt Yenna, who was at the stove, turned around and smiled at the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, you two! Breakfast is ready! Go on and dig in!\" She said with a warm gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls didn't take that for advantage. Immediately, the girls began to eat the food on the table. They grabbed everything from pancakes to bacon to chocolate covered doughnuts, and even grabbed cheesecake. Emily, surprisingly, grabbed more food than Shea since she never really got to pig out at her own home. She found this as an oppertunity. Aunt Yenna looked at the girls with a smile as she set a plate of eggs onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I'm glad you girls like my cooking! It makes me feel great. Continue digging in. And Shea, why are you wearing that hat?\" Aunt Yenna asked with a questionable expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just felt like wearing it today. I love this type of clothing. I was just in one of those random moods,\" Shea said as she pulled her hat down farther on her head. Shea didn't want to tell her Aunt about the boy situation yet since she still felt hurt about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ok then. Keep on eating, girls!\" Aunt Yenna said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that they did. The girls didn't stop eating the food. They rarely took breaks and made sure that the food was eaten down to the last crumbs. This went on for a half hour until finally, the girls were sitting back in their chairs, moaning sounds of pleasure from being so full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best..... meal....  *burp*.... ever!\" Emily said with chocolate across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... *burp*.... agree!\" Shea said with sticky syrup on her face. Both girls looked down at their bellies to see any results. They were liking what they were seeing since their bellies were feeling hard and stuffed to their limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should eat more today! What do you want to do after we get ready?\" Emily asked. Shea thought about it and decided to....</span></div></div>",

It's not so big! I mean, I know everyone that lives here and everyone knows me,\" Emily told Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, that does make me feel like I'm a grape in a box of cherries. I don't know anyone here except you, Jane, Rapunzel and Aunt Yenna..... Well, maybe you can consider Kelly and Leonard. But I hardly know Leonard. I only saw him once and I don't want to know Kelly!\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't worry. In a few months, everyone here will know you and you will know most others. You're the niece of someone who lives here and you have some friends here. Also, you're pretty nice, too. So I think most people will accept you. Of course, there's always a few who won't like you like Kelly, but don't mind about her,\" Emily said to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. That does make me feel better. But it's going to get hard to know everyone,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's easier than you think. Besides, with this warm weather, there is a big chance they're going to have a neighborhood party. And you're also invited!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls walked upstairs to get dressed. Shea thought this was the right time to take some of her Aunt's old clothes since her clothes were getting pretty tight on herself. A few minutes later, the girls walked out. Emily was in a summer dress and Shea was in some old cut of jeans and a dark blue T-shirt while still wearing her hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, our village is not that impressive,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I want to see the stores!\" Shea said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's this street here,\" Emily said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome cars were driving on the street and Shea saw there were stores in the whole street. A butcher's deli, a book store, a bakery, and a lot of other stores were all in the same street easily located on a row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know it's not much. For teenagers, it's very boring. There's no party places or cinema. Teenagers mostly go to the next town. It's not that far from here,\" Emily said to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked further through the street. Located there was a bar, a toy store, a jewelry store, a small super market, and a candy store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if you really want to shop, you need to go into the other town. We go there every now and then. I'm sure you can come with us sometime. I know our stores aren't much, but come here,\" Emily told Shea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled Shea down the street. Here, you could see the entire sea and the beach. But Emily walked further into the forest nearby. Shea didn't have much of a forest by her old place and this was a huge forest. Shea looked around curiously. There were huge trees an bushes around. Shea kept on thinking that this was a great place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's always nice to walk through the forest. You also have Mr. James in here. He's an old man who lives in the middle of the forest on his own, but he's very friendly to most people,\" Emily said to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there many animals here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. There's a lot of birds, foxes, deers, a few wild hogs, badgers, vipers, weasels, and some people told me they saw some wolves, but there is no proof. Some boys said they once saw a puma, but that was just a prank!\" Emily said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they walked further, Shea heard voices. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Who is there?\" Shea asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can better see for yourself,\" Emily said while they walked further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea put on big eyes. She saw that there was small houses built into the trees. But these were not just tree houses, but many tree houses connected to each other by stairs and bridges. It looked like a small village in the trees. Some houses were small and others were big. A lot of boys and some girls were playing in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People built this a few years ago. Every year, we play in it. But the problem is sometimes there comes two groups. One group has it and another group wants to take it. Sometimes, it's a war with water guns and balloons. The trouble is that some wars go a bit far sometimes. Want to see it?\"   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, let's keep on going then!\" Emily motioned to Shea as they continued to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the girls started walking on the trail until they were just getting out of the woods. Shea was looking around, loving the new view that she was seeing. She never had huge forests in her old town and to see forests like this surprised her. All of a sudden, she felt herself hit something almost like she had bumped into somebody. She turned her head around and looked in front of herself. Shea began to bulge her eyes out as she realized what she had hit. The thing, or actually, the person, was Leonard. Shea was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry about that! I wasn't paying attention to where I was going,\" Leonard said with a smile to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's.... it's okay. I wasn't looking either,\" Shea said as she started to turn red.

Do you wear that a lot?\" Leonard asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I haven't really lately, but I just might now since you said that,\" Shea said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad I made your day,\" Leonard replied with a bigger grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like... your eyes,\" Shea said as Emily started to laugh. Shea thought to herself after that, thinking of why she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I guess no one has ever said that,\" Leonard said with a giggle. Then he said, \"Do you want to hang out sometime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like fun. Sure,\" Shea said, feeling like fireworks just went off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I guess I'll call you later? You live at Miss Yenna's house, right?\" Leonard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Or you can just come by. Either way,\" Shea smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Well, see you later,\" Leonard said as he walked away with a grin. Shea immediately turned to Emily as both girls screamed at each other in a funny way. Shea possibly had a date coming on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shea, he was totally checking out your belly!\" Emily said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think so? I mean, I saw him look down a few times. But, I don't know,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think he was. Maybe we should go to your Aunt's house and eat some more. Or we can look for a restaurant around the neighborhood. All we need to do is put some more pounds on you and I,\" Emily said with a grin. Shea liked this idea and decided to....</span></div></div>",

I never thought that would happen!\" Shea said while the two girls entered the house.

I'm so happy I finally have someone that can appreciate my cooking. I lived alone for way too long. I always liked cooking, but there was never someone to tell me how it tasted,\" Aunt Yenna said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to stuff her face with the food.

If I would be around your age, I would really like him. But he never goes out with anyone from what I hear,\" Aunt Yenna said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until now that is!\" Emily said with loud voice. \"He asked Shea out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? He... he asked you out? You're pretty, don't get me wrong. But he never asked any girl out. He also never wanted to go out with any girl... and he hardly knows you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He liked her belly! He was totally checking out her belly. So she wants it to get a bit bigger before their date. Man, I must admit I'm a bit jealous of you! You have everything! A great house, a swimming pool, a sauna, a nice chest, and now a date with Leonard! Wait until Victoria hears about this! She will be so jealous! She's tried so many times to get Leonard to date her, but he never said yes. She even offered him money. He got angry that she thought she needed to pay him like if he was a pimp,\" Emily said as she also began to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he doesn't like her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He hates her. But she still wants him since he's so cool. If she hears you got him without even trying while she did try to get him for years, She won't like that,\" Emily said as she bit into some cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if she likes it or not. I just heard my crush dumped me and ran off with a total slut. So I'm single. Now, a really cool and cute boy asked me out. I should be crazy not to go out with him,\" Shea said as she bit into some greasy chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. No one will blame you since you're going out with Leonard. Well, no one except for Victoria. The others can't blame you since they would have done exactly the same thing,\" Emily said after finishing some of the cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea smiled. She couldn't believe how much luck she had. After her Aunt, a lot of cool stuff, a group of new friends, and even a new crush. And this was a crush who seemed to like her big belly while she tried to make it bigger while her Aunt cooked fattening dinner.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some people have all the luck in the world. If you weren't so nice, I would hate you!\" Emily said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea smiled at her. She was glad she had three friends. She wondered how the other girls at school would react if she told them she was going on a date with Leonard. At her old school, they already were jealous of her early developing chest. Now, she also had some what of a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea swallowed the last crumb and looked at Emily. </span></div></div>",

Are you sure?\" Emily asked as she looked down at her body, seeing that her stomach was buldging out some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. How about this: We eat some more food, weigh ourselves, play in my room for a little bit, and then we can go and hang out with Sandy and Jane. Are you fine with that?\" Shea asked with a keen look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. That does sound pretty fun. But what can we eat right now?\" Emily asked. There was no more food on the table at the moment, which made her wonder what else they could eat. Shea stood up and headed toward the refrigerator and opened up. Emily opened up her mouth and saw that Aunt Yenna had cooked two chocolate cakes, more chicken, some casserole, four big eclairs, and even some chocolate pudding. Shea took this all out and put it on the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can eat all of this. Aunt Yenna always makes some extra food,\" Shea said as she and Emily rubbed their lips in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we shouldn't let this go to waste. Let's eat!\" Emily said as the girls sat down and began to dig into the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing that Aunt Yenna was in another room at the moment. The reason for that is because the girls were enjoying eating the food so much, they were letting out little moans here and there from the taste and the slight fullness they were feeling. Emily kept on looking at Shea up and down. Shea's belly was looking a lot bigger as some of it was poking out, making Emily smile. Emily wasn't that far yet, but her belly was definitely the biggest part of her body. Emily then looked at Shea's hat, which she found weird but cool looking. She decided that later on, she was going to ask if she could get one just like Shea has since they were best friends now with their looks heading on the same path. This made Emily smile even more. She never had this close of a best friend before and Shea was a great best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea kept on eating and looking down at her growing belly. She smiled as she began to think about her fat and Leonard. She realized that the reasons why she was becoming fatter now is because Emily asked her to, Leonard loved it so much, and because she realized now that she wanted to be a fat girl. Now, it was coming true along with her fatter friend, Emily. Life was perfect for her at this moment. She smiled and rubbed herself as she crammed an eclair in her mouth along with Emily, making both girls moan.</span></div></div>",

She swallowed it and opened her mouth and let out a soft girlie belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That tasted good,\" Shea said with a grin.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Not all the chocolate went in your belly, Shea. Most of it is on your face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who's talking!\" Shea shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girl's faces were covered with chocolate stains because of the chocolate cake and pudding. Both girls started to laugh and get up and walked to the sink to wash their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now we weigh ourselves, right?\" Emily said. \"I wonder how much I gained!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Follow me. The scale is in the bathroom,\" Shea said to Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls were curious about how much they gained, but slowly waddled since they were full from all the food. Shea walked in first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should stand naked on the scale or else we also have the weight of our clothes on us,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Why not? We were naked in the swimming pool and in the sauna. One time more or less doesn't matter!\" Emily said and pulled off her sweater and the rest of her clothes along with Shea. Both girls began observing their naked bodies and noticed how much bigger they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see. Last time, I weighed 95 pounds the day before I came here. Now I am....\" Shea said as she looked down on the scale. She curiously read the numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"114 pounds!\" Emily screamed. You gained... 19 pounds in just a few days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess Aunt Yenna's food is very fattening and since she cooked so much I also ate a lot. Now you weigh yourself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! My old weight was... about 77 pounds. Man! I'm such a lightweight,\" Emily said as she stepped on the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"90 pounds! Well that's still a gain of 13 pounds. It's a good start!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's still even less than your starting weight,\" Emily mumbled sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! It's not so bad. Let's go to my room,\" Shea said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I first put my clothes back on?\" Emily asked while she put on her underwear. Shea was starting to do the same as she looked up and down her friend's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well soooooooooorry,\" Shea said as she let the word sorry sound longer and said it on a bored tone to show it didn't really matter to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just a bit upset I hardly gained. I hoped it was a bit higher!\" Emily said to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem. You will soon gain more,\" Shea said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walked to Shea's room. Shea still had a bit trouble to believe this was her room. It was so much better than her old room with all of the cool extra stuff she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So with what did you play with in your old neighborhood? Please don't say barbie. I hate those fashion dolls,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my grandparents once gave me a barbie when I was five. I cut off her hair and her hands, I covered her with cut marks and I finally boiled her in a pan with water. I wondered what would happen. Seems they don't survive that. So you understand I don't really like barbie dolls. I never got another one. Not that I wanted one,\" Shea said. Emily grinned.</span></div></div>",

That meal left me full anyway,\" Shea said as both of the girls started to lay down on Shea's bed. They then got some magazines and looked through at the girls in the magazines. None of them were fat. They wished that society would be more accepting to fat, but that wasn't the case. They flipped through magazines and chatted to each other more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shea, your life is perfect! I mean, you have an Aunt who always feeds you and lets you do anything you want, you live in a mansion, and you get the guy of any girl's dream! You are so lucky,\" Emily said to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's all thanks to my parents for dropping me off here. I like it here although I thought I wouldn't at first. I am very thankful for all of this,\" Shea said to Emily in a non-cocky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely! I wish I was as lucky as you, especially with gaining weight. I really want to be a lot fatter,\" Emily said with a sigh as she continued to flip through the magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Emily. You will get fatter. It will just take time,\" Shea said as she tried to make Emily feel more happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess. I'll be right back. I got to use the bathroom,\" Emily said as she got off the bed and started to head for the bathroom. When she got out, Shea started to think to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to bring up her confidence. She needs to stop acting like that. But how?\" Shea thought. She started to look around her room as she tried to think of what to do. After a few moments of looking around, Shea got a wicked idea. She saw that she had many candy jars in her room that Aunt Yenna refilled for her. She came up with the idea that she could stuff Emily with the candy and try to make her gain more weight. It would be painful for Emily, but it would make Emily more happy in the long run. Shea grabbed all the candy quickly and put the jars on the table next to her bed. When she did this, Emily entered back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, Shea?\" Emily wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing really. Just checking out my room,\" Shea said as she stood in the middle of the room. She saw Emily walk back to Shea's bed as she layed back down on the bed and looked at the magazine. Now, Shea was going to put her plan into action. Shea walked over to the bed and looked at Emily with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you like candy, Emily. You will get a lot of it!\" Shea yelled as she jumped right on top of Emily. Emily flinched with panic as her friend bounced right on top of her so she couldn't move off of the bed. Shea's fatter legs were on both sides of Emily as Shea sat on her to hold her down. Emily could feel the extra weight on Shea's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Emily yelled to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm helping you get fatter. See all of this candy right here? I am going to stuff you with it. It will help you,\" Shea said with a friendly grin. Immediately, Shea grabbed a jar of candy and started to stuff it into Emily's throat. Emily was shocked by this, but chewed on the candy and eventually swallowed it as Shea continued to stuff her. Although this was different, Emily didn't mind this at all since all she wanted to do was gain weight. Shea smiled as all that her friend could do was eat. Emily moaned as the candy went down her throat and into her stomach, which Shea was on. She smiled back at Shea as she started to realize that she was having some fun with this like Shea was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

All she had to do was just open her mouth, chew and swallow. It was so much fun this way. She wondered if Shea would like to do this again and if she would like this herself. <i>Then maybe Leonard can do it for her </i>, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here comes some more candy,\" Shea said and stuffed more candy in Emily's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea liked this too. It was fun to help her friend just by feeding her candy. She decided it could't harm her since Emily was still thinner than her before she even start gaining. It was no problem to help her catch up a little.<br>\r\nEmily liked this but she started to get full but knew that if she ate a bit more than she was used to, her stomach would slowly stretch and be able to hold more food. So she kept eating and eating. Her belly started to hurt, but she kept eating and eating until suddenly the feeding stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you stop?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm out of candy. Do you know how much you've eaten?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked up and suddenly saw all the empty jars and suddenly noticed how much her belly hurt. She moaned and put a hand over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I know it's painful but if you really want to gain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no! It's fine. Really. It does hurt, but I know it will help me to gain. Because of that, I don''t mind. Not even if it hurts. Besides, I didn't want you to stop. I liked it. I still don't really understand why,\" Emily said as she tried to think to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? I'm kind of happy now I moved. Life here is more exciting. I would have never done something like skinny dipping or gaining weight with one of my friends in my old neighborhood. I did it for you, but now I like it,\" Shea said as she started to feel her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That happens sometimes. Karen, she's a girl in our school you will meet soon, her mother always taught her to take care of flowers. She once said to me in kindergarten she didn't like flowers. Two years later, her mother died, but she kept taking care of flowers. I asked her why she did it. It seemed she started to like to take care of flowers,\" Emily said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karen? I would like to meet her,\" Shea told Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is the sweetest thing you've ever seen. She very short. She's about a head shorter than you. She's very thin and has shiny, long black hair, light blue eyes, and a smile that looks like her teeth are made of pearls. She's very sweet, helpful, and always is ready to help you. I'm sure you will like her. You'll mostly find her in a garden,\" Emily told Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the phone rang and Shea ran over to it and picked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? This is Shea,\" Shea said right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Shea. It's Leonard. How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, thank you. How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm fine. So what do you want to do for our date?\" Leonard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I would like to see the village a bit more,\" Shea said to Leonard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't we have a picnic in the park and after that, we can walk through the village tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh sure... sure. I think I can. I have to ask my Aunt, but I think I can come,\" Shea told Leonard with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Then I'll come and get you at eleven. Is that fine?\" Leonard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great. See you then!\" Shea said with the biggest grin ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hung up and she and Emily both started to scream like they were at a music concert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a date! You have a date! You have a date with Leonard!\" Emily said in a happy tone to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only a picnic,\" Shea said, although she couldn't stop grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a picnic? That's closer than any girl has ever been to him. He's hardly been on dates with girls and now you have a date with him! Every other girl will be so jealous of you or won't believe you,\" Emily screamed to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea smiled the biggest grin.   <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

They were going to the beach to meet up with Sandy and Jane and since Emily forgot her swimsuit, Shea let her borrow one of her swimsuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it fit?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's pretty snug, but it will do.

Before you go, here's some money just in case if you guys get hungry. Have fun!\" Aunt Yenna said as she gave Shea and Emily forty dollars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Aunt Yenna, but isn't that a lot?\" Shea asked her Aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it might be, but if you guys get hungry, it will be useful! I'll see you later,\" Aunt Yenna said as the two girls started to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls started to walk to the beach, they talked to each other about clothing, weight, food, and how excited Shea was for her date. They eventually began to realize that the beach was on the other side of the village, which meant that food stops were along the way. As they realized this, an ice cream truck came from behind them. Immediately, they started to jump and wave like little children usually do. They started to feel hungry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I help you girls with?\" The lady in the ice cream truck asked the girls. Shea thought about what she wanted right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get two cotton candy ice creams for me and three for her?\" Shea asked the lady as she pointed at Emily. Emily looked at Shea in shock. She did like cotton candy ice cream, but Shea ordered more for her. Maybe Shea wanted Emily to get even fatter. Although this surprised her, Emily smiled at Shea as Shea smiled back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Shea,\" Emily told Shea as the girls got their ice cream and began to eat. As the girls began to eat the ice cream, they started to walk through the village, noticing some of the nearby food places. Both girls started to get even more hungry. Along with that, both of the girls wanted to stuff each other and fatten up each other more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Emily? Do you want to eat before we go to the beach? I think Sandy and Jane won't arrive for at least a half hour. We kind of left early. Do you want to eat?\" Shea asked as they both finished up eating their ice cream. Emily started to think about it. Emily knew that Shea wanted to fatten Emily up. Along with that, Emily wanted to do the same to Shea . But Emily started to wonder. Did she want to eat food right now? </span></div></div>",

Now we need to wait,\" Shea mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the two friends walked over to the beach, talking about hobbies and stuff they saw on T.V. <br>\r\nAt the beach, Shea spread out her towel and started to pull off her clothes until she only wore her bikini. She smiled when she saw how her belly stuck out more than it used to. She slowly rubbed it and liked the feeling. <br>\r\nShe grabbed a bottle of tanning oil and started to rub it on her skin. She didn't want to get sun burnt. She remembered she once got it when she was kind of young. I had been very painful. It definitely was not a pleasant moment. She looked at Emily and smiled. The stretchy stuff of her swimsuit clearly showed Emily's extra pounds, which made Shea extremely happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always like to go to the beach,\" Emily said. \"The fun part here is that there's so much beach but not so many people here. If you want to be with other people, you can go to some places where more people are at, but some like to be alone or in a small group and they pick out another place like this. There's more than enough room. There's also a beach that's especially for people who want to surf and a beach for people who want to train. But you also have some places that are hardly used like this one,\" Emily explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea smiled. She did like to be around friends rather than have hundreds of people around you. Besides, she hardly knew any other people around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Emily!\" A voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea looked up and saw a tall man who was about twenty. He had a light tan and long, blonde hair. He didn't wear a shirt so you could see his six pack. He also carried a surfboard under his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Andrew. Shea, this is Andrew. He's my cousin and also the best surfer in the village. Andrew, this is Shea. She's new here and already is a good friend of me,\" Emily said as she smiled to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, nice to meet you, but I got to go now. There's going to be some extreme waves. Really great waves to surf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he walked away, Shea grinned at Emily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool cousin you have there,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's all right. Every teenager girl tries to date him,\" Emily said while she rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand why,\" Shea laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like him?\" Emily asked surprised.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! At least not in that way. Sure, he looks nice of course, but he's way too old for me. Besides, I like Leonard,\" Shea said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Shea and Emily!\" Jane said followed by Sandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth spread out a towel and started to pull off their clothes until they only wore a swimsuit. Well, Sandy wore a swimsuit and Jane wore a bikini just like Shea and it looked perfect on her slender, muscled body. She looked like a super model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you four doing here?\" A voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea looked up and saw it was Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get lost, Victoria,\" Jane said sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? I have just as much of a right to be here as you three. Except that new one... has she any right to be here? Don't you need to be accepted first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she's accepted. Especially by four people,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four? I only see you three,\" Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she has a date with Leonard,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria's mouth fell open, but she soon recovered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lie. Why would he go out with you? A new one? Much cooler kids and more beautiful ones like me have asked him out, but were rejected. How can you reject this body and then like the body of someone like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's because you're a snobby, bossy, mean bitch,\" Shea suggested. \"But he did ask me out and if you don't believe me, that's fine with me. But he did,\" Shea said with a fat grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria angrily stamped away and Shea looked as she was smiling at her new friends.    </span></div></div>",

Shea is pretty nice, which is a lot better,\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not that fat,\" Sandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I am trying to gain. Or we are trying to gain. Emily and I. So if Leonard likes me fatter, that's only better,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so lucky,\" Jane said. \"I mean, no one can have that much luck. I mean, living here is already cool. It's a nice place that is near the sea and all. Plus you have a nice aunt who has everything and cooks delicious food, you have found three good friends and you have a date with the coolest boy in the entire village while no other girl ever was able to get a date with him. Many have tried, but no one succeed,\" Jane said to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I didn't even try. He asked me,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Sandy shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes way. He did. I saw it,\" Emily said. \"Strange, isn't it? Everyone tries and the one who didn't gets him,\" Emily continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if someone's got a date with Leonard, I'm glad it's Shea. Not Victoria or Demitri or an other mean girl,\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have some mean girls and boys in our village, Shea. Don't worry about them. We also have a lot nice boys and girls in our village. Almost every kid here goes to the same school. The reason is there's only one school here. So you will soon know everyone. But I know for sure a lot of girls will be very jealous that Leonard asked you out,\" Sandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some will be jealous and be mean. Others will be jealous, but are mature enough to be nice,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had that at my old school. Many girl were jealous when I already started to get boobs. My friends were also, but they stayed nice to me,\" Shea sighed. \"I really like you guys, but I miss my old friends at times,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We understand. But cheer up. Are you a fast swimmer? I would like to race you,\" Jane said. </span></div></div>",

The girls walked out of the water to get themselves dried off and ready. While they were drying themselves off, Shea looked over at Emily. She could see Emily's belly sticking out through the stretchy fabric of her swimsuit, making Shea smile. Emily looked over at Shea and smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look better?\" Emily asked Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely. It makes you look cuter,\" Shea said to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane and Sandy came over to them and put on their shoes, shirts, and put a towel over their bottoms. They started to walk to Shea's, although Emily and Shea were very tempted to stop by one of the restaurants and eat. Plus, they were feeling more tired than usual from walking, but they managed. After fifteen minutes, they had finally arrived at Shea's house. They all saw Aunt Yenna immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, girls! It's good to see you all. If you wait a little bit, I will have some dinner for you guys,\" Aunt Yenna said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Aunt Yenna! We will be up in my room,\" Shea said to her Aunt as the girls smiled and started to walk to Shea's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I mention I love your Aunt?\" Jane asked Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many times,\" Shea said with a smile. The girls sat down on Shea's for, but all of them, including Shea, realized there was a problem: they still had their swimsuits on and their clothes were now very wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess we should get out of these clothes,\" Shea said out loud, making the other girls think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we borrow your clothes?\" Jane asked as the other girls agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind, but are you sure you guys can fit into my clothes?\" Shea asked nervously as she looked at her bigger belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can try. I think we should be fine,\" Sandy said to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Fine with me. Emily, do you want to borrow my clothes, too?\" Shea asked Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please. I need to wash my clothes from last night,\" Emily replied to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Well let's go look in my closet for some clothes for us all. I have a lot. I will see if we can wash all of our stuff after we find clothes,\" Shea said to the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Shea! Well what kind of clothing do you have?\" Jane asked Shea as she patted Shea on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have a lot, but I have a lot of long sleeve clothes and hats because I like winter. I have some nice clothing. Let's check it out,\" Shea said as she started to direct the girls to her closet, which the girls didn't realize was one of the biggest closets they would ever see.</span></div></div>",

Aunt Yenna recently gave some of her old clothes to me. Some of them looked pretty cool. Well, after all, she also was a young girl once,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did she never married? I mean, she looks very pretty and has a nice body and cooks amazingly,\" Sandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Yenna thinks boys only want woman for sex,\" Shea said. \"I guess that's partly true. Some boys are that way. Once I was with a guy named Zack. We broke up. Reason was he wanted to have sex with me,\" Shea told the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You right for breaking up with him,\" Jane said. \"We're way too young for that. Before you know it, you get pregnant from him and then you have to deal with a baby at the age of twelve!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm eleven, Jane,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I now. But if you get pregnant, that kid grows in your belly for nine months and after nine months, you're twelve. But it would be very unhealthy for you and the child at your age!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, you're too young to raise a child. You're still a child yourself,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I had this much clothing!\" Sandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane looked at some clothes. Shea couldn't help but giggle. Sandy was pretty fat and the old clothes of Aunt Yenna would fit her, but Jane was so slender. Shea didn't know if there was anything that would fit her. Most clothes would be a bit wide on her. But after looking for some time, they found some clothes that fitted her nicely. Jane wore a red top with a star on it that showed her flat belly and some cut of jeans. It looked good on her, but when you looked as good as Jane, probably everything looked good to you. Sandy wore some short stretch pants and a light blue shirt with short sleeves. Emily took a a purple shirt with long sleeves and dark blue jeans. Shea wore some black pants and a red shirt with long sleeves. She thought a moment about wearing her winter hat, but decided not to and take a short break from it. Shea thought a moment about how easy it went. They just got dressed in front of each other and no one cared that they saw the other naked. It was a bit strange for her, but she found it nice. They didn't have to be ashamed. They were all four girls after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a knock on the door and Aunt Yenna walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, how nice. Some of you are wearing some of my old clothes. I wasn't sure my clothes would fit you. I used to be a bit fat when I was your age. Anyway, I wanted to tell you that dinner is ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Aunt Yenna. Say, could you wash the wet clothes from the beach please?\" Shea asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! No problem. You four can go eat and I'll take care of your clothes,\" Aunt Yenna said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Aunt Yenna!\" Shea yelled before the four girls ran down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy she's here,\" Aunt Yenna softly mumbled. \"I get very lonely being here all by myself. I'm glad I now have a young girl around here and some of her friends. It's a lot more pleasant,\" she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea and the other girls reached the kitchen and looked with big eyes at the table full of food. It was a lot of food for just four young girls. They were a bit surprised, but all four were hungry and took place at the table and started to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, this is a lot of food for just four girls,\" Sandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would almost think your Aunt is trying to fatten us up,\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe she's trying to fatten up me and Emily since the two of us want to gain, but I don't know why she would want to fatten up all of us,\" Shea suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if Leonard likes big bellies and we all get...\" Sandy started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you, Rapunzel!\" Emily screamed. \"Leonard is Shea's boyfriend. We're her friends. We don't steal her boyfriends. Even if he's very handsome. But be careful. Victoria might try to steal him from you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that. Leonard never showed any interest in her. I don't see why he would now especially since he has a much more nicer, cuter, prettier girl than Victoria. Besides, If you're right and he really likes big bellies, then Victoria would never get him. She hates fat people or becoming fat,\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but what would she do if she found out Leonard likes big bellies?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

All of the girls rubbed their bellies in bliss as they smiled at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shea, that was so good!\" Sandy said as she rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have never eaten so much in my life,\" Jane said as she burped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad you guys liked it,\" Aunt Yenna said as she walked into the room smiling.

I got a lot of it,\" Shea said as she grinned to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls then went upstairs into Shea's room and headed to the closet. As they entered, Shea grabbed two jars of candy, gave one to Emily and they started to get. Jane and Sandy looked at Shea's belly, noticing that part of it was sticking out of  Shea's red shirt. Emily wasn't as bad, but she was heading Shea's way. They all went over to the outerwear section of Shea's closet and started to grab stuff. Jane grabbed a green sweatshirt, the smallest sweatshirt that Shea had and grabbed a black beanie and wore it like a skater. Sandy, who was bigger than Jane, grabbed a pink zip-up light jacket and grabbed a pink hat with a ball on top. Emily grabbed a white swater and grabbed a green tassel hat with balls on the tassels and the top of the hat. Shea grabbed a large blue sweatshirt and grabbed her hat. Emily and Shea finished up the candy and the girls headed outside on the beach. They started to walk and talk to each other. They were talking about...</span></div></div>",

Who cares?\" Shea said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we keep eating at your place so many times and I gain a lot of weight, my mother might care,\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't think my parents would mind it too much for now,\" Emily said. \"But as I gain a lot more, it may be an issue. But I don't know. How about you Shea? Would your parents mind?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if they mind or not. I'm still mad because of what they did. Just take a job while knowing you have a child and just drop her off at a aunt's house who you hardly knew,\" Shea said as she adjusted her hat and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you liked it here,\" Sandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, Rapunzel. I do. It's not the place. It's the way they did it. It's like saying that their job is more important than their child. They practically said they want the job, can't use a child like me so they needed to get rid of me like some old garbage. They never asked me what I thought about it or how I felt. I just needed to accept it. So they need to accept my weight gain or else they shouldn't have left me here,\" Shea said as she felt frustrated.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not the place. it's the reason why she came here,\" Jane said. \"She wasn't sent here because it was so beautiful, or because of the healthy air. She was here just because her parents didn't have any other place for their own daughter,\" Jane continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. So I don't mind what they think about my weight because I like it. Besides, with the food my aunt makes, it's hard not to gain. It's very nice this way,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much did you two gain?\" Sandy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see. Last time I weighed myself, I weighed 114 pounds,\" Shea said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I weighed 90 pounds,\" Emily said softly. They all looked to the moon as they enjoyed the cool air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Emily, Rapunzel, Jane and...\" A voice said suddenly. \"Hm... I don't think I know you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl that spoke was busy watering some flowers. She had some flowers in her hair as she wore some blue dungarees and a white shirt with long sleeves and a jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Karen,\" Emily said. \"Shea this is Karen. Karen, this is Shea. She just moved here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. You're the flower girl,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flower girl?\" Karen asked. \"Never heard that nickname before. Well it sounds better than weed girl. I like that nickname; flower girl. So where do you live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With my Aunt Yenna. Do you know her?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do. I mean, I know everyone who lives here,\" Karen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be impressed about that,\" Jane said. \"We all know everyone who lives here. We were all born and raised here. In a village like this, you soon start to know everyone. We all do,\" Jane continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I need to go back inside. I'm going watch a movie called \"Little Shop of Horrors!\" It's about a flower shop. I guess I'll see you at school then,\" Karen said as she walked into her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a nice girl,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Karen is all right,\" Emily said. \"But be careful. Not all people are as sweet as Karen. Like Johnny. He 's two year older than the others. Better stay away from him or there's a chance you'll lose your virginity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You also have Triple M,\" Jane said. \"They are three boys named Mark, Max and Matt. They think they're funny but they're kind of lame,\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not as lame as their jokes,\" Sandy said. \"But you don't need to be careful with them. They're just annoying!\" Sandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But enough about them. How fat are you planning to get?\" Jane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I must admit I don't know. I never really thought about it. I guess I will just keep gaining and I will see where it ends. But it will take some time,\" Shea said as she smiled and held Emily's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here,\" Emily said.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look!

Jane did the same with Shea. Shea took a first bite and enjoyed the taste. She looked a moment at the delicious burger as it was dripping from the grease and sauce. Shea smiled and opened her mouth for a second bite. But after the second burger, Shea started to feel full. Although Jane noticed this, Jane continued stuffing hamburgers in her mouth. When finally, the last burger went past their lips, Shea was able to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... was... fun,\" Shea said with her hands on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane pushed her back on the couch so Shea was laying down as she went on her knees and hands, pinned Shea's wrists to the couch and smiled evilly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not done yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy walked inside the room with the chocolate pie. Shea loved chocolate pie. Sandy and Jane both grabbed a fork and started stuffing it into the mouths of their friends. Both felt their bellies push out because of all the food inside of it. Shea had no choice at all. Jane put her under legs on Shea's arms and scooped chocolate pie into her mouth so fast, Shea couldn't do anything. Emily and Shea were in pain, but even with how much pain they were in and how stuffed they were, they still felt very content being so stuffed with food. Both girls loved chocolate pie. If they needed to have some pain in their tummies, then so be it. They kept thinking that even when the last piece of pie entered their mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

After their stuffing, all of the girls moved up to Shea's room, tried on hats and clothing, and then went to bed. She remembered that Emily and her took the bed while Jane and Sandy were sleeping on a mattress next to the bed. Suddenly, Shea realized something: something was grabbing hold of her. She turned around and found out that it was Emily, who was grabbing Shea's fatter belly with a slumbering smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea liked the idea that Emily wanted to get fatter with her. She started to feel like Emily was really understanding why Shea had always wanted to gain. Of course, Shea was bigger, but Emily was doing her best to catch up to her best friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then noticed her alarm clock, which read seven in the morning. She was surprised that she was up so early while everyone else was sleeping. Maybe she was anxious for her date with Leonard. Maybe she was just hungry. She couldn't really tell. All she knew was that she was still pretty tired. Without a further thought, Shea returned back to sleep, dreaming about her life with her fat.</span></div></div>",

She must admit she liked the feeling. She turned her head and saw Emily and realized that the things she felt was Emily's hands. Emily was playing with her belly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you enjoying yourself?\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily then sat up straight and then she saw Shea and sighed, feeling relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You scared me a bit. You shouldn't sneak up on people. Anyway, are you nervous for your date with Leonard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a bit. But it's not like I have never dated before,\" Shea said. \"I used to have a boyfriend, remember. But he ran away with a stupid slut after I moved,\" She rolled on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think Leonard would do that. After all, you're the first girl he asked out ever. That has to mean something. Since he didn't go out with any other girl while he was asked several times. He refused any girl. Even Victoria. Man, she was mad. She said boys didn't refuse her, she refuses boys,\" Emily continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he's good looking... but a boyfriend has to be more than that. He must be kind, caring, get along with my friends, listen to me, support me, he must be no macho and he must like my weight gain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A perfect boy. Well I know he's some of those things, and the other things... I don't know. Are you going to make out?\" Emily asked and grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. If he wants that. But I'm not sure how fast he is,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise and shine,\" Jane said. \"I heard you two talking and you're right. It's time for your date and we're your friends! So we need to make you ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Rapunzel?\" Emily asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still in dreamland. Just let her stay there. I think she'll wake up fast. Alright, Shea. Come on now and get up!\" <br>\r\n    <br>\r\nShea went to sit on a chair in front of her mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! First we need to find you some nice clothing. You're going out on a picnic, so no long gala dress. Since this is your first date, I would go for a nice pink T-shirt and maybe a short skirt,\" Jane requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that sounds great. Oh, I also have some pink lipstick,\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane and Emily soon found some nice clothing. It was easy in Shea's huge collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Take off your pajamas! Don't be ashamed. I saw you naked before and you have nothing to be ashamed of,\" Jane said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea did as she was told and Jane and Emily were thinking about what to wear. They also put on a bit make up, not that it was noticeable, but just enough to look nice. After that, Jane, Emily and Rapunzel (who woke up) combed Shea's hair until it was very wavy and straight. <br>\r\nShea looked at herself in the mirror. She thought she looked good. Jane was good at dressing others up. She also liked that her pink T-shirt with flowers was a bit to short so it left a small stroke of Shea's belly bare. But if Leonard really liked big bellies, this was only a bonus. Besides, she saw enough girls in sixth grade with tops that left their belly bare. But of course, those girls were all slender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're ready for your date!\" Jane yelled. </span></div></div>",

I will be back soon. In the meantime, I made you and your friends pancakes for breakfast that are in the refrigerator.

She opened it up to notice that there were multiple stacks of pancakes for the girls to eat. All of them smiled, knowing that their breakfast would taste well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's warm these up and eat!\" Shea said as they started to take the pancakes out and warm them up in the oven. There were multiple kinds of pancakes, including chocolate chip, blueberry, plain, and even maple syrup filled. When all of the pancakes were heated up, the girls put them out and set them on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shea, why don't you sit back and relax? We will feed you a lot of pancakes since you need to have a bigger belly for your date!\" Emily said with a grin. The others agreed to, including Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Let's eat!\" Shea said as she sat back in her chair with her mouth open. Emily, Rapunzel, and Jane set pancakes aside for themselves, Emily taking the most out of the three, but the major majority of the pancakes were left for Shea. The girls covered the pancakes in syrup, making the pancakes even more fattening. They slowly started to stuff pancake after pancake into Shea's gullet, satisfying her taste buds and her hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it coming,\" Shea said while all the other girls smiled, enjoying the idea of stuffing their best friend.

Let's go,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard took her by the hand and walked with her through the village while he said what everything was or who lived where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know all those people personally?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone here knows everyone. I was born a raised here. There's only one school here so almost all kids here are on the same school and sometimes we have neighborhood parties where we see all the others. It maybe a bit boring here. There isn't really much night life, but we like it here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it here, too. It wasn't so much fun where I lived. I knew about four or five families on our street. That's it. Also, a busy street was in front of our house. Of course, I had a lot of friends at school, but there were a lot of schools so a lot of people in your street went to another school,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well most people here are nice. Of course you have always a few less nicer people...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Victoria,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. I really hate her but for some reason she likes me. But I don't like her. She's so skinny. Not that I have anything against skinny girls, but I have something against girls who are starving themselves and are dieting and throw up only to lose some weight and think it's a crime to gain a single pound. Girls who look like skeletons. I have something against that. Victoria is just like that and she also has a bitchy personality. She thinks she's the boss and she is mean to everyone who doesn't think that way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you like more? A skinny girl of a fat girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... Well to be honest... Well I do really like... eh... eh... a fat girl. I like more to hold a girl that's soft. I don't want to hug a girl and only feel bones. I want to have something to hold. Something that soft and warm and... Well that's what I like in a girl. In looks, of course. She also needs to have a nice personality. I would never date a girl like Victoria even if I thought she did look fantastic,\" Leonard said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? You may not believe me... but I'm trying to gain weight,\" Shea admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean on purpose? You want to gain weight? You eat to gain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it started as an accident, but now I'm really trying to gain,\" Shea said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes me really happy,\" He said and slowly rubbed her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea liked the feeling as she started to feel turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think of Emily, Jane and Rapunzel?\" She suddenly asked, wondering what he thought of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Emily is thin, but has a sweet face. Jane has a body made of pure muscle and looks really cool and nice. Sandy is not too smart but looks kind of cute. Emily has a sweet personality and is always ready to help people and does make people feel at home. Jane is brave and always protects her friends but can never say no to a challenge and is very friendly. Rapunzel is nice, but sometimes a bit loud and doesn't always thinks before she says anything. But she means well for all You can always  count on her when you're in trouble. All three are true friends,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's perfect,\" Shea thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're here,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Where?\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the park . We were going to have a picnic, right?\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Of course,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea really liked him. It was fun talking to him and Emily had been right. He liked her fat. She also liked talking with him. It was easy. There was also an extra bonus: Victoria wouldn't like this. That wasn't so important, but it was always a nice extra.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She remembered how in love the two of them were. She heard somewhere that when you're in love, you feel butterflies in your stomach. She felt that with Nick and she couldn't deny that. Now she felt butterflies again but it felt like every butterfly had ten kids.<br>\r\nLeonard moved a bit more closer. Shea didn't really know what she was supposed to do. To kiss him seemed the right thing to d,o but would she dare that? Suppose she understood it wrong and he didn't want to kiss her. Then she would of made a terrible mistake. But on the other hand, if he did want to kiss her and she didn't, she would also make a terrible mistake. She needed to decide fast what to do.<br>\r\nFor a short moment, she thought about Nick. He left her for a slut, leaving her nothing to stop her. Did she want to kiss Leonard? No doubt about that because he was hot. Did she dare to kiss him though? She wondered what Jane would do. She never said no to a challenge. She even dared to swim naked and accepted the challenge. Was kissing a challenge?<br>\r\nShe knew for sure she knew she needed to make a decision soon. And when she looked at him, she felt some sort of trust as she pushed her lips forward and found Leonard's lips. Slowly, he pushed his lips on her lips.  <br>\r\nShe felt some sort of shock through her body. It felt great for her as if it pleasured her. She knew for sure there were sparks flying around them. Then, just as fast as it happened, it stopped. However, she still felt the butterflies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like that?\" He asked slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she grabbed his head and pushed another kiss on his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that answer your question?\" Shea asked with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it does. Wow... It's just... I mean just... wow... I never kissed a girl. At least not like that. This was something I never felt. It was great. I never knew I could feel that with a girl,\" Leonard said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think you feel that with just any girl. Just with me; A girl you got feelings for. At least, I think you got feelings for me, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I do. That's 100% true. I got feelings for you and a lot of them. You know, I've been asked out by many girls more than once, especially by Victoria. But with not one of those girls have I got the feeling I have with you,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You also never went out with either one of them,\" Shea smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It wouldn't have been fair to them to say yes if I went on a date with one of them while I didn't have feelings for her. I sometimes did things together in a group with boys and girls, but I never went on a date until now. I know for sure I won't regret this,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither. However, when school starts, I guess most girls will hate me since I'm dating you. At my old school, girls hated me since I was getting boobs and they weren't. Now that I have them and you, that's two reasons for them to hate me,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry too much about it. Most people here are not that full of hate. Besides, every other girl that asked me out, which is almost every girl in our class, would have done the same thing. Of course, you will have Victoria. She'll hate you and maybe one or two others, but that's it. About those boobs... after a few years, they will have them, too. Besides, you have three true friends... and me,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth kids cuddled a bit with each other. </span></div></div>",

The next moment, her face turned red from anger and she ran away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like kissing you, but doing that to Victoria is a nice bonus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shea, I'm sorry, but... all the food is gone,\" Leonard said and showed her the empty picnic basket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, did I already eat all that? Say, want to come over to my place? I'm sure Aunt Yenna has some food you can feed me. She always has some food, and she's a great cook!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the reason people come to her for food,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, everyone here knows each other and everyone knows your Aunt is a great cook. If you have a party or when you need a cake, everyone goes to your Aunt to ask if she can make it. She likes doing it and you can always ask her to make it look special. She's good with doing that. A good thing is that when we do this, we don't have to pay your Aunt right away. She doesn't send a bill to us. We can pay when we have the money. Since your Aunt's food taste so delicious, a lot of people ask her every now and then,\" Leonard continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know that, but it does make sense,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard and Shea talked some more until they reached Aunt Yenna's house. Shea opened the door and held it open for Leonard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come in,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you live in a nice house. Do you like it here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet I do! I like it a lot,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they walked in the living room, they saw Aunt Yenna. She looked up, surprised, and smiled when she saw who it was. She looked like a parent who saw her daughter with her first date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Shea! And you're Leonard! So nice to see you again. I see you like Shea,\" Aunt Yenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. She's a lovely girl,\"Leonard said. \"I really like her,\" Leonard said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Shea, this just came with the mail. It's a invitation for a neighborhood barbecue,\" Aunt Yenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... am I invited? I'm still the new one here,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're invited. They asked for Yenna and Shea. So, they expect you, too. It's always fun. All people come together. Some take food for the barbecue, others take something to drink, others, like me, make some food for the party, and others pay money for the party. Your friends will also be there and some other kids who live here. A lot of other people who live here will be there, too,\" Aunt Yenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most kids are from you school here, considering you are going to our school,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is. You're not thinking I'm letting a eleven year old girl travel to the next town five days a week just to go to school, do you? I love Shea. I don't want to see her unhappy. I hope you understand that,\" Aunt Yenna said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come. I want to show you my room!\" Shea said and took Leonard by the hand. Upstairs, Shea went sitting on the bed with Leonard next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for my Aunt. She doesn't trust boys that much. She does think boys only think about sex,\" Shea continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't only think about sex. Not only boys think about it. I know enough girls who also think and talk all the time about sex. Like that girls that live next door. I hear them talk: \"Go to bed with him. You don't want to be a virgin at 16.\" At some towns, you can pick up a whore at every street corner,\" Leonard reasoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea thought a moment about Nick with Evaline. That girl was also a slut. Leonard was right. Sure, there were boys who only though about sex, but some girls could also only think about sex. <br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

I mean, I am still moving in, but I am almost done,\" Shea said with a grin as Leonard kept on looking around. He then looked at her dresser, seeing Shea's winter hat on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is this out?\" He asked curiously. Shea went over to the dresser, grabbed the hat, and put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well I unpacked it earlier. I like wearing this for some reason. I mean, what do you think?\" Shea asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it makes you look cute,\" Leonard said with a smile as Shea giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks,\" Shea said with a smile as they both sat back down on the bed, Shea looking into Leonard's eyes. As they kept on looking, they started to kiss one another, grabbing each other down until they were both lying on the bed. Moments later, Shea pulled away from Leonard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I just have a question,\" Shea started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. What is it?\" Leonard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... what's your view on sex?\" Shea asked. There was a pause as Leonard thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have never done that, but I would never rush a girl into it. Only when she is ready,\" Leonard said with a smile. Shea smiled back, only thinking of how perfect he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you are perfect,\" Shea said with a smile. Quickly, they continued to kiss each other, looking like they would never let go of each other.</span></div></div>",

I understand that, but I would like it if my first time with a girl is also her first time,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's easier for both. Both have to be a bit nervous for their first time, both don't have to be afraid of the amount of experience.

You're special,\" Shea said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she kissed him on the mouth as he returned the favor. Both were not thinking clearly. They kissed as Leonard's hands slowly removed Shea's shirt. Shea let him. She even slowly did the same with his shirt and went sitting on her knees before him, showing her belly and her evolving breasts. Slowly, he tried to undo her bra, but he didn't know how to. She smiled and helped him and slowly, her bra slid of. Both were still lost in passion. Slowly, Leonard's hands pulled Shea's pants down, but Shea didn't stop him. She even helped with getting her pants down, both still lost in passion. Both kids only wore their underwear while they kissed further. Then slowly, Leonard's hands took Shea's panties and pulled them down. Shea did the same to him while they were still kissing.

Leonard went pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm so sorry. I... I wasn't.... think... thinking clear.... I just....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't you dare try to take all the blame. You weren't the only one doing it. I did it, too. I'm not the only one here naked, you know,\" Shea said while she went sitting with her legs crossed under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I started...\" He started to say, but Shea cut him off.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"And I didn't stop you. I let you, and I even helped you. Besides, I liked it. I really did! And I know for sure you liked it, too,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, I did like it, but I didn't know what happened, as if I was lost,\" Leonard said with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonard, you're really special, and perfect, and I want my first time to be with you. But... not just now,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're totally right. Like I said, I only do it if the girl herself is ready for it. Sorry for, well, you know,\" Leonard continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. After all, nothing happened. But I'm not on the pill and I don't want to become a teenage mother and I don't think you're planning to be a teenage father,\" Shea reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really. However, I want to become a Dad in the future. When I'm all grown up, have a job, house and a wife, then I want to,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems like fun to me, too. I hope I can be the wife. But let's just wait with the sex. We're just eleven. I mean, we both have a whole life ahead of us to do it in. Shouldn't we first explore it as virgins? When we're older, we have enough time to do it,\" Shea smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's maybe more wise,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's maybe also better if we put our clothes back on. Suppose if Aunt Yenna comes in. Then she will think her niece is a slut and that you're just like all the other boys that only think with their cock. Just wait. We'll have enough time when we're older. Then, we can continue where we stopped,\" Shea said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth got dressed immediately. For some strange reason, Shea didn't felt uneasy or ashamed being naked with a boy. If someone in her old neighborhood would have told her this would happen, she wouldn't have believed him. Maybe it was because she saw him naked as well or because she felt so happy with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad everything ended well,\" Shea grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at his watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already this late? I'm sorry, Shea. I need to go for real. I'm not making up an excuse, but my mother wants me home since we have some guests,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea walked him to the door. He kissed her goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you at the neighborhood barbecue!\" He yelled while he ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea walked upstairs slowly. She still had a little trouble understanding what happened. She realized she almost had sex. Even while it sounded kind of exciting, she was happy she didn't go through with it. Even while she loved Leonard, she wanted to be a little bit older before she lost her virginity. Now that she thought about it, she might want to start taking the pill. Leonard said he would not make a girl do anything she didn't want to do, but there could also be boys who thought different about that. And there has sometimes creeps that tried to rape a young girl before. She surely didn't want that to happen, but just to be sure, Shea decided would ask Aunt Yenna about the pill. <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What's up?\" Shea asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much. We just wanted to see how you were doing,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Emily started talking, Shea couldn't help but look at her. She noticed that Emily had gained a small amount of weight since the last time that she saw her, which was a little surprising to her since it had not been that long. Shea smiled realizing that Emily was almost a duplicate of her in some ways. She needed to have another stuffing session with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come on in, you guys!\" Shea said as they all came into her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your Aunt home?\" Jane asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. She went on some errands for now. I think she went to go shopping again since I ate more food,\" Shea said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We noticed,\" Rapunzel said as she pointed to Shea's pajamas. She was right. It was really easy to notice considering Shea's fresh food stains on her pajamas accompanied with a belly that was sticking out between her pajama pants and shirt. Shea was starting to become down right fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, how did the date with Leonard go yesterday?\" Emily asked quickly. All of the girls started to giggle as they wanted to hear the details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! We want to know everything!\" Jane said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat scared Shea in some way. Sure, they were all her friend, but she didn't know if she wanted to tell them about the sex situation. She didn't want her brand new friends to think of her as a slut of any kind.

Besides, I don't use the pill and I don't want to become a teenage mommy,\" Shea said as she put hands on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, Shea,\" Jane said. \"You are a bit young for sex.

She had no problem looking good in winter clothes, but she needed a lot of time to look good in summer clothes and today was a warm day. She took a short shirt so her belly could be bare and noticeable as it was sticking out forward. That was just what she wanted. She was wearing a short red shirt and some cut off jeans with black sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'm done,\" Shea said and ran downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here. Hold this,\" Her Aunt said friendly as she handed her a bowl filled with food. \"At that barbecue, I always take some food with me.

Told you it was a short walk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea eyes almost popped out of her head. The house was even bigger than Aunt Yenna's house. This was only for three people? She knew Carlie was an only child and lived with her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must be really rich,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if they weren't, they couldn't afford those clothes,\" Aunt Yenna said and rang the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beautiful slender woman with curly dark brown hair opened the door. She had large boobs, pearl white teeth, tan skin, and long legs that made her look perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Yenna. We expected you, and of course Shea, too. We are glad you could come. Nice to meet you,\" the lady said to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea shook her hand and walked in. After the woman showed her where she could put the bowl down, Shea walked into the garden. The garden was already full with other people. She just wanted to look and see if she could see her friends. That was when she heard someone screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's not for you! Come back with that meat, Silver!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment, she saw a white colored cat run away with a piece of meat between his jaws. The cat quickly jumped on a chair onto a table, jumping on a balcony from there. It jumped then on the roof of the garage and from there to the roof of another house until  he was gone.<br>\r\nShea looked at the girl who screamed at the cat. She never saw the girl before, but Emily's description was perfect. That was Carlie. Shea saw that she wore really expansive clothing, but she must admit she looked very good in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn cat,\" She mumbled as she saw Shea. \"Oh! You must be Shea, the new girl that just moved over here,\" Carlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... how... how did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you're the only person over here I don't know,\" The girl said with a wide grin. \"I heard you would come. It's nice to meet you finally,\" She said as she stuck out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea shook it while she said: \"You must be Carlie. Emily told me about you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can believe our village must seem a bit boring if you are someone new from out of town. But it's nice here. I can believe that it's not nice leaving your friends and all behind, but you will soon make enough new friends here,\" Carlie said nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already have new friends. I have three of them: Emily, Jane and Rapunzel. I also met Karen once. I gave her the nickname flower girl. We met but that's all. I also have made one enemy: a girl named Victoria,\" Shea said while rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh her! Ha ha! Don't worry about her. Most others don't like her. So you made some friends. Maybe you could also get a boyfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I already did get a boyfriend. You must know him. His name is Leonard,\" Shea said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlie froze for a few seconds and then slowly turned to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonard? Your boyfriend is Leonard?\" That can't be. You must have heard his name wrong. He never dates girls. He rejected every girl that ever asked him and he's been asked a lot of times!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Leonard did go out with her!\" Emily suddenly said, who wore also some cut of jeans that formed a nice muffin top. She also wore a light blue shirt and she put her hair in two pigtails. \"And from what I heard, he really likes her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Man, you are so lucky! A lot of girls tried so many times to date him and never had success,\" Carlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome more people walked in the garden while Carlie's mother went on a small stage and took a microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Test, one, two, three. Alright! First, I want to tell you all welcome to our annual neighborhood barbecue. It's so mice to see everyone again. But most importantly, between all familiar face, we have one new face. Shea, come on over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people went aside to make room for Shea. She was a bit surprised and slowly walked towards the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Shea. She's the niece of Aunt Yenna and just moved into our neighborhood. I'm sure we all will try to make you feel right at home here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone cheered and clapped. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From there, the barbecue then continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll throughout the event, Shea kept on meeting new people with help from Carlie and Emily. One of the first people Shea met was a short, shy boy name Josh. He had blonde hair and seemed very intimidated. Shea could tell that he was nervous and quiet normally. After that, she was introduced to a group of girls. There was a tall brunette girl named Lea, a short brown hair girl named Elise, and a normal heighted blonde named Cosette. Face to face, the girls seemed very kind to Shea. She could tell they were very clicky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe afternoon continued on like this, which made Shea very hungry. Her stomach rumbled more and more every second. After Shea met more people, she finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. I don't know about you guys, but I am hungry. Want to join me?\" Shea asked Carlie and Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely!\" Emily said as she put her hands on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good. I'll come with you guys though,\" Carlie said politely as they all headed for a nearby table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding a seat, Shea and Emily got up, grabbed plates, and got as much food as they could. Their plates were filled wiith sweets, hot dogs, chips, and other barbecue favorites. Carlie looked on in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you guys eat this all?\" Carlie asked in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we have gotten used to it. It feels so good not worrying about what you eat,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I usually worry about what I eat. I mean, it sucks, but I would like to let loose,\" Carlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea then started to think, wondering what she would do next.</span></div></div>",

Acting all sweet and innocent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Shea asked. \"An annoying younger brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only have a little sister and I'm talking about Silver, my cat. He's now rubbing against peoples legs, nuzzling up against them. He's trying to get a bite of meat,\" Carlie continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't she steal some food before?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. That was Silver. Oh, he's a nice cat, but if he can get food, he's isn't always nice,\" Carlie said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man! A lot of kids go to school here,\" Shea mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course they do. There's only one school here in this whole, boring village,\" Carlie said. \"But it's alright. See those little tikes over there?\" She asked and pointed to the group of toddlers. \"They are all in our school. They're in kindergarten, of course, but they go to our school. Just like those kids over there,\" Carlie said and pointed to some boys and a girl about eight years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They also go to our school,\" Emily said. \"Until you go to high school, they're here at school. So you'll also be with them,\" Emily continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you have an entire school year to know us and do things before we party the whole summer because we're going to high school!\" Carlie yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not go too fast. We still have a whole year before that. Besides, one of us might stay down a class,\" Emily said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello girls. Emily, Carlie and... Shelly... Sina... Sia... It was something like that, wasn't it?\"  A boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Shea, Elf. Remember that,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is his name Elf?\" Shea asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's a nickname. He and his parents live in the forest. He can climb the best and can get along with any animal. He loves the forest and he can jump from one tree to another just like an elf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lately, he hangs around by the tree houses, throwing water balloons to other kids. It's a game. One group goes to three houses at one side and the others go to the other sides and battle each other. Nothing too serious of course. Some older kids are there, too, now and then to watch them,\" Carlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Shea,\" a familiar, unpleasant voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Hello, Victoria,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful hanging around with Shea, Carlie. She might steal your boyfriend like she did with me,\" Victoria said meanly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never stole your boyfriend or any other boyfriend. If you're talking about Leonard, he isn't your boyfriend. He never was and never will be,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Everyone knows he's in love with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... you like him. But you asked him out over a dozen times with him always rejecting you,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys don't reject me!\" Victoria screamed. \"I reject them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How true that might be with any other boy. Leonard reject you and any other girl, but he asked Shea out. Leonard was single, which means she didn't steal anyone. Besides, Leonard asked her out. He is Shea's boyfriend. Accept it,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria almost seemed to choke, but she turned around and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would also like to meet a few new people,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know about most people in our group, but we can show you some younger school members or older people,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood up and walked to some younger kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Ruby, Simon and Travis,\" Carlie said and introduced three kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three wore loose clothing, a cap, and had wild hair. They also all three wore a belt with some paint spray cans. Shea took one look at their T-shirts. When she saw the drawings on it, she know what they did. They were graffiti artists. Shea never was a big fan of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio, however, each raised a hand and all three said: \"Hi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" Shea answered.        <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked further.    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wasn't it only four hours?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but my family and I woke up early because we had some caterers and decorators come to help set up.

She looked at her and Shea knew she was furious. Her eyes were squinted so far, it looked like tiny cracks full of hate. It was obvious she hated Shea because Leonard liked her. In her eyes, she still saw it as stealing her boyfriend. She was the diva: the cool, popular girl. If she liked a boy, no other girl was allowed to look at him. She was convinced Leonard would fall for her or just play hard to get. But now he had a girlfriend. He had a new girl that she didn't like at first sight. That only made it more frustrating for her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Don't pay attention to her. She can't do anything to you,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can try to put anyone in the village up against me,\" Shea said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. Not all classmates like or believe her. Besides, if Leonard tells them that he likes you, Victoria doesn't have a leg to stand on. The only problem is that some girls could get a bit jealous,\" Emily reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlie walked back over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Carlie, Emily is going to spend the night at my place. Do you want to come, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I just need to ask my Mom, but I think it's alright. It's vacation after all,\" Carlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea liked vacation, but she looked forward to school. Not that she liked school that much. She hated school to be honest. But to meet all the others, see a new school, do things during recess, and of course, some classes at school were fun. The idea of sixth grade at a new place at a new school with new friends made Shea lean back and let the sun shine on her face as she enjoyed it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I asked my Mom and I can come over to spend the night,\" Carlie said, carrying a small bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tooth brush, clothes for tomorrow. I don't think your clothes will fit me. No hard feelings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! You're right. They probably wouldn't fit you,\" Shea mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shea! I'm going home. Are you coming?\" Aunt Yenna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'm coming. Oh, and I invited Emily and Carlie to spend the night. That's fine, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. You're so easy at making new friends. First Emily, Rapunzel, and Jane. Then a boyfriend Leonard and now also Carlie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea smiled. However, she must admit she missed some of her old friends, especially Kelly. Now that she thought about her, she needed to chat with her again. Would she tell her about the gaining? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily, you really did gain the past time,\" Carlie said while they walked to Aunt Yenna's house. \"It looks good on you with all those extra pounds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't tell you, but Shea and I are trying to gain weigh on purpose!\" <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShea looked at Carlie, wondering how she would react.</span></div></div>",

Over the course of the next 15 minutes, food from candy to pancakes are thrust down Carlie's mouth.  Her bloated, tight belly is staring to peek under her shirt as she starts to slow down.  \"I dont know of I can finish all of this guys, I'm feeling pretty full\" says Carlie as she eats some more bacon.  \"You can do it we still have plenty to go\" says Shea.  Carlie knew if she wanted to gain and catch up with Emily and Shea, she would have to push through her limits so she toughen up and started faster. Another 15 minutes had past and Carlie was having the final piece of pancake shoved through her mouth.  Her belly button was visible and her shirt felt much tighter than before.  \"Good job Carlie you did it!\" said Emily who was hopping up and down in joy. \"What do we do now?\" said Shea.</span></div></div>",

But if it's okay, I could help you girls out. I'm more a bit of a rebel, you know? Against the magazines that say you need to be thin. I'm against it, but I'm not becoming fat myself,\" Carlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds a bit hypocritical,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not. That's the point. I'm not becoming fat myself, but I'm fine with fat or gaining people. I don't think people need to be thin to look beautiful. They can also look beautiful when they're fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds more a bit like the promised land,\" Shea said. \"A place were people can live in peace together and don't care which size or skin color they have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about size or skin color. Take Rosa. She has skin with the color of pure chocolate, but is very nice and is fun to hang out with. She also hangs out with white people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea remembered a chubby lovely black girl she met at the barbecue. That must have been Rosa. She tore off another lump of cake and started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, with you Aunt's cooking, it's no wonder you gain,\" Carlie said. \"I bet even Victoria wouldn't be able to resist this food and she's doing everything she can to stay thin,\" Carlie continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Shea started to roll over the ground from laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I say something funny?\" Carlie said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just... You said that Victoria tries to stay thin no matter what. But she also tries to get Leonard to be her boyfriend, right?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct. That's why she's really going to hate you,\" Carlie said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but what's so funny is that Leonard is attracted to fat girls. He likes fatter girls more than that stupid tooth pick girl Victoria. She tries to stay thin, maybe even to look attractive to him, and she gets the opposite effect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlie also started to giggle now that she understood the humor about Victoria's obsession about being thin together with her obsession about getting Leonard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder... if she would know that... would she try to get fat?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps,\" Shea said. \"Doesn't really matter since even if she would gain weight, Leonard still wouldn't like her because of her bitchy personality!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand that,\" Emily mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can be lucky you live here. You know, in some schools in the city, Victoria would be a popular girl, or the diva, the girl all other students should listen to and do what she wants. But in a school like the one in this village... we don't care so much about popularity. We know most other people who live here from day one. We get to know others and when we're older, you do not care about anything that could make him or her popular or not,\" Carlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlie swallowed the last piece of cake and belched loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. Excuse me. By the way, that cake was delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! My Aunt is the best cook, but I think I'm full for tonight. I had a lot of food from that barbecue,\" Shea said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlie crawled in her sleeping bag and Emily crawled in bed with Shea.

Some how, Emily was elevated super high. As she continued to look around, she noticed something: she was an obese, immobile ball of fat! No matter what she did, there was no way she was going to move as she was sitting down. Her thighs and ass were the size of a park bench as her feet looked like they were being swallowed in fat. On top of that, she could feel her chin being enveloped with layer upon layer of fat. Finally, the biggest feature was her belly and her boobs as they both stuck out, creating rolls of fat all over her body, giving her a defined rounded shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even though she was fat in her dream, she didn't notice the twist that she was about to find out.</span></div></div>",

This was what she wanted to be. <br>\r\nShe saw some of her blonde hair over her shoulder resting on one of her boobs. Then suddenly, she saw something strange. While the end of her hair was still blond, the other end turned brown. It came over her hair, sliding like a liquid, leaving her hair brown. It looked nice overall. When it reached the end of the hair, it went further at the same time making extra hair, making her hair about an inch longer. <br>\r\nShe turned her head and finally saw a mirror and could turn her head just enough to look at her face. She saw how it slowly changed a bit. It was her face, a lot fatter then it used to be, but still her face slowly changing. Her eyes turned a heavier shade of brown while her nose started to turn into a button nose. With all of these changes happening, Emily began to notice her skin turning darker, turning into a tan. When she stopped changing, she saw who she was: she was Shea. Fine, Shea was fat and this person was morbidly obese, but there was no doubt this was Shea. She was Shea. <br>\r\nWhen she thought about it, it wasn't so bad. Shea had about anything you could ever want. Shea had a huge room with a computer, T.V, a music center, and as much candy as she liked. Shea also had a swimming pool, a very nice Aunt who cooked terrificly, some very nice friends, and a boyfriend. And he was not just any boyfriend, but a very handsome boyfriend. Emily must admit if she could be someone else, Shea would be the best choice, maybe even better than being herself. <br>\r\nHowever, Shea also had a problem that wasn't her fault. She had two parents who went away and left her with an Aunt she hardly knew. Fine, she appeared to be very nice and all, but still, she hardly knew her and now needed to live with her.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm Shea,\" Emily mumbled, hearing Shea's voice that was hers. \"Wow! This is so cool. Being Shea isn't so bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying, sweetie?\" A voice said as Aunt Yenna walked in. \"Oh my, Shea! You are getting so nice and fat,\" Aunt Yenna said, pinching and patting her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's maybe time we get a bigger bed for you. You're getting too fat for the queen sized bed. Just look! Your love handles are spilling over the edge of the bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily couldn't really see it since her body took away some of her view, but she believed her Aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I can't move,\" Emily said, still exploring new things about her new obese body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Shea? You haven't moved in ages. You can't move. You're way too fat to move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily noticed she could just wiggle her fat toes a bit and just move her under arms and hands a bit, but not too much. But she must admit she liked it. This was the life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet if my parents come to visit, they would get a great shock!\" Emily said as she acted like Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They probably will, but it's their own fault. You know, without Emily, you maybe wouldn't be here. Perhaps you would be a fat girl, but not morbidly obese,\" Aunt Yenna continued.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well I'm thankful for her because now I'm so happy. When can I see her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't act silly. None of you can leave the house... Oh, you mean with the webcam, of course,\" Aunt Yenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put a computer screen down so Emily could watch it. Emily wondered how her real form looked, who she assumed was Shea in Emily's body. But before she could see, the dream disappeared in little white lights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily woke up to notice that she was in Shea's room. She wasn't fat. Well, she was fat, but not near as fat as she was in her dream. Shea wasn't so fat either. At least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed she was pressed against Shea's fat body and must admit she liked it.</span></div></div>",

It still felt nice as she slowly stroked it. Suddenly, Emily started to remember her dream of becoming Shea. In a weird way, the dream wasn't creepy to her at all. She didn't really know what to think about it. She tried thinking of all the reasons why she would have such a dream like that. I mean, she became morbidly obese and transformed into her best friend. What more could that mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it hit her. Emily started to realize what the dream was telling her: She really wanted to be Shea. She wanted Shea's life filled with fat, luxury, a great boyfriend, looks, and everything else she thought of. Emily remembered falling asleep hours ago with Shea calling Emily her twin. In a weird way, she wished she could be her twin, which got her thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer and Shea were basically like sisters. They both were fattening each other up, wearing the same clothes, hanging with the same people, and always were constantly talking to one another. Emily knew that she couldn't be Shea or really live with her, but what if she could try her best to be her twin? It didn't seem like it would be that hard. All she really would have to do is dye her hair brown, make it wavier, and fatten up with Shea. There were maybe a few other things, but it seemed very basic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was lost in her thoughts, Emily noticed Shea waking up. She knew that if she was going to go through with the idea, she would need to talk to Shea about it. She had no idea how she would react, but Emily knew it was something she would want to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Emily. You're up early,\" Shea said with a chubby smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning! I've been up for like a few minutes,\" Emily said as she looked to the floor. She noticed that Carlie was still asleep. Now would be the perfect time to tell Shea about it. But how?</span></div></div>",

What about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I thought that I could dye my hair brown, the same color like yours, and make it more wavier. Then I would look just like you and we could look like twins!\" Emily said with some excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there were also some extra pounds in difference between them, but Emily was gaining already, making that really not matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dye your hair brown to look like me? Look like me like a real twin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh!\" Emily said excitedly. \"I think it would be really cool to look like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it sounds nice and all, but isn't there a chance that other people could think that you're me or that I'm you?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well one could look at your cup size and they would know it's you. Even if they can't keep us apart, we're most of the time together anyway. So what does it matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea thought about this. She would kind of like Emily to be like her twin, but wondered what the others would think, especially since she was the new girl in town and of course the idea that she had Leonard.  What would he think? Was this such a good idea? She didn't want to say no to something her best friend wanted and herself also, but she thought it might become a problem with the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does you Mom allow you to dye your hair?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's no problem. She's pretty cool about that kind of stuff. As long as it's not forever like a tattoo. With piercings, it's as long as it's in the ear or belly button. Not anywhere else,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where else would you put a piercing?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... eyebrow, nose, lip, tongue, nipple.... and well, my cousin once told me he saw in a book from his Dad that a girl who pierced her labia!\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No way! Ew! That sounds kind of disgusting. Who would want to do that? It also sounds kind of painful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my Mom also hates pumped up breasts or lips and that kind of stuff. She hates things where you really need surgery for, but she's fine with just your hair. I could even dye it purple or blue if I wanted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It finally turns back to your own hair color anyway,\" Carlie mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Carlie! You're up. What did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said it turns back anyway. No matter what color you dye your hair, after some time, it turns back to the original color. If you want to keep it in another color, then you need to dye it from time to time,\" Carlie said as she slowly awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So should I do it?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea still wasn't sure what other people would think or say if they were suddenly the same girls. She looked at her best friend.  </span></div></div>",

Emily looked at Shea, noticing how much bigger her belly was and how much more prominent she was with fat. While Emily checked out Shea, Carlie checked out Emily and Shea's body, noticing how much smaller she was in comparison to them.

She noted to herself what kinds of things to look for: Jeans that made her belly more prominent, shirts that were girly and gave her room to grow, and winter hats for fun. She knew that if she ordered those kinds of things, she would be Shea's twin in a heart beat.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After she was sure she remembered what kind of things Shea wore, she ran downstairs. First, she wanted to eat a large breakfast since she still wanted to gain. After that, she wanted to dye her hair. After that, she wanted to shop for those new clothes. When she came downstairs, there were already some plates full of food on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what Aunt Yenna made us for breakfast,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you can just take all that for breakfast?\" Carlie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wrote a note that said take whatever you want in the fridge. Besides, she gave us lots of food before. So why not now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the girls started eating, Emily asked them: \"After I dye my hair, can we go into the village? I want to buy some new clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you buy loose clothing that can stretch or else you won't be able to wear them. Or at least not for very long,\" Shea said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure... wait. You're coming with us, right?\" Emily asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure. That is if you want, then I will come with you,\" Shea said while she took another big bite of her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlie was surprised when she saw the two other girls eat like there was no tomorrow. She was also surprised at how much the two girls could eat. Sure, she herself wasn't a big eater, which was probably the reason why she was so thin. But still, both other girls ate way more then her. She didn't really mind it. The amount of food that she ate was more than enough for her and it tasted good. But Shea and Emily made sure they ate all the food until the last crumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! I spilled some grease on my shirt. Could you two wait here while I go get a new one?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Go ahead. Take your time. I can let some of the food digest,\" Emily said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea ran upstairs into the bathroom and put her shirt in the clothes basket. She wanted to run out, but suddenly noticed her reflection. She saw how fat she had gotten and thought she really looked good with it. She could even understand why Leonard was attracted to fat girls. Who couldn't be attracted to a girl that looked so good? She couldn't understand why so many people wanted to be thin. But what also took her attention was her boobs. Shea didn't put that much attention to them lately. She used to not even need a bra, however, she wore one on her date with Leonard and at the barbecue to look a bit more presentable. But now, she looked at her boobs that had grown since the past time. She didn't understand why she didn't notice it before, but they were noticeably bigger than when she arrived here. Suddenly, she knew it. All that weight she gained. Boobs were partly made out of fat. With all that fat that she gained, some of it also went to her boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily wanted to go shopping. Well, I could use a few bras because if I keep gaining like this and it keeps going to my breasts, I soon will really need a bra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly ran to her room, grabbed a t-shirt, and was thinking for a short moment. She then grabbed her bra from the ground where she left it yesterday,  put it on, pulled on her t-shirt and walked back downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to go?\" Carlie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I am. So you know someone who could dye Emily's hair for a cheap price?\" Shea asked while they walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. He lives by us. He has three rooms upstairs. He's very funny and very friendly. He's a great fan of horror movies or that old T.V series like The Munsters or The Addams Family. He has hundreds of that stuff on DVD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure he can dye my hair brown? Just brow?. I'm do not want to look like Mortica or the bride of Frankenstein!\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. He's a professional. Well, we're here!\" Carlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked inside and followed Carlie to the first floor. She walked straight to a door and knocked on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professional you say? What kind of work... \" Shea was cut of when the door opened.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was in the door was something they had only seen in their scariest nightmare. It had green rotting flesh at some places where you could even see part of the bones sticking out of his body. One of his eyes was on the right spot, however, it was red hile the other eye wasn't in the right place and hung by a dread next to his mouth with different sized rotting teeth. You could see cuts and scars over the entire body. His hair was dirty and his clothes seemed to be ripped. The three girls started to scream, but Carlie recovered quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Really funny, Leo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person took off his mask with a grin and revealed a normal face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Leo. He does make up and makes masks for horror movies. Seems like it was a real success!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not really doing it yet, but I want to do it once. I'm practicing,\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it looks good, Leo. We just had a question. Could you dye the hair color of this girl as the same color as the hair of this girl?\" Carlie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Is your hair colored or is it natural?\" Leo asked Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natural,\" Shea answered.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"Well then,\" Leo said while he took some jars. \"Let's start!\"</span></div></div>",

He pulled up a chair to the sink for Emily while Shea sat on the toilet for comparison. Carefully and thoroughly, Leo started to dye Emily's hair. The whole process took an hour as he spread the brown hair due all over Emily's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the whole time, Emily had her eyes closed because she didn't want to see what her hair was looking like. She was hoping that her hair wasn't going to be messed up at all. All she had to do was wait. Shea kept on watching while they all talked to each other to make the time fly by. Deep down, Shea wondered if Emily dying her hair was a bad idea. But if Emily wanted to do it, she wasn't going to stop her. In some way, she was a little excited for Emily to look like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finished!\" Leo said as he backed away from Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily sat up to face the mirror, she opened her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh! It's perfect!\" Emily said with a grin as she grabbed her new hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair was the perfect shade of brown, matching Shea's hair color to the tee. On top of that, he even made her hair wavy just like Shea's hair was. The girls now really looked similar to one another, especially since they were both gaining weight. Overall, Emily was pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it a lot! We look alike!\" Shea said as she touched Emily's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you he does great!\" Carlie said to the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do I owe you?\" Emily asked Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me eight dollars and we will be good,\" Leo said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily handed Leo the eight bucks as they all walked downstairs and thanked Leo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me know if you need anything else, girls!\" Leo said as the girls walked out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, he is awesome!\" Carlie said as they all began walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally!\" Shea said agreeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely!

There were stores on both sides, but no where else in the area was a store except for a barber and two stores that Carlie and Emily said that it seemed like they had never been open. For Shea, it was totally different. She grew up in the city with hundreds of stores that were not just on one street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's different from where you come from, isn't it?\" Carlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. I forgot. You come from the city,\" Emily said. \"Guess you must think it's boring here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is where you do well... all the shopping. Only on this street?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, but this is where we do most normal shopping. You know... groceries, the T.V guide, a new pencil. But sometimes, our mothers go with us to the next town to shop there,\" Carlie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Because they think we are too young to go over there on our own,\" Emily said in a grumpy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I need to be honest, if you go over there to party, it can become pretty late. And if you need to wait for the bus in the dark... well there are pretty creepy guys out there who love a beautiful young girl like us. They are ready for the raping. I also heard in a documentary that they even like it more if the victim is still a virgin. The idea that our mothers don't want to let us go on our own probably isn't so strange!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it isn't so bad here. We have here every store we need,\" Emily said while she walked in the clothing store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need some clothes?\" Carlie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. I got a box full from my Aunt... but I could use a few bras,\" Shea said. I hope they have a few here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea looked in the store for bras and suddenly saw some of the clothes Emily picked. If she needed to be honest, they were exactly the same clothes she would pick. She took a better look and noticed that two of the t-shirt were exactly the same as the ones she had. Emily took the twin thing very serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She looks very good with the same hair like you. It's kind of funny if you think about the fact that her hair is done by somebody who works with make up for horror movies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like horror movies?\" Shea asked while she found some bras that would probably fit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, but my mother doesn't want me to see them. She thinks it's too scary for me. But sometimes, Leo shows me one or two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea took six bras and went to the fitting room. She was relieved when she found out they fitted her perfectly. She hoped that Emily wouldn't find it a problem that she bought bras. She decided that she could better pay for them already. After she bought them, she went back and saw Emily showing one of her new outfits. She turned around so you could take a good look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrific. It suits you perfectly!\" Carlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Great,\" Shea said who also looked to see if they were a bit wide so Emily would have some room to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the three girls left the store, two of them with bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you buy any clothes, Carlie?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I don't need new clothes and I don't care that much about clothes. Also, I don't have money for them right about now.\" <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Just did some girl things,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see. Emily, I like the new hair! You look identical to Shea,\" Aunt Yenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.

Emily headed for the computer, Carlie headed for Shea's closet, and Shea headed for a jar of M &amp; M's while laying on her bed. For the next bit, the girls talked about fashion, celebrity gossip, and about how much they disliked Victoria. During this time, Emily was on the computer looking at more clothes. She found a few websites that had Shea's clothes. What she found that made her really happy was a website that made hats. There were literally thousands of them. After a little bit of searching, Emily found all the winter hats that Shea had, which would help make her look more like Shea's twin. Meanwhile, Carlie was looking through Shea's clothes to see what she had. She noticed some smaller clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shea, this outfit looks so small,\" Carlie said while holding it up. It was a navy blue shirt that was so skinny, Carlie could wear it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I wore that when I moved over here. I was really small then. Now, I'm just getting obese,\" Shea said as she patted her bigger belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I took some of your smaller clothes so they won't go to waste?\" Carlie asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Be my guest,\" Shea said while munching on more candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to say, you really have nice clothes,\" Carlie said. She noticed some of Shea's hats as well and tried on a white one with tassels and a big white puff ball on top. After a few minutes, she took it off and continued looking through Shea's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I try my best. I mean, I'm getting bigger, but I do still like to have some nice clothing,\" Shea said as she noticed Emily on the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Emily. What are you doing?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just looking at some clothing online to buy. I've found some good stuff,\" Emily said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of good stuff, how's Leonard?\" Carlie asked Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's doing well. Hopefully, we will go on another date soon. I just need to wait and see,\" Shea said as she let out a burp. All of the girls started to giggle. </span></div></div>",

But since obesity is growing, people are also making nice clothes for fat people. Like in that movie Phat Girls. Well, that girl made clothes for herself and she was fat. But the clothes were nice and all... you know what I mean?\" Carlie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I have no idea. I understood it until you said that movie Phat Girl. Then it got a little blurry,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlie sighed and started over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. There is a movie called Phat Girls. The main character is a fat girl with a fat female friend and another female friend who's more or less a skinny twig. However, that main character designs her own clothes, which are clothes for fat people. Personally, I thought they looked really good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I understand. Sounds like a fun movie. Two fat girls and one skinny twig. Hey, that's us!\" Shea said, causing them all three to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it would be fun designing our own clothing,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea rolled her eyes. When she was about five years old, she once got her finger stuck in the sewing machine. It was one of the most painful and embarrassing moments of her life. Luckily, her mother saw what happened and turned it off or else she would have lost her finger. But nonetheless, she had scars to remember it. She also got a hatred for sewing. But maybe designing clothes was okay. As long as she didn't need to sew them. Designing could be pretty fun. During art class, she always liked to give characters on her drawings nice clothing.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls! Lunch is ready!\" Aunt Yenna yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea and Emily quickly ran downstairs. Carlie looked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it possible that such large people can move so fast?\" She asked to herself as she lifted her shoulders and then went after her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe it when she saw all the food on the table. There was so much. She had a bit trouble wondering if the three of them could eat all that, but then decided she better first get something to eat before her two obese girlfriends ate all the food. Aunt Yenna smiled when seeing how the girls enjoyed her food. She was glad she offered her sibling to take care of Shea. Shea seemed to have a great time here and she really liked having Shea and her friends over. Before, she had been lonely sometimes. Now, there was at least someone home instead of arriving in a empty house. She also hoped that Shea would ask her on advice later for things like dating and school work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the girls stuffed themselves like there was no tomorrow. Well, at least Shea and Emily did. Carlie ate just her normal small portions. Her Mom never understood how she had so much energy while she ate so little.<br>\r\nThe food was quickly gone if you considered how much it had been. Shea and Emily laid back with bloated and round bellies. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wondered how Aunt Yenna could clean so much so fast. She really did a lot of things like cook, clean, and work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute. We don't have swimsuits. So how are we going to swim?\" Carlie asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. You didn't swim with us last time. We don't swim with a suit,\" Emily said as she started to take off her clothing.

I'll try!\" Carlie said as she started to strip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, all the girls were naked in front of one another. Carlie's body was flat and skinny for the most part with some nice curves. Emily and Shea were definitely opposite of Carlie as their bellies were hanging, thighs touching, arms looked stuffed, and their butts had some ripples. After seeing each other, they all jumped into the pool and started splashing one another. They were all really having fun. After a little bit of swimming, Emily looked at Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Before I leave, we should see how much we both weigh. I'm curious about it,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.

She was thin, but with enough curves that could attract some guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it that your Aunt has a pool in her house?\" Carlie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know. I never asked her. But I must admit I am glad we have one. Besides, being in the water makes our bodies less heavier. That's one of the less nice things about being fat. Your body gets very heavy. When you get really, really, really obese, you're so heavy that your feet can't even support your weight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't have to worry about that. CANNONBALL!\" Carlie shouted and jumped in the air curled up into a ball, which made a huge splash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I bet I can make an even bigger one!\" Emily said while climbing out of the pool, making her fat body jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped and curled up to a perfect ball into the pool. Emily made a way bigger splash than Carlie thanks to her bigger body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!

Shea jumped in, causing a mini tsunami that came right on the heads of her two friends. Emily's new colored hair was hanging before her face like a curtain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! Fun in the pool?\" Emily said while she whipped her hair away from her face.\"Well I think it's slowly time we went out,\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know what I would like to do before we weigh?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. What?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to the sauna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You don't mean your Aunt has a sauna too... does she?\" Carlie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you bet she does,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we go in there? I love the sauna, but I almost never can go in there even though I really like it. Besides, sweating is really healthy and I think it is better to sweat before you weigh yourself,\" Carlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine with me,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well all right then,\" Shea said while putting on a towel. \"I'll ask Aunt Yenna if she can turn the sauna on,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea went into the living room and saw Aunt Yenna dressed in a robe while watching T.V with some Cola. Aunt Yenna looked up with a friendly smile when she saw Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Shea. Is there something you want to ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we wanted to go to the sauna. So could you put it on please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't have to. I just went and it's still on. You and your friends go ahead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea ran as fast as her chubby legs could carry herself back to the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news. Aunt Yenna just used the sauna and it's still on. So we can go right in it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if we're going into the sauna, you'll have to be naked! Are you fine with that Carlie?\" Emily asked and dropped her towel while showing her naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have totally no problem with that!\" Carlie said while also dropping her towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I also don't have a problem. So what are you standing here for? Let's go to the sauna!\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, all three were in the sauna. Soon, sweat was appearing on their foreheads and in their armpits. After that, it was over the rest of their bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels so good,\" Carlie mumbled while lying on her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea and Emily were both sitting slowly while rubbing the sweat over their naked body.     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I had one relationship with a guy named Scott Jones a while ago. It didn't work out well. He was kind of weird and was way too attached to me,\" Carlie said with her eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by attached?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He started saying I love you and constantly texted me.

Is there anyone you really like?\" Shea asked with some curiousity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily, who was lying on her belly, sat up normally and looked at Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish.

I can help you, too,\" Carlie said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks guys. We will just have to see who will like my new body,\" Emily said while rubbing her sides. \"Well Shea, how are you and Leonard?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we are doing well.

Carlie closed the door and looked at her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really have to weigh myself, you know. I don't try to gain. I'm just a bit of a rebel,\" Carlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebel against the idea that slender girls are beautiful. I like that. In those stupid magazines, people tell you that you need to be thin to look nice or to wear cool clothing. It's just stupid,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Those pictures are not even real. They're photo shopped. Take a picture of just any girl. Then they hide her acne and her zits and all other things. They work away wrinkles, pump up the breasts a bit, and make the waist a bit smaller. I saw it once on T.V. About 90% of those photos are totally fake. They can let any fat girl look slender,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough talking. Let's get weighing,\" Emily said. \"I want to know my exact weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter those words, she threw away her towel and stepped naked on the scale while she closed her eyes. She took a  few deep breaths and opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"112 pounds! That's a... let's see. How much was it last time? 90 pounds, right? So that's a gain of 22 pounds! I'm turning into a real fat girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Shea. It's your turn!\" Carlie said. \"Step on the scale and let's see how much you weigh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea also dropped her towel and slowly stepped on the scale. She looked down and enjoyed that it was getting a bit difficult for seeing past her big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what is it? What's the number?\" Emily asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"134 pounds. That's a gain of... 20 pounds. Who knows, Emily. You might beat me one day,\" Shea said and looked at Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily didn't look at Shea's face, but looked a bit lower at Shea's chest. Shea quickly picked up her towel and wrapped it around her body. She knew very well how bad Emily wanted breasts of her own now that the breasts of her best friend had grown a bit. It must be a bit harder for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Cheer up, Emily. You gained even more than me. So you do weigh a bit less than me, but I had a head start!\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. I doesn't bother me so much,\" Emily said and quickly smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should slowly put our clothes back on,\" Carlie suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. That's a good idea. They're still by the pool,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls walked back to the pool and put their clothes back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Carlie. You didn't weigh yourself,\" Emily suddenly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't care about my weight. I also don't care if I lost or gained. So why would I weigh myself? By the way, it's been a long time since I weighed myself last. So I wouldn't know how much I gained,\" Carlie reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think my Mom noticed my weight gain,\" Emily said. \"But she seemed kind of happy. Maybe because I always used to be a lightweight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea put her socks back on when...  <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Well I called you up here because I have to run a few errands. Your friends can stay over as long as their parents don't mind that I will be gone for a little bit,\" Aunt Yenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Where are you going?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to get some groceries, get you some school supplies, and a few other things,\" Aunt Yenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy. School supplies. Hopefully that time will never come,\" Shea said while rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. It is still a little while away. Just enjoy the summer for now! And by the way, I made some desserts and put them in the refrigerator. There is also some ice cream in the freezer. I don't care if you guys eat all of it. Do what you want. Just don't destroy the house,\" Aunt Yenna said with a smile as she began to walk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! See you later!\" Shea said to her Aunt as she walked out the door. She then realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, home alone with my friends. I wonder how many desserts she was talking about,\" Shea said as she opened up the refrigerator and freezer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Shea's mouth opened wide. They were both packed with desserts of all sorts. There was at least enough desserts to feed a classroom! Aunt Yenna had made cake, brownies, pies, even rice crispy treats. On top of those, there were more desserts plus ice cream. Shea smiled and licked her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls! Come up here!\" Shea yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, she began to hear their footsteps as they were running upstairs. Shea continued to look at the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, we are all going to be fat after this!\" Shea said with a grin.</span></div></div>",

I mean, we had lunch not too long ago,\" Carlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we went in the sauna. I heard that all that steam makes you lose weight. So we need to put some extra weight on,\" Emily said with a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a moment,\" Carlie said. \"Are you two planning to eat this all? Don't you see how much it is? I mean, do you really think you will be able to eat it all? It's a lot of food, you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know... and I guess the only way to find out if we are able to finish it is... to try it,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words, Shea and Emily took all the desserts and put them on the big table. Carlie lifted her shoulders one time and helped them. She must admit that the desserts looked delicious. She wasn't really hungry, but she could eat. Carlie thought to eat maybe a few bites of each dessert before Emily and Shea ate all of it. She liked her new friends, but she thought their gluttony sometimes took them over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! That was the last plate,\" Shea said. \"Lets eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment, Shea started to eat. Well, eating wasn't really the right word for it. She was really stuffing the food in her mouth with great speed with brownies in each hand. Emily quickly also took some of them. Carlie also, but she looked at Shea. She ate like if she almost starved. Shea kept eating with great speed. The cake, the pies, and everything else. Emily was afraid a few times when she saw how much food Shea had in her mouth, thinking she would choke. But everytime, Shea was able to swallow it all. But finally, Emily thought it was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shea, take it easy! It's not a race!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea stopped eating for a moment. Then she slowly looked at the plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! What did I do? I made a complete pig out of myself. I didn't really realize what happened. I was lost just like that time with Leonard, only with something else this time. That's with eating,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second... what was that with Leonard?\" Carlie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that. Well we... we were cuddling and... one thing lead to another...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU TWO HAD SEX!\" Carlie yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! But I must admit, it was close. We were both naked... But I decided that I didn't think I was ready for it. Besides, I don't use he pill. I don't want to be a teenage mommy!\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you don't get pregnant from sex. At least not from just one time,\" Carlie said. \"If you got pregnant from each time someone had sex, then there would be at least one hundred times more people than now,\" Carlie continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter how many times you do it, but when you do it. You can get pregnant from one time sex. It just has to be at the right time. If you do it at the right time, you can get pregnant. Then one time is all you need,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suppose you do want to get pregnant. Then when is it the right time to do it?\" Carlie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know. I thought it has something to do with your period. You can't get pregnant if you never had your period,\" Emily answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we have to worry about that now,\" Shea answered. \"When we get into high school, they'll teach us all about it and until then, let's not worry about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right. For now, let's enjoy being a virgin!\" Emily shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Emily... We still have some desserts left,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls started to eat again and Carlie also took a bite. After some time, they suddenly realized they had eaten every dessert up to the last crumb. Shea and Emily both held their bloated bellies, but both felt good, fat, and happy. <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

His ice cream parlor is closed tomorrow. So, I was just wondering if you wanted me to feed you all of the ice cream. My Uncle gave me a key and it would only be you and me there,\" Leonard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Shea's fatter face lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I would love to do that! Do I need to do anything?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome. Well you don't have to dress fancy. I mean it's going to be a lot of ice cream and you will probably get very messy. If anything, wear like some stretch pants and a white t-shirt. Also, you may want to bundle up in winter clothing because we would need to take out stuff in the freezer a lot. I don't want you to freeze over,\" Leonard commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I can do that.

Still 45 minutes before he comes. I better get ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea waddled over the her closet and looked through her clothes for some time before she found what she was looking for. It was some elastic pants. They used to be from Aunt Yenna. Shea must admit that they didn't look bad considering she bought this about fourteen years ago. They were still in pretty good shape.<br>\r\nShe took some panties and thought one moment about if she should wear a bra or not. Since her boobs were bigger and since she went on a date and her t-shirt might get messy, she decided to wear one just to look a bit more presentable. If she kept gaining like this and her boobs would keep growing, then she really would need to wear one everyday. This thought made her smile while she looked for a loose white t-shirt, which was a bit hard since her clothes were getting more tight than getting looser. But finally, she found an old one somewhere in the back of her closet. She also took some long pants. <br>\r\nLeonard told her to take some winter clothing. She decided to take that in a bag. It was not that she minded wearing them, but outside, it was still pretty warm and she didn't want to be all sweaty on her date. Except maybe for her hat. She just liked to wear it. Besides, there were also other people who like to wear hats or caps. So why not a winter hat? She thought one moment and also took a second t-shirt. If her first got really messy, she could always put on another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm I wonder what Victoria is doing today. She doesn't know about the date, but perhaps we will see her on the way. She won't like it, but I don't really care what she thinks!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea walked over to her mirror. She decided to put on just a bit make up. She put on just enough to look nice, but not enough to really notice it except maybe the lipstick.<br>\r\nShe also brushed her hair and looked in the mirror. It looked nice and brushed once more through her hair.<br>\r\nThen she heard the door bell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's for me!\" Shea yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea ran down the stairs, taking two steps together, and jumped the last three steps.<br>\r\nShe brushed through her hairs and opened the door. There was Leonard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Shea. Wow! You look fantastic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea doubted that many people would say that to a girl wearing elastic clothing and a loose white t-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have your winter clothes?\" Leonard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I have them right in this bag, but I decided since it's pretty warm to put them on there or else I will sweat before we are there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's a good idea. I would look a bit strange wearing coats and gloves in the summer,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked outside and Shea took the time to look around. She liked the houses here and the people. Some people who were outside greeted them friendly. Shea must admit that they were way more friendly than some people in her old neighborhood. She hardly knew the people there. At some places, she could smell the weed all the way from the street. But she doubted anyone here used weed or drugs. Leonard took her right through the middle of the village.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they walked through the village, the two held hands and looked around until they had reached the main street. Even though it looked old fashioned, there were still many places. Immediately, Shea spotted the ice cream parlor that Leonard had talked about earlier. As they approached the door, Leonard went to get out a pair of keys. Shea noted how it was dark inside from being closed that day. The next minute, Leonard opened the door and walked Shea inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Shea, what do you think?\" Leonard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea started to look around when Leonard turned on the lights to the place. Shea noticed that it was definitely a place for families to hang out because of the rainbow colors, pictures of ice cream, and even some arcade games to top it off. But overall, Shea felt the place had a friendly vibe to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really nice, Leonard. I like it already,\" Shea grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Well, I'm going to see if my Uncle left me any notes around here. Go ahead and get into your winter clothes,\" Leonard said with a grin as he walked to the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Shea opened her bag and started to take out her stuff. To start with, Shea put on her winter jacket and zipped it up, making her look more fat. Following that, Shea put on a pair of matching gloves that had a soft texture to the touch. Finally, Shea put on her favorite winter hat and pulled it down on her head. She then looked at herself in a mirror nearby and began to make sure she looked perfect for Leonard. Minutes later, Leonard walked in and saw Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found the note. And wow. Even when you are covered up like this, you still look good,\" Leonard said as he and Shea got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. This is my favorite clothing,\" Shea said with a grin as she pulled her hat down more and inched closer to Leonard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpontaniously, the two began to kiss each other, just enjoying their privacy. A minute later, they pulled back and slowly laughed as Leonard began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let the date begin!\"</span></div></div>",

Follow me,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious Leonard had been here more often. He knew exactly which way he needed to go and where the light switch was. They finally reached a thick door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the freezer,\" Leonard said while he pushed a button. \"Alright. When we get in, we need to close the door again or else it gets warm in here and then all the other food will spoil. So... ready? Let's go,\" Leonard said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard opened the door. Shea felt the cold air in her face. Quickly, she stepped inside and was followed by Leonard who closed the door the moment they went inside. Shea looked around. Shea knew some restaurants had big freezers, but this one seemed very big. Shea was glad she put on winter clothing since it was very cold in here. Shea could see her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here!\" Leonard said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was standing on the other side of the freezer by a shelf with a few different boxes of ice cream. Shea walked over to him and read the labels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strawberry, chocolate, vanilla, mint, banana, forest fruit, coconut, mango,\" Shea said as she stopped reading for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Everything at this shelf needs to be taken out. After that, I need to take a few boxes from that other shelf over there. My Uncle told me how he wanted that, but you don't have to do that. But let's take your food outside,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth grabbed some boxes and put them next to the door. After that, Leonard put a few boxes from the other shelf on the free made shelf. He checked it a few times. Shea waited patiently. She started to get really hungry. She didn't eat anything this day since she knew she would get a lot of ice cream, but with her new food intake, her body wasn't used to being without food for so long. But she decided to wait until he was finished. <br>\r\nShe looked a moment at the boxes of ice cream for her and must admit she didn't suspect it was so many. Thinking about how much they weighed, they must be almost full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's done. Now back to what's really important,\" Leonard said with a smile while he walked back to Shea. \"Alright. I'll open the door and you'll hand me the boxes,\" Leonard said.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much ice cream would fit in here?\" Shea asked and slapped her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's find out,\" Leonard said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door and walked outside, already taking a few boxes. Shea handed him the boxes as fast as she could. When she was done, she walked out of the freezer and closed the door. Leonard pushed the button another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that button for?\" Shea asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The light switch,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard grabbed a cart and put the boxes on it. He wheeled it back to the eating place. Shea went sitting and took her jacket and gloves of. She didn't need them there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Which one do you want to taste first?\" Leonard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it matter? They are all going to end up in the same place,\" Shea said with a wide grin.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Eh Shea... is it okay if I... feed you? If you don't want to, it's fin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love it if you would feed me. I would like that a lot,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard got red, grabbed a spoon, and opened the first box of ice cream. Shea opened her mouth wide and Leonard pushed a full spoonful in her mouth. Shea felt like she was in heaven.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All Shea could feel was spoonful after spoonful of ice cream going down her throat. She could taste the richness of the ice cream and savored the flavor. The first one that Leonard began to feed her was vanilla. The whole time, Shea just closed her eyes and let Leonard do the feeding. Shea would just lean her head back and let out a moan of bliss from the ice cream. Multiple spoonfuls had entered Shea's mouth and one could tell from the amount of ice cream that was over her face. Shea looked like a sloppy pig with all of her loose clothes, her winter hat on, and with ice cream smeared around her face. She especially loved the feeling of the cold ice cream reaching the bottom of her stomach. After a half hour of eating, Leonard had reached the bottom of the vanilla ice cream box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Shea, you finished one,\" Leonard said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea opened her eyes, feeling like she was still in a sedated state. She could eat more ice cream, but Shea did feel stuffed from the first batch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. That's so delicious. That's the best ice cream I have ever had,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad you like it. We could do this more often,\" Leonard said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea smiled, thinking about how lucky she was as Leonard got another bin of ice cream ready, which made Shea wonder something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonard, out of all the girls in this town, why me? What made you like me so much?\" Shea asked with a small grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for one thing, I love how fat you are. And don't take that offensively. I think you are the prettiest girl I have ever seen. That, and you are not like the other girls here. Some can be nice, but many are not as caring and bright spirited as you. No matter what, I feel so happy around you and you constantly move me, Shea,\" Leonard said, making Shea feel like the happiest girl on earth as if hearts were being shown in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard then sat next to Shea on her side of the both as they began to kiss. Shea had never felt so happy in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. You take my breath away,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I try my best,\" Leonard smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Leonard, do you mind if.... well.... I wanted to try and eat this ice cream differently just to see if you like it. After this bucket, you could feed me normally again. Is that okay?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Anything for you,\" Leonard smiled as he put a bucket of chocolate ice cream in front of Shea, making her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Shea stuck her head into the bucket of ice cream, eating the ice cream like a dog would eat out of a bowl. Shea was making a pig of herself, getting her face and hat messy with chocolate stains. Shea was feeling like she was in ecstasy as Leonard watched and smiled at his girlfriend. </span></div></div>",

She didn't even notice how full she was getting. Hours went by and some ice cream already melted and Shea could drink the melted stuff, instantly loving it. Slowly, but surely, all the ice cream found its way to Shea's stomach. She didn't notice this until Leonard stopped feeding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Why did you stop?\" She asked disappointedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no ice cream left,\" Leonard said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? That can't be! I can't have eaten all of it!\" Shea screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around and saw all the empty boxes of ice cream. She then noticed her shirt that was covered in ice cream stains and her huge belly. Shea suddenly noticed that her pants weren't buttoned anymore. It seemed her button popped off and she didn't even notice it. She looked at her huge bloated belly. She suddenly noticed how stuffed she was and wondered how she had been able to eat so much ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought you would be able to eat all of it,\" Leonard said surprised. \"Sure, I knew you could eat a lot, but this much? It's really unbelievable. By the way, I found your pants button. I thought you might want to get it back. I'm sure your Aunt can put it back on. She is good with a sewing machine,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate sewing machines. I once got my finger stuck in one,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! I'm sure that was kind of painful,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, tell me about it. It took some time before my finger fully healed. But I kept some scars to remind me about it. Ever since then, I'm not such a big fan of sewing. It's one of my most painful moments,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say I enjoyed feeding you all the ice cream. I thought it was a perfect date. You saw this like a date, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet I saw this like a date. A perfect date. Our second date. Both were great,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I must admit I told my parents about you. Hope you don't mind,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course I don't, silly. But you didn't tell them what happened at my room, did you?\" Shea asked feeling scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Of course not. I don't think my parents would be happy with that. They won't be angry at you, but at me. But anyway, they wanted to meet you during a dinner. I promised them I would ask you seeing when you can come,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know,\" Shea mumbled. \"I mean, I do want to meet your parents, but I'm not sure if Aunt Yenna planned anything. But as long as she hasn't... I would love to come. But warn you mother that I'm a big eater!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to stand up, but fell back down on her chair with her fat butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I'm too full to stand. BUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRP!!! Oh! Excuse me. Give me some time to digest this food,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. But since you're going to meet my parents, tell me in the meantime something about your parents. What I also wondered was did you always have a big belly?\" Leonard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... alright. I will tell you,\" Shea said.       </span></div></div>",

In some ways, they even spoiled me. I mean, being an only child, they did everything I asked for the most part. Every year, my Mom and I would go on shopping sprees. She got me into clothes, especially winter clothes. I have always liked that fashion,\" Shea said as she pointed to her hat and jacket. Suddenly, she took a second and burped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Shea said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. Continue,\" Leonard said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, so when I was younger, let's say five, I was a twig. I was probably one of the skinniest girls in my school. But then, I kept on liking sugar. I would consume more and more with my parents letting me at free will. Overtime, I put on a bunch of weight. By the time I was about eight, I was at least twenty pounds overweight,\" Shea said with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well, what happened then?\" Leonard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had a hard time staying fit and my parents noticed. So, my parents began putting me in sports and changed my diet. I hated sports and I felt like I barely ate anything. I mean, I would usually sneak food as much as I could. Anyway, after a while, I quit sports and my parents were starting to shift my diet to normal. I had lost a decent amount of weight, but I was still chubby. I was as chubby as I was when I came here,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Well, I'm happy I helped you gain more to break your limits,\" Leonard said, making Shea laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I am too. But anyway, after a while, my parents had more to do. My Dad was able to own his own business and my Mom helped out, leaving me alone a lot, hence how my diet started to shift. They became so busy, they decided to expand their company. My Dad one day told me that he and my Mom had to leave for a while, but they were not sure how long. I resented them for it because they left me behind. But now, I'm happy that they did. I got to meet my amazing Aunt, new friends, and you,\" Shea said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad, too,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was with my parents, I had met this boy named Nick. He liked me and basically cheated on me when I left. He became fatter though and just forgot about me. I am just so happy that you won't do that to me,\" Shea said, making Leonard smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard then wrapped his arm around Shea and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will never do that to you,\" Leonard said, reaching in for a passionate kiss, which covered his face in ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! Your face is going to be sticky now!\" Shea pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care,\" Leonard grinned, continuing to kiss her.</span></div></div>",

To be honest, she totally forgot about him or any good moments with him. Not any moment with him went half as well as with Leonard. But with Nick, he wasn't feeding her. Of course, back then, she didn't try to gain. But feeding her felt so good just like stuffing herself. She liked all those things, which were things she never did before. Perhaps it was meant that she became a fat girl. That God (if he existed) made her to be a fat girl. That would be nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Shea... if you want, you can meet my parents right now. They're at home. Then we can have that dinner a few days after that,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love to, but I think I better first change my shirt,\" Shea said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea first pulled off her dirty hat. She then pulled off her shirt and used it like a napkin to clean her face. After that, she looked in her bag for a clean shirt she took. Leonard blushed seeing Shea in her bra. Shea noticed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on. You saw me naked already. So what does it matter if you see me in my bra?\" Shea asked. \"I must admit I feel a lot better now. At least I can walk,\" Shea said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard pulled Shea up. Shea looked at the mess on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... don't we need to clean that up? I don't think you Uncle would like it if... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'll clean it up tomorrow morning before he comes,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked through the small streets to Leonard's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope your parents like me. Do they mind that you're dating a fat girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. To tell you the truth, my Mom likes girls with a healthy appetite. She doesn't really likes those anorexic girls that only drink mineral water and think they're already overweight if they gain a single ounce. No, my Mom likes it more when the girl is more like... you. She does like it if the girl is fat. That's why I dared to tell her about the fact I loved fat girls. She was happy to hear it. A good thing, too,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about your Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a funny thing, too. My Dad was very close with his Uncle. His Uncle used to travel a lot and told my Dad stories about natives and wild animals. Sounded like he had a really exciting life. My Dad adored him. Anyway, he told me that those natives didn't like the thought that fat was ugly. Over there, it was seen like beauty and a sign of wealth. My Uncle started to think this way, too. This way, my Dad also never saw fat girls as ugly. We're here,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea put on big eyes. This building was so big. She suspected that this was city hall or a museum, but Leonard opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you live here?\" Shea asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's way too big, but my parents like it. It's their...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was interrupted by a high voice and running footsteps as Shea saw a young, fat girl running over to Leonard with her fat belly jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonard! Leonard! You're home!\" She yelled and jumped in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's a good thing Leonard is so strong</i>, Shea said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! I also have a little sister.

And she's your sister!\" Shea said, feeling shocked that he was so calm with his sister. Normally, siblings were more vulgar towards each other. Leonard, however, seemed nuturing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do what I can. Now come on. Let's meet my parents,\" Leonard said as he walked Shea to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Shea walked in, she noticed the smells of food being prepared. She looked over towards the oven and noticed a lady in a white apron preparing the food. She wasn't fat, but she wasn't completely skinny. A moment later, Shea realized who the lady was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonard, dear! How was your day?\" Asked the lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mom. It was great. I just spent the day with Shea. Shea, this is my Mom. Mom, this is Shea,\" Leonard said as he introduced the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot of good things about you. I've also heard of your healthy appetite!\" Leonard's Mom said to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very nice to meet you, too. And thank you for having me over,\" Shea said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, a man walked into the kitchen. Again, this man was not fat, but was not skinny as he supported a smaller belly on his frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this Shea, Leonard? She looks like she eats well. That's how I thought of it,\" Leonard's Dad said as he proceeded to shake Shea's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you too, sir,\" Shea said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonard, why don't you show Shea around the house? I'll have dinner ready in a few minutes! Shea, make yourself at home for the time being!\" Leonard's Mom said as she continued to cook dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! Nice to meet you both!\" Shea said as Leonard and herself walked out of the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

After that, we can have dinner if you want, of course,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I would like that. I only hope you have enough food. But I'm still pretty stuffed from all the ice cream. So I probably won't eat that much,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. My parents wanted to invite you and your Aunt. But since you're here now, they can first meet you and after that, we can have that dinner with you and your Aunt. My parents are nice, but sometimes, they care a bit too much about my life,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least they didn't drop you off with some relative you hardly know in a place were you don't know anybody,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. A place without a shopping center, without clubs, and without a movie theater. That's what most kids out of the big city say,\" Leonard admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really care about those things too much. Don't get me wrong. This village and the people here are all very nice except for Victoria. But my parents and I didn't know that. It might have been just as well if most people here were awful. Besides, I hardly knew my Aunt. But anyway, I thought you would show me around the house?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile saying this, Shea suddenly remembered she didn't see all rooms in Aunt Yenna's house. She really needed to do that once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is the living room and this is the dinner room,\" Leonard said while he lead her around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was surprised. It seemed like Leonard had anything he wanted while she saw all rooms he showed her. He brought her upstairs and opened a door while he said: \"Hillary's room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea smiled. Hillary was having a tea party with her stuffed animals. She clearly didn't like that Leonard suddenly entered her room as she showed that by throwing a small chair at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock first before you enter my room!\" She yelled. \"What if I had been naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing to see what I haven't seen before,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHillary lifted her arm with her teapot, but suddenly put him back on the table. Good idea since it was made from stone and would probably break. But Leonard needed to watch out for the football she threw at his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's move on,\" He said. \"My parents bedroom, the bathroom, and this is my bedroom,\" Leonard continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea walked inside. It was almost as big as her bedroom at Aunt Yenna's house and also was with a music center, a television, and even a DVD player. There was also a desk, two bean bag chairs, a bookcase, and a lot of normal boy stuff with of course a bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a nice room,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like it. Sorry about the mess. I should have cleaned,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I don't mind. You need to be able to be yourself,\" Shea smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner time!\" Leonard's mother suddenly yelled.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Quickly, Hillary started to run downstairs to the kitchen as Shea and Leonard slowly followed. All in all, Shea seemed hungry, but she was still a little bit stuffed from eating the ice cream earlier. As she walked into the kitchen, the smell began to empower her youthful mind as she felt hungry again. Leonard sat Shea down as he sat next to her. Leonard's Mom sat down along with Leonard's Dad while Hillary sat next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I made some mashed potatoes and gravy, Parmesan crusted chicken, homemade onion rings, corn bread, and some deep fried green beans. Dig in everyone! There's plenty for a village to eat,\" Leonard's Mom joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea looked on and noticed that there was a ton of food! It seemed that out of anyone, Hillary was getting the fattest results. However, Shea could tell that she would be next to join that group. Immediately, everyone grabbed as much food as they can, but Leonard's Dad looked at Shea's plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you can grab more than that,\" he said with a smile to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea's face turned red as she grabbed more, trying to impress Leonard's Dad and the rest of them. One thing that Shea noticed about the food was that it was all greasy, making it even more delicious in Shea's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shea, I saw that you had a bag of dirty clothes. I put all of it in the washing machine for you. I'll have it ready for you before you leave!\" Leonard's Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks! You didn't have to do that,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. Leonard told me that you had dirty clothes. I felt like it would help you to have them cleaned,\" Leonard's Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I appreciate it very much,\" Shea said with a smile in between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell us more about yourself, Shea,\" Leonard's Dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I used to live away from here, but my parents had to take a job that meant I had to be left here with my Aunt Yenna. I haven't been here for super long, but I am really liking it so far,\" Shea admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great! Are you getting to know people well?\" Leonard's Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely! And it's nice since school is starting up soon,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! Well, hopefully you and Leonard will have the same teacher then. You probably will since it is a smaller town,\" Leonard's Dad said, making Shea grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope as well,\" Shea said as she smiled at Leonard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Shea had finished the food on her plate while talking with the family. The family had noticed that she had finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take more, Shea! Eat until it's all gone!\" Leonard's Mom said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea couldn't say no since the food was delicious and she was still feeling hungry, which would play a good part in her weight gain in the end.</span></div></div>",

At least not for real. There was no sea where I lived. I hardly saw the sea,\" she said while looking out, seeing water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Dinner and dessert, Leonard took her to the attic. From there, they got on the roof and were now looking at the sunset. In the meantime, Leonard, of course, rubbed Shea's belly, who was very happy with that especially since she ate so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're a real city girl?\" Leonard said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I wouldn't say I'm a city girl,\" Shea said. \"Sure, the place where I first lived had a lot of fun things, and fun people. I can't say no to that, but I really like living here, and also, all the other people. I'm really starting to like them,\" Shea admitted.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Them and your belly,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled when she heard that. She never had been such a thin girl wannabe who ate nothing but salad and mineral water to stay thin, who already screamed if she gained a single ounce, and who went to the gym every afternoon. She wasn't like that. She preferred eating a big, greasy, tasty hamburger and some cola for lunch, not caring if she gained two pound, and rather watched a good movie every afternoon while sitting on the couch with a big bag of chips. Yes, she really started to love her big belly and also loved the shape and how soft it was. It was just perfect in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I come here a lot, but always alone. Never with someone else. Not even Kathrine,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is that?\" Shea asked Leonard, a bit worried she might have some competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That tall blond girl at the barbecue. She wore some sunglasses and wore a pink tank top. Kind of slender...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea suddenly remembered, but didn't really put much attention to her. She was at least two years older. Her cup size was huge proof of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she's my cousin. We're kind of close. We weren't only cousins, but also neighbors. So we hang out a lot together. We're still good friends,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea sighed, feeling relieved. For a moment, she was scared Leonard had another girlfriend. However, a cousin was fine. She should probably meet her somewhere in the next few days. After all, if Leonard really was close with his cousin, she would probably meet her soon. Suddenly, she noticed the sun was almost gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonard, this is all terrific and all. It really is, but I think I slowly need to go back home. I bet Aunt Yenna is worried about where I am,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she wait at home for you with dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope not! I'm so stuffed. If so, I will end up tonight as round as a barrel,\" Shea said while patting her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went back inside and walked downstairs, suddenly seeing Leonard's parents. She walked over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was nice meeting you guys. It was a delicious dinner! Thank you so much, but I need to go home now. I guess my Aunt is getting kind of worried,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! You're not going,\" Leonard's Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... excuse me?\" Shea asked, thinking she didn't understand it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said you're not going. It's already dark. I'll take you home with my car. I want to schedule a dinner with both of you anyway. Leonard, you need to stay here. You Mom is leaving in a few minutes to take your Grandma to bingo and somebody has to be here to watch Hillary. Say goodbye,\" Leonard's Dad said as he left the room to get his keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked each other in the eyes and kissed long, deeply, and passionately. Shea felt her heart performing cartwheels and felt an explosion of butterflies in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, Leonard,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, Shea,\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Shea grabbed her bag of clean clothes as Leonard's Dad drove Shea to her Aunt's home.</span></div></div>",

There you are. I was getting a little worried,\" Aunt Yenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. I was with Leonard all day,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't too worried.

Shea was a pleasure to have. Me and the rest of the family would love to have you both over,\" He said to Aunt Yenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great! When would you like to have us over?\" Aunt Yenna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does three days sound? On Saturday?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great! We will be there. Thanks for having her and driving her home,\" Aunt Yenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem! Have a good night, guys!\" He said as he walked out of the room and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your day, Aunt Yenna?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was very nice. I just tried to relax for the day, but I decided to make some dinner. Are you hungry?\" Aunt Yenna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! I mean, I ate at Leonard's house, but I can't say no to your food,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Well it will be ready in a few. Why don't you go upstairs and shower? Dinner will be ready after that,\" Aunt Yenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea went upstairs with her bag of clothes and headed into her room. She put the bag down on her bed as she looked around her room for pajamas. After a short time of looking, she found loose fitting pink sweat pants with the words pink embedded on the back of them. She found herself a loose fitting white tank top. She continued to look in her closet, seeing her collection of hats. She decided she wanted to wear one, having her eye caught on a white hat with white tassels, huge balls attached to them, and then a huge white ball on the top of the hat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea grabbed the clothes accompanied with a towel, walked into the bathroom, and began to strip. As she did so, she observed her body and noticed how much she had gained, curious about her body and her size.</span></div></div>",

She went standing naked on the scale and tried to look past her belly to see the numbers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"145? That can't be. It was just 134 just a day ago. I can't have gained elven pounds in one day. Can I?\" She looked again at the numbers, but it was still 145 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea suddenly thought about all that ice cream she ate plus the dinner. Now, she was going to eat even more. She was slowly acting like such a fat pig. For some strange reason, she didn't even understand herself, but she must admit that she liked it. She looked in the mirror and noticed her boobs again. She took a boob in each hand and softly squeezed them. They were noticeably bigger than when she arrived here. Probably with all the weight she gained, a small part went to her boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need to start using a bra,\" Shea mumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went into the shower. While she turned the water on, she thought she could maybe buy a few bras tomorrow. But she didn't want to go alone. She still didn't know the village that well. She thought a moment about asking Emily to come, but realized that maybe that wasn't such a good idea. Not that she didn't liked Emily. She liked Emily a lot, but she was still a bit sensitive when it was about boobs. Asking her to shop for bras while she didn't have any boobs wasn't such a good idea. But she could maybe ask somebody else. It would be a girl of course. Carlie also had a flat chest, Sandy also had no boobs, and then she knew it: Jane. She had, just like her, developing breasts about her size. Well, about her size some time ago. Jane maybe wasn't really in need for a bra, but it wasn't such a bad idea to have a few.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will ask her tomorrow. She would probably anyway like to go shopping with me,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked how the water ran over her fat body. She really liked being fat. She started with gaining weight thanks to her Aunt Yenna's delicious cooking, then to help her friend Emily, and finally for Leonard and herself. Everyone wins. It was still so strange that so many girls her age were dieting to be thin. All they did included dieting, exercise, throwing up, and starving one's self. Why do that to yourself when a fat body is way more beautiful? That's all that Shea wondered. Another fact that showed humans are idiots. She slowly traveled with her hands over her body, exploring her new fat. She liked this. She liked it even more when Leonard did it. He had magical hands. But she also knew every girl at her new school would feel the same if Leonard did it with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well too bad for them, but he's mine and I'm not planning on letting him go. Not now, not ever. At least I hope not,\" Shea said and soaped her body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe must admit she was glad she ended up here with a nice Aunt and terrific cook, good friends, good boyfriend....She thought a moment about Victoria and added enemies to her list. After all, your life would be kind of boring without any enemies. Plus, Victoria didn't really act like she ever wanted to be her friend. Not that she would ever wanted Victoria to be her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned the water off, grabbed a towel, and rubbed herself dry. After that, she quickly put her clothes on and ran downstairs for dinner.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Aunt Yenna looked over at Shea and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you have been eating really well today,\" Aunt Yenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely. This feels like my millionth meal today,\" Shea grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it shows with your clothing right now,\" Aunt Yenna pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea looked down at her clothes and noticed how right her Aunt Yenna really was. Shea's loose fitting tank top felt really tight on her as her boobs and stomach poked up against it. Her belly even stuck out under her tank top, making it seem like a half shirt. On top of that, her sweat pants was still loose in some parts, but around her sides, it felt very tight. She felt like a muffin about to burst. Of course, her hat fit on her without ease, but her growing chin was definitely tightening up her space by her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I really have grown,\" Shea said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner is on the table for you. I am going to shower real quick. Feel free to eat all the food,\" Aunt Yenna said as she walked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Shea started to look at the table. All she could see was a fatty dinner full of tasty endings. In front of her was a plate filled with greasy, breaded fried chicken that was oozed with grease. Next to that was a huge bowl of Shea's favorite food: mashed potatoes caked in greasy gravy. In addition, Shea also saw that Aunt Yenna had made some french fries from scratch. Even with those, there was also a plate of deep fried green beans that sounded weird, but appetising to Shea at the same time. At the very end, Shea noticed that Aunt Yenna had also made a whole pecan pie. The dinner was truly a fat person's delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I really eat all of this?\" Shea wondered. She had eaten so much, she wondered if she would explode from packing so much into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well. What do I care? More fat for me,\" Shea grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Shea brought the bowl of mashed potatoes in front of her and looked into it. Forgetting all manners, Shea slammed her head into the bowl and began slurping the meal into her mouth. Even though she had silverware, she wanted to eat as much as fast as she could so she wouldn't change her mind about eating dinner. As she pigged into the bowl, Shea became messy with her face, hat, and shirt getting covered in gravy. But she didn't care as she grabbed her hat, sucked the gravy off of it, grabbed her shirt, and did the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached the bottom of the bowl, Shea reached out, trying to feel for the fried chicken. When her hands found it, she grabbed a piece and crammed it into her face as she tried to chew around the bone. All of the grease started to cake around her mouth as she bit into it piece after piece. All this time, Shea's belly became harder and harder as her body became rounder and rounder. Shea ignored her surroundings and only focused on stuffing herself crazy, whether it meant that she would get messy. She was truly obesessed with eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question now was if she was able to finish all of the dinner.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shea licked one time around her mouth to get all the caked grease around her mouth into her tummy. She grabbed more fried chicken and tried to rip the meat off the bones as fast as she could while she was chewing and swallowing it. She felt she was stuffed, but kept eating. After she licked the last bone clean, she grabbed the fries and started to push them in her mouth with both hands. But halfway through all the fries, Shea laid back. Her mouth was still full of fries, but she was sure she couldn't eat anymore. She didn't feel so good. Aunt Yenna walked back inside with her hair in a towel. When she saw Shea, she rushed over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shea, is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea slowly shook her head and spit out the fries on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm too full. I feel a bit sick as if I'm going to throw up,\" Shea admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, honey, it's fine with me if you want to gain weight, but you need to know your limit. If you eat more than your stomach can handle, you're going to throw up. Then you will lose all those calories. That way, you don't gain,\" Aunt Yenna assured Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burp! I feel terrible. My belly hurts,\" Shea said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! You poor thing. Let's get you into bed so that the food can digest,\" Aunt Yenna suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Yenna pulled Shea on her feet and slowly, with a lot of help from her Aunt, they reached Shea's room. She let herself fall down on her bed. Aunt Yenna pulled off Shea's shoes, socks, hat,  and then reached for her pants as she tugged them off. Shea let out a moan. Aunt Yenna walked out of the room and returned with a glass of water and a small pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, Shea. Swallow this pill with water. It will make you feel better. Believe me, I speak from experience. When I was young, I also sometimes didn't realize how much I could eat,\" Aunt Yenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea did what her Aunt said as she swallowed the pill with a sip of water. After that, she crawled under her blanket and tried to fall asleep, but she noticed after a few minutes that the pain in her belly slowly got less. She slowly rubbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made a complete pig out of myself today. Why didn't I stop when I felt full? I'm not someone who can eat non-stop. I shouldn't have eaten so much. BURP!!! Oops. Well apart from the pain, I had a fun day,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea looked at her belly. Tomorrow, all the food will be turned in to fat. She looked forward to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully I will feel better tomorrow. Anyway, I have been on two dates with Leonard. I believe on the third date, you can hold hands,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe giggled at this, remembering that at the first date, she almost had sex with him. Well, it was almost. Besides, kids started with sex younger and younger these days. There was more of a chance that two lovers had sex rather than a french kiss. Shea also heard somewhere that some did it for money, food, shelter, clothes, or other stuff. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"If I would do that, I would really be a slut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those thoughts in her head, she drifted away into a dreamless sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next thing Shea knew it, she was opening her eyes again to see that she was staring up at her ceiling. She immediately yawned as she raised her arms above her head. Sleepily, Shea began to rub her eyes from her rest, noticing that she felt better than she did last night. Before, she had felt so stuffed, she was about to throw up. Also, she felt as if her stomach was going to explode, although that could not happen to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the light shining through her window, Shea looked at her clock to see the time. She then read 9:08 as she realized it was still well into morning. However, she felt that she wouldn't be able to fall back asleep since she had already been in bed for so long. Slowly and drowsily, Shea brought her legs over to the side of her bed. Before she began to lift herself up, she wanted to find the energy to do so because she felt so lazy from her day before of glutting. She felt like someone who had partied all night long and woke up with a hang over. In a way, Shea was drunk off of the food from the night before, but was dealing well with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what will happen today if I ate like a total pig all yesterday,\" Shea wondered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shea looked to her bed side, she noticed how her Aunt Yenna left her clothes on her night stand right next to her bed. Shea drowsily recalled how Aunt Yenna took off everything except for her underwear and shirt to relieve the pressure that was exerted onto her body. Shea saw how Aunt Yenna made a pile on the night stand with her pink sweatpants on the bottom, her socks right above those, and her white tassel hat on top. Quickly, Shea reached over and slammed the hat onto her head. Now she knew she needed to put on the rest of her stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a lot of haste, Shea got up off her bed. She felt a breeze for the fact that she had no pants on. She was finally up, but she still felt that a lot of weight was holding her down. She then remembered all the food she ate. Before she looked down at her belly, she wondered if she had gained a lot of weight or not, which made her wonder if she would fit into her sweatpants.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She quickly put her sweatpants on as she immediately noticed they still fit, but were tighter. Shea smiled as she was thinking about all the ice cream she ate yesterday, dinner at Leonard's house, and part of Aunt Yenna's food. It would be strange if she didn't gain any weight. But now, she was hungry. She already smelled something delicious coming from downstairs. Quickly, she put on her clothes and ran downstairs. When Aunt Yenna saw Shea, she put down a plate with sausages, an omelet, five pieces of toasts, and a lot of garlic butter. Shea smiled and quickly started to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it seems like you got your appetite back,\" Aunt Yenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure did,\" Shea said with a full mouth. \"Thanks for helping me with pulling off my clothes yesterday,\" Shea continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, sweetheart. So what are you going to do today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wanted to ask Jane to go shopping with me for some bras. I really think I'm going to need them,\" Shea said and lifted her shirt. \"See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea suddenly realized what she had done and quickly pulled her shirt down with a face as red as a tomato. She realized that she never would have done that if she hadn't moved over here. But it didn't matter that much. The only one who saw her do it was her Aunt. She was also female and wouldn't tell anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're right that you are in need of some bras,\" Aunt Yenna said in a friendly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And some new pants, too,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea fastly ate her breakfast and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am going to go. I hope I can find some nice clothes here,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Shea, wait a second. Here,\" Aunt Yenna said and handed her some money. \"For buying some clothes, and yes, you can take it and I want you to,\" Aunt Yenna assured Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea was surprised at how much money her Aunt gave her, but like her Aunt said, she took it and walked outside.<br>\r\nShea thought she could remember where Jane lived, and if she didn't lived there, she at least could ask that woman where Jane lived since everyone here seemed to know each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rang the doorbell. A woman opened the door and Shea looked with a wide open mouth. The woman was beautiful with dark red, straight hair that fell nicely around a pretty perfect face. Her cup size was DD with a flat belly, nice long legs, and perfect skin. She looked really stunning. She didn't have to ask if Jane lived here because this woman looked just like an older version of her except with some less muscle and blue eyes instead of green. She looked friendly as she was smiling at Shea. Shea looked at her like a hypnotized bunny, and totally forgot why she exactly cam here. Lucky for her, the woman helped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Shea, wasn't it? I guess you are looking for Jane, right? She is in the backyard,\" the lady said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea nodded and walked inside as Jane's mother pointed to where the backyard was. The backyard was way bigger than Shea expected with a bit of a forest at the sides, a pond, a great garden where you could run, and a few big trees. Jane was climbing in one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi, Shea!\" She yelled. She jumped from branch to branch and went sitting upside down at a low branch while looked upside down at Shea. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Jane. I wanted to shop for some bras. I kind of need them. But I'm still new to it and I don't know all the people here. So I wondered if you want go shopping with me. Besides, what's more fun than an afternoon shopping with a  friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sure. Why not? Just give me a minute to get some money,\" Jane said while she jumped on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane ran quickly inside and Shea waited downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might take a while before she comes back,\" Jane's mother said. \"Her room is always a total mess. I don't understand how she does that. So before she finds her wallet, it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I am!\" Jane said while she ran downstairs and jumped the last five steps.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"That was fast,\" Jane's mother mumbled while the two girls walked outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you wanted to come with me. I still don't know the entire village,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few more weeks here and then you will know the entire village. After a few months, you will know everyone,\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane walked with her to a clothing store. They walked inside as a pretty teenage girl walked over to them with a friendly smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Jane and... I though it was Shea, right. I saw you at the barbecue. Nice to see you here. Can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I wanted to shop for some new bras, but... I don't know my size,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then follow me and I will help you take your size,\" the girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane looked for some cool sports clothing while Shea walked with the teenage girl to a room. The girl then grabbed a tape measure, wrapped it around Shea's chest, and whistled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea looked at the tape measure.   </span></div></div>",

She unfolded the chart and showed it to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a bra sizing chart. It shows all the types of bra sizes there are for us girls. You are a 34C like a said. A girl at your age is on average a 32B, which is at least a cup size smaller. From when I saw you last time, I would say that you were at least a 32B when I saw you,\" the teenager said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Wow. That's great then,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is considering some girls don't even go past that a 32B. Since you are younger, you could probably get even bigger,\" the teenager said to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl began to put the chart away, Shea began to look at her boobs. She began noticing that when she pushed them up, they jiggled. She laughed at this as she began to notice how big her boobs really were getting. She even began to realize that the reason why she was having boobs was because she is fat and getting bigger. Her boobs were made up completely of fat, but they were still big, which made Shea happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Shea, let's get you back to your friend and you guys can continue shopping,\" the girl said as Shea and her began to walk back to Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jane. Did you find anything?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, actually. I found this track suit that I can use for working out. It's pink, too,\" Jane said as she held it up to Shea's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice!\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how did it go back there?\" Jane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm a 34C,\" Shea said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Wow, that's big. Mine is a little smaller than that. You're lucky!\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully I can get them bigger,\" Shea said as she looked down at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for now, let's continue to shop!\" Jane said.</span></div></div>",

Because I'm gaining weight?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that to, but I saw your Aunt. She has DD cups. So since she's your Aunt, you probably have some of her genes. In this case, your cup size. With all that weight you gained and are going to gain, you probably will even get DD+ size cups,\" Jane said and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wouldn't mind having big breasts,\" Shea mumbled. \"But I wouldn't want to look like Lola Ferrari,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Jane said. \"That was so fake. Those things weren't near real. All plastic surgery. I think that she just has tiny tits and that's the reason she wanted them bigger,\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand that... but... They were just... too big. Way too big,\" Shea said while she took some of the bras the teenager advised her to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with that. They really were too big. She died because of all that surgery to her boobs. I even heard that when she did, they found that she planned some surgeries for the future,\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, these ones look nice,\" Shea said and took some dungarees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea smiled. These would probably hold up her belly a bit and wouldn't be tight around her tummy since most of her pants left marks around her belly. She also took some elastic pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I will go try these on. By the way, if I get big breasts because of Aunt Yenna's genes, then you get some big ones, too. I saw your Mom and she also has some DD cups,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. A lot of people say I look like my Mom except for my eyes,\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea took her clothes and went into a changing room. She had to admit that teenager had been right about her cup size. The bras fitted her perfectly. Shea was lucky too since her old ones were getting tight. Also, the dungarees fitted fine. After winter clothing, it was her favorite kind of clothing. She also quickly fitted the elastic pants and was happy that they fitted nicely around her tummy area while she still had some room to grow. She took them and waited for Jane. A few minutes later, Jane came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I found some cool sport clothing, a jacket, and a bikini,\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need those for?\" Shea asked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no problem swimming naked with you and the others, but I will never go swimming naked with boys. Sometimes with school, we go to the swimming pool. I like that, but I'm not going to swim naked with boys around except maybe with my boyfriend. I first need to find one of course. I also took two bras. You're right though. I might need to start wearing them sometime,\" Jane admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea and Jane paid for their clothes from the teenager. She happily waved goodbye to them when they walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a nice girl,\" Shea said. \"I didn't realize my boobs grew so much,\" Shea continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice for Leonard,\" Jane mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you....\"     </span></div></div>",

Jane had her clothes on more quickly and began to look at herself in the mirror. Shea continued to focus one herself as she put on some dungarees that were gray and white with a checkered pattern all across it. Shea then looked at herself in the mirror. Even though her belly stuck out, she liked the look. She then noticed how she had a white puff ball hat on a nearby drawer. She then put it on, noticing how it matched her outfit perfectly and gave her a type of hipster look. Overall, she was liking her new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door bell began to rang as the two girls ran to the door to let Emily in.

Emily enjoyed how her friends seemed impressed at her gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi girls. Hey, nice dungarees. Are those new? They look good. They're holding up your belly,\" Emily said while looking at Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like something you can use,\" Jane said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that. Well, my mother noticed I started to gain a bit and, of course, my new look. So she wanted to talk to me. I finally told her about the weight gain thing and all. Guess what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Shea and Jane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's totally fine with it. She sees no problem to have a fat girl for a daughter. She says I can become as fat as I want to. Isn't that cool? She even feeds me fatty food pretty much, too. Sometimes, I have a problem eating it all, but it sure pays off,\" Emily said and turned around to show her body. \"Do I look good or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily pushed her belly out bit and it was just a bit too much. The button of her pants flew off as Jane ducked right in time or else the button would had hit her. The button ended further down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! Sorry. That wasn't supposed to happen,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Shea said. \"Nothing happened, right Jane?\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing happened? Thanks to my fast reflexes, nothing happened!\" Jane yelled but with a smile. \"Some people say being overweight is dangerous. But apparently, it's not only for the people who are. It's also for the people around them,\" Jane said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you don't have to worry about your weight, Jane. You have hardly any fat on your body,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But solid abs!\" Jane said and hit her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, can I borrow some pants from you, Shea? Seems like mine are a bit too small,\" Emily asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Go ahead!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls walked upstairs, but Jane looked a minute at her friends. They looked a lot alike, but the biggest difference was still Shea's cup size. Her breasts were pretty big, but Emily's chest was still flat. She herself also had some boobs and they were growing. She knew very well some other girls were jealous at her boobs (like Victoria), but compared to Shea's boobs, her boobs were kind of small. But it didn't matter since Shea was already taken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Emily, take any pants you like,\" Shea said with a smile while she kicked the bags with bras under the bed. She didn't want to let Emily know how her boobs were pretty big for her age while she had nothing as she wanted them so badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Emily paid more attention to the pants. Shea had some pretty cool pants. Since she was too fat for most of them, there was no harm in giving one too Emily.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"This one looks good. It also fits good around my tummy,\" Emily said while wearing white pants with black stripes as she was looking a bit like a zebra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Emily? When I called, you said you were kind of hungry. Did you eat anything, by the way?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not yet. I thought I should wait with eating until I was here since the food your Aunt makes is delicious. Plus, eating is more fun with your best friends than alone,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's get something to eat. I'm hungry,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'd also like a bite,\" Jane said.  </span></div></div>",

She liked it here. Her new friends, her boyfriend and all other people except maybe Victoria. She was just used to the idea to live here. At least until she was eight teen. Aunt Yenna took stuff to make hamburgers and while she cut the ingredients she looked at Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a message from your parents Shea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea swallowed. She wondered what her parents wanted to do now. She had't spoken to them since they left her here. That was't too long ago. It seemed way longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears their new work is going very well. They're a few days ahead on schedule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" Shea said slowly. \"But why would I wanna know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since they're free for a few days and not too far from here they decided too come here for a few days. Seeing how you do. After they left you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea did't felt so good. All right like most kids she loved her parents. Sure she was angry for what they did but still they were her family and she still loved them and as far if she know they loved her too. But apart from the bad way of saying goodbye and not talking to them for some time the biggest problem was what would her parents think about this. Her new way of living. That she was fat now and gaining with a friend and wanted to gain more weight and had a boyfriend who liked fat girls. She was't sure if they were fine with that. But if they were't they would probably need to go away from here. Then she lost all friends, boyfriend and people she knew here and probably was put in a home for kids where the parents were too busy to take care of their kids. Where she needed to share her bedroom with other kids and were there were many rules and she surely would't have such good friends like here or such cool stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\" Shea mumbled. \"They don't know anything about this gaining. Suppose they hate it, and think aunt Yenna is terrible at raising me and take me away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Emily screamed. \"They can't do that! Can they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so. It are her real parents. They decide what she thinks what's best for Shea. If they really think I don't take good care of you they probably  will take you away.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she got up, she began to get ready. She took a shower while she felt her fat body the whole time. She was hoping that her parents would be accepting of her new body and let her stay with her Aunt. After her shower, Shea went over into her closet. After putting on a bra and panties, she looked over and saw her pair of black and white dungarees that had a checkered pattern all across it. She put it on and continued to look around her closet. She looked and saw a white hat with a puff at the top and tassels with balls on them. She knew that if anything, this would make her parents feel more comfortable since this is how she dressed with them before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shea, come on down.

She's very nice. Then you have Jane. She a cool, muscled redhead and Sandy. A bit chubby. Not too bright but friendly.  I also met Carlie. She's skinny but fun.... Oh and guess what I even found a boyfriend. His name is Leonard. Oh He's perfect. Any girl would kill to go out with him. Other girls are a bit jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a boyfriend?\" Her mother asked. \"That's nice. But Eh Shea.

You're fat. You gained a lot of weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well fine! Yeah! I did gain a lot of weight! I wanted to help Emily. She wanted to gain and asked me to join her. But the more I gained, and the fatter I got, the more I found out I liked it. The gaining, the extra weight, the fat on my body, and guess what... Leonard likes fat girls. Of course he also likes me in character but what first attracted him was my big belly. Besides what did you expected with someone who cooks so good if aunt Yenna. Even if I would't have joined Emily in the weight gain I would have gained thank to aunt Yenna's delicious cooking. But she cooks so good that you can't stop eating. So yeah I got fat but I'm fine with it, and I love it here and I have so many friends here and a boyfriend so please don't take me away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said anything about taking you away Shea?\" Her father asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I thought because I gained so much you would think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Shea we love you no matter what size you are.\" Her father said. \"And to be honest We knew that there was a good chance this was going to happen. I know my baby sister's cooking. We knew you probably would gain weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We hoped you would gain weight. I mean look at yourself. Don't you look way better then before. Especially more then some of those anorexia kids that drink nothing but juice and only eat salad. No such a fat girl like you. That is a daughter we like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you seemed kind of shocked.\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we knew you would probably gain weight. But we did't expect it you would gain it so fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can stay here? I can keep gaining? You don't take me away?\" Shea asked relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.

How many kids did we have?\" He asked slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one darling.\" She said not looking up from her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Shea was't part of a twin?\" Her father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course not why do you....\" Her mother asked while she looked up from her cell Phone but stopped talking when she saw Emily. \"Well Shea they say everyone has a twin.

Emily, Carlie my parents.\" She introduced them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you.\" Shea's mother said. \"We were a bit worried since we did't heard from you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what did you expect. You just dropped me of here on a place where I don't know anyone. You were just busy with your work and I needed to live with my aunt who I hardly knew on a place where I've hardly been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it so bad here?\" Her mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's terrific here. Aunt Yenna is very nice and all people... well most people here are very nice but it's more the point you left me here on a place that I don't know, to live with someone I don't know with people I don't know. I worked out all right but it could have gone wrong. It's just felt like you want me out of the way for your work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Shea it's not really like that...\" Her mother said.    </span></div></div>",

So round and soft, and she could see Leonard also liked it very much.<br>\r\nLeonard looked at it almost drooling.<br>\r\nShea let herself fall on her back and slowly pulled her pants of. Leonard looked a bit surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She asked. \"I'm gaining all over my body. Also my butt and thighs are bigger. I thought you want to explore them too. If you want I can pull of my panties as well. I don't really care. You saw me naked before and you will see me naked later so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can I touch it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course silly. If you want to explore it you need to touch it. Leonard put his hand under Shea's breasts and slowly let his hands slide down over her body. Enjoying how round, soft and warm it was. But she also loved it. Both kids were very enjoying this.    <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She never really thought about that. She considered herself as a normal girl who would fall in love with a boy and get some kids, and grew old with her husband. She did't knew if she wanted to be this. But she also heard it was't something you could't choose. She just thought about it for a moment and now she could't stop thinking about it since Shea and Leonard left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlie what's wrong with you?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing why. Does it look like something is wrong with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for about five minutes you are putting your spoon in and out your ice cream without taking a bite, I think your ice cream has melted by now, and you're sucking at your straw for five minutes while your glass is already empty for about four minutes ago! So call me crazy but that does seem weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well fine then. You're right. There's something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? Is it a secret?\" Emily asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you need to promise me to don't tell this to anyone. I'm not even sure about it.

I don't really see the problem.\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I liked seeing it. See your bellies. Bellies of girls. Perhaps I'm a lesbian. I mean... it's kind of strange. I never thought I could be a lesbian. and the other kids at school. How would they react if they found out. Not everyone is fine with lesbians. Perhaps my friends will leave me if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlie I think you're worry to much. True friends will like you no matter what you are. Straight, gay, lesbian or bi. So what if you are. You liked the bellies of me and Shea getting bigger. I like it too, and a little secret I like seeing people get force fed. But just because you saw two female bellies getting fatter does't want to say you're a lesbian. Perhaps you are but who knows maybe you like it just so much when see a male belly growing. Perhaps you like girls and boys. Who cares? Not me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's all a bit difficult to understand for me. It's my  life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. You're eleven. You have a whole life ahead of you. Why would you worry about it now? Just because Shea has a relation does't want to say we need to have one also. Let's just wait until next year. Then we're in high school and we can really start thinking about dating. Then you have a whole year to find out what you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Emily. That really helped.

She used to be a fat girl then too but now she was a lot bigger. Also her appetite increased so she was sure she gained a lot of weight. But she hoped Leonard would also like her new weight gain. <br>\r\nShe remembered she once saw on T.V a show called obese were a overweight person got help from a personal trainer to lose weight. They set a goal to lose so many pounds in that amount of time. It must have been always a nervous moment for those people. Just as nervous as it was now for Shea. Only her weight went in the other direction.<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes and looked at Leonard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much is it?\" She asked excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"203.\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pounds?\" Shea asked in disbelief. \"I'm 203 pounds. I'm over 200 pounds. I can't believe I gained so much weight. I'm happy with it. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy with it too. Very happy. But you do understand that I won't be able to carry you over the doorstep.\" He said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what. That carrying over the doorstep is a so old fashioned anyway. But you like those 203 pounds. Well you can play with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard looked like a little kid a Christmas morning. So happy he looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea waddled back to her bedroom. Her rolls of fat jiggling with each step. Leonard could't help it but seeing that made his penis hard. He really hoped Shea did't saw it. He did't want to do anything to Shea if she was't ready for it. He was fine with waiting two years or twenty year or even longer. But he sure hoped it would't be too long. <br>\r\nShea went sitting on the bed on her knees. She spread her knees and her belly dropped on the bed. She smiled when Leonard went sitting on the bed looking at her. Shea saw his erection but did't said anything. If this body already gave him a erection what would happen if she was even fatter since she planned too continue gaining weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Grab my belly. I know you want it. Go on. Grab it.\" Shea said and made her belly jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard grabbed her belly and dropped at it and played wit it. Massaging it and softly pushing and pulling at what both kids really enjoyed. Shea looked at her boyfriend.<br>\r\nShe heard many times that first relation's never worked. Many girls had about four serious relations before the found the right one and some sluts had about hundred relations just for the sex. Any way many girls had several relations before they found there real boyfriend. The person they wanted to share the rest of their life with. She also used to have Nick and before that Zack. The boy she broke up with because he wanted to have sex with her. A moment she thought about Nick. She really used to like him. Would he still like her now she was so fat? Would he be attracted to a fat girl? But what did it matter now? She had Leonard now and he was far better then Nick in any way. Besides he was now with a total slut. So who cared about him.<br>\r\nShe focused again at Leonard playing with her belly. That was way more fun.</span></div></div>",

At the same time, she thought about Leonard and the things they did. She wondered about sex in general and began to ponder the idea. She knew that she could be safe, but she wanted to be totally sure that she wouldn't get pregnant. But then, she began to think about it. If she got pregnant, she would become even fatter, and more attractive. She began to imagine herself as a really pregnant girl by picturing herself with a fuller face, boobs, and a huge stomach. She started to rub her belly as she envisioned it. Yes, it would be cool, but she knew she didn't want to be pregnant yet. If she did, she would know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shea, are you hungry?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Bring it on!\" Shea said as they all began to cut into the pies and eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls lathered the pie in ice cream and whipped cream as the amount of sugar on the pie was very high .

If my mother would cook so good I would be as round if a barrel.\" Carlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah aunt Yenna is a terrific cook. That was't the main reason why I was gaining but I must admit it did make gaining weight a lot easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so true.\" Emily mumbled with full mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly they heard a loud: Rip! Sound when Emily's T shirt ripped apart. Emily did't noticed or did't cared since she just kept on eating. Shea did noticed it but said nothing of it and neither did Carlie. All girls just ate. <br>\r\nAfter some time Carlie pushed her plate away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really stuffed you two. My belly is't as big if yours.\" Carlie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Emily and Shea both were't ready with eating. The next moment. There was another: Rip! When Emily's pants split. But for some reason Emily did't react to this while Shea thought she must have noticed that. But perhaps she did't care. Outgrowing clothes was't so strange. She did the same with some of her clothes, and she would do that with more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But nothing happened between you and Leonard?\" Carlie asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something did happen but there was't any real sex involved! We did't had sex. If I have sex you will be the first who know it. But I'm just eleven. I'm not ready to get a child. First I wanna finish school. Perhaps go to college.... not sure about that. I still need to think of a job. Anyway I want kids... once but not just now. Later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you have sex that does't mean you really get kids. If that was the case there would be a lot more people on the world.\" Carlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit strange. Animals only do it to get kids. Humans are the only living things I know who also have sex for pleasure.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but who says that's wrong?\" Carlie asked. \"You can Always use the pill or a condom. It's also save. Who knows what happens when...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not on the pill and we did't have a condom. I have sex when I'm ready for it. I know Leonard will wait until I'm ready for it.\" Shea said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonard perhaps. But most other boys don't. they only wanna have sex. Right here! Right now! Who cares if the woman is ready or not. Just have sex!\" Carlie yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True there are boys who think with their dick but Leonard is't one of them. I also try to have a boyfriend who does't think with his dick.\" Emily said with full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you also have some slutty girls who also only think about sex.\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True!\" Emily yelled. \"I saw some of them on vacation. Girls who have sex on the backseat of a car!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea belched loudly after the last piece of food went past her lips. Carlie looked at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who you two can eat a lot.\" Carlie mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Shea. Is there a chance that I can borrow some clothes of you?\" Emily asked showing her ripped clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time. Besides I have some old clothes that don't fit me anymore anyway. But they probably fit you... for some time.\" Shea said carefully<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Shea went up to Shea's room and Carlie followed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Carlie looked on mostly as she saw how her inflated body moved side to side, but she then turned away as she didn't want to freak out Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Emily. What kind of clothes of mine would you like?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I like your dungarees. Do you have any of those that do not fit?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Plaid or jean for now?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go with plaid,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of looking, Shea pulled out a pair of black and white dungarees.

To Shea, she was happy for Emily.

If I was't trying to gain on purpose I still would have gained thanks to all this delicious food.\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. But then you would't be so happy with it. You know before I lived where I lived now I lived in a house with another family. I and my parents lived on the second floor and a mother with two diva teenage girls lived on the first floor. If they gained a single pound they were worried. I could hear them scream on my room. But those bitches did nothing about it. They were shopping and I believe they always ate some junk food when they went shopping. They ate also two or three times junk food for dinner and were mostly lying on the couch in front of the T.V. No wonder they gained. Anyway I could always hear it. That's for sure. So most other teenage girls are worried if they gain. You don't have to worry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing too.\" Emily mumbled. \"I hate counting calories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea belched and the next moment three buttons of her blouse popped of and her belly burst out. The Girls looked one moment surprised and then burst out in laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That was great Shea. You really need to start paying attention to how well your clothes fit. Suppose they rip on a date.\" Carlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't think Leonard would mind that. Especially if those upper buttons also pop and if you don't wear a bra.\" Emily said and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The time that I could go outside without wearing a bra is over.\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah for you perhaps!\" Emily said grumpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take it so hard Emily.\" Carlie said. I am just as flat if you and some of the other girls are too. Fine so Jane and She have bigger tits then the other girls in our class. Who cares. We all gonna get them. Sooner or later. Or take Lisette... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean long Lisette?\" Emily said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is that?\" asked Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of unattractive. Very tall. That's why we call her long, and at thin if a broom. You can literally see her ribs. She's very thin. I think she really underweight. But she also is't the nicest person so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I doubt she ever gets boobs. With such a skeleton body. I don't think She'll get boobs. Not enough body for.\" Carlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long Lisette. If she get's boobs she breaks in half.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlie and Emily giggled. Shea tried to remember if she saw Lisette at the barbecue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will see her at school. The new school year is excited. It will be very excited for you since you the new kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you have some friends and a boyfriend so you're Lucky. Besides most kids here are't so mean. There's less teasing and violent here because everyone knows each other and grew up with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea must admit she did't liked school.

The girls would go swimming, eat, or simply just hang out in Shea's room and talk about what the new school year would bring. Overall, Shea was very excited for it, but she knew there was still a decent amount of time before she would be able to go to school since it wouldn't start for another few weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Shea just continued to stuff herself with food, which made her stomach a lot bigger as well. Emily was following in Shea's footsteps as she was starting to look rounder as the days went on. But overall, the most shocking of gains was with Carlie who had put on a few pounds in her stomach. It seemed as if Shea and Emily's eating habits rubbed off on Carlie for those times they all munched on food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Shea was just waking up. She felt something grabbing her body and then noticed what it was. It was Emily who was sleeping next to her that night since the two normally had sleepovers. She realized quickly that Emily was a cuddler, or plainly, a person who really liked to cuddle with someone. Shea didn't mind since really the two were so close. She looked at Emily and saw how she was wearing one of Shea's white puffy winter hats. Shea then went to the mirror and looked at herself. She was standing there naked with her normal puffy winter hat on since her hair looked bad yesterday. She must of forgot about it and fell asleep with it on, but she didn't care. She began to feel up her body, noticing how much more she had gained overall. Honestly, she loved her new fattening body, but she wondered when it was really going to give her a lot of trouble. If she kept this up, she would end up immobile at some point in her life. But would that be such a problem? She thought about it, but was then interrupted by her phone vibrating, meaning she was getting a text message. She looked at the heading and saw it was from Leonard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Shea. I need some help getting rid of ice cream like a few weeks ago. Can you come help? Bundle up because there is a lot,\" Leonard texted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea then got a really good idea.</span></div></div>",

The  quick and sudden movement of her exited jump caused her whole body to cascade in a torrent of what seemed to be never ending wave of jiggling flesh. Rendering Shea transfixed on her own reflection as she watched as her body moved as it rhythmically dancing around her static body as if having a mind of its own, she started to feel her ever growing belly running her hands slowly up and down feeling how soft it was thinking how big it was going to get, and Shea loved it, she wanted more to be fatter to be softer, heavier rounder to be able to burst out of her clothes at the slightest of breaths. Shea was so enthralled with her body that she didn't notice that her 'jump for fat' caused her room to shake inadvertently walking the sleeping Emily. Emily watched Shea as she slowly massaged her body it wasn't until a few minutes of observing Shea Emily realised that she was subconsciously playing with her own ever growing soft body. her cheeks instantly filled with red with embarrassing at the fact she was so drawn to her best friends growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"err..Sh...Shea\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe sudden realization that she wasn't alone in her room admiring her own body made  her freeze momentarily and fill with embarrassment, but as quick as the feeling came it left much faster as Shea realised it was Emily who was speaking to her and there was no reason to feel embarrassed I mean they have seen each other naked before and played with their fat in front of each other. Shea turned around with the biggest smile on her face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Emily guess what\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"w..what\"?

I would love to come over. I have of course to ask aunt Yenna first... but that should be no problem. After all we still have vacation for some time... But first things first. I go over to Leonard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out of bed started to get dressed and took a bag and took some clean clothes a sleeping bag and her toothbrush. In the meantime Emily also got up and got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My clothes are getting tighter each day.\" Emily mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have some of my old clothes.\" Shea said. \"You also have a older sister.

She packed warm clothing for winter temperatures, bra and panties, and a couple of winter hats since she did not know what one she wanted to wear with Leonard. But currently, she was wearing her blue winter hat with a big pink puff ball on top since it was one of her favorite ones. It was about six when she left her place and began to walk to the ice cream shop. Deep down, Shea was very excited, but she began to wonder if her and Leonard woud move on further into their relationship since they were having a night alone. Shea did not care what happpened as long as she did not end up pregnant in the end like the other sluts she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how much ice cream there will be,\" Shea said as she put one hand on her belly and began to rub it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast time she went to the ice cream parlor to eat ice cream, it was a decent amount. However, Shea knew that if she was staying for the night, there would be a lot more than last time. All that Shea knew was that she was going to gain weight and become fatter by the end of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well. I mean at this rate, I am going to end up immobile someday. I really wonder how long it would take for that to happen,\" Shea thought as she began to think of the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down, she wished she could be immobile right now, but the best part about the experience was the whole process of gaining, and Shea knew that she had to enjoy gaining weight for now until she coudn't see the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, she finally ended up in front of the ice cream shop and knocked. Shea was feeling butterflies in her stomach, but she was also feeling hungry at the same time. Finally, Leonard came up to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready for the all-night stuffing?\" Leonard asked with a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you can keep up,\" Shea said with a more evil grin.</span></div></div>",

Say cheese.\" He said and took a picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do that for?'\" She asked kind of angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I thought you might want to see the difference.\" Leonard explained calmly. We now have a before picture, after you have eaten the ice cream we have a after picture. But weight gain and lost also by the way is better to see without clothes. Don't worry... no one else will see them. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea smiled. I would be fun. She smiled friendly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to take four or five pictures.

After it digested it shrinks a bit and becomes fat on my body and then you can see how much I really gained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind taking pictures of you.\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea fast put her winter clothes on since she was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I just thought about it, If I keep doing this I will once end up Immobile.

But how long would that take? I mean school will fast start and then we have school work, home work and probably gymnastics. Also my school is so close to my house I can easily walk over there. That's some sort of exercise. With all that stuff I have less time to gain. I will keep gaining... but not as fast if now. I bet I'm the fattest girl in school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are. Well your gaining might slow down a bit... but we can catch up in the vacations. We also be together at school. With our friends. You also have Victoria of course, and triple M...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who were that again?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max Matt and Mark. Three boys. They're pretty lame with even lamer jokes. Perhaps it would't be so bad if they knew that did't tried to be funny, but they think they're awfully funny, and make jokes all the time. They're not funny. But they're not smart enough to notice that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea now remembered she heard those names once. They seemed like kind of annoying, but not mean like Victoria. that was a good thing. It would't be easy to get to know all those names. But she would worry about that later.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Enough about annoying class mates. Time for something more important... eating myself fat and round, and you help me by stuffing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be happy too help you.\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea opened her mouth wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hurry up then I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Shea took all kind of different poses. standing, sitting, rubbing her belly, on hands and knees (when you could clearly see her belly reaching for the floor), and even one with her legs spread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonard I like this... very much, but you make sure no body else will see those pictures. Or else...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. When I get home I'll put them on my computer. I will protect them with a password.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that that pass word by any chance Shea? Just like my name?\" Shea asked with her arms fold over each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeeeh.... Maybe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonard, I'm flattered you chose my name as a password but... come on. Use my name as password. Even your little sister could think of that. Nothing personal but my name as password is't that a bit too obvious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry my fat princess.\" He said with a apologizing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that's a good password. FatPrincess. With a capital F and P. I don't think anyone can think of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm kind of good with computers. I learned it all from my cousin. He even protected some of his most secret files on a special way. A password... that's normal, but he programmed it in a way that if someone typed the wrong password it would delete all the files. It's the perfect way to be sure no one will read your files... but that way you lose all your files, and I don't wanna lose this photos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if some of our classmates would see this they would probably think I'm a total slut. I'm not. I'm just in love, and people who are in love do strange things some times. That at the same time feel so right. However I knew some girl from where I lived before who were real sluts. I bet they lose their virginity before they enter high school.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to worry about that with me.\" Leonard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea looked outside and saw the sun was slowly going down.

She did had silly dreams sometimes. Not really anything erotic yet but now she had a boyfriend who knew. Many dreams were silly.

But compared to her he was a bit of a lightweight. But well weighing over 200 pounds at age eleven she was pretty heavy. But in the U.S.A there were a lot of overweight kids. Surely there would be some who were heavier then her but she just started gaining recently. Considering that she thought she did a pretty good job.<br>\r\nShe licked her lips it tasted kind of sweet. Of course. Leonard fed her last night. She could't remember if he finished feeding her before she fell asleep. She looked a moment at him. He had a smile on his face and his head rested at one of her boobs. using as a pillow. She smiled wondering how she would look like if her boobs would get the size of pillows. Well she doubted her boobs would ever reach that size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard moaned and slowly opened his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning sleeping handsome.

In fact ever since  that wonderful night they spent together at his uncles ice cream parlor stuffing her self with every-and-anything that was edible Shea and Leonard really revved up on the whole gaining weight thing. They spent every available second of the remaining summer stuffing her full of what ever they where able to get there little gainer hands on. Leonard somehow even got his hands on two industrial sized 10 kg tubs of weight gain powder to help her with her quest to gain, Shea wasn't sure if she should accept Leonard's \"gift\" she wanted to gain weight but maybe this was a little much but after much debate Leonard managed to persuade Shea in to letting him,use the weight gain powder to make gainer shakes for her along with her daily dose of left over ice cream at the parlor and the result was something to truly marvel at if Shea was big at the start now with the help of Leonard in fact at times it seemed that everyone was helping her gain weight. Now Shea was truly massive, her days during the holidays  where spent exploring all the realms of indulgence that gluttony had to offer an average day for Shea went a little something like.... <br>\r\nwake up, have a huge fatty breakfast accompanied with weight gain shake, relentless snacking, midday feast with Emily accompanied with weight gain shake, some more snacking, late but fatty lunch accompanied with yet another weight gain shake, more snacking, a huge fatty dinner with Aunt Yenna with one last shake then waddle over to Leonard's  for another if not less fatty but equally huge  dinner, then head over to the ice cream parlor for dessert where Leonard stuffs her full of the old stock. That was Shea's life for the last couple of weeks and her weight had skyrocketed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHEA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"huh?\" Shea was utterly lost in the memories of her past indulgences over probably one of the best summers she ever had, making new, getting a new boyfriend and lets not forget all of that  wonderfully fatty food and with that came new and glorious ponds of fat making her bigger. Shea couldn't help smile as she reminisced about all the clothes that she had out grown all the clothes that had there buttons blown off by her mammoth of a belly the inseams of her pants bursting open by fat of her thighs, Shea was so happy lost in her past that she didn't hear Emily calling her name trying to get attention she didn't even notice that she was slowly playing with her enormous belly slowly rubbing it feeling how warm it was how soft it was and envisioning how big it was going to be in the future Shea couldn't lie she was truly looking forward to the future and how big she was going to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily sat there watching Shea lost in thought while she plays with her fat with a smile in her face it was a sight that Emily was used to when she first saw Shea lost in thought playing with her fat so happily oblivious to the world around her it did cause her to feel somewhat embarrassed by the whole thing but now after seeing her do it god knows how many times Emily just saw it as a normal occurrence and had been any other day she would have happily left Shea to revel in her fat but to today was the first day of school and they don't have time for body exploration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"god we don't have time for this\"  Emily said quite annoyed by Shea belly play. With a deep breath Emily leaned in close to Shea ,who still had her eyes closed in pure fat bliss, positioned her lips right in front of Shea's ear and yelled \"SHEA STOP PLAYING WITH YOUR SELF OR WERE GONNA BE LATE!!\" . That was enough to bring Shea back to reality <br>\r\n\"ah jeez Em why'd   you shout down my ear\" Shea responded quite annoyed, glaring at Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you where doing it again\" Emily stated flatly pointing towards Shea's belly. Shea looked down to where she was pointing to, doing so causing her double chin to become even more prominent, Shea's cheeks turned red as she realized what she was doing. \"sorry Emily you know i get a little carried away sometimes its just so big and soft\"  she said giving off a sheepish smile. \"huh, whatever come on or where gonna be late\" Emily said as she got up from the table. Emily stood and watched as Shea attempted to hoist her self up out of her chair, as Shea got bigger small things like getting out of certain char became harder and Emily for some reason always enjoy watching Shea struggle with simple tasks.Emily didn't know why she she enjoyed it but every time she saw her struggle she got a tingle in the pit of  her belly. Shea took in a deep breath as she prepared her self for the task of getting up it was one quick motion that she had perfected during the summer, rising her legs up in the air so her feet no longer touch the ground with as much force as she can while simultaneously throwing her arms back and thrusting her belly forward, the huge weight of her belly being thrown forward was more than enough force to bring up out her seat and after fixing up her outfit Shea was ready to start the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AUNT YENNA I'M GOING NOW\" Shea shouted to her aunt letting her know she was on her way out, \"OK HUN BE SAFE AND HAVE A GREAT DAY\" Aunt Yenna shouted out from somewhere in the house and with that both Shea and Emily where out the door on there way to their first day of a new school year. As Shea and Emily waddled up the street to school they could feel their bodies shake and jiggle uncontrollably with every heavy foot fall Emily turned to Shea with a smile on her face looking up to meet her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Shea i can't believe how big you are\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" i know isn't it great\" Shea said with a smile as she lifted up what she could of her belly most of it spilling out of her hands completely encasing them in fat.\" and i see i'm not the only one who done some growing, say how much do you weigh now any way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" yeah i know\" Emily responded with a smile and a pat on the belly \" i weighed myself this morning and i'm proud to say i way 218 pounds but unlike you i don't have a hot boy stuffing me full of food 24/7\" Shea's cheeks reddened at Emily calling out her and Leonard's little get together's. \"plus unlike you puberty forgot me and blessed you what are about 5'7\", 5'8\" now\" Emily's voice was dripping in masked jealousy. Shea just smiled she wished that Emily would be so jealous of her body when her time will come \" i'm 5'8\" Aunt Yenna measured be yesterday\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"see you've got more bone then me, which means your gonna weigh more than lil 'ol me \" Emily said looking Shea up and down, <i>Actually its quite obvious that she weighs more than i do god look at her she's HUGE.</i> Emily thought to herself \" hey Shea how much do you way? i bet its like 300 pounds\" <br>\r\nShea smiled at her friend \"Actually........      <br>\r\n         <br>\r\n          </span></div></div>",

At the other hand... going to school would probably slow down our weight gain a bit. Since we have to go there, five days in a week. We have P.E over there. Of course also homework.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Homework. I don't get that. I don't do the dishes at school. So why would I do schoolwork at home?\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. But I guess we can't do anything about it. Besides we can better get used to it. In high school we get even more homework. But at least, This year I can do homework with some good friends.\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why only this year?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well next year it's high school. I really like you but... It's not sure we go to the same school. I hope we can but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Well let's first enjoy this year. We're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea started to smile. The school was a very friendly looking place. Build with red brick and some nice paintings on it. With some nice stuff to play for the young kids and two big fields for the older kids. One flat field to play football and one full with long grass, bushes and trees.<br>\r\nShea kept looking while Emily ran over to some kids she knew. Shea looked around from some other's she knew. But suddenly Victoria walked over to her. With two girls who were standing left and right from her like two guards. She could't remember seeing them at the barbecue. At the other hand she met so many people there. She could't remember all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So look who's here. The boyfriend stealer. You stole my boyfriend. That's not nice.\" Victoria started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally not nice.\" The two other girls added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did't...\" Shea started, but Victoria cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please. Don't come with lame excuses. You're just a backstabbing, boyfriend stealer, jealous bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" Jane asked and walked over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay out of this Jane. This is't any of your business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Shea is a friend of me. So it is my business. If you want to do something to her you have to take on me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that goes double for me!\" Emily said and walked over to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bitch stole my boyfriend!\" Victoria yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo other girls who walked by stopped and walked over to Victoria and turned to Shea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stole her boyfriend? That's mean.\" One of them said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You should't do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on. Shea has't done anything!  Emily yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All eight girls started to scream at each other so loud no one not even the girls could understand a word from the other. They suddenly stopped when Leonard walked over to them with a 'what's-going-on-here' look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello girls. May I ask what are you all screaming about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shea stole Victoria's boyfriend.\" One girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Leonard mumbled. \"Not this again. All right ladies. Let me make this clear to you. First of all, I have a girl friend. Shea is my girlfriend. I like her, she likes me were a couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" one girl asked. \"You never went out with any other girl that asked you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. But I asked her out. Shea did't stole any boyfriend. Victoria just finds that because I'm in love with Shea instead of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute. You said she stole your boyfriend. Excuse me but Leonard never was your boyfriend.\" One of the girls said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonard was't any ones boyfriend. Shea had just as much right to get him  like everyone else.\" Another girl said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why do you want to go out with such a fatso like her while you could have such a beautiful girl like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she's soft, warm, nice, friendly, help full, kind and appreciate good food. You're at the other hand bony. If I touch you I can feel your bones. Is't a nice feeling. and apart from that you're pretty mean, unfair and not so nice. I can never be attracted to you so please... give up, and stop saying Shea stole your boyfriend. She did't steal anyone. By the way, I asked her out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears appeared in Victoria's eyes and she ran away crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I did't wanna make her cry.\" Leonard said. \"I just wanted to make something clear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she did ask a bit for it.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the school bell rang and all the kids walked inside. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Emily sat down next to her as her belly kind of gathered up in front of her a bit making her look pregnant. Shea on the other hand went to sit down and she had an issue. Her chair creaked as her huge butt hung off the sides. Her fat looked like it was pouring out of her seat and she looked exhausted. Shea looked like she had officially eaten the skinny version of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began to look around at all of the people in the classroom. All of them looked different in some way. One girl had long blonde hair and looked like a Hollister model. A few of them had longer hair and looked like skater boys. Suddenly, she looked at one guy in the class that had blonde hair, and a fat body that compared to Shea. Shea began to have this feeling at the bottom of her belly as she kind of wanted to stuff him up or vice versa. Maybe it could happen if they became friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes latet, the teacher came in and greeted everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, class. My name is Mrs. Linus. I will be your teacher this year. I hope you all had an amazing summer!\" She said with a smile that lit up the whole room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I did,\" Emily whispered as she smiled to Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I know we have a few new students here. Why don't the new students stand up and introduce themselves,\" Mrs. Linus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea kind of felt excited but nervous.

It also seemed most others of them were at the barbecue and there most of them seemed pretty nice. At the other hand that was several pounds ago. Well she would make the best of it. She also saw the Eyes of Victoria who were everything except supporting. They seemed to be burning full of hate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... Hi my name is Shea. I came to live here with my aunt. Yenna.

But it's fun to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two talking about?\" Shea asked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlie sighed and looked at Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine I tell you but not here. All right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio started on their walk home. After two minutes Carlie looked at Shea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then... I think... I'm not sure... I might be... a lesbian.\" Carlie said with a deep sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" Shea asked. \"Nothing wrong with that. But what does that have to do with you new look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well gay people also sometimes wear clothes that look a bit well girlie. I decided since I might be also a bit different lets just try a new style. I know it does't make much sense but it was fun to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee Emily. Why don't we go to your house. I never have been there.\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh well. I rather you don't come. The point is... well... I told you my mother is supportive about my weight gain. Since I told her she makes more fattening foods. But my big sister hates it. She''s kin d of mean lately. She thinks I'm crazy for wanting to gain. She also hates you Shea. For being fat, getting fatter, liking it and getting fatter with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never saw your sister.\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to.\" Emily said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I wanna see you also once for a change. You have been over to my house many times but I have't been over once at your house.\"      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm going to go shop for some clothes and try to see what other looks might fit me best,\" Carlie said as she looked at Emily hoping that she may notice her appearance more.

We can show you what we got!\" Carlie said as the two girls walked away, leaving Shea by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now time to sit and refuel,\" Shea said as she brushed her double chin and went to sit down in the shade. She immediately went into her backpack and pulled out a Twix bar. She enjoyed the savory taste of caramel and chocolate as she gorged into the calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You eat Twix, too?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea heard the voice and looked around. She looked up and saw it was Cody, the new blonde kid from her class who was also really fat. He had a Twix in his hands and was looking like he was about to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I get that's at least one thing we have in common,\" Shea said with a grin. \"You can sit down if you want,\" Shea said as she motioned a hand to the spot next to him. He sat down, which made his rolls of fat pile up very noticeably to Shea's eye. She grinned as she liked the look of his fattening body, although her grin and red face didn't want to admit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you new here too, then?\" Cody asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I moved in with my Aunt as my parents got a new job. How about you?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my parents were getting divorced. I decided to live with my Grandma because it was getting too difficult. Hence why I have eaten so much more,\" Cody said as he grabbed his belly, which made Shea look in awe. She did not know why she liked admiring the fat so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sane here. I used to be really skinny, but I ballooned pretty fast,\" Shea said as she grabbed her fat, making her and Cody laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hey, my Grandma is out of town for a few days because she is on a business trip. She has a ton of food though if you're hungry and want to eat right now?\" Cody asked hesitantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How far away does she live from here?\" Shea asked as her stomach rumbled more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just two blocks away. It will take us five minutes to walk there,\" Cody said as he scratched his belly. In awe, Shea looked at Cody's stomach again. She knew that she has a boyfriend, but Cody did look good with his fat and she couldn't deny it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Let's go eat some food! I'm starved!\" Shea said as they got up and prepared to walk over to Cody's house. Shea could not wait to pig out with another fat person.</span></div></div>",

That's partly why they are getting divorced. So perhaps she's my half sister. Anyway she's just six months old, lives and stays with my mother. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just me. Only me not one sibling not even a half sibling. However I must admit I would have loved a sibling. I was alone a lot of the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did you then started to eat out of boredom?\" Cody asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh no. Most of this fat after I moved over here. My aunt is a terrific cook. Then I met Jane, Rapunzel, Carlie and of course most important, Emily. Well She wanted to gain weight and asked me to gain with her. I said yes and... I found out I really liked it. I enjoyed doing it and I liked my new weight. But I want to gain even more. With Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Emily. I remember her. Yeah I saw her before the vacation. She was a lo fatter. But I did't mind that. So the two of you are gaining... on purpose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Is that so strange?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I know a lot of people who want to lose weight. I never met or heard of anyone who want to gain weight. However a lot of people gain but don't want to gain. Some of them eat fries, hamburgers and KFC super sized portions and don't understand why they're fat. Ha ha haa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Well how about you? What do you think about it? I mean yoy're also pretty... big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... my opinion is... I don't really mind. You know if I would lose this big belly and became a slender, perhaps even muscled kid I would't mind. But If I would stay this weight, perhaps even gain a few pounds I would't mind. At least not until it would really bother me like those people in my 600 lbs life, you know. But that's for me, and I'm a boy. Girls look better if they're fat. But that's what I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so nice of you.\" Shea on seducing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow easy. Listen you seem like a nice girl, we can be friends but not more then just friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why. Don't I look good?\" Shea asked indignant with her hands in her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo.\" Cody said slowly. \"But you're Leonard's girlfriend. Leonard is a nice guy and all, but if I would steal his girl friend. I think he will be pretty angry. Leonard is also pretty strong, if he's angry at me, my face will look like a pizza after he's done with me. By the way it would be wrong to steal someones girlfriend. No matter who it is. If I do that all other boys would't like me. So just friends is fine with me... but not boy and girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea could hit herself. She was in love with Leonard. Why would she like this boy. Sure he was friendly and all but she did't knew him that good. She also liked how fat he was. But she did't wanna lose Leonard. She really liked him. She did't think he wanted to lose her either. Leonard was pretty strong. He seemed very reasonable but who knew what he would do if he really got angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah here we are.\" Cody said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea saw his grandma lived in a pretty old house. But many old people lived in old houses. It looked kind of cozy and friendly.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked around and saw a lot of antique furniture, China, and other valuables that made the house look like it was part of a historic connection. However, she looked around and saw that there were components to it where it was definitely a Grandma's house because of all of the photos, especially of Cody. She took her shoes off at the front door area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my house. Where do you want to eat?\" Cody asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well usually I work up an appetite in the kitchen, but I'm fine anywhere honestly,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I usually do it downstairs because my room is down there, but outside my room is my own entertainment center and place to sit and relax while I pig out,\" Cody said as he scratched his belly and Shea observed closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine with me,\" Shea said as they began to walk towards the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea observed the many photos of Cody from when he was a baby all the way up until now. Shea noticed that when he was younger, he was surprisingly thin as a baby. However, when she looked at photos of him around age eight or nine, she could tell that's when he started gaining. Finally, after a minute or two, they were in the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of food do you like?\" Cody asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything sweet, fattening, or just tasty,\" Shea said as she rubbed her belly and licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then! Hold out your hands!\" Cody said as he began to stack food in Shea's arms like a major pile of firewood being created. Cody gave her a couple bags of candy, some pudding, and even a cake, which made a major balancing act for Shea. However, Cody also made a pile on his arms of various foods that were made of pure fat and sugar. Immediately they began to walk downstairs as they walked towards a table in front of the TV center. They placed everything down, seeing that the whole table was full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back real quick. I'm going to change real quick,\" Cody said as he went into his room nearby real quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea looked around and noticed how nice this basement was. The television was over fifty inches for sure as the entertainment center had loads of video games, DVDs, and other important entertainment components. There were many couches around the area which made it easy for people to relax. Overall, the area would be a glutton's paradise, which made Shea smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice set up,\" Shea said with a grin as she turned around to look at Cody who just walked out of his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Cody said as he looked at Shea. Shea observed how Cody changed out of his khakis and nice polo, but rather changed into gym shorts and a tighter t-shirt that showed every crevice of his fat. She also noticed how Cody was wearing a grey beanie with a puff ball on top to hide his blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wear winter hats, too?\" Shea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. My grandma would not let me wear one because it was the first day of school. I have a whole closet filled with them if you want to see after our pig out,\" Cody said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! I'm jealous because I have to still wear this dress clothes,\" Shea said as she pointed to herself. \"It's almost like you want to see me fill it out,\" Shea said in a seductive tone. However, Cody brushed it off and kind of giggled at it slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I will say that your fat is not too bad for a girl,\" Cody said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do you not think I can eat a lot of food?\" Shea asked out of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I bet you can, but we will have to see right now, won't we?\" Cody said as he pulled down his beanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on, blondie,\" Shea said as she grinned and brushed up against Cody while passing him to sit down.</span></div></div>",

Just a normal room of an eleven year old boy. A bed, a desk with chair, a beanbag chair and a closet with books, a few boxes with toys and there she saw a closet with clothes.

But before girls only wore dresses till their ankles. While she could't think of any girl that would wear that these days except maybe in kindergarten.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes she found some clothes that did't looked bad at her.

She looked once more at herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fat, I like it, and I'm darn proud at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back too the kitchen with a wobbling belly. Cody looked at her and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks pretty good at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thanks.\" Shea mumbled. \"It was fun Cody but I think I can better go now. I guess my aunt is starting to worry about me. Oh and Cody... don't tell anybody a word about what happened here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" Cody said calmly. \"My lips are sealed. No one will know about your clothes. But perhaps it's wiser if you take the evidence with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up the remains of her dress and walked out. What happened had was kind of embarrassing but Cody stayed rather calm about it. She was thankful for that. He acted like it did't was a big deal and perhaps it was't. After all she still wore her underwear. You also saw girls in bikini's in the swimming pool. How different was that from this? She also believed Cody that he would't tell anyone. She liked Cody but just as a friend, at least she thought and hoped it.  <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

She was happy that she got to eat a lot of food and meet someone knew, but she still could not believe that she ripped her dress in front of Cody. Although she felt like he could be a great friend, she had a feeling around him. Maybe it was attraction as she liked his fat a lot. However, she knew that she would just look into it later and try not to worry about the strange feelings now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, with shreds of her dress in her hands, Shea was walking home wearing a grey shirt with a Star Wars logo on it while wearing a pair of Cody's pants. She could smell Cody's natural scent in the clothing as she continued to walk on by. She was not worried or paranoid at wearing Cody's clothing. However, she didn't want Aunt Yenna to see or notice the clothing since it could give off the wrong idea. As she was thinking of all of this, Shea grabbed her belly that was sticking out under her shirt and continued to shake it. She needed to weigh herself again to see how much bigger she had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneakily, Shea went through the front door of Aunt Yenna's quietly. She then walked slowly towards the kitchen as she heard her Aunt preparing food. And, it was Shea's favorite: fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy. The way her Aunt Yenna made it was extra fattening, but Shea did not care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's even more food to eat now. I'm going to be more stuffed than a turkey by the time I'm done eating tonight,\" Shea said with a grin as she patted her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment, Shea went upstairs to her room. She took the shredding of her dress and put it on her dresser. She then saw her puff ball winter hat and slipped it on her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, if I have to wear another dress this week, I will try to become immobile by the end of the day today,\" Shea said as she jumped into her bed to relax for a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea was still confused about Cody, but was happy to have eaten more food. Although the dress situation was embarrassing, she was also proud to know that she had gotten even bigger. Now that the first day of school was coming to a close, Shea knew that this year of school was going to be an eventful one. Time would tell what would happen with Shea.</span></div></div>",

I got a boyfriend and he loves my fat and likes it to stuff me with food. I got huge tits. It's going good at school. Well this is just the first day. I think I should wait a few weeks before I can say how it goes. But everything else goes well. I'm pretty happy. It was nice of Cody to borrow me his... Oh I can better take them of before aunt Yenna sees them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea fast put her clothes of but she then took a look in the mirror and thought she looked very good. She looked fantastic. A dream girl. Well Leonard's dream girl anyway. She then looked at the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how much I weigh exactly.\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe even pulled of her panties and bra. She was totally naked and stepped on the scale. She had bit of trouble seeing past her tummy. The needle crept over the 266 pound she hit last and stopped at 270 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea smiled but also noticed the food still needed to digest. But aunt Yenna mad a delicious fattening dinner.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first lets get some clothes. I can't go down for dinner naked. At the other hand... no one is down there except aunt Yenna. She's also a girl. I guess I could. But that would be a bit weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked in her closet for some clothes that would fit her. That was getting harder each day. But she liked that. However it was a sign she needed to buy new clothes soon. perhaps she could do that with Emily. However... Emily had a bit of trouble with Shea's body. Emily perhaps could use some of her old clothes. She could't use them anymore anyway. At least someone she cared about could use them. However who else could she ask? <br>\r\nJane, Sandy, Carlie, perhaps Leonard or even Cody. However the idea of going clothing shopping with a boy felt a bit strange to her. Well she could think about that later. <br>\r\nShe put on some clothes and went ling on the bed until aunt Yenna called her for dinner<br>\r\nShe ran downstairs as fast if her chubby legs could carry her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you were upstairs. I was't sure. I did't hear you come home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh after school I met a really nice guy. Cody. His new here and invited me over. We talked a bit and ate. He's also pretty fat. Anyway sorry I did't told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's nice. Another boy. Not another boyfriend I hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Of course not! Leonard is my boyfriend! I'm not a girl who's having several boys at one time. That would make me a bit of a slut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was you first day at school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fine. But nothing special off course. It's just the first day. No test of course. However... at my old school I was doing... fine. I was't a straight A student but my grades were good enough to make my parents proud. However that was of course over 100 pounds ago. I'm not sure how good I am in P.E those days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah what does that matter?\" Aunt Yenna asked on a teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea smiled and took a big bite of fried chicken. Grease was dripping of her chin. She looked at all the food. It seemed pretty much for just two people. But Shea promised herself it would all en up in her belly adding more and more fat to her body.<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

You have done them before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah but I was 270 pounds back then, or had boobs. I don't want a strange doctor checking them for lumps.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.

I wanna show you something. and Maybe take a bite to eat while I'm there as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will ask.\" Shea said. \"Eh aunt Yenna Emily want to come over to show me something, and also eat a bit perhaps. Can she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... sure. But don't stay up to late. You have school tomorrow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Emily. Come over fast before I have eaten every thing here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Emily ran inside.

Did't you have dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had.\" Emily said with a wide grin and started to stuff her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you wanted me to see, but I know for sure it has't really ruined your appetite.\" Aunt Yenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... well.... actually... I only wanted  to show it to Shea. You know. Something between female friends.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. Then better fast eat your food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were done eating Emily and Shea ran up to Shea's room. Shea jumped on her bed and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Shea this what I wanted you to show!\" Emily said excited and pulled of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled up one eyebrow seeing her friend there with her upper body bare. But then she saw it. Emilly's chest was't flat anymore. There were two small lumps. Sure they were't pretty small, but Emily seemed so happy she could't bear to tell her that. By the way now they started growing they probably would get bigger soon. Especially if you noticed how fast she was gaining. Some of that fat also must to go to her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see them right? I have tits! Finally! Thank you god! I finally have them! I know they're pretty small right now. Especially compared to yours but still... Now I have them started they sure will grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah... Eh Emily tomorrow we can't walk to school together. I have a check up by the doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry. I know him. Well I know everyone in our village of course. However he's pretty nice and friendly and respects you. You don't have to worry. He won't do anything you don't want to. By the way... are this your clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. They're not. They're from Cody. He's a really nice fat boy. He moved over here recently. I was over at his house and ate. I ate so much my clothes ripped. Well I could't go home naked so I borrowed some of his clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fat boy? Does he looks nice.\" Emily asked teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea knew Emily only teased but it did gave her an idea. Perhaps Emily would be a nice girlfriend for Cody. Then they could double date. That would be fun. A date with her boyfriend and two of her best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will show him to you tomorrow. After I'm back from the doctor. Oh here by the way.\" She said and tossed one of her old bra's to Emily. \"If they become a bit bigger you perhaps can wear them on parties or so to look a bit more... presentable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls started to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Some early morning show was on where really skinny people were cooking food and talking about healthy habits, something that Shea had truly disregarded.

The nurse looked at the number and whistled. She wrote the weight down.<br>\r\nThen the doctor came in. He smiled friendly and walked calmly over to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you must be Shea. I'm doctor Smith. You don't have to worry this is all just a check up. You had check ups before right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea nodded. The man seemed and sounded very friendly. So probably this would turn out all right<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor checked Shea height, reflexes, listen to her hart beat and some other things asked her some questions every now and then. Finally he was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Polly could you call Miss Yenna in?\" He asked the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse walked out and returned a few seconds later with aunt Yenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeeel.\" The doctor started slowly. \"Shea you seem to be perfectly healthy. However... your weight is really very high for a girl of your age and height. You're eleven but you seem pretty mature. You have a big chest for a eleven year old I guess you had you first period right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh yeah. Short before I came here.\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. I thought something like that. Girls with a high weight seem to mature faster. But like I said your weight is very high for a girl of your age and height. I got a copy from your old doctor. According to the information I got from him you seem to have gained a lot of weight in the past time. Now at the moment you're healthy. Lets make that clear. But if you gain more and more weight... well you might be less lucky. Do you do any kind of exercise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not really. Swimming sometimes, in the swimming pool of aunt Yenna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Now you're in no danger. You're also to young for a crash diet. But I advice you to eat a bit more healthy. Perhaps some more vegetables and fruit. It's also healthier to cook food yourself than canned or jarred  food. It also would be good for you to do some kind of exercise in a exercise group. Maybe that way you can lose some of that extra weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What no if I don't want to lose weight?\" Shea asked \"I like being fat. I even want to become fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. Oh well that't unusual. Well in that case you may be happy you're still healthy. But I can't promise you that you stay healthy. But if you really want to do this make sure that you stay healthy. Try to train your muscles so they can support your weight. If you think something is wrong come straight to me. That's all I can say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea and aunt Yenna tanked the doctor and walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit he was pretty friendly. And maybe train my muscles a bit is't a bad idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But first you need to go to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know. But can we perhaps first get something to eat?\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey, uh, do you want to go swimming? Apparently we have a pool in one of the rooms...\" Shea asked nervously. The three local girls exchanged looks.<br>\r\n\"Uh, I don't think any of us brought swimsuits...\" said Jane awkwardly.<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Shea said, slightly put out. Then she perked up. \"Don't worry, I brought a few. You can borrow some of mine!\"<br>\r\n\"Sure then.\" Chucking their paper plates into the bin, they followed her upstairs to her room and went inside. All of them but Sandy, who'd stayed there before, looked around at the beautiful room in amazement.<br>\r\n\"Wow, Shea, you're lucky to have such a nice room. It's so much bigger than mine!\" Said Emily enviously. Jane also looked impressed. Shea remembered that neither of their houses had been very big; she supposed that their families might not have all that much money.<br>\r\nSandy, meanwhile, had been busy sampling a few of the candies from the various jars dotted around. She turned to Shea, smiling through a mouth of sugar.<br>\r\n\"These are great Shea! I wish Yenna had had these out when I stayed here...\" said the plump girl wistfully. \"My parents probably told her not to though.\"<br>\r\n\"Why would they do that?\" asked Shea, confused.<br>\r\n\"They think I'm too heavy.\" said Sandy, looking rather irked. \"I keep telling them I don't weigh half as much as some of the kids round here, but apparently 5 pounds extra are just too much...\"<br>\r\nShea looked the larger girl up and down. Only five pounds extra seemed a little optimistic if you asked her... though the blonde girl probably wasn't that heavy, she was a good 4 inches shorter than her, and those extra pounds had spread themselves across her lower body. The result was a large, rounded belly, a large butt for an eleven year old, and soft thick thighs.<br>\r\nIn the end, Shea shrugged noncommittally.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\nEmily tapped her on the shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Hey, where are your swimsuits? I'm looking forward to this pool of yours!\"<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah. They should be in one of my bags.\u201d Shea moved over and started rummaging in a suitcase, quickly producing a few sets of swimwear. She counted them. \u201cI\u2019ve only got four pairs, so grab\u2026\u201d she took her favourite tankini before anyone else could \u201c\u2026what you want.\u201d<br>\r\nThe other three eleven year olds divided up the suits, quickly reaching an agreement. It was obvious they had known each other a long time, guessing what the others would want without a word. In the end, Sandy got a one-piece, Jane got a bikini and Emily took her spare tankini. <br>\r\n\u201cShall we, er, use the bathroom to change or\u2026?\u201d <br>\r\nJane looked at her, bemused.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re all girls here, aren\u2019t we?\u201d The slim girl began unbuttoning her shirt, revealing her bra underneath.<br>\r\n\u201cO-okay then.\u201d She said nervously. These girls really were welcoming; she\u2019d only met them a few hours ago! Not wanting to be left behind as Sandy and Emily both started stripping down as well, she pulled off her shirt, feeling slightly self-conscious. She was all too aware of how much she\u2019d eaten that evening, but although her belly was slightly swollen she wasn\u2019t even close to chubby yet. If she remembered correctly, last time she\u2019d weighed herself she\u2019d been about 105 pounds.<br>\r\nShe watched as Emily unbuttoned her shirt, revealing she was the only one of the four to not yet wear a bra. The blonde girl looked around at the other three, frustration written across her face as she noticed the same fact.<br>\r\n\u201cYou as well Shea? Damn it.\u201d She looked down at her flat chest. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair! Why do I have to wait when everyone else doesn\u2019t?\u201d<br>\r\nBoth Jane and Sandy looked bemusedly at her. It was evident they\u2019d had this conversation many times before.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll catch up soon, Emily, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Said Sandy reassuringly. Despite her chubby figure, little fat had settled on her chest. Still, it was more than Emily\u2019s complete lack of breasts altogether.<br>\r\n\u201cBut both my sisters have them! Even Ellie, and she\u2019s only nine! How\u2019s that fair?\u201d This was obviously a big deal to her, as evidenced by her bright red cheeks, but Jane spoke normally.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but Ellie\u2019s pretty chubby and your older sister\u2019s, well, older. You should be pleased you\u2019re so slim; the boys\u2019ll go crazy for you in a few years.\u201d <br>\r\nEmily sighed.<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose\u2026 maybe next year right?\u201d she turned to Shea. \u201cSorry about that. Touchy subject you know?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d Shea apologized awkwardly.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t apologize, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d The blonde girl looked slightly guilty. \u201cI've made you feel bad at your own sleepover now, sorry.\u201d She looked around, and saw that both Jane and Sandy were changed. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s hurry up and get ready. I\u2019ll make it up to you later, okay?\u201d <br>\r\nThey both quickly slipped into their swimsuits and set out down the corridor, following the other two girls. Shea reflected idly on how strange it was to be lead around her own home, but it made sense as Jane knew the building better than she did. As she walked, she kept adjusting her tankini bottom. It was a bit tighter than she remembered, the fabric stretched taught under her bloated belly, but at least it fit her better than Emily\u2019s did; the waistband was quite loose around the skinny girl\u2019s narrow waist, constantly threatening to fall down.<br>\r\nShe glanced at Jane, and was impressed by how good the redhead looked in her borrowed bikini. Shea\u2019s grandmother had bought it for her, God knows why, but the old woman had bought one that was considerably too small in the waist. By luck, it fitted the athletic girl beautifully, both top and bottom.<br>\r\nSandy\u2019s costume, on the other hand, didn't fit quite as perfectly; the one piece hadn't been worn in at least a year, when Shea had been a bit slimmer than she was now, and was very tight on the plump blonde, clinging to her bulging form like a second skin, evidently straining the fabric across her belly and chest.<br>\r\nStaring at the larger girl\u2019s jiggling backside, Shea could only hope that the poor thing would survive the ordeal.</span></div></div>",

The oven was covered with foods that could have been on a magazine cover! The aroma of the food could have been from a four-star restaurant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Yenna laughed at Shea's expression, the action causing her bosom to bounce. \"So, I take it you approve?\"<br>\r\n\"A-Approve?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A week had passed by since Shea began living with her Aunt Yenna, and despite her protesting against it at first, by now she almost wanted to stay there! her aunt's hospitality was almost unmatched, and only her food was better. For Shea, each bite got better and tastier than the last. Her chicken was succulent and juicy, her pizzas were cheesy and bursting with flavour, and her fries were golden and crisp. The only thing that topped that was her desserts; the rich delicious cakes, the soft cool ice cream, the flavourful chocolate.<br>\r\nShea just couldn't get enough of her aunt's cooking. <br>\r\nLiterally. She was becoming full-blown addicted to the food set in front of her. She'd eat, eat, and eat, then ask for more. She even asked frequently if she could lick the melted chocolate from the bowl! And of course her dear Aunt Yenna didn't mind her new eating habits at all; in fact she welcomed them. \"Young ones like you still need a lot to grow,\" she'd say.<br>\r\nOf course she meant in age, but for Shea that growth was outward. In only a week she'd already shown signs of plumping up; her pot belly was now starting to slightly hang over her waist, which had expanded by just a few inches. Her thighs had expanded too, nearly touching together, and you could see a double chin beginning to form just between her cheeks, which were also starting to plump up. Even her backside was a bit bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShea was oblivious to this of course. All she wanted was her aunt's food, and a lot of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning, Shea rose up from her bed, not hearing the small creak of relief coming from it. She gave a quiet yawn, stretching her arms up and causing her sleeping vest to ride up and her rounder tummy to show. The groggy girl plodded to the bathroom, washed herself up (not noticing her slightly plumped up face) and returned to her room without brushing her teeth, so's to not spoil the flavour of her aunt's amazing food. She could always brush after.<br>\r\nShe stood at the mirror and brushed her long brown hair, getting it into its naturally wavy style.<br>\r\nNow to dress, Shea checked off in her mind. She grabbed a pair of jeans and stepped into them, grunting softly as she slightly wiggled her wider hips to slip them up to her waist and button them up. They felt a bit tighter, she noted. She then grabbed a clean red t-shirt and slipped it over her head and onto herself, tugging it down a bit.<br>\r\nShea looked in the mirror with a little bit of concern growing; her tummy was peeking out a bit from under her shirt, which looked a bit tight.<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I've been...eating a bit too much?</i> She thought to herself warily. Maybe she could check her weight in the bathroom before she went down for breakfast.<br>\r\nAnd speaking of breakfast, at that very moment a succulent smell flowed right into the girl's nostrils, her eyes widening at what she could smell; sausages, eggs, bacon, toast, everything!<br>\r\nHer rounder tummy gave out a desperate rumble, begging Shea to go down there ASAP and feed it, <b>now</b>.</span></div></div>",

She had beautiful brown hair, an adorable chubby face, full plump lips, and she was a bit curvy with a small gut.  She wasn't too terribly bright, having a D average. She didn't know George Washington from Bill Clinton. She just like to eat and have fun with her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Shea walked in the living room where her parents were. She had on just a really short tank top and some jean shorts that were cut off at the hip. Her Mom notices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not leaving the house like that, are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mom. I'm just going to hang around the house today,\" Shea said irritated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby, you haven't been eating enough.

They all sat at the table. Her parents wanted to feed her themselves. Being a bit spoiled and not too bright, she says with glee \"Okay!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they shovel it in her cute, chubby face. Her parents take turns feeding her while she feeds herself in the process. She eats and eats and eats. They eat some as well, but not a lot. After a while, Shea starts to get thick. Her belly gets bigger and bigger. Her face gets fuller, her juicy lips covered in grease. Her butt gets more plump and round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, my baby,\" her Mom says as she rubs her daughter's fat gut.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On a fall day, the mall in a normal city was full of people of different races and genders. Many of them were walking around, looking at stores and buying the different foods located at the mall. Many friends were hanging out with one another while others were in the mall by themselves. One of those people was a girl who was currently on the move. She was a girl who liked to wear skater clothing, especially clothing from Hot Topic. She was wearing a black hoodie that had designs on it with a torn pair of skinny jeans, black shoes, and a black skater beanie. Under her hoodie was a black tank top that showed how skinny she really way. For those who did not know her, her name was Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily had some what of a shy personality, having some issues with her self confidence, but she was a pretty girl with brown hair that went down to her shoulders, tan skin, and brown eyes. She was short and very skinny, in fact, underweight. When people looked at her, they would believe that she was a skater girl. In reality, she was just a normal girl who liked the color black and liked listening to alternative rock music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was starting to enjoy her life more as she had met a new guy named Michael. She had feelings for him, hoping that he feels the same way. Luckily for her, she had no school today and was excited to see Michael later on. She was just wondering what to do to kill time. She didn't like beingaround her family, which was why she was at the mall. After a few minutes, Emily found something to do and somewhere to go.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emily let her feet guide her, not really caring where she went as she wondered aimlessly through the mall. There was music playing overhead, though the sounds of people enjoying themselves made it sound like more of a slightly melodic hum than actual music. Emily effortlessly weaved in and out of the other shoppers as she glanced in the windows of each shop she passed, hoping that something would catch her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost to the end of the mall when she stopped, her eyes drawn to a shirt inside a store that looked like just her style. Instinctively she changed course, as her feet carried her into the shop. The floor changed from tile to a beige carpet, and the din of the mall grew quieter as she strode into a sea of clothes. There was only a couple other women in the store besides the plump attendant who was folding shirts at the register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily quickly reached the shirt, as her eyes went wide. There was a whole section of shirts that were just her style! She began rifling through the different designs, trying to decide which one to get. They had such a good selection, she was surprised that she hadn't been in this store before. Though now that she thought about it, she didn't even know which store she was in. Not that it mattered. They had such a great selection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she decided on a shirt and began looking at the sizes. Large. Extra-Large. Extra-Extra-Large. No matter how deep she dug in the pile of shirts she couldn't seem to find anything smaller than a large, which would be way to big on her wiry body. She let out a sigh. Maybe the attendant would be able to find a small for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteeling herself she glanced at the counter near the front of the store. The attendant was definitely plus-sized though she still looked really cute. She had her blond hair in a stylish bun, and her black-framed glasses made her look surprisingly chill. Her extra weight really made her look young with a round face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one more deep breath, Emily grabbed one of the shirts and strode up to the counter, \"Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant smiled at Emily, making her look even more youthful as she replied in a sing-songy voice, \"Yes? How can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily set the shirt on the counter for the attendant to see, \"I was wondering if maybe you had this in a small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump girl chuckled slightly, \"I'm sorry miss, but I think you're a little too small to be shopping in this store. We cater to plus-sized women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily felt her face turning red as she glanced around the store. Sure enough, everyone in here was at least plus-sized if not bigger. Even the other teen girl off in one of the corners. She looked back at the attendant, noticing her name badge said Lisa, as she watched Emily to see if there was anything else she could do for her. Emily glanced back at the shirt lifting it in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared intently at the shirt, trying to avoid showing Lisa how red she obviously was. She hadn't even realized she'd walked into a plus-sized shop. She'd just saw the shirt and had been drawn in. She really did want the shirt, but there was no way it would fit on her. However, it wasn't like she'd seen this shirt anywhere else. This shop probably had the rights to it or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flipped the shirt over, holding it up to better look it over. The material felt nice to the touch, not too rough and not to soft. She even had the perfect accessories to go with it. The only problem was that it was designed for girls who weren't underweight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily bit her lip, trying to decide what to do. She'd already embarrassed herself by asking if they had a small in a plus-sized store. Still, maybe she could just buy the shirt and say it was for a friend, and was wondering if they had any smaller sizes because she thought it looked really cute. The attendant would probably buy that story. Though then she'd be stuck with a shirt that there was no way she was going to fit in unless she put on like fifty pounds. Still, the doctor did say she needed to put on at least 40 pounds. So even though it would be lose, the shirt would probably fit better then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she could also just cut her loses and leave. It probably wasn't the first time someone had asked that question of the attendant. She'd probably understand. Still, she just wished she wasn't so underweight. It would definitely make things easier. That was a problem for a different time though. Right now she needed to decide what to do with the shirt.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emily steeled herself, \"This is for a friend. I just thought it would be cool if we had matching shirts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled, \"Ah, unfortunately large is the smallest size we carry. That shirt has been pretty popular, so whatever we have out is all we've got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to get anymore in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The company that made that shirt has gone out of business, so I doubt you'll be able to find that shirt anywhere else. And that also means that once it's gone we won't be restocking it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily let out a disappointed sigh as she clutched the shirt to her chest, \"Alright, I'll take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later she was walking out of the plus-sized store with her new purchase hanging in a bag on her arm. She pulled her phone out of her back pocket, glancing at the time before sliding it back into its storage space. She still had an hour until she was going to meet Michael at that new all-you-can-eat place just down the street. Her stomach let out a loud growl as she began wandering through the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched her feet as she walked, lost in thought. She wasn't sure why she'd bothered buying that shirt. There was no way that it would fit on her, but it had just been so her. Still, she had put on a couple of pounds the last week or so. That was probably due to Michael always taking her out to places with really big portion sizes or buffets. Though it wasn't like she was too worried about her weight right now. If anything it would be good if she put on a few more pounds. Maybe then she would be able to fit into her new shirt without drowning in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Emily! What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily jumped slightly, looking for the whoever was calling her name. She nodded at the plump girl who was waving at her. The girl was definitely fat, though she was still really cute. Her round face actually made her look younger than she was, though one look at her oversized bosom sagging on her round belly would quickly correct that notion. Emily chuckled as she watched the girl's skin-tight shirt start riding up on her belly as she jumped up and down, trying to get Emily's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily made her way through the crowd of people towards the wide girl, \"Hey Sam. What you doin' here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just thought I'd get some food.\" Sam said, holding up a large burger for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily noticed a couple other burger wrappers on the bench by Sam, as well as another uneaten burger on her other side, \"Sweet. I'm just killing time until I meet up with Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam rolled her eyes and took a big bite of her burger, \"You two are such a couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily plopped down on the bench next to Sam, \"What's that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam just shook her head, taking another bite of her burger. She licked the sauce off her hand before handing Emily the uneaten burger. Emily unwrapped the burger and took a large bite from the greasy goodness. She closed her eyes, savoring the savory flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily smiled as she glanced at the large girl beside her. They'd been friends since kindergarten, though they'd both been about the same size back then. However, even then it had been obvious that Samantha loved to eat. She was always complaining about how hungry she was, or stuffing her face if she had the chance. She had never really cared about what others would think of her and just seemed to enjoy herself. Though, it wasn't like Emily was too much different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily didn't really care what others thought of her body. It wasn't like she'd really been trying to stay skinny, she just wasn't into food like Sam was. Though, she was finding herself indulging herself a lot more often since she'd been hanging out with Michael. The big difference between her and Sam was that while she spent most of her money on clothes or movies, Sam spent most of her money on food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what you got there?\" Sam asked, gesturing towards Emily's bag with her burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a shirt I thought was cool. It's a little too big, but I figure I can wear it if I ever put on some weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not likely. I can't picture you as anything other than a twig.\" Sam laughed through a mouthful of burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily turned her attention to the floor, taking another bite of the delicious burger. Honestly, she wouldn't mind being chubby or even called fat, but it was the fact that everyone just saw her as a twig that bugged her. It wasn't like she was trying. Though that seemed to annoy everyone even more. The fact that she could be a twig with no effort, and they had to work just to stay average. She was sure she got teased more because she was a twig that she would if she was chubby. Especially since in this day and age, it seemed like everyone was at least a little chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam put a thick arm around Emily's shoulders, pulling her close to her soft body, \"So, what you and Michael going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to try that new buffet place just down the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to let me know how it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been wanting to try that place, but I just haven't been able to get there yet.\" Sam said, leaning back on the bench, causing her shirt to ride up her belly, exposing her belly button, \"Looks like its almost time to get some new clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you just get those just a couple of weeks ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Sam said, tugging on her shirt as she tried to get it around her bloated belly, \"but I think they must have shrunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily smiled as she shoved the last of her burger into her mouth. She was sure that shrinking wasn't the problem. Ever since Sam had gotten that new job that payed her quite a bit she'd been blowing up like a balloon. She'd been chubby for a couple of years, but lately she'd finally progressed to being fat, and it looked like she was showing no signs of stopping her expansion. At this rate she might be able to make a bid for fattest girl in school in a few months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScoffing Emily leaned back on the bench, staring at the glass ceiling. Honestly, she was kind of jealous of Sam. She seemed so happy, and everyone seemed to like her, so it wasn't like she really ever got teased about her weight. Maybe she should ask Sam for some help putting on a little weight. Just so that she was more average. She had no idea how to go about that though. It wasn't like she could just say, 'hey your fat, can you help me put on some weight?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily pulled out her phone, glancing at the time again. She let out a sigh and stood up, tossing the empty wrapper on the pile of wrappers by Sam, \"Well, I've got to go. I'll talk to you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam just nodded, trying to swallow the mouthful of burger she was working on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily made her way towards the exit, emerging into the bright sunlight. She shielded her eyes as she waited for them to adjust to the natural light of day. She caught a slight hint of cinnamon on the crisp breeze that caused her to wrap her arms around herself. She watched as a few leaves fell to the ground from the trees in front of the mall, as a gentle rustling filled the air. She could see the restaurant at the far end of the parking lot, just past the end of the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later she was walking up towards the front door, when she noticed a tall blond boy waiting on the bench just outside. He stood up and started walking towards her when he noticed she was approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you waiting long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" he said, pulling her into a kiss, \"probably five minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily could feel his hand running up and down her thin body, \"Alright, well let's head inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walked inside. It was pretty crowded, but they were able to get a table quickly. Michael went off to load up a plate of food, while Emily left her things at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned, watching Michael's back as he disappeared from view. Maybe she was being paranoid, but it almost seemed like Michael was disappointed that she was so thin too. He always seemed to look a little disappointed whenever his hands ran into one of her many exposed bones, and he often seemed disappointed that he couldn't really take her flesh in his hands. Still, it wasn't like she had really been trying to gain weight either, but after today she was beginning to wonder if maybe she should work on putting on some weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around at the numerous people around her, most of them chubby, she couldn't help feeling out of place with how skinny she was. This wouldn't be a bad place to start gaining a bit of weight. But what if Michael didn't like her after she put on weight? Well, honestly it probably wouldn't be too hard for her to lose the weight if that was the case, but something kept telling her that wouldn't be a problem. Still, it was a big decision to decide to actively try to gain weight. What if she couldn't stop herself and ended up like Sam? Though it wasn't like Sam seemed unhappy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do...?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emily was quiet as she followed Michael into the restaurant. Thoughts raced through her head as she tried to decide what to do. On the one hand, she was definitely a bit curious about what it would be like to gain some weight. On the other, she really cared about Michael and she didn't want to disappoint him. She could ask him about it, but she didn't want him to think she was weird for even suggesting something like that. She could also work at putting on some weight and see if he reacted at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe followed Michael through the crowd of mostly chubby or fat people towards the cashier, listening to the sounds of people chatting and eating. The smell of delicious food wafted from the dining area, causing her mouth to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as he paid the cashier for the two of them, though she found her eyes wandering towards the many overweight people around her. Her eyes drifted lazily around the dining area, taking everything in as she contemplated what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her eyes fixated on one person as she felt a fluttering in her chest. She didn't even care that she was staring as she looked at the large girl across the dining area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she didn't know any better, she would say that it was her twin. Though slightly older and quite a bit heavier. The girl was probably about eighteen, and was probably three times Emily's weight. She was with a couple of friends that also were pretty chubby, and the three of them were laughing at something one of them said. A large pile of empty plates littered the table as the three of them continued feasting on more food than Emily ate in a week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily jumped slightly as Michael put his arm on her shoulder, looking a bit concerned, \"Sorry. I zoned out for a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael chuckled, glancing in the direction she had been looking. She was sure he saw them. The three girls eating to their heart's content. However, he didn't say anything about it. Instead, he took her hand and led her into the dining area. A moment later they were sitting down at an empty table with a rather good view of the three girls. Emily wasn't sure if that was intentional or not, but she found herself glancing their way more often than she anticipated. Though she was sure she wasn't the only one at the table doing that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were settled in, she got up to get some food. She moved easily through the crowd of people at the buffet tables. Her small size allowing her to squeeze into areas others couldn't. Though she found herself trying to watch the girl through the crowd, but she kept losing site of the three girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whipped her head around as she bumped into something soft, \"I'm so sorry. I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped as she realized she'd bumped into the girl she'd been watching. She hadn't even realized she'd gotten up from her table to load up another plate of food. The girl smiled at her, \"No problem. I know I take up a bit more space than normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily watched as the girl turned her attention back to loading up her plate. She seemed so confident in her size. It didn't seem to bother her at all that she was fat. On top of that, Emily couldn't deny that there was something about her that was quite beautiful. It seemed like all that weight made her look perfect as it smoothed her out and made her look very inviting and kind. She unconsciously found herself loading up her plate to match the girl's heavy meal before heading back towards her own table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone's hungry.\" Michael said as she sat down, \"Though, that's good. I usually have to prod you just to eat enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily took one more look at the fat girl, \"Yeah, I figured I should probably eat a bit more so I don't space out so often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I've been trying to tell you.\" Michael laughed, \"You couldn't even feed a mouse with how much you normally eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily glanced at her plate as she began eating, unable to look Michael in the eyes. Michael seemed to realize how uncomfortable she was feeling and quickly changed the subject to a new band he'd just heard about. She quickly relaxed and even went back for another plate that almost mirrored the first before finally getting dessert. All the while they chatted and laughed, and Emily even forgot about the fat girl she'd seen until they were ready to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily let out a little belch as she rubbed her belly. She was definitely fuller than she normally was, though that was to be expected with how much she'd eaten. She was sure that she'd gone past the point of a normal meal and into overeating. Still, the three girls were still at their table with more food in front of them. She couldn't believe that they weren't done eating yet. They'd been there before Emily and Michael got there, and they didn't seem like they were slowing down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt that fluttering in her chest again as she admired how beautiful the girl looked, and she imagined that as her. She imagined what it would be like to be that fat and still be so confident. It actually made her think of Sam and how she didn't seem to care that she was fat. Actually, those two might get along just great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took one last look at the girl before following Michael through the crowded restaurant towards the exit. She shivered slightly as the cool evening air enveloped her. She was glad that she had her hoodie on with how much colder it was now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael turned and pulled her into a warm hug, \"So what did you want to do now?\"</span></div></div>",

She wasn't that bright, having a C average. She was too busy texting her friends and listening to her music. But her favorite thing about school was the cafeteria. Food was her real weakness next to chubby boys. She just loved to eat. She hated sports as she just liked to eat and hang out with her friends. As a result, she had a round bubble butt that bounced and jiggled when she walked, a soft, jiggly pot belly with a big navel, and rather big thighs. Her friends were chubby and lazy too, especially her friend Bobby, whom she had her eye on because he had a pot belly, too. Sometimes, she likes to poke and slap at his belly. He would pretend not to like it, but it actually made him turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Jenny and her friends, Bobby (age 14), Alice (age 12), and Vicky (age 13), were hanging out at her house. Her parents had went out. So she had the whole house to her self. They ordered seven pizzas, all had a liter of soda each, and planned to watch movies all night. Jenny was wearing some small bike shorts that fit like panties. They cut into her fat and showed some of her butt cheeks. Vicky, who secretly liked Jenny, said \"Nice butt, Jenny!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you, Vicky,\" Jenny said as she picked up a large slice of pizza and shoved it in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon, they all dug into the pizzas and drank their sodas. They all sounded like hogs as they scarfed everything down. Bobby and Jenny were feeding each other while Vicky and Alice were doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUURRRRP! Oh! Excuse me,\" Jenny said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby's skinny jeans started to get tight. He unbuttoned his jeans and out poured his huge gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! That's better,\" He said as he laid back on the couch with his hands over his head. Jenny's eyes got huge and a big smile came over her fat face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bobby, can I just rub your belly please? You can play with mine,\" Jenny begged as she moves her pizza filled belly all around. Bobby reluctantly replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well...okay,\" Bobby said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she got beside him on her knees on the couch and started to play with his belly. Then, he played with her belly. Meanwhile, Alice laid there on the floor knocked out, snoring on her side. Her swollen gut looks like it was waisting out of her body. Her friend, Vicky, was on the floor laying on Alice's thigh just rubbing her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen....  </span></div></div>",

She always tried to stay in shape. She comes from a family of heavy people and she has a very slow metabolism. She has always been the only skinny person in her family. She had two sisters, Bertha (13 years old 5'4, 270 pounds), and Helga (14 years old, 5'6 280 pounds.) Helga is Mackenzie's twin. She looks just like Mackenzie, but MUCH fatter. Her mother (susan) was 5'5 320 pounds. Her mother gave her sisters more attention than her, but Mackenzie was alright with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small pot belly bulged out from Mackenzie's stomach. But her sisters REALLY pigged out at thanks giving. Helga's pants were struggling to contain her girth and Betha's shirt showed all of her fat roll outlines clearly. Mackenzie's mom yelled from downstairs \"Girls, we're going shopping and going out to eat. We're getting some new clothes and some Italian food!\"<br>\r\nOf course, Helga and Bertha rushed to the family car and Mackenzie reluctantly got in. She was squished in the middle of the back seat between her two sisters. They stopped at a local Italian restaurant. They were seated at a circular table. They ordered their food. Helga said \"I'll have the lasagna and two slices of extra cheesy pizza with a large cola. Bertha said \"I'll have the spaghetti and meatballs with bread sticks and a large chocolate milkshake. Mackenzie said \"I'll just have a wat-\" Her mother interrupted \"No waiter, she'll have the spagetti and meatballs, chicken alfredo, and a large cola. In a matter of minutes, their food came. For once, Mackenzie had more food in front of her than her sisters. She started eating slowly, but then ate at a regular pace. She knew her mother wouldn't be happy if she wasted food. Mackenzie found herself eating at the pace of her sisters and finished her spaghetti and meatballs. Just as she finished, her mother left for the washroom and Helga stopped to unzip her pants to make room for more food. Her belly leaked out on to her lap, and she dug in at the same speed again. Mackenzie felt her pot belly filling up and getting full She was almost done with her meal when she had to unzip her pants as her sister did. She finished the last of her meal and washed it down with cola. She crammed her now bloated belly into her pants. Her mother came out of the bathroom, paid for the bill, and they left the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got to the nearest shopping mall and split up. Mackenzie went to a smaller clothes section while Helga and Bertha went to the same section. They wore the same size, so they helped each other pick out clothes. Mackenzie tried on her original size of shirt, but found her belly bulged out enough to see her belly button's outline on her shirt, so she reluctantly grabbed a couple shirts from a rack a size larger than her original. Seeing her pants were becoming impossible to fit into, she also went up a size in those. Before she left, Mackenzie stepped on a scale. \"135? But how? This is crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio left the mall and arrived home.</span></div></div>",

She sighed with relief as she unbuttoned and unzipped her jeans, and her gut stuck out a little farther. \"Food is good and all, but I don't want to show off that it is\", she pulled up her new, bigger shirt and rubbed her belly as she spoke, \"I like being how I look without this large thing in the way. Anyways, I can't play any sports if I'm as fat as the rest of my family, there's just no way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours had passed, and some of the newfound calories had found a spot to stay on Mackenzie's figure. She still rubbed the her belly, occasionally squeezing it in disgust. Just as she started thinking about how to get rid of the extra fat, her mom called her from the living room. She zipped up her pants, pulled down her shirt, and left her room. She entered the room to see the rest of her family, and many boxes of pizza stacked on the table. \"It's time for dinner\", her mom stated, as she split the boxes between them: 2 for her, 1 for Helga and Bertha each, and 3 for Mackenzie! She didn't want to argue, and she took a seat on the large couch. She was almost immediately greeted with a belly pat, and turned to see it was her twin Helga. Mackenzie glared at her as she finished it off by squeezing some of her new fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, dig in\", her mom said, and almost immediately Helga and Bertha started cramming food into their mouths. Mackenzie shook out of the shock she got from seeing all the food in front of her, and gradually started to pick up the pace. Her stomach already looked almost as big as when she ate the last meal when she finished the first box, but she had to unbutton her pants and keep eating, or her mom woulndn't be happy. Each of them were also given a 2-liter to help finish off some of the pizza, which came in handy having to eat so much. Her sisters watched as she ate, jealous of the extra food she got, but it also seemed they were enjoying it, watching their once toned sister eat and eat, her stomach begging for mercy but continuing to grow and expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was nearly three times it's original size when she finished everything. her new shirt was now stretching, once again revealing her bellybutton through the cotton. She couldn't believe she ate more than her mom, and she's over 300! She laid back against the couch, her stomach hurting more than ever. Helga and Bertha began to rub her distended gut, and she wanted to yell at them to stop, but she hurt to much to do anything, and this felt way too good to resist. </span></div></div>",

But then Helga brought up an interesting topic.<br>\r\n\"Why do you try to stay skinny Mackenzie? Why don't you just stop counting calories and exercising and just let go. We're identical twins, we have the same metabolism. You need to try so hard to maintain a low weight. So why not just stop?\" Mackenzie thought about that question. \"It's because skinny is the fashion. There aren't any fat models.\" Helga replied \"If everyone jumped off a bridge, would you? No. And fat woman can be models. It's not just skinny girls. You should try packing on a few pounds, just let go a little.\" Bertha joined in \"Yeah Mackenzie, being fat actually feels pretty good. And if you weighed more, you would have more in common with us. We could hang out more and better relate to each other. So yeah Mackenzie, just let go.\" Mackenzie thought about this for awhile.

The fame, beauty, and glamour those pop princesses possessed served as the aspirations of many a high school girl. One girl in particular was infatuated with becoming a pop star. Miki, a 14 year old girl with hopes of becoming the greatest pop star ever. Wielding beautiful blonde hair which she kept long and fashioned in a pony tail along with glittering blue eyes, Miki certainly caught the eyes of boys from all ages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever one trait of the stylish girl wasn't typical of a pop princess. Miki was chunky. Weighing in at 130 pounds, Miki was much heavier than her friends. Though owning an envious pair of d cup breasts, her excess flesh earned her the harassment of the thinner girls. Their ridicule only built her determination. Rather than trying to lose weight, Miki dove deeper into the world of fashion. Painting her nails, wearing cute clothes, and showing off her privileged cleavage were some of the things she adopted. Furthermore Miki diligently practiced the dance routines of the pop stars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently Miki was watching an idol's performance in her room, while her mother had just prepared dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miki! Dinner time!\" Miki's mother called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Miki couldn't hear as she was occupied with singing and dancing along with the pop star on the television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miki!\" the mother called out again approaching Miki's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother opened the door to reach Miki to be instantly greeted by the sight of her scantily dressed daughter bouncing her big butt to the music while singing along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miki, Dinner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay mom. I was getting really hungry anyway.\" Miki said turning off the tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She walked in smiling as she enters a two door entrance where she saw the place, which was huge with lots of food she can try, which could maybe help her with putting on more weight. She then went up to the reception desk and was spotted by her Uncle with delight as he was told she was coming for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why look who's here! It's my favourite niece!

She was surprised because she could tell they were just made. She grabbed one and began to eat it. Her first bite over came her as she became hooked and addicted. She began to eat the rest of the donuts on the plate. She finished the place quickly and moved on. Her belly already curvy was starting to get stuffed, but Mel J didn't notice that. She just ate and ate because it was her job. Three hours went by quickly as Mel J had gone through nine plates of donuts. She rubbed her stuffed belly. It was poking out under her shirt, which meant that her shirt was riding up half way. Her Uncle came by and began to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! What a good job, sweetie! You're done your shift now unless you want to work overtime!\" Uncle Sam said as he sneaked in the fact of working overtime. </span></div></div>",

Susan tried to think back to a time when her belly was silent, but couldn't. All her life, her belly was constantly growling when hungry, or gurgling when full. And a gurgling full belly was much less annoying than a hungry growling one. Which was one of the reasons she was so big. She's a big eater and thus, her body was packing away excess calories as fat. That fat centered on her belly primarily, which was the largest part of her body, and her butt secondly. In fact, that's how she got her nickname \"Juicy\". Her belly growling snapped her back to attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy girl, I'll get you some food soon\" She said as she lovingly rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan stripped out of her tight pajamas and looked at her self in the mirror.

Her daughter, Lisa knew about her Mother's role when she was in pre-school and wanted to be as big as her.

Trent loved fattening Jasmine up, watching her skinny frame plump up. Trent would also devise plans to keep Jasmine sedentary such as having her be a princess who sits and eats while he plays the knight. Despite her weight gain, Jasmine loved spending time with Trent playing at the park, passing days together. But the relationship faded as the two went to different schools. Without Trent's deliberate fattening Jasmine lost weight. However now that the two go to the same school the relationship would rekindle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jasmine how about I treat you to something to eat.\" Trent suggests. <br>\r\nThe two united friends than go to a fast food restaurant.</span></div></div>",

She looked back, and saw a very scrawny man looking at her from his porch. His eyes were cold and dead, making Jess go at much faster pace than before, when suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The room was cold and dark.

Now, how about doing something less boring to enhance your proportions...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he spoke, a yellow gelatinous substance seeped through the cracks all over the room. It merged together in front of Jess, and then slowly made it's way towards her, continuing to grow as it got close. Jess could only weep as she saw her fate edge towards her, \"No, please... I don't want this... Let me free, please... I promise I won't say anything... Just let me go... No, get away... Stop! No, no no no no n-\" She was cut off as the ooze slowly crawled into her mouth...<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",
