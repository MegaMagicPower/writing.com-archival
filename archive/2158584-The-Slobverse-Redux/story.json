Her favorites thus far were the story of how she wiped out three   all you-can- eat buffets in one day and the video of her taking on the challenge to break the world burping record. The jade super heroine's belch was so powerful that even watching the replay seemed to make her phone shake! Jen began another bout of laughter until she stopped and decided to look at an older video. This one showed her as She-Hulk battling with Titania outside a Mexican restaurant. In fact, it was a restaurant that Jen often frequented and had been visiting on the day of the incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous grin spread across the heroic lawyer's face as she watched her mighty- muscled gamma self pound on Titania and knock her to the ground before positioning herself over the villain's face. There was a faint rumbling sound and...\"PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFT!\" Jennifer laughed out loud now as she watched her on-screen counterpart unleash a monstrous toxic fart in her rival's face, the perfect end to a fight that followed a heavy, gas-inducing meal.  She was feeling so good at the moment that she decided to transform and admire herself in her full-length office mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may only be the second strongest next to Bruce,\" She-Hulk said as she flexed her huge muscles, \"but I am most definitely the gassiest  one there is!\" Just then, her phone received an update and She-hulk was shocked to Wonder Woman was now trending above her because she had beaten Supergirl in a belching contest, her winning belch having caused the collapse of a nearby building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer glared at her phone as her good mood rapidly soured. She and Wonder woman had long had an intense rivalry and while she would begrudgingly admit that the amazon surpassed her in strength{for now} and fame as both a heroine and sex symbol, she refused to allow anyone to beat her in terms of gas!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jade giantess impulsively went back to the video of her belching and took note of the fact that while her mighty eruct ion shattered windows and caused a great tremor, no buildings collapsed as far as could tell. This made her so angry that she crushed the phone in her hand.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nIt was some hours later that Diana Prince, agent of the department of metahuman affairs, was called in to aid S.H.I.E.L.D. in stopping a rampaging She-hulk. She knew right away that Wonder Woman was needed and slipped away to change into costume at the first opportunity. Not wanting to risk innocents by engaging her rival in a fight, she chose to ensnare She-Hulk in her unbreakable Lasso of Truth and drag her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Jennifer, talk! Why have you suddenly decided to emulate your cousin?\" Wonder Woman demanded to know while they let She-Hulk's firm handle things with S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was jealous of you for upstaging me.\" She-Hulk blurted out, compelled by the Lasso's magic. \"Oh?\" Diana couldn't tell whether she was irritated or amused. \"Is this about our last arm-wrestle? The weight-lifting contest? The flex-off, perhaps?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Woman playfully flexed her mighty arm. It clearly surpassed She-Hulk and raised Jen's ire even further. \"You...out-belched me. Nobody does that! I want a burping contest, here and now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana shook her head. \"I knew I shouldn't have accepted Kara's challenge. Very well, but no more tantrums, agreed?\" Jen nodded and Wonder Woman untied her. \"You may start us off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Hulk sucked in a big breath. \"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-UUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUU-RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!\" The resulting belch echoed through the city and made Diana's hair flutter a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, but not good enough! BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\" Wonder Woman's massive belch blew She-hulk backwards and surpassed her's in volume, yet somehow caused less damage to the city and made people laugh, even the authorities!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want a rematch!\" She-hulk demanded as she got to her feet, somewhat embarrassed by how whiny she sounded. Wonder Woman began to think. \"Very well then, you'll have it. I invite you to compete in some Amazon trials with me on Themyscara a month from now. There will not only be a belching contest, but you'll have a chance to beat me at eating, farting, and several other things at well. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer waited for a long moment before clasping Diana's hand in a grip that would've crushed a normal' woman's bones. \"You're on, Wondie! See you in a month.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

There were eating and gas competitions as Wonder Woman had said, but also various gross-out contests that involved body odor and other such things. It was supposed to be an ancient, annual series of events that defied the unrealistic expectations placed upon all females in \"man's world\", but it was really just an excuse to cut loose. Few outsiders had been invited to participate and even fewer had won. Supergirl had managed a very close victory against Cassie Sandsmark and Rogue had managed to win, but others like Lois Lane and Sue Richards had lost badly. Jen had also learned that the winner would spend a week on Themyscara, being worshiped by the loser and all amazons. This made the heroic lawyer's drive to win even greater and she spent her time gorging on New York pizza and other fast foods while ignoring things like showering and basic hygiene. She did this all as plain Jennifer Walters, becoming as obese and dirty as humanly possible without transforming once. Just as building muscle as Jennifer Walters had resulted in a  buffer, stronger, She-Hulk that could take on the Champion of the Universe, it stood to reason that a slobbier Jennifer would result in a She Hulk who could out-eat and out-gas the strongest amazon. Jen went to bed each night of this routine dreaming of her victory and Diana kissing her big, smelly green feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month later, the heroic Lawyer finally arrived on Themyscara via a private plane that Diana Prince had discreetly arranged for. The moment it touched down, the obese Jennifer allowed herself to transform for the first time in a while. The result? A She-Hulk whose enormous gut strained the limits of her  badly stained special uniform treated with unstable molecules, whose reeking body was covered with irradiated sweat that had taken on a slime-like appearance and pooled underneath her pits. Flies and other insects were actually buzzing around her and she'd allowed some snot to dribble from her nose. All this and the still prominent gamma muscle that blended into her monstrous fat made Jen feel as though the amazons, particularly Diana, would  be intimidated as well as disgusted by her. Instead, the women who met her plane cheered for her, each one sporting a sizable gut and letting out a belch or fart every few minutes along with it. Queen Hippolyta, Wonder woman's own mother, was nearly as big as her and smelled just as bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Jennifer. We are honored to have you with us. Knowing that a warrior such as you has seen fit to join our games will make these our most exciting trials yet. Are you ready to begin?\"       </span></div></div>",

The patrons were soon watching the famous heroine devour massive amounts of greasy double cheese burgers, chili digs, and sloppy joes. The whole thing was a gross mess that involved no manners at all and She-hulk reveled in it. It was always so much fun to deliberately defy the sexy image the public had of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of it, Jen sported a massive green gut that stood out from the rest of her amazonian physique. Now for her favorite part! Leaning back a bit on the stool she sat on, the gamma heroine thumped her chest and unleashed a belch that shook the entire establishment, shattering every window. She chuckled quietly to herself as she imagined the shocked faces staring at her and the low grumbling from her immense gut made her grin widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to everyone down wind.\" She-hulk quipped as she raised her powerful left leg and leaned to the side in order to unleash a massive toxic fart. The resulting smell put half the diner into a coma. The other half ran out the door while trying not to vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen laughed out loud, but her joy was quickly interrupted by someone applauding her...from above.She looked up to see none other than Supergirl, a goofy grin plastered on her face. \"That was...awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl of Steel had been working at her job as Daily Planet intern, Linda Lang, when her super hearing picked up the excited whispers about She-hulk's diner binge. She used the damage that Jen's belch caused as an excuse to change into costume and \"investigate\" her idol. Kara had long admired She-Hulk's confident attitude and tomboyish antics. The Hulk's cousin might have stood no chance against her in arm wrestling, but even Supergirl was amazed after hearing how Jen had managed to beat Wonder Woman herself in a belching contest. No one had done that before, not even Clark. Kara had come the closest up until now, but she'd been forced to surrender in the end.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe Girl of Steel wanted to ask about all that and more, to compare notes on superheroes and having to do so while occasionally being compared to one's own cousin. First, she knew she had to break the ice. The best way to do that? To showcase her own tomboy skills of course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was awesome,\" Kara continued in a more casual tone, \"but nothing compared to a real super belch. Check this out! BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-RRRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupergirl unleashed a belch of such proportions that it echoed into space. This lasted a full two minutes and filled the diner with an even more unpleasant smell. The Girl of Steel then looked at her hero and smiled nervously, waiting for a reaction.<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

An Irate Jennifer quickly transformed back into She-Hulk, now a little more muscular thanks to her anger-induced strength boost, and glared at the younger heroine. \"Okay, Brat of Steel, you want to go? Let's go! It's dessert time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Hulk stomped into the kitchen and returned a few minutes later holding a massive armful of pies and cakes. Some were unfinished due to the diner having been evacuated and others were old and half-eaten for whatever reason. A confused Supergirl watched her idol place as much as she could on  counter, then rear her head back. With a sickening snort, Jenifer shot a Hulk-sized Loogie into each pastry and took special care to let it slowly drip into those that were incomplete, as though she finishing the job in her own disgusting way. Supergirl was weirded   out, but did her best not to show it. \"Your turn.\" She-Hulk sneered at the younger heroine as she indicated the number of pastries that had been placed on the admittedly dirty diner floor. Kara nodded and spat into each one as disgustingly as she could manage, which was actually more grossness than She-hulk was capable of. The older heroine would've turned green with envy if not for...well, you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, in contrast to Supergirl's extreme admiration of her, enough to follow orders completely without question, She-hulk had nothing but disdain for any kryptonian with a big red \"S\" on their chest. It might have had something to do with the fact that Kara's cousin had relentlessly hounded her own about as far back as she could remember, or how the contrasting reputations of said cousins had prevented her from getting a spot in any branch of the Justice League. Some said it was because she was envious of Power Girl's boobs {behind her back} But She-Hulk herself  would claim  she hated Supergirl for being so arrogant and rude, the very worst example of a teenage superhero and teenage girl in general. It had nothing at all to do with the fact that Kara had quickly managed to surpass her in fame as both a Heroine and a sex symbol in almost no time at all, just as it most certainly had nothing to do with the fact that she'd been so easily and so vastly outbelched. No,not at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see if you can eat more of this 'special' deserts than me without throwing up.\" Jen challenged while proudly patting her already more than ample stomach. \"Biggest gut wins.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on!\" Supergirl exclaimed happily, thinking this was the best way to prove herself to her idol. A now even more angry She-Hulk tersely counted down: \"1...2...3...go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two heroines began swallowing mouthfuls of mucus covered food as sloppily as they could from their respective areas. Supergirl's super speed gave her an early lead, but She-hulk made up for it by eating more aggressively. Spittle flew everywhere and mixed with snot and food crumbs as they spilled onto the diner walls. Eventually...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The slobby gamma heroine managed to lift her head and smirk as she observed Supergirl, now standing near the counter and throwing up her own portions in disgust. To top it off, the younger heroine's Kryptonian metabolism had prevented her from gaining even a small pot belly despite the immense amount of junk food she'd eaten. Jen had won the contest in every way possible, but still felt the need to rub it in a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Blondie, guess you don't have what it takes to hang with the big dogs after all.\" She-hulk pulled herself to her feet with some considerable difficulty and waddled over to give Supergirl a rough and condescending pat on the back. Supergirl was able to recover from vomiting in record and was already gazing at her idol with pleading eyes,  still oblivious to the older heroine's animosity towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Ms. Walters, give me a second chance! How about a farting contest?\" Jen scowled and was about to give a rather nasty retort when she paused. The idea of humiliating the super brat even further with her awesome gamma gas was rather tempting and she had plenty of fuel to burn off from her binge anyway. The gurgling sounds from her huge green gut were already starting to sound like another gamma bomb explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay kid, it's your funeral. We may need new stomping grounds though. Thanks to me, this place needs at least two years' worth of fumigation already.\" The older heroine indicated the already foul smelling and messy diner around them to prove her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupergirl nodded, but her face soon lit up. \"My cousin is with the Justice League in space at the moment and his Fortress will be perfect! Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne super speed flight and a change of clothes for Jen later, the two heroines faced off in a special ring designed by Superman specifically for sparring with allies who could match his strength. There was even a protective force shield in place to prevent damage to the surrounding area. She-Hulk listened to the mighty roar  of her still huge stomach  one more time before staring down her unknowing rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The nastiest, loudest and most powerful fart wins. No wimpy sbds allowed and let's try very hard not to soil ourselves, okay princess?\" She-Hulk had meant to embarrass and anger Kara with the last comment, but the younger heroine merely laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll start us off!\" Kara announced before unleashing a fart that made her cape flutter behind her in a parody of the standard hero pose. The smell was worse than She-Hulk anticipated, but she tried not to let it show. \"Not bad kid, but top this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gamma heroine bent down low and unleashed a far more massive  fart that filled the arena with glowing green stink. She-hulk  lovingly breathed it and laughed triumphantly. \"Ha! ready to give up blondie?\"        </span></div></div>",

This failed to make it easy to balance herself as she stood up to glare at the younger heroine. \"What are you doing here, kid?

Truthfully, the older heroine was embarrassed at  having been so easily out-belched, particularly Kara Zor-el. In contrast to the younger heroine's admiration for her, She-Hulk believed Supergirl to be an arrogant brat who had no business being a superhero.

It's pretty sad that that was the best you could do, though not surprising with how little you can put away.\" Jennifer looked down at her deflated gut and scowled. \"You think you can do better, blondie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara paused, considering what to say next. A challenge like this would be the best way to showcase her skills to her idol. \"You be!. I can slob it with the best of 'em! You up for it...old lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's eyes glowed deep green and she immediately hulked out, her muscles and gut growing just a bit larger from her rage. \"Bring it on, little girl!\" Supergirl responded by flying off and returning with a quartet of food trucks in her super strong arms. Each one had been shut down due to poor food quality or abandoned due to some involvement in a super villain's scheme. Often it was some combination of the two, which was why they were somehow all fully stocked. The doors were opened at super speed and both heroines were assaulted by the noxious smells of expired food soaked in aged grease. Both took a huge whiff in an effort to seem tough and a lover of grossness. \"Okay Jen, first one to finish and get the biggest gut wins.\" Kara challenged while trying not to sound giddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Hulk responded by jumping into the nearest truck and devouring a frier full of nothing but grease. It dribbled down her chin and splattered across her chest before she tossed it away and flashed a challenging smirk to Supergirl, daring her to top this disgusting display. The contest that followed was the most disgusting binge anyone would likely see, but in the end...    <br>\r\n <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Humming as she made the finishing touches on the cake, she was interrupted by a large crashing sound from her pantry. Going into abduction mode, she was about to scream \"MARIO HELP ME!\" when she realized that the crash wasn't followed up by fire, or laughing, or anything. Curious, she looked inside of the pantry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a large warp pipe sticking out of the ground. Now where had that come from? It was a dark green, and covered with grime... The smell coming from it was rather unpleasant as well, the kind of thing she'd associate with actual sewers. Leaning over it to see how far down it went, she coughed, and found her grip slipping on the filth-slick pipe as she went head-over-heels and plummeted into it, screaming. As her screams echoed into nothingness, the pipe vanished into the floor like it had never been there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*-*-*-*-*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought she'd been falling for hours when she finally splashed into the foul-smelling pool. Blinking her eyes open she sighed, looking down at her dress... It was ruined with disgusting stains covering it. Looking around, she tried to figure out where she was... She didn't know this zone. It was kind of like an underground tunnel, with a foul-smelling river leading into the cesspool she'd just crawled out of, and weird green-and-brown mushrooms covered the walls, glowing softly. There was something spraypainted on the side of the tunnel...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Slob Land? How strange...\" Was Bowser behind this? Or some other villain? The princess carefully considered her next course of action.</span></div></div>",

Wringing out her dress as best as she could, she took a seat on a putrescent mushroom that looked sturdy enough to hold her weight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Then gasped as the thing released a bunch of spores into the air with a sound like the world's largest whoopee cushion. Peach hacked as the noxious spores filled her lungs. \"Ukh! Aggh! Gross! Koff, koff...\" Hopping off of the toadstool, she staggered over to a wall... Which gave way, causing her to slide down a secret passageway. Skidding down the greenish slide, she came to a stop beneath a large pipe. Getting to her knees unsteadily, she leaned against another pipe for support. Hopefully this time her perch wouldn't give way. Though she still felt a bit dizzy, she soon regained her breath and saw that there was a valve on the pipe, with two settings other than the current closed one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... Slop... And Wash? How strange... I could certainly use a good wash, but...\" Her stomach grumbled as gas slowly built up inside of it, one of the insidious effects of the spores she'd inhaled. There was something oddly compelling about the word Slop...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The peaceful hamlet of Pallet Town, a comparatively new human settlement in the souther half of the Kanto Region, constructed only a quarter of a century ago during the economic boom of the region\u2019s development industry. The humble village is quite locally famous for the cheap cost of living and high quality housing, making it an attractive place to live if one were to negate it\u2019s lack of job opportunity. It is also the official residence of one of the highest scientific authorities on all things related to Pokemon, Professor Samuel Oak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is in this sleepy, seaside village that the young Leaf Walker slumbers underneath the blankets of her bed. She let out a Murr of contentment as she woke from her deep sleep, accredited to a lone beam of sunlight trickling through her bedroom window curtains and sanding itself on her cherubic face.From the kitchen below, Leaf\u2019s mother was already up and about, cooking up a slew of arterie clogging breakfast food made with generous helpings of grease and lard, the various smells creeping into every corner of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was a rather special day for the long, brown haired Leaf. Today was the day that the official Pok\u00e9mon League of Kanto designated as the start of this year\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon Journeys! Only so many children were allowed to become trains s each year, due to the scarcity of the starter Pok\u00e9mon, so the league rations how many can officially become a trainer each year. Leaf was at an advantage to the close proximity her house was to Oak\u2019s laboratory, but she was still anxious about not getting they're in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around ten minutes of getting herself ready for the day, Leaf gave herself one last look in the mirror to see if she had missed anything important in her attire. Her plump lips curved into a smile as her trademark hat fell into perfect center on the top of her head. Her chipmunk-esqe cheeks bloated even further as she did so, a healthy shade of red forming as she looked herself over in the body mirror. Her signature double chin dropped down to her thick neck, bulging with blubber, already on the verge of a third. Her heaving bosom pokes out from her cropped, blue t-shirt, abundant flab squeezing their way out and over her bra cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf\u2019s eyes move down further to her large, globular blob of a stomach, completely exposed to the elements as her shirt gave up trying to cover it long ago. Thighs that could squeeze the life out of a baby Pokemon, a rear end as bulbous as sports balls; some might fall her appearance disgusting, to Leaf and her mother she was the sexiest girl in town. She filled her large breasts and gave them a rough, if not affectionate squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s the last of it!\u201d The heavy Leaf gave a deep belly laugh as she grabbed her new trainer\u2019s purse and headed out of her bedroom to the kitchen below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Sunshine! Are you ready for your very important day?\u201d Leaf\u2019s mother heard her daughter come down the stairs, her weight making the old floorboards creak and moan. She gave Leaf a smile as she entered the kitchen, complete with an even plumper set of lips and extra chins than her daughter. Leaf\u2019s mother was significantly more fat than the young girl by a wide margin. Her heaving chest was almost bursting out of the cooking apron she was wearing over an old white T-shirt, with enough side boob to choke a Riolu. Fortunately, her mammaries were supported by a shelf of belly blubber, a sphere of fat so large it brushed the tiled floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf\u2019s mother was the fattest women in the entirety of Pallet Town, although that wasent saying much considering the sparse population, and openly proud of her weight, always advocating that fat equates to beauty and tried to gain as much weight as possible. Naturally, Leaf was brought up in a similar fashion. The mother and daughter\u2019s relationship flourished under the unified ideals of eating more food and having more fat on their sexy frames. To her mother\u2019s eternal joy. Leaf\u2019s biggest goal in life is not to become the world champion of the Pok\u00e9mon League like the rest of the children her age...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf wants to become the fattest women in the world, instead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the local administration of The Kanto Region coerces children into being Trainers by offering very attractive benefits, forcing Leaf to sign up. She thinks that this is going to be a major obstacle into becoming the world\u2019s fattest, what with all the walking and physical exertion, but little does she know that outside the borders of her hometown lies a whole buffet of tasty food to snack on! She just has to know where to look\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, as ready as I\u2019ll ever be!\u201d Leaf gave her mother a wide smile, while her tummy gave an ominous growl of hunger. \u201cBut I think my gut is more ready to have some food!\u201d She gave her stomach a loving rub, appeasing the beast within. Her mother giggled, making her whole body jiggle and wobble with glee, to which Leaf eyed with a taint of jealousy. She promised herself that one day she would outgrow her mother, and at the rate she\u2019s going, that day might be soon...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The two obese women sat at opposite ends of the kitchen table, itself struggling to remain upright under the weight of the greasy foodstuffs. Each of them feasted on the lardy bounty with abandon and without shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrph...I got it...just one last plate...they're!\u201d Leaf forced down the last of her food and set her utensils down on her even larger gut. Sticky sweat ran down the forehead of the obese girl as she raised her puffy arms over her head and leaned her wide back in the reinforced chair. What started out as a simple going away breakfast devolved into a two-hour long feeding frenzy. While Leaf was done eating, her mother still had room in her impressive gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, mom, whatever you did with those pancakes, make sure you cook \u2018em like that from now on!\u201d Leaf drummed the taut surface if her gut as she stood up from her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, I found a special brand of MooMoo milk that's 30% fat instead of just 2%. I thought I could break it out for your special day.\u201d Leaf\u2019s mom said, shoveling more of the food down her throat. \u201cNow go on and get to Oak\u2019s lab, you\u2019re late as it is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright mom, I love you!\u201d Leaf gave her obese mother a hug as she kept eating. She grabbed her PokeGear and headed off from her childhood home to Professor Oak\u2019s lab at the edge of town\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but as she walked, she noticed something strange. Normally, they're would be a crowd of a hundred kids around the entrance to Oak\u2019s workplace and residence, but right now it was noticeably empty. Did it get cancelled? That would certainly be a bummer. Leaf knocked loudly on the door of the Lab, wanting some answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Leaf Walker.\u201d Professor Oak greeted the fat girl as he opened the door. \u201cSo, you decided to show up after all, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Professor Oak!\u201d Leaf greeted cheerily. \u201cI\u2019m here for my Pok\u00e9mon! And, hey, do you know why they're\u2019s such a low turnout this year?\u201d She gestured to the emptiness around the property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Leaf.\u201d Professor Oak sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s over. I\u2019ve already given away all of the Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha...what?!\u201d Leaf cried in shock and horror. \u201cN-n-no, that can\u2019t be right, it just can\u2019t be! You have to at least ONE Pok\u00e9mon left, right?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Leaf, but I-\u201c Oak cut himself off as he remembered something that might help the young girl\u2019s situation and did him of a rambunctious nuisance. \u201cWell...I do have one left, but it wouldn\u2019t be a very traditional starter, mind you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have one? Yes! I\u2019ll take it. I don\u2019t even care what it is, I\u2019ll take it!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In her hands was the Pokeball that contained her new best freind, Eevee. The good professor explained to Leaf that it was Lv. 1 and currently knew no moves. It was orphaned at birth after it\u2019s parents saw that it was a shiny, and Oak had took it in, trying to get a good home. Unfortunately, the poor thing is terrified of most everyone, and is too young for anyone\u2019s taste as a pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the abandoned Eevee, Leaf wasent listening to a lick of what Professor Oak was saying about it. She was just too excited to finally get her first Pok\u00e9mon! Since her greatest ambition in life is to become as fat as possible, she never really put any effor into learning about Pok\u00e9mon. But she didn\u2019t care, she would just wing it like he gut told her. And her gut was rarely wrong about anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf ran out of the front door of the lab at lightning speed, despite the fact that she was an obese teenager who had just finished eating a double digit course breakfast, towards the first entrance to route one. In her rush, however, she had completely forgotten to grab the set of sjx complementary Pokeballs from The good Professor. \u201cLeaf, w-wait up! You forgot your\u2026\u201d he called out to the fat teen, but she was too caught up in her own world and too far away to hear him. Oak sighed, knowing that he was powerless and walked back into his lab, hoping that the girl would manage without any means of capturing Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I feel amazing!\u201d Leaf cried with a happy smile. \u201cWhere did all this energy come from? It\u2019s like I can keep going and never stop!\u201d And indeed, Leaf did not stop, at least for untill a long while had passed. She bolted through Route 1, completely ignoring the other trainers that wanted to battle with her, breaking the unspoken rule of when two trainer\u2019s eyes meet, they must battle.Leaf ran for a solid thirty minutes before not her stamina pooped out, but her stomach signaled that it was done digesting and hungry for more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways the one to trust the whims if her stomach over everything else, Leaf reasoned that now was the perfect time to take a little break from the road. She sat her fat ass down a neighboring tree stump and fished her only Pokeball from her purse. The Pokeball was tossed into the air and onto the ground, releasing a Snow White Eevee. The incredibly blubbery girl could not help but smile as she looked down at her new freind, totally oblivious to the reactions it was making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a couple of hours ago, the Eevee was in the warn and comfy hands of the elderly Professor Oak eating his light breakfast. Now he was a long way from home in a different environment in the care of a stranger who looked as fat and as intimidating as a Snorlax. It was obviously scared, but Leaf refused to pick up on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello they're, Eevee. My name is Leaf, and I\u2019m you\u2019re new best freind! Are you hungry lil\u2019 guy? Because I know I am!\u201d Leaf greeted her Pokemon and smacked her empty belly hard, making the dome of pale flesh quiver and wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee E\u2026\u201d the confused Pok\u00e9mon whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, I can\u2019t understand a word you\u2019re saying, silly!\u201d Leaf giggled teasingly. \u201cLooks like someone\u2019s gonna have to learn English~.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVee\u2026\u201d the Snow White Pokemon cried softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, time for a well deserved lunch!\u201d Leaf opened her purse t see what kind of food her mom packed her for the road...only to discover a distinctive lack of anything edible within. \u201c...no, no they're\u2019s no way she forgot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf turned her purse upside down and let the contents fall to the ground. She daw nothing but makeup, her cellphone, a diary, and s high of other trainer stuff that she did not care about. They're was no food, and right on cue her bloated tummy cried out in agony from being deprived of proper nutrition for so long. \u201cOh Arceus\u2026\u201d The portly girl grasped at her black hole of gut. \u201cIt hurts so bad...I can\u2019t go out like this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE...Eevee\u2026?\u201d The shiny Eevee tilted it\u2019s head at the interesting display his new master was making. Was it some kind of mating ritual? Rain dance? Whatever it was, it was freaking him out and he wanted nothing to do with it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">The young bride-to-be Susan Murphy\u2019s wedding day had taken a turn for the worst. For starters, she was struck by a meteorite. Then at the altar, she began to grow, but not in height \u2013 in weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer appendages thickened with flab but also built an equally thick layer of muscle underneath, soon reaching a diameter of 1 foot. The same thing happened with her fingers and toes, except they were only twice as wide as before. White replaced the brunette in her hair and her facial cheeks swelled with fat. She gained a second chin as her neck vanished in a coat of fat. The ivory wedding dress stretched and tore as her melons grew to the size of actual melons and her ass inflated to rival basketballs. Sue\u2019s navel popped outward as did her stomach, until it approached the size of medicine ball. By the time her transformation had concluded, all of the attendants had already fled the church, including the groom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Murphy gasped as tears swelled in her eyes. Before she could start the waterworks, a group of military personnel rushed into the nigh vacant room and launched a powerful sedative at her. It nailed in the thigh and Susan\u2019s vision &amp; hearing blurred before she blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan could only see darkness and heard an alarm go off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, could you hit the snooze?\u201d Susan asked groggily. She turned to her other side and tried to drown out the noise. \u201cBaby, why did you set the alarm? We're on our honeymoon.\u201d She continued before falling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman raised her head and looked around her. She was in a dark area that flashed red. What was behind her was a large gray bed with a white pillow that she\u2019d presumably fallen off of. Gazing upward, Sue saw a blinking crimson alarm. Observing her outfit, she could tell that she was wearing a snug long-sleeved dark grey jumpsuit with orange stripes on her shoulders and the side of her legs. There were orange-colored pockets on her breasts, the number \u201800005\u2019 just above the left pocket and an orange \u2018?\u2019 sign on the side of her upper right arm. Although she couldn\u2019t see her feet, they were covered in orange and white Converse sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? What's going on?\u201d She question before she saw her bed retract into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a metal door slammed shut on the other end. A small cranking was heard before the room shifted down like an elevator. Susan felt her padded belly, butt, and breasts wobble as bright, white lights shined briefly through a glass window in the door. Susan crept up to the opposite wall in fear before the room suddenly stopped, the laws of physics dictating that she drop to the floor again. The beeping and flashing ceased as well and the alarmed receded into the ceiling. The weighty woman still shook like a lost puppy, until a whirring sound occurred followed by the opening of the door. Ms. Murphy could see a massive light grey area lit by several ivory lights. She could just barely make what appeared to be two tables. Immediately afterwards, the wall that Sue leaned on pushed her into the new room, her frightened stammers not stopping it. She panted heavily when it did stop, then got up and cautiously waddled around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d She called out, the door shutting once more behind her. She made her way to the tables before hearing something faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it just legs? Did they capture a giant pair of legs?\u201d A voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilence, B.O.B! She'll hear us!\u201d A second voice stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow? Legs don't have ears.\u201d \u2018B.O.B\u2019 replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust shush!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue motioned toward the source of the sound with more caution. \u201cHello? Is there someone there? Could you tell me where I am?\u201d She inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother strange sound emanated from the center of the room, which made Ms. Murphy whip her head back toward the table. There, a thin tube dispensed beige mush and a spoon onto the larger one with a metal coffee mug before retreating out of sight. The fat-laden maiden went back to the table and grabbed the spoon. For some reason, she found the oatmeal-looking slop rather appetizing. However, she turned her head away when she heard the sound of tiny pitter-patters on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? What was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to refocus on the oddly tantalizing slop laid before her, Susan took a seat on the reinforced steel bench near the table, her ass overflowing the seat that could fit two. She then heard the same noise again and it was louder this time. She turned around once more and the next thing that she saw almost made her faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello.\u201d The creature greeted with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEw!\u201d Susan responded before clutching her gut in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a cluster of gas worm its way up her throat. Despite covering the only vent it had to leave, the pressure soon became too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\"<span class=\"cgreen\"><u><i><b>*BBBBBUUUUURRRRPPPPPP!*</b></i></u></span>\"{ /size}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster was fortunate to duck out of Sue\u2019s general direction as the power burp blast broke the sound barrier and smashed into the super steel wall, leaving a 49\u2019 11\u201d wide hole in it. Susan's face turned tomato red in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever mad scientist made you... he really went all-out.\u201d The bug-man complimented, peaking his head out from behind Susan\u2019s table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can talk.\u201d Ms. Murphy said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMissing Link, when did we get a hole installed?\u201d A man-sized blue mass of jelly with one eye questioned, arriving with a green fish-ape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t B.O.B. That was the work of the new girl.\u201d The fish-ape corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive him, but as you can see, he has no brain.\u201d Dr. Cockroach commented about B.O.B.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTurns out, you don't need one! Totally overrated! As a matter of fact, I don't even have to... *gasp* I forgot how to breathe! Don't know how to breathe! Help me, Dr Cockroach! Help!\u201d B.O.B. pleaded loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuck in, B.O.B.\u201d Dr. Cockroach told, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB.O.B. then started to breathe normally. \u201cThanks, Doc. You're a lifesaver.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight we ask for your name, madam?\u201d The Doctor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusan.\u201d She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no, we mean your monster name. What do people scream when they see you coming? You know, like 'Look out! Here comes...'?\u201d B.O.B. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusan.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Dr. Cockroach responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018SUUUUSAAAN!\u2019\u201d B.O.B. repeated spookily. \u201cOoh, I just scared myself! That is scary!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the conversation could further develop, a door over 350 feet tall opened partially. Out of the darkness appeared a man on a jetpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMonsters. Get back in your cells.\u201d He ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three smaller ones begrudgingly obeyed, walking toward three open doors that soon closed afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thank goodness! A real person!\u201d Murphy exclaims in relief before noticing his jetpack. \u201cYou are a real person, right? You're not one of those half-person, half-machine, you know. Whatever you call those things?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA cyborg?\u201d He replied dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no! YOU'RE A CYBORG!\u201d The 350 pound female shouted, panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadam, I assure you I am not a cyborg. The name is General W. R. Monger. I'm in charge of this facility,\u201d He explained before turning around. \u201cNow follow me. It is time for your orientation.\u201d Although, she was much hungrier after that burp, Susan reluctantly followed Monger out of the room and onto a moving pad. \u201cIn 1950, it was decided that Jane and Joe Public could not handle the truth about monsters and that they should focus on more important things like paying taxes, and so the government convinced the world monsters were stuff of myth and legend and then locked them away in this here facility.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother door opened, showing darkness. The pad that Sue was on lowered slightly before turning left. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a monster. I\u2019m just a regular person. I\u2019m not a danger to anyone or anything.\u201d As if trying to undermine Ms. Murphy\u2019s argument, her posterior rumbled for a bit before shooting a supersonic air bullet that downed a faraway helicopter. \u201cSorry.\u201d She apologized meekly before the pad moved upward and entered yet another door. \u201cHow long will I be here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndefinitely.\u201d The General replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I contact my parents?\u201d Sue asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDerek?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNegative.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo they know where I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonger turned to face her. \u201cNo, and they never will! This place is an X-File, wrapped in a cover-up and deep-fried in a paranoid conspiracy! There will be zero contact with the outside world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pad entered another empty space, then turned right. After passing the monsters that she met earlier, they stopped at a closed door that opened to reveal a room similar to the one that Susie woke up in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and uh, one other thing. The government has changed your name to Slobica.\u201d Monger said as the door closed behind Susan.</font></span></span></div></div>",

What started out as a lovely morning for Snow White soon spiraled out of control when the Woodsman alerted her of the Queen's intentions to kill her. Fearing for her life, she ran into the woods and in for the fright of her life. She could have sworn the trees were out to get her. If not for the helpful woodland creatures, she would have been wandering lost for hours. Snow White was grateful but she had yet to see any other friendly faces since then.

Sure that it would lead her somewhere safe, she followed the road for as long as she could. An elk that had been following her offered a ride on his back, which the tired girl was unable to reject. The road was becoming harder to see as the stars blinked into visibility.

Occasionally Snow would step in something squishy and hoped it wasn't a poor mouth or the leavings of a passing mule. The streets were oddly wide and she heard something in the houses nearby. Snow tried knocking on the doors of several homes but no one answered. Not wanting to be a bother, she searched elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when all hope seemed to be lost, Snow found an establishment with the lights on and the door open. Finally! She hurried on over and walk right into.... </span></div></div>",

She stumbled over to the pile of bread and began chomping, as well as drinking another barrel of beer. She let out an enormous fart, filling the room with her own gas. Jasmine took a whiff and her eyes watered, but couldn't help but enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.... I want some too!\" she said as she sat alongside Aurora, scarfing down some of the bread.

Jasmine smirked and replied, \"It's bath time.\" She grabbed Aurora and tossed her into the mud. She landed face first, but unharmed. She turned over and saw how filthy she was getting. Jasmine came over and started throwing cumps of mud at her. She started rubbing her into the mud like a sponge on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora had to keep gasping for air every few seconds. Jasmine sat down on the princess and made it so the princess was in between her butt cheeks. Then she let out a huge fart. She continued to pass gas and wiggled her butt to rub the princess into the mud. Aurora could hardly breathe between the farts and mud in her face. Jasmine was loving farting on Aurora, but she wanted to do more. Really disgust her. She got up and went to one of the water arrels and drank from it. Aurora watched as Jasmine downed an entire barrel. Jasmine's started to grow and swish with the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished, Jasmine was bigger and slobbering twice as much. Some of her spit was overflowing and falling to the ground. Aurora nearly puked. Jasmine stopped in front of her, nearly drooling on the princess. She laiddown next to her and started grabbing the mud. She grabbed Aurora's panties and put mud in between them and put some mud with her drool in it in her bra. Jasmine sat on her and farted on her once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she grabbed a huge handful anof mud and crammed it into Aurora's mouth.

Jasmine wasn't sure if the princess had gone mad or not. Aurora was now laughing hysterically as she rolled around in the mud. She grabbed armfuls of mud and covered her body with it. She filled her panties and bra with mud and let them ooze over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, this is glorious.\" proclaimed Aurora. She started rubbing mud on her face and letting her drool drip on her body. She started swallowing mud and began farting and burping loudly, breathing in the gas. Even now Jasmine was getting a little shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is heavenous. How could have I missed out on this experience.\" she said. She looked at Jasmine and begged \"You!

On one hand, this girl fattened her and tied her up, and looked insane. On the other hand, she did look cute and stupid as a slob.

Belle laughed at this and groped one of Jasmine's truly colossal butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, you'll get better the more you do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I want to do something else now,\" Jasmine replied with a gleam in her eyes. Belle caught on and soon both had stripped each other naked, the two falling into the shallow pool, right under the waterfall as they made out, the water soaking the both of them through.</span></div></div>",

While they ate, Ariel tried her best not to look at their exposed butts and not gag on the farts that expelled from them. It was a nauseating experience but she didn't leave. Ariel was starving and this was the only source of food she could find.

She pouted and sighed as her stomach rumbled. The two looked at the trough and felt a twinge of guilt for not leaving her any. \"Sorry about that.

We can usually find it very easily.\" Jasmine confirmed as she burped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel wasn't sure if she wanted to spend more time with these women but she was so hungry she had no choice. \"Alright, lead the way then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine and Belle lead the skinny princess through the streets on all twos, while releasing the occasional bout of gas from their backsides. She waved her hand in front of her face to get rid of the smell and asked, \"So is everyone in this town an animal like you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No we're the only ones.\" Belle told her. \"We used to be humans but then we transformed into a cow and pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you've never looked better.\" Jasmine complimented.

I'm not sure how I even got here in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do we. However the food is so great we never left.\" Jasmine explained. Ariel didn't like the sound of that. Would she turn into a fat animal like them? She certainly hoped not. As another fart hit her she thought about ditching these two women and trying to find a way out of this city. With any luck she could find some food on her own.</span></div></div>",

They were so fat, their tails were overweight. But what disgusted everyone was their \"manure\". Along with gaining animal features, they gained their carelessness of where they went. Mostly by accident, the two had filled the town with poo. The streets were littered with their waste, which was mixed with their sweat, spit, and milk. Entire building were filled with their crap. They weren't worried. The only part of cleanliness that they kept was that they still didn't touch their crap. The only signs of their past, slim selves were they they were still disgusted by their own waste. The only thing they were worried right about was that the food was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were panting under the hot sun since they had nowhere to shade themselves.

As she walked, the smell from her cheeks hadn't left. Thanks to more flatulence coming from her bowels, Jasmine's farts began to create a huge trail of the same nasty smell from before. It didn't help that she still burping loudly too. People who were in her path gasped, coughed, choked and even fainted from the noxious odor spewing from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was happening to herself, the princess asked?

Her thighs were now constantly touching each other and her butt was doubled in size and easily the biggest part of her. In addition her pants had torn and she was now standing in her underwear, which was on the verge of bursting. Luckily her belly managed to cover part of her midsection but she was still embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go before someone sees me.\" She told herself. She ran down the road ripping one a fart every few seconds. In the midst of the gas she produced Jasmine caught the scent of fresh baked food in the distance. Despite eating not too long ago she was tempted to fill her belly once more but she also wanted to get some clothes to cover herself.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't put her finger on what city she was currently strolling through; the buildings seemed generic. Helen found herself overtaking many of the pedestrians she encountered as most seemed rather overweight. They also all seemed to be women. \"Hmm...maybe a cooking convention in town?\" Helen wondered to herself, knowing full well that there still should be men and slimmer women around if that were the case. She couldn't decide if the city's atmosphere was pleasant or not. The people looked happy enough, and delectable smells drifted through the air. Underneath the rich smells of frying meat and baked goods, however, was a sharp sort of locker-room smell that never seemed to go away either, almost as if it was seeping from the buildings just like the smell of cooking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually her hunger got the best of her and she succumbed to the temptations of a plump teenager with a hot dog cart. She asked for a plain one, and to her surprise she was laughed at! Before she could react, a massive hot dog stacked with onions and slathered in melted cheese was presented to her. When she began rummaging in her pockets for money, the teenage girl simply waved her hand, revealing a sweat-stained armpit. Helen took the tiniest bite, slightly disgusted with herself. \"This isn't going to do my hip measurements any good...\" she sighed as she recalled her rear end's rather substantial presence in her bedroom mirror every morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, it tasted fantastic! It was the best 'dog she had in her life! She finished it with gusto, and rapidly licked her fingers to capture any remaining grease and cheese. She belched a little and smiled. \"I guess I -am- on vacation...might as well let go a little.\" The girl at the cart already had another similarly decked out treat ready for her newest customer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll just spend my vacation here if all the food is this good....\" Helen laid a silent fart as she pondered, not noticing her breath curdling. She did however, begin to notice the slight discomfort of gas pain beginning to well in her gut.</span></div></div>",

Of course she consumed three more hot dogs and took two more with her as she continued to explore the unknown city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen stopped every now and then and let a louder fart pass her rear each consecutive time, the super growing more and more embarrassed with each flatulent blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut none of the citizens passing by scolded her for her bad manners.

She waited for her food at a nearby table, farting into her chair as she read the menu. Several minutes later, a tray with twenty burgers came by, stacked with melted cheese, bacon, mayonnaise, and chicken nuggets as condiments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, URRRP, we decided to increase your order!\" said the waitress. Helen was okay with this and started scarfing the burgers down.

She's no longer stick thin and scrawny but remarkably obese. Matching Helen in size but in a well arranged business suit, she sports a hefty gut restrained by her unbuttoned shirt, her D cup breasts showcase a generous amount of cleavage, her hips have quadrupled in width, and a sputtering fart spews from her ample ass. Her short skirt shows off her flabby thunder thighs nicely and just barely covers up her basketball-sized buns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! You're that woman who was working with Syndrome. Mirage right?\" Helen questions. Her inhibitions might be lowered but her guard is very much up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Elastigirl, but I assure you I mean you nooouuuuurrrprp harm.\" She insists, burping midway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell did you find me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The front desk told me.

Not sure how I wound up here but I'm not complaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good. Not about you being straaaaaaaaanded,\" she belches. \"I just didn't want any further misunderstandings. I wouldn't want any repeats of our last encounter.\" Being reminded of that incident, she rubs her chubby cheek where Helen punched her long ago. Helen eases up slightly and tries to get more information out of Mirage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the front desk girl just gave you my name, just like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course. I'm the manager of this hotel?\" Mirage answers with a bit of pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You run this joint?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. *ppprrrrrbbbbbtyy* For quite some time, if you couldn't tell.\" Mirage takes a seat at the foot of the bed and explains, \"Much like you I found myself here with no idea how I arrived. I fell in love with this place instantly and after noticing the lack of organization at this hotel. I got a job braaaaaap job here and worked my way up to manager. It's rather easy when the rest of the people here are so....unreliable. So for the last two months I've been running this place providing the best for all my guests. Including you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't surprise Helen that a woman like Mirage could climb her way up to become the boss of this place but being here for two months in unbelievable. \"You're telling me you've been here two months and look like this? I haven't been here less than a day and I'm already huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you wear it well~ I'm not entirely sure why this place is so welcoming and enabling to weight gain but I try not to question it. I prefer to bask in the glor-urrrrrpp and help others come to terms with their weight rather than indulge in my own. Hence why I'm in your room. I wanted to make amends for tricking your husband and endangering your family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Helen doesn't completely trust her, she does believe that Mirage is sincere of being helpful.

Helen would blame her weight gain on her clothes shrinking in the wash but it is very apparent that she has no washed them since she arrived. For a moment Helen takes out her cellphone and considers calling her family when all of a sudden a huge SUV revs up in front of her. The windoe rolls down revealing that its none other than Mirage wearing a set of sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hop on in.\" Mirage invites. Helen pockets her phone and begrudgingly gets in. The inside is surprisingly spacious and the seats are astonishingly soft and accomodating for their plump posteriors. Her only real complaint is of the smell from lingering old farts and the discarded takeout bags by her feet. She notices Mirage punch in some buttons on a screen but notices no wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....how are we going to drive there?\" Helen asks, feeling stupid for asking like everyone else here knows the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage chuckles as the car drives forward. \"This is a self driving car. I've set the destination in, so all we have to do is sit back and enjoy a snack until we get there.\" She pushes a button beside the cupholders and a panel slides back as a tray lifts up with a tempting array of cookies, hot dogs, donuts, popcorn and more. Helen doesn't hesitate to grab a handful and stuff her mouth with the confectioners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage smiles and reclines her chair back as the car moves on its own. She undoes a few buttons and lets her belly out for some air. She grabs a soda and starts chugging while Mrs. Incredible gets her own seat to lean back. She ends up pressing a button that causes her seat to warm up, much to her delight. Helen loosens up and eases back into her seat, getting some comfortable she rips a puff of gas in front of Mirage without any worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's first on our little trip?\" Helen asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage glances over with a sneaky smirk. She notices Helen's seat warmer is working but doesn't tell her about the side effects that come with it. Instead, the silver haired vixen watches as her guests's already rotund rump grows even thicker than before. \"Try not to leave your seat warmer on for long.\" She teases. \"In about half an hour we'll be making our first stop at...</span></div></div>",

She sighed as she sank into the water. It was perfectly heated with lights on the bottom of the pool changing colors.She closed her eyes and let herself float, being projected by her own farts.

Helen finally starts to worry about her situation at long last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, as if being left nude wasn't bad enough, my wallet was still in my pocket.\" She mutters to herself. Folding her arms, she takes notice of her breasts being larger than before. Rocking a luscious D-cup and a remarkable beer gut, her weight gain is the least of her concerns. She's naked in a strange land, has no money, phone, or ID, and her family has no clue where she is. Worst of all, despite everything she is still famished. \"Maybe there's someplace open around.

As she neared the establishment, the thumping of music could be heard from outside. With no other option, Helen goes through the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked in, Helen gasped and coughed at the barrage of odors attacking her senses. She wondered what made such a stench but when she looked around everyone there was huge! The smallest person apart from Helen had to be around 400 pounds. To her left was a decadent buffet of barbecue, ice cream, pizza, and more. To her right were dozens of large tables covered in mountains of people ate as well as extra large booths where some individuals happen to be getting a lapdance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there's the stage. Helen stared at the performers as they worked the pole despite their absurd sizes. Three girls were performing, the two smaller ones were leagues larger than Helen. She eyed the largest performer and guessed they had to be in the 900s at least. Aside from some pasties, she couldn't see any clothes on them except for a flash of a thin strip of cloth on the verge of tearing that she assumed was supposed to be panties. While they weren't the most limber of girls, the dancers made use of their flab to envelop the pole and play with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Helen came back to her senses, she got moving and headed straight for the bar. She hoped someone working there could let her use a phone or borrow a spare set of clothes. No one seemed to notice her in the slightest despite being buck naked. Instead everyone was captivated by the larger girls even as they farted freely and in some cases louder than the music, and stuffing their own maws with cheap, greasy buffet food. It amazed her to see women that would normally be looked down upon get worshipped like goddesses of beauty. They also made plenty of tips, as Helen saw one girl with her cleavage and belly rolls stuffed to the brim with $10s and $20s. Helen gets hit with tremendous toot from one waittress with a rear wide enough to cover a car lane and got smacked in the face by a $50 that blew out of her ass crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone  tapped on Helen's shoulder, causing the super to turn around and gaze upon a gargantuan scantily clad woman. Sporting a glowing tan and wavy red hair, the woman looms over the outsider with a belly that hangs over her knees and could fit an entire hog inside of, breasts larger than Helen's head and likely capable of smothering her, and an ass accustomed that can only use tables for sitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering when you'd show up. Normally being late on your first night would get you fired, but you're a lot cuter than I expected.\" The mystery woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen blushed after that. \"Wha- you were?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, name's Brandy. Aren't you the new girl working?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen hesitates to answer. She needed money desperately and the girls looked like they got paid pretty well. She could lie and work here til she had enough cash to get a plane ticket home. However lying felt wrong and if she got caught there might be hell to pay. She thought about telling the truth. Maybe Brandy could help her out, she seemed nice enough. Though could she trust her to actually help out?</span></div></div>",

How kinky~.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 Thank you?\u201d Helen acknowledged, feeling strangely\u2026 proud of that praising statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, the real question though is\u2026 Will you fit in perfectly here?\u201d the redhead continued with a seductive grin, flashing her stained teeth. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cParr, Helen Parr.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, Helen\u2026 I\u2019m going to be the judge of that!\u201d Brandy loudly declared smacking her drooping belly hard as it wriggled wildly in front of Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026?\u201d Helen asked before she was suddenly spun around by the glamorous slob, who spanked her colossal ass. Helen was so caught off-guard that she-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFFFFFRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlasted out a big fart from her enormous rump, which Brandy was moaning happily from the smell before continuing to watch Helen\u2019s ass ripple and jiggle in marvelment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet on that stage and show me what you got!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing more about her ass being slapped like that, Helen couldn\u2019t back down now from this new commitment she had taken on. And considering Brandy seemed like the type to care less about introductions, only for how useful her employees\u2019 assets were; Helen had to convince her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then,\" Helen said before gulping down her phlegm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandy soon pointed her to the backstage entrance, which Helen proceeded to waddle towards. Once she was there, she could hear so many heavy thuds across the floor, loud spanks, and moans from each contact, as well as echoes of farts and burps throughout the main room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Helen\u2026 You\u2019re only doing this for the money\u2026 Only for the money,\u201d Helen repeated to herself quietly, as she got closer to the stage entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she witnessed one of the strippers giving a teasing bow as her breasts and belly fell onto the greasy damp floor, the heavy overweight blonde wearing only a cowboy hat giving everyone sloppily kisses before waddling off stage and waving her beloved fans off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Just need to be like that,\u201d Helen remarked, feeling\u2026 compelled now.</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sneakily grabbing a pair of pasties to cover up her tits, Helen took a deep breath to calm herself and wound up inhaling the combined miasma of all the girls backstage and their gas. Repugnant as the odor was it took her mind off of the stage fright. 'Take it easy Helen. Just go out there, shake your bits, get the money, and find a hotel.' She told herself mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright sluts, it's time for Rookie Hour!\" Brandy's voice bellowed from the intercoms. The crowd cheered in a frenzy of hoots and belches, freaking out Helen even further. Looking behind herself, she glanced around for a back exit but sadly found none. Just a box of costume pieces. Helen tried to tune out Brandy's announcement and reminded herself that this was nothing. She used to fight supervillains for crying out loud! She could handle strutting her stuff for a little bit. Besides it's not like she hadn't gotten cat calls before or gotten leered at but at least then she was in disguise and no one knew who she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a light bulb went off in her head. While no one was looking, she snagged a domino mask from the bin and put it on. Taking another vile breath, she let calmed herself and got into her superheroing mindset. Repeating to herself, that she was ferocious, cunning, and hot as hell, a sense of invincibility and power filled her being as she strolled onto stage welcomed by a roaring crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her assets to use, Helen sashayed down the walkway jutting her girthy hips from side to side. She smirked hearing a few hollers from the crowd. Her ass cheeks slid up and down against each other as the lights from above warmed up the heroine and had her sweating like a pig in no time. She wiped the sweat from her brow eliciting much to the joy of the patron that got splashed by it. Sensing that maybe these dirty denizens were pleased with more filthy methods, she reached under her boobs and hoisted them up to wipe off her underboob sweat. It was greasier than she imagined, and some food bits from her prior meal fell out of her cleavage but the crowd seemed to love it. To test if they really liked it, she swiped a finger of an oily residue caused by a myriad of sauces from before being stained on her chest, she sucked her finger clean and was met with applause and several dollars being tossed on stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer confidence rose as she approached the pole and pressed her gargantuan gut up against it. She wrapped her breasts around the pole and stroked the metal rod while her paunch oozed around practically engulfing the fixture. Pouting at the audience and sensually moaning, they were loving her performance just as much as she was loving the attention. A gas bubble got dislodged and she ended up burping and receiving a bigger response than she anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen switched things up and slammed her ass against the pole feeling her ass cheeks swallow it whole. Clenching her buns, she bounced her ass up and down to distract the audience while she picked up the money that got tossed and stuffing them in her belly rolls. She was raking in a generous amount of bills, not a single $1 among them. It was more than what Bob made in a day. Sensing a rumble down below, she ripped a sputtering PPPPLLRRBBBBB causing her cheeks to clap and clang against the pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe super stepped forward, releasing the pole from her anal grasp and tried something she knew would kill. Putting everything into her backside, she twerked for the crowd and they lost their shit seeing her pancake ass shake and ripple while her breasts heaved a d her belly bounced. All of this was more draining than she expected. It was time for the closer, and lucky for Helen she had one more burst left in her. Finishing off her set, she leapt onto the pole and spun around holding on with one hand while she cropdusted the crowd. Using her powers, she subtly stretched a little to pick up the bills tossed on stage and stuffed them with the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then hopped off and left her audience cheering. Once backstage, she removed her mask and gasped for air after that exhilarating performance. It was honestly more fun than anything she's done even before the trip. It gave her the same kind of rush that fighting crime did only here she didn't have to worry about getting killed or collateral damage. Just as she was about to count her sweat soaked money, a hand slapped her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot damn! You've got some moves out there Helen! I ain't ever seen a newby own a pole like you did,\" Brandy praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen blushed and thanked her for the compliment. \"It was nothing. Beginner's luck and all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't beginner, that was professional. You sure you haven't danced before? Or even done porn? I could see you starring in one of those.\" It was meant to be flattering but Helen would be mortified if she ever starred in one of those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, it was my first time. I'm beat from that show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I believe you, honey.\" Helen is drenched in perspiration and looked like she ran a marathon. Grabbing an abandoned margarita, she offered it to the milf who downed it instantly. \"You got some serious potential. How'd you like to be a regular?\" Helen hadn't considered she would ever do this again. This was meant to be a one time deal but it was a lot of fun. And she made a lot of money from it. Not enough to buy a ticket home, she suspected, but enough to rent a room at a hotel for the month. There had to be a more dignified profession than stripping. Even though she felt more alive than ever showing off her bare naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled and interrupted her train of thought and getting a chuckle from Brandy. Helen needed to get some food and to give Brandy an answer. </span></div></div>",

Pizzas, burgers, hotdogs, pastries, huge portions of pasta, deep-fried seafood, big fat steaks and plenty of sweet treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, even the salads that were being served alongside them looked deep fried too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMountain piles of food that practically covered every corner of the serving tables, even with some pieces of food that had fallen and slid down onto the club\u2019s floor. There should be something on the buffet tables here to please everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen\u2019s nostrils flared open as she deeply inhaled the scent of the delicious smell of food, her plump lips leaking a small trail of drool while her stomach gurgled even louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s eat~!\u201d grinned Brandy, patting Helen\u2019s backside several times with her fat hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-head pushed some binge eaters out of the way, even burping into their faces until there was plenty of room for Helen and herself to stand beside each other while they ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen didn\u2019t know where to start though, as she stood in front of a big heaping pile that looked like a squished combination of pizza rolls and hotdogs that was covered in a blanket of red yellow sauce. Just as she was about to grab whatever she could, Brandy, who was chewing on a huge chicken drumstick, bumped her belly into Helen, causing the overweight brunette to suddenly fall head first into the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to Brandy\u2019s shove, Helen was not only semi-buried in the grub, but her mouth was fully stuffed with the food she was observing; which Helen couldn\u2019t be happier. Her taste buds were going out of control, as everything she had eaten since she had arrived at this mysterious resort; was nothing in comparison to this club\u2019s meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewing loudly and swallowing the load down her throat fast as possible, Helen quickly gathered another load into her hungry maw, her arms, belly, ass, and legs bouncing rapidly on the side for all to see. The slobby milf dug into it her food with great vigour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s the -UURP- cuisine, Helen~?\u201d Brandy asked before burping loudly, after devouring a large fried chicken piece; licking her oily pudgy fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmph! The mphood phere is mmpazing!\u201d Helen replied back with her mouthful, drool and bits of her food splattering all over inside her food tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking from that response, Brandy collected another chicken to eat while she watched Helen\u2019s body wobble and jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate, Helen\u2019s body started to expand and grow with more flab adding onto her already big body. Growing softer and thicker with each load of food she consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face filling out more, gaining another chin which now gave her a total of 4 chins. Her breasts had grown even larger, travelling further down and resting on her growing belly, jiggling slightly as she continued to devour her food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was even starting to eat faster, growing faster as well as pounds continue to pack on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly stretched far and wide, soon reaching the floor, engulfing her knees and rubbing into the bottom layer of the layered food. Her thunderous thighs filling out more; becoming pillars of fat. And lastly her ass gained the biggest growth out of everything on her swelling body; as it looked like it could crush an entire sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>PPPHHHHHFFFFFRRRRT!!</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out another powerful wet fart, Helen softly pulled her messy head out of the food tunnel she made; rubbing her swollen belly lazily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though her weight had quickly jumped from 400-ish pounds to 620-ish pounds in that excessive binging, Helen had never felt so good in her life.</div></span></div></div>",

Such delicious cupcakes.\" One bite turned into another bite and another and again until it was all gone and Helen was left licking the crumbs from her pudgy fingertips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Helen's stomach growled loudly as she grabs one of the many rolls on her, feeling a bizarre rush throughout her body. \u201cOh, that doesn't feel too good. Maybe, I should head to the restroom before-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling an odd sensation of pain and pleasure coming from her body, Helen stopped what she was doing and let out a small moan from her fat lips. \u201cOoooohhh\u2026~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe involuntarily bucked her hips forward, as she could feel a strange growth forming around her crotch area and spreading out between her fat trunk thighs. Suddenly it appeared from beneath her massive belly, rapidly ballooning in size until, to her absolute shock and awe, a huge, thick cock had appeared!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201c\u2026What?!\u201d</b> Helen screamed in shock at her discovery. Her sudden outburst was fortunately drowned out by the loud commotion around the strip stage and gluttonous buffet tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt continued to push further out until finally stopping, reaching approximately 3 ft long and 5cm wide. Helen moaned again as she felt two large lumps form between her thighs, almost reaching down to the soggy cold floor that made her flabby body shiver with goosebumps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH GOD! WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME!?\" Continuing to scream in panic, her body swinging around violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could do anything else, her newly grown cock shot out a thick burst of precum as if to celebrate its blossoming, followed by fat, swollen smooth balls that swung back and forth between her thickly meaty thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreating a big puddle of her cum onto the floor in front of her, Helen soon felt her sexual rush fade away from her body, as her cock slowly became limp and dangle back down onto the floor. With her senses coming back to her, the transformed slobby milf super yelled-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY THE HELL DO I HAVE A COCK NOW!?\" Before quickly covering her mouth hoping that no one heard her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Helen was trying to piece together about her strange mutation, watching from a safe distance carefully in the shadows of the club, Brandy was snickering with delight as she pulled out a phone from her flabby rolls.</div></span></div></div>",

Pools of fattening slop, sure. Strip clubs of fat dancers and patrons, why not? Growing a cock however was the breaking point. Thankfully everyone was too preoccupied with their meals and the next performer to give a damn about the mortified milf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen needed answers right away but before she could take a step an ominous rumble emanated from her midsection. At first she mistook it for another hunger pang but then she felt a rising pressure come from her newly formed cock and her plump posterior. Looking around the dimly lit establishment, she searched for a restroom but there was none in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell's the crapper in this joint. There's got to be one. I mean where else do they go?\" Helen muttered to herself. Now that she thought about it, she hadn't seen a single restroom since woke up in this strange slobby utopia. Her eyes continued scanning the room until she spotted one portulent patron stuffing herself with chicken wings and scrunching up her face. A brown bulge formed in her sweatpants yet she continued to feast like it was no big deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing what little restraint she had left, Helen fought to keep her asshole clenched but it was a fight she was losing. All the food she had been taking in was demanding to be let out and she couldn't deny it any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately her cock was the first to betray her and spray a jet of piss. Having just received it, she had no control over it or idea how to shut it off. She moaned in relief taking her first leak in hours only now realizing just how much she had stored in her. Her stream sprayed the nearby wall and provided her with immense relief. Rather than stop it Helen loosened up and peed even harder like her cock was a fire hose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she did, her sphincter relaxed as well and opened up pushing out a heaping log as thick as a baseball bat. It was a hefty behemoth that pryed her pucker open and plopped onto the ground below her. Helen tried to stop but the stream was too strong for her dick to shut off and that first loaf opened the flood gates for more shit to coil out.  In the shadows Brandy grinned from ear to ear. Once she finished her call, she took out her phone and started recording Elastigirl's dirty display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dump grabbed the attention of everyone else and drew attention from the performer on stage, who wasn't pleased to see someone steal her limelight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You had your turn, newby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the closest thing to criticism Helen had received since she arrived. Everyone else was cheering her on and tossing money her way as her poop pile continued to grow. A few adventurous fatties dared to step in front of her cock's fire and giddily let themselves get soaked in urine. Some even smacked her ass cheeks and leaned in to get a sample of her ass fudge. The super refused to be their entertainment and tried to waddle away. The good thing about her super soaker shlong was that it cleared most of the crowd away when she aimed it at them. It was good to know that not all of them were filth addicts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen shuffled away leaving behind a trail of turds and spraying everything in front of her, including tables, booth, and the buffet. Her piss only stopped a few from continuing to devour the pee infused food. Out of the corner of her eye she spotted Brandy stuff her phone away and walk off with a smirk. Desperate for answers and privacy, she considered going after her but she was far from finished with her movement. She did spot the emergency exit close by but she wasn't sure if she could make it over there. A massive log was slinking through her system and would take all her willpower just to squeeze it out. Deep down, she also relished being cheered and praised for her performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a blaring PPPPPPPBBBBEEEEEEEEEEEAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRGBGBBBBBBBBB, Helen makes her move. Where does she go?</span></div></div>",

Catching her breath, Helen paused for a moment, the unfamiliar sensation a combination of adrenaline and fright that made her blood quicken and electricity that made her skin tingle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s more going in this so-called resort than people getting\u2026 fat\u2026\u201d Muttering to herself, a pool of sweat forming between her flabby dirty rolls. \u201cAnd so far, my only lead is with that woman, Brandy\u2026\u201d Thinking back to earlier where she saw her \u2018boss\u2019 using a phone to record and take photos of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, her thoughts soon turned towards her cock, as it was tingling underneath her heavy belly suddenly. \u201cOh, what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious of her new tool, Helen moved her arms away from her extremely wide hips, stretching them underneath her belly apron like a snake; until Helen found the base of her shaft and the two bloated balls that accompanied them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlicking the thing, it's flung back and forth, banging into her corpulent belly, its form pumping every so often with her blood coursing through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow am I going to explain this to Bob if he or, hell, the kids see me like this\u2026?\u201d</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was hard enough living as a super in hiding. Now she had a whole new member to deal with. One she couldn't fully see thanks to her prominent gut covering it up. \"Well at least this belly has one good use.\" She sighed. If she could find some clothes and put on a couple more pounds she might be able to go unnoticed. After all, what's a few more pounds at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thought about this, the tingling didn't fade away. If anything it was growing stronger. Helen started to worry that maybe something was wrong and needed a better look. She tried extending her neck to get a better look but nearly toppled over. She looked behind her seeing the dumpster was only half full with empty bags and containers. She wasn't too concerned, although her lack of concern did worry her. Was this place desensitizing her? The tingling was turning into an itch. Helen fell back and landed on the containers with a FUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sides pressed into the fading green sides of the dumpster as she struggled to sit upright. Her hill of a stomach kept her down, a grim reminder that it would be an uphill battle to get her old figure back. After a few more failed attempts to sit up, Helen stretched out and grabbed the rims of the container and pulled herself back up. Her belly sloshed and lurched forward as she moved, rising and falling as she caught her breath. Sweat trickled into her cleavage, dampening the money she made during her dance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was time to inspect her cock. Her noodle neck extended out past her paunch while her hands reached under to hoist up her gut. Her dick and balls felt heavy but she hadn't gotten a good look of them until now. Aiming right at her plump face was a cock that would intimidate even the most well endowed of porn stars and a pair of apple sized balls to accompany them. So much for wearing jeans ever again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving one hand from her gut, she caressed her penis to prove that this wasn't just a trick of the mind but also to see what was causing it to itch so much. Did she pick up something back at the club? If it's anything like the other establishments it was probably a haven for grime a d STD's. It was hard to see so all she could do was feel around and hope it was something she could flick off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike scratching at a rash it felt good to finally sink her fingers in and wipe out the irritation. In fact, she found herself tightening her grip around the shaft and stroking her foreskin. It didn't occur to her until just now that her newest organ would feel so sensitive. The nerve endings still fresh and even the slightest stroke sent pulses of pleasure through her body. Letting her belly flop and smack the top of her cock, her other hand reached down to cup at her balls. Her rationalization was that she wanted to test how sensitive they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike her rod, Helen's sack needed tender handling as her finger fiddled with the balls. She took deeper breaths as her strokes quickened and her cock stood at full mast. Ignoring her repulsive surroundings and trauma at the club, she found herself consumed with lust. All of her priorities were put on the back burner as she rode this sexual high. Her belly wobbled and jostled, the trash beneath her crinkled and crunched beneath her buns. A new sensation bubbled up in her nethers and her cock tip tingled like crazy. Something was building inside her and much like the dump she took, this couldn't be contained. The big difference was that she didn't fight it this time. She welcomed it with chubby arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden cry of delight, she sprayed the end of the dumpster in a dose of her jizz. It spurted out like one of those oversized squirt gun her son would ask for during the summer. Her rubbing slowed down as did her cum shot. It went down to a dribble as she tried to steady her breathing. It was like being a teen discovering masturbation for the first time. In a sense, this was Helen's first time, with a cock at least. And damn did it feel good. Is this what it felt like for Bob?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that popped into her head, she should have returned to her senses and remembered that getting home to her family was the top priority. But it didn't. Helen's next thought was what sex would be like with her new member. With a whole island of massive slobs to choose from with asses large enough to take her shlong, she had a lot of options. Before she could consider her options or come to her senses, her body gave out. All the dancing, running, crapping, masturbating, it all wore her out. Even supers needed to sleep and that's what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning finally came around, Helen found it hard to wake up. Granted, the dumpster wasn't the best place to sleep but she lacked the energy or desire to even sit up, let alone open her eyes. But she did, mainly because of the smell of food lingering from the garbage she slept on. Also, because of the noises. The loudest had to be her stomach, demanding to be fed like it was Jack Jack in the morning, refusing to compromise. The other noise was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You okay in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the noises of her stomach briefly, Helen tried to position herself as best as possible in her cramped bed bin, turning and rolling her body around until finally, her head was at a good angle to see who was talking towards her. Standing beside her dumpster of a bed was a young woman, who light tan skin, magenta plump lips, teal straight hair running down the right side of her face and turquoise eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like everyone else Helen had seen or encountered on this bizarre resort; she too was a lumpy slob, wearing a skimpy small blue bikini on her wide frame. Though, she looked 200lbs smaller in comparison to her enormous size and bulk. Most of her fat reasonably portioned around her body unlike Helen\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sorry Miss, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s just I heard something over here and when I came to see\u2026 I saw you here\u2026 struggling\u2026\u201d the woman stammered while fidgeting her plump fingers together awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at the nice gesture, Helen softly replied, \u201cThank you, dear, I could use some\u2026 help here-UURRPPP!!\u201d Letting out a small withheld burp from her drooling fat mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman watched as Helen heaved herself upwards, almost tipping the dumpster over with her weight. Grabbing her greasy hands onto Helen\u2019s, the young helper tried to pull Helen out of her awkward cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>PPPPPHHHRRRRRRTTTTT!!!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>PPPPPPPPPPHHHHHHHRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTT!!!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each attempt the two bloated women let out notorious gasses from their flabby rears, grunting and groaning through it all, but eventually; it was no good. Helen\u2019s weight was simply too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, hun, I think we may need to rethink this\u2026\u201d Helen spoke calmly, as she watched the teal haired woman let go of her hands and mumble in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling tired though, Helen would have used her powers to stretch herself out of her situation, but that would risk her super status; no longer hidden if this person saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, Miss, I got\u2026 another idea,\u201d the woman said nervously, looking around in-case anyone else was near the alleyway. \u201cBut\u2026 But promise you won\u2019t tell anymore after I do\u2026 this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Do what?\u201d Helen asked, curious by the sudden change of tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping backwards, which caused her belly and breasts to jiggle wildly, the woman exhaled a lot of deep breaths before flicking her flabby hands forward. In an instant, Helen found herself engulfed in a glowing circling hole that pulled her out of the dumpster, immediately falling in the vacant space near the dumpster; landing on her colossal ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoof!\u201d Helen groaned from the impact, her ass and balls sore from that fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 Ta-Dah?\u201d the woman cheered in another awkward manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting herself up and aching a bit, Helen looked at her \u2018here\u2019 and said in surprise, \u201cYou\u2019re a super too?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 Yeah but-Wait, what?!\u201d she replied in surprise too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen gave a smirk at that response and suddenly stretched her arms and neck around like a snake before slipping back into place. \u201cNice to meet you, I\u2019m-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cO.M.G! Elastigirl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen\u2019s eyes widening from that squealing outburst as she found herself in a big bear hug from the now excited teal-hair super.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never thought I meet the actual Elastigirl and I\u2026 O.M.G!\u201d Shouting more than before that almost made Helen\u2019s ears ring. \u201cI knew I recognised you from yesterday\u2019s show, you were that amazing dancer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen sheepishly giggled as she recalled that alluring event, though her cock was already swelling again underneath her sagging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the woman let go of Helen and started to clear her throat. \u201cMy name is Karen and if I was a superhero, I would have called myself... Voyd, if that wasn\u2019t\u2026 obvious.\u201d Once more fidgeting her sausage fingers together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you, Voyd, I\u2019m Helen,\u201d the super milf replied with a warm motherly smile while also patting Karen\u2019s flabby shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before things could go any further, both of their bellies roared loudly, urgently demanding for food.</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a good night's rest and the colossal dump she took last night, Helen was starving and had room to spare. Especially with her stomach stretched out from the other day. Breakfast sounded lovely right about now but she wasn't sure where to go. \"Um I know this sounds sudden but um would you like to go grab some breakfast? My treat.\" Helen offered, reaching into her cleavage to pull out some damp $20 bills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to!\" Karen beamed, only for her smile to disappear. \"Oh wait....I just remembered. Every place on this block is packed. I don't know about you but I can't wait too long for something, anything to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen agreed. She smell the distant aromas of bakeries and cafes in the distant. She also smelled something closer, and it wasn't their flatulence. It was the dumpster. Still loaded with garbage. Part of her thought it was insane to even consider eating out of it but she was also desperate and didn't want to wait or be seen strutting her stuff around town in the nude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren moved past Helen and leaned over the side of the bin. \"There's gotta be something in here.\" As she searched, Elastigirl was left to stare at her fan's fanny as it wobbled and shook. Her cock stirred to life and the milf had to keep her emotions in line. The last time she felt like this was in college and she experimented. For both their sakes she had to resist. Eventually Karen managed to fish out a pizza box with cheese clinging like scabs to the cardboard. \"Oh look! Found some cheese someone missed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pried the cheesw chunk off and ate it like it was no big deal. Helen was appauled by this and yet also just the sight of some pizza cheese was making her stomach rumble. At this point, she would kill for a bread crumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Karen realized that something was wrong and swallowed what was in her mouth. A sudden wave of shame washed over her, probably the first time she felt like this in ages. \"I'm sorry, I don't know what I was thinking. Everyone else just kinda does it and I thought you'd be fine with it too. This must be super weird to you and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karen!\" Helen interrupted. She stopped immediately and gripped the pizza box like a shield, even though Elastigirl would never harm her. What she did do was stretch out a hand and tore the last dried up glob of cheese, and a bit of cardboard with it and shoved it in her mouth. Even thouh it was basically scraps, it tasted like the finest cheese she ever had. And she wanted more. \"Voyd, lets see what other goodies we got in there.\" Karen grinned ear to ear at being called her hero name and used her powers to conjure two portals. One at the bottom of the bin, the other in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrash poured out and piled on the ground as Helen knelt down searching for any resemblance of food. Starting with a bruised banana peel, she gulped that down and then moved on to a soda cup with melted ice still inside to wash it down. Karen soon joined and grabbed some grease soaked napkins to suck on. Elastigirl didn't see if she spat them out or not because someone left a few kernels on their corn on the cob. She could practically taste how many sticks of butter were slathered on. Almost unwilling to part with it, she put her stretchy powers to the test and swallowed it whole. No choking whatsoever. Seeing Helen scarf that down, she stopped holding back and grabbed empty chip bags. She licked them of every crumb and then gulped the bags down. The older slob hit the mother lode when she found some chicken tenders partially sunk in yogurt and covered in hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there the two stopped being picky and just shoved whatever was in front of them in their mouths. Their only criteria was to swallow anything that tasted good and spit out anything bad. Considering how much lard, sauces, and butter was sticking to everything, the tossed away few things. After a good ten minutes the two leaned against the alley wall. While far from Helen's best meal it at least filled them up and gave them enough energy to get moving. Karen let out a bassy belch that got a chuckle out of her idol. She blushed and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of all the slobs Elastigirl had met, Voyd was the nicest and hadn't stabbed her in the back. If she was going to get slim again and get home, she would need help and Voyd seemed trustworthy. Plus she knew the city better than her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elastigirl? Er uh I mean Hel-uuuuuuuuuuurrpp! Whoops,\" she stammered, still nervous around the super. \"Would it be alright if I uh I hung out with you for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen couldn't believe how adorable this bikini clad beauty was. By far the most polite slob in the city. \"I'd be delighted. But first, I need a change of clothes. I know people are pretty lax around here about nudity but I'm still getting used to it.\" That and she didn't want anyone see her when she got a boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Of course, lets get going,\" she said, amped up and ready to go. She opened a portal beneath her and fell through just as another opened above. She landed on the ground, impressing Helen with her superhero landing at her size, and offered a hand to her. Elastigirl grunted and strained as she pulled herself up, ripping a slew of sharts that left her asscrack moist and smelly. Once the two are back on their feet, they leave the alleyway and....</span></div></div>",

Moving her swollen head and neck down, the dorky super soon realised what her idol was getting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oh\u2026 I see.\u201d Her face also painted red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce far away from the strip club, Helen followed Karen\u2019s lead as the two slobby supers waddled through the messy foul streets of this resort, as their flabby bodies were coated with sweat that dripped heavily towards the floor. While also occasionally letting out burps and farts with each step they made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two arrived at the hotel Karen was staying at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are, the Lazy Poly,\u201d Karen happily stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 wow,\u201d Helen mumbled at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the hotel Helen was staying at, this Lazy Poly looked so out of place compared to everything else she had seen during her stay. It was a large wealthy-looking country golf club, that was surrounded by various things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I was surprised too when I got here, Elas- I mean, Helen,\u201d Karen said. \u201cIt looked nothing out of the ordinary until I got inside and saw\u2026 everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no different to everything else we\u2019ve seen here?\u201d Helen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two waddled their way inside the clubhouse, Karen then explained to Helen what the Lazy Poly was really like. Surrounding the tall clubhouse, there was obviously a golf course that was strangely damp, swampy looking and infested. And then she explained about the two-sport court areas, where holiday stayers could enjoy a nice game of tennis or volleyball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the games weren\u2019t exactly as they were back home. Some games had people gradually fatten up from playing a match or two. And somethings the tennis ball or volleyball was either a big ball of meat or pastries squished together into a ball. And lastly, there was the pool, though it wasn\u2019t normal like the one Helen tried back at her hotel. The pool at Lazy Poly was filled with carbonated water or whatever special liquid they would dump in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat an interesting clubhouse\u2026\u201d Helen replied softly, who was both confused by the bizarre status of this place but also at the same time, was eager to see these things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Karen collected her keys from the hotel receptionist and immediately headed towards the elevator with Helen behind her. Though, instead of going to the elevator, Karen whispered Helen they were going to take another shortcut. Finding an empty room with no cameras, Karen used her powers to warp Helen and herself to the door of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy powers are more effective when the location I need to warp to closer, otherwise things get a bit\u2026 messier,\u201d Karen explained nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, sweetie, I understand,\u201d Helen replied a reassured tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door and closing it immediately after Helen entered, Karen quickly locked it up so they didn\u2019t get any uninvited guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, cute place,\u201d Helen beamed with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren\u2019s hotel room was big enough for the two overweight supes, as there were no walls. The bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom were combined into a single area. And just like everything else, Karen\u2019s room was a mess too. Walls splattered with filth and food, crumbs and bits all over the sticky carpet floor and there were big piles of waste where the bath and toilet were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sorry how my place looks, it gets harder to clean or care about cleaning,\u201d Karen nervously stated, as she waddled towards her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 Yeah, I got that same weird feeling too,\u201d Helen added, glad to know the feeling was very mutual. Scratching her fat ass, Helen then remembered another thing she needed to ask. \u201cOh, Karen, another question, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything,\u201d Karen instantly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have any spare clothes I could wear?\u201d Helen asked. \u201cI\u2019m not used to walking around naked, though nobody has complained\u2026 yet but, I would feel\u2026 better if I had something to wear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren\u2019s face lit up with a bright smile, as the dorky super heaved away from her dirty bed and waddled towards a pile of wedged stuff, that was in the corner of the room. Helen was once more treated with a nice show of her fan\u2019s blubbery ass, watching it bounce and ripple in delight that was making her cock twitch greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh hah!\u201d Karen loudly declared, as she moved away from the pile and handed it to Helen. \u201cI have another bikini you could wear, hope that helps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Voyd~,\u201d Helen said with a wink, making Karen giggle at that response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Anytime!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt surprisingly didn\u2019t take Helen very long to put her new clothes on, as the slobby milf was wearing a red version of the same tight bikini that Karen was wearing. Though, it was struggling a bit to cover all of her enormous breasts and was quickly devoured by her monstrous ass. Not so much on her belly and groin area, but it would do for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding beside her a broken mirror that leaned on a wall, Helen checked herself out as she flaunted her flabby curves. \u201cHehe, I wonder what Bob would think of me now\u2026\u201d she thought to herself before slapping her mega booty in a playful manner. \u201cOr the kids...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Helen was admiring herself and Karen busy fishing out more stuff from her strange pile-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>KNOCK KNOCK!</b></i></div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Helen jumped a little when she heard the knock but Voyd placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \"Don't worry, I'l go check and see who it is.\" Helen nodded and watched Voyd waddle over to the door. When she opened up the door, there was a plump woman with beach blonde hair styled up in pigtails sucking her jam covered fingers. She had a revealing baby blue tank top on and a pair of formerly white shorts that were splattered in various sauces and stains. When she looked up and saw Karen, she grinned ear to ear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karen! There you are! I was worried sick about you. I've been looking everywhere.\" The blonde squealed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I left a note for you, Calli. Didn't you read it?\" Karen asked. By the stupefied look on her face, that was probably a no. Voyd rolled her eyes and blamed herself for not having a backup plan. Her friend peeked past her shoulder and noticed the brunette eyeing herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, you didn't tell me you found a milf!\" Before she could stop her, Voyd was shoved aside by the blonde bimbo as she dashed inside and startled Helen for a moment. Even though it was only a few feet, she was already out of breath when she grabbed Helen's hands. \"Hi, I'm Calli! I haven't seen you around before. Or maybe I did. I'm not that good at remembering people but I' pretty sure I would remember you. Is that a cock?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen tried to cut in but Calli dropped down to her knees with a THUD and grabbed her cock nonchalantly. Giving it a gentle grip that sent chills through the hero. \"Wow! You're huge! I mean, I'm huge too but not like this.\" Elastigirl was still in shock and still trying to process the situation. As for Voyd, she noticed out in the hallway there was a long chain of dining carts loaded with breakfast and brunch dishes. She also saw a couple turds lying on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calli, are you in the middle of something?\" Karen asked, only now noticing the fresh skid marks on Calli's asscrack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalli paused and thought hard for a moment. \"Hmmm I don't think so. Was I pooping?\" She grunted and strained as her pucker flexed open and nothing came out save for a few spurts of gas. \"No, that's not it. I did that on the way over to save time and get the food up here. Oh yeah!\" She let go of the dick and stood back up. \"Since you didn't show up for breakfast, management got worried so they sent me up here so you wouldn't miss out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, their stomachs rumbled at the mention of food despite being filled with garbage recently. \"Well it would be nice to get some actual food in us,\" Helen muttered. It might be hard get her belongings back on an empty stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure beats dumpster diving,\" Karen added. She opened a series of portals beneath the carts and then fell through, and reappeared when Karen made a portal in the middle of the room. The aroma wafting off made Helen's mouth water but before she could take a bite of the fluffy, syrup soaked pancakes, she realized that Voyd just used her powers around a civilian. She gave her a WTF look. \"Oh don't worry. Calli already knows about me. She won't tell anyone about us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalli just stared absent mindedly at the two with no clue what they were talking about. Satisfied with her answer, the supers dug in. Helen jammed a fork into a stack of pancakes and tore into them like they were nothing while Voyd was piling donuts into a stack and chomping into them. Compared to the trash they ate, this was like fine dining. It almost brought a tear to their eyes. Calli watched and giggled as the two pigged out and stuffed their chubby faces. Voyd motioned to her and pointed to the jug of orange juice. Without needing any further clarification, she grabbed the jug and poured it straight into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen was helping herself to biscuits drowning in gravy, thick gray globs running down her chins and into her cleavage. A familiar sensation was growing in her gut and making its way down south. She tried her best to hold it in because....because....wait, why was she holding it in? She looked to Calli who was licking muffin crumbs off of Voyd's belly. It had something to do with her but she couldn't recall why. Her mind seemed to be slowing down as if all that gravy was gunking up her brain. Since she couldn'f remember why, she shrugged and let an eggy fart rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoyd copied her idol and ripped a wet fart. She lifted up a box of marshmellow cereal and dumped it into her open maw. Most of it bounced off her cheeks and spilled onto the floor or her  belly but Calli was ready to jump in and eat it off of her friend. In their feeding frenzy, Helen could have sworn she noticed a couple hairs pop up around Voyd's armpits. Helen's crotch was also getting a little hairy too but that was normal. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided it wasn't worth questioning because she was more focused on combining different food. Eggs and donuts? Chomp! Sausage and syrup, yum! Coffee and bacon? Glug glug glug! It was all going to the same place so why not have them all mashed up together. In their haste they knocked over a cart and spilled food all over the filthy carpet. It didn't them from eating it up though. Helen got on all fours like a pig and grabbed the food with her mouth. Something seemed wrong but she didn't know why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she perked up when someone's head was slammed between her asscheeks. She looked back and could make out Voyd's familiar form motorboating her mounds. Elastigirl giggled seeing how silly Voyd was acting and her licking made her ticklish, so she gave her a five second long fart for her troubles. She giggled in response and noisily huffed the fumes. All the while Calli grinned and clapped for them. By the time they were finished, Helen and Karen were sticky with syrup and fruit juice, their bellies full and content, and they were completely content with themselves, ready for a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen was sprawled out on the bed scratching her belly while Voyd sat next to the bed, with Calli laying on her gut listening to her digest food. Helen was ready for a name right about then but something was nagging at her. She had to go do something but what was it? She had to go somewhere.....a hotel? But she was at a hotel. Maybe she just needed to enjoy the different activities Voyd showed her on the way up. Was that it?</span></div></div>",

The fact that her mind was somewhat cloudy wasn\u2019t helping\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting herself out of the damp and littered bed, Helen let out a small burp from her drooling fat lips while also nonchalantly scratching her flabby ass-cheeks, as the slobby super suddenly felt her fat dong bump against her meaty thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t forget about you,\u201d Helen chuckled at her mischievous appendage. Grabbing the base of her rod, she tried slipping it back into her much tighter bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Helen was busy with her clothing malfunction, Karen and Calli were slowly back onto their feet too. The slobby duo peeling pieces of leftover food off their sticky flabby bodies and instantly shoved them into their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026 So yummy~,\u201d Calli mumbled while chewing on a soggy sugar-coated donut that was once on Karen\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren moaning a bit as she slurped down a hairy fried egg, \u201cMmmhmm, it sure is~!\u201d she replied back happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObserving the two in their slobby snacking, Helen let out a warm smile at their cute antics. \u201cWhat a cute pair,\u201d Helen said to herself. \u201cI can see Violet getting along nicely with these two.\u201d However, that suggestion of hers quickly became erotic, as Helen soon began to daydream the girls and her having fun, as Helen soon pictured her slim daughter becoming a huge blimp-like herself\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cock swelling a bit and forming a big bulge underneath her hefty belly. Even her hairy snatch dripping a bit too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I mean\u2026!\u201d Helen muttered out nervously, instantly drawing the attention of Karen and Calli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong, Helen?\u201d Karen asked, getting a bit worried at her idol\u2019s sudden outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, there\u2019s nothing wrong!\u201d Helen quickly assured as she wanted to change the subject.

For some reason, it smelt like a lovely perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you now\u2026?\u201d Karen teased to her giggling blonde friend. \u201cWhat do you have in mind, Calli?\u201d</div></span></div></div>",

Laughing at her new friend\u2019s overflowing enthusiasm, Helen scratched her belly and groin, following Calli, while Karen followed the slobby older super from behind. Enjoying the constant smells her idol was making and admiring her jiggling posterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt surprisingly took them longer than they anticipated to get to this golf course, as the three grossly overweight women had their minds elsewhere while travelling through the resort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were times where Helen tried to keep her flustered emotions in check, feeling her mischievous cock twitch and throb in her tight bikini outfit, as if it had a mind of its own. It didn\u2019t help as she followed Calli, she was getting all sorts of arousing thoughts at sorts of other slobby residents and workers in this establishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, her super fan, Karen, was trying her best not to constantly piss herself with excitement, as the frantic young lady couldn\u2019t believe she was hanging out with her idol still! The blu-nette trying to keep herself cool and collective as possible. But really, she was constantly breaking wind from her bouncing ass-cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Calli? The ditzy blonde may have been the one who suggested to go to the golf course, there were a couple of times Helen and Karen had to keep her on track as the bubbly porky woman was continuously distracted by various things inside the hotel building. Ranging from delicious snacks on display, slobby games like burpee bingo or at times, she would just suddenly stand still, her mouth wide open, drooling mindlessly while Helen and Karen would try snapping her back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, the three managed to leave the Lazy Poly building and arrive at the Swampy Course. A large swamp with many pools of slurpy looking glowing water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat an\u2026 interesting place for golf,\u201d Helen stated as she looked around her surroundings. It was only now the older super was questioning why a get-away paradise would be next to a place like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, isn\u2019t it great~?\u201d Calli sighed with delight, her snotty nostrils sniffing up the swamp air. \u201cOkay than gal pals, like, let\u2019s go get our golfy stuff!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling their eyes but somewhat finding her blonde\u2019s quirkiness cute, the two waddled behind her. Thankfully, it didn\u2019t take them very long to get their golf gear as there was a kiosk nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollecting their golf clubs while subconsciously ignoring how old and rusted they looked, the slobby three realised something interesting about their chosen clubs and balls</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n===========<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Choice 1:</b></i><br>\r\nThe end of Helen\u2019s club was shaped like a Frog while Karen\u2019s own resembled an Octopus and lastly, Callie\u2019s took the appearance of an Alligator.

The super heavyweight mom picturing her baby son making a mess in one of the pools here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s ready for some <i>-UUUUUUURRRRRRRPPPPP-</i> fun?\u201d Calli cheerfully announced with a large burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, the three slobs soon waddled their way towards the first hole and began playing their game. As Karen and Calli gave Helen the first go and watched the older woman practice her swings, causing her blobby body to shake and jolt from her attempts, which Karen and Calli admired with great interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon followed was quite a relaxing game of golf, as the swampy course was more like a mini-golf with crazy swamp theme attractions than a big field, which thankfully meant the three didn\u2019t have to waddle around so much. The three took their turns and smacked their balls near the golf hole. However, by the time they reached the fourth hole, the three encountered an\u2026 obstacle of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gotta be kidding me\u2026\u201d Helen sighed, wiping some sweat off her forehead with her saggy arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area linked to the fourth hole was completely flooded with that slurpy water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAah, what\u2019s wrong, sugar mama?\u201d Calli asked as the blubbery blonde waddled in front of Helen, placing one fat foot into the water. \u201cOoh, kinda tingles~.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Calli, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea\u2026\u201d Karen uttered with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, relax ladies, no water hurt anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen and Karen watched as Calli stepped further into the water, the level reaching her heaving chest as she continued moving forward. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the hole~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait!\u201d Karen mumbled, the blu-nette quickly stepping into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen merely shrugged and simply followed them; her flabby body covered in goosebumps from the cold tingling sensation of the water. As Calli said, it was only water. What harm could it do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully moving through the water, Helen kept her attention on Karen and Calli, the overweight heroine making sure nothing bad happens to her young friends. However, as she slowly waded through the boggy water, Helen\u2019s body was having a strange reaction to the substance that resided in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen\u2019s already enormous frame began to thicken and grow more, pushing beyond what she currently weighed. Her doughy chinned face, belly apron, huge breasts filling greatly with newfound fat while her arms, thighs and legs packing large amounts of fat as they became true pillars of lard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her body already experiencing a lot of things, Helen didn\u2019t notice how her appendage was extending further than before and the huge balls that were sandwiched between her colossal thighs bloated more until they could reach the bottom of the boggy pond she was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the biggest growth on her body was super-sized hips and ass. The super mom\u2019s body becoming larger than before, the bikini she wore struggled to remain on but it eventually snapped off and floated away in the water; which Helen didn\u2019t hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her body was swelling crazily, her skin suddenly became gross and slimy like an amphibian\u2019s. The colour of her skin also gradually changed red while her arms, waist and legs were painted black as if she was wearing her superhero costume. Soon, her face followed as a black domino-like mask formed around her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething... doesn\u2019t feel right\u2026\u201d Helen thought herself, she continued to press forward in the deep bog. She suddenly heard some flies buzzing around her damp hair, which too was lengthening as well, covered with her new mucus too. \"Go on! Shoo!\" she snapped at the pesky bugs, causing the exceedingly overweight woman to fling her arms around to shoo them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to chase away the flies, Helen felt herself lowering herself down. Forcing herself into a crouching position that was similar to a frog. Her thighs and legs suddenly becoming bigger too while her hands and feet became more webbed-like. Then out of nowhere, Helen let out a croak that inflated her throat like a balloon, before deflating once she was done; as if she croaking with frustration.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing more frustrated with the flies, out of nowhere, Helen shot her tongue out of her larger fat mouth, catching one of the flies and quickly slurping it up in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026 <i>-ribbit-</i> Crunchy!\u201d  Helen remarked from the surprisingly good snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBusy eating the rest of the flies that circled around the changing slob, Helen\u2019s right eye began to inflate which sent a sting into her system at first; but her face soon adjusted to fit her bulging new eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooohh\u2026 Who knew flies could be so delicious!\u201d Helen croaked with delight after eating the last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 965lbs froggy super soon reached destinated area, where she carefully hopped out with a heavy thud, her inflated changed body jiggling for several minutes while Helen lazily scratched her new neckrolls with her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 <i>-ribbit-</i> wasn\u2019t so bad,\u201d the frog slob chimed, sporting a smile on her slimy chunkier face.</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Helen helped herself to the bug buffet, Karen and Callie kept playing. Neither seemed to acknowledge Helen's transformation and waded deeper into the water. Karen questioned who designed such a poorly made course. Karen managed to hit her ball across the water but Callie missed and was going after her colorful ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren trudged through the swampy soup until her foot sank into a thick patch of mud. Her second foot followed as she teetered and tried to get her balance. Karen stopped herself from faceplanting but now she was stuck. She could call out to her friends Karen didn't want to look weak in front of Elastigirl, and Callie was occupied. The only company she had were the dozens of mosquitos swarming her and trying to drink her blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rump received the blunt of their bites as each cheek stood out like a squishy island in the water. Due to her immobilization in mud and her rotund frame, she couldn't quite reach the bugs. All Karen could do was make a portal in front and behind her then give her ass a smack. Every time she yelped and winced seeing the bug guts smeared on her buns. While she did that, she strained herself trying to pull her legs free. With some grunting and pulling she heard something pry free and whack her bubble butt yet couldn\u2019t' quite escape her predicament. Even stranger, the bruises on her bum matched her turquoise hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Callie, she was trying her best to swim out to her golf ball. The weather was warm out and a swim was just what she needed. Especially with her skin cracking and hardening along her back. Not only that but it was turning a sickly green and scaly but she didn't notice. She huffed and puffed her way after the golf ball steadily paddling after it. The waves her body made kept pushing the ball further away and making her swim farther from her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so close she could almost reach it with her teeth, and she certainly tried to get it with her mouth. Silly as it was, she swore she could feel her mouth get closer with every bite. Her swimsuit slipped off during the swim but she didn't really care why but she should. The reason being that a ground mound was forming above her keister and stretching out into a long tail. Fed up with the ball, she dove under the water and for a moment everything was calm. Then, a blurry blob rose to the surface as Callie leapt out of the water and caught the ball in her reptilian muzzle before splashing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren looked up but missed what made that splash. Growing concerned, she struggled harder to free her legs. She could have sworn that one of them was freed and even swiped at the mosquitos with one yet it felt like both were still there. That's because her legs were splitting off new limbs for her that began forming suction cups on the underside. Her entire rump now matched her hair and the pigment was bleeding out to her hips and stomach. Karen kept pulling and exerting herself but couldn't move an inch even though she felt something breaking free. Eventually, she tired herself out and decided to swallow her pride. She looked over her shoulder and called out, \"Helen? I could use some-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice got stuck in her throat because she spotted an enormous red frog on par with her size going to town on some flies. Karen shrieked and reached down trying her best to dislodge her digits. Finally, she managed to free a leg but lost her stance and backwards into the water. Her big blue belly hutted out of the water while her face sank beneath the waves. She squirmed and struggled to get back up but something was wrong with her hands. It was as if someone tied them together and made them feel floppy. Not only that but there was a wriggling mass of tentacles above her that scared the crap out of her. Was this it? Was she going to drown?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently not because someone hooked their arms underneath hers and hoisted her up. Karen gasped for air and breathed in deep. Her hair obscured her vision but she recognized the slimy belly pressing into her back. Karen parted her hair and said, \" Thank you, Helen. For a moment I thought ai was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped once again when she realized that the frog from before was the one holding her. Another second passed and it dawned on her that Helen WAS the frog. Before she could say a word, she noticed Helen looking down at something. When Karen checked below, she discovered those tentacles were her own. Six meaty limbs writhing beneath her with her fists replaced as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo top this all off, a massive gator girl swam to shore brandishing a golf ball in her muzzle victoriously. Her whole body was covered top to bottom in scales and a long 5 ft long tail dragged in her wake. \"Sorry bout that, I got my ball... back\u2026\" It was clear that the alligator was Callie, who took a second to put together that the frog and the octopus were Helen and Karen. As all of this sank in, how do the girls react?</span></div></div>",

WAIT-!\u201d Helen called out, as she tried to hop but felt her larger cock and balls get in her way, making her clumsily fall over.

Looking back down to where her body was, not only did her body look a lot larger than before but now, she resembled a giant frog! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her stretched flab filled neck back down, Helen hopped towards the water and looked back at her reflection, truly confirming that\u2019s how she looked now. \u201cThis is so\u2026 surreal\u2026\u201d Pinching her inflated cheeks before croaking again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer large webbed hands moving from her head, down towards her drooping belly before reaching her cock. Helen\u2019s eyes widening at the discovery how much bigger her appendage had gotten since she last inspected it. Unaware it naturally measured 7 ft long, without needing to use her powers. After she was done with that, Helen let out a soft moan as she soon felt her much larger orbs squeeze between her wider thighs; that sat on the floor while she was squatting. Quickly realising her balls had also gotten larger, she could only estimate they were big as her dangling but yet full breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoohh\u2026~\u201d Helen murmured with arousal while feeling her sticky slimy body with her hands, almost about to stroke her cock before slapping her hand. \u201cN-No\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRefusing to give in to her carnal feelings, Helen turned her attention back at Karen and Callie, expecting to see them feel nervous or frighten by their sudden changes, but instead, the froggy super discovered the two sporting lusty smiles and giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren no longer looking nervous but laughing softly as she played around belly and breasts with her arm-like tentacles and using one of her new limbs form below to reach her much larger head. Meanwhile, Callie was swinging her huge tail around and playing with her nipples, her huge maw wide open as large excess amounts of drool tickled between her fanged teeth before dripping down like a waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen couldn\u2019t help but feel more aroused than before as she watched the two play with themselves with no hesitation, as her throbbing cock extended more and lifted her heaving belly.</div></span></div></div>",

The slobby frog hopped closely to Karen, who was too focus with her tentacles tickling her folds of fat and cupping her heaving bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBumping her ginormous belly into the blue octopus super\u2019s own, Karen suddenly found herself fall over, landing in her heap of expelled turds that got splattered all over, which only made the shy slob laugh more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Helen\u2026 What are you doing~?\u201d Karen stuttered softly before breaking into a moan, the fallen slob looking back at her idol in a dreamy manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving the giddy blue slob a warm and loving smile, Helen shot her tongue out and gave Karen\u2019s doughy face a good licking. Once she was done with that, the froggy super carefully spread Karen\u2019s fat legs apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 Come on, Voyd, give your hero a good <i>-ribbit-</i> time~,\u201d Helen said in such a captivating way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling more than before, Karen watched as Helen lifted her belly up high before placing it on top of her blubbery belly. Soon she could hear Helen softly grunting and croaking, as the young octopus could feel something gently slide between her legs on the floor; approaching her open damp puffy snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen\u2019s fat cock slipped easily into her awaiting pussy, as the frog moaned even harder than before, even burping exceedingly. The froggy super milf enjoying the warmth and soft feeling of the insides of her superfan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh\u2026 Oooh\u2026 Elasti-girl~!!!\u201d Karen sang loudly, her pupils shaped like hearts while her body trembled in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no hesitation, Helen immediately starts pounding away into Karen, the two moaning together while their flabby bodies bounced and jolted wildly from the thrusts. Helen\u2019s bloated balls swinging into the bottom of Karen\u2019s supersized ass while her belly bounced ontop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two fucked in the boggy mess, Callie was using her tail as a temporary dildo, ramming her new body part into her dripping pussy while her fingers were busy groping and playing her giant chest and massive belly. The blonde gator moaning loudly into the swamp air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering all the times her husband, Bob, pleasured her, Helen repeated the same actions with Karen, loving the sounds of her fan\u2019s cute moans and gassy outbursts with each thrust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a good <i>-ribbit-</i> girl!\u201d Helen yelled and croaked with delight, one of her hands stroking Karen\u2019s belly. Soon, the grossly overweight frog humped even faster into her blobby blue woman, her body getting sweatier while her thoughts soon began to imagine all sorts of lewd things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElasti-girl surrounded by her adoring public, family and friends, treating her like a queen. Feeding her constantly and pleasuring her almost every minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck, fuck!~\u201d Helen suddenly called out, reaching her limit before unleashing a huge climax into Karen\u2019s hungry pussy, flooding it completely with her thick seed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAHHH~!\u201d Both of them screamed blissfully before huffing and panting from that rush. Using her powers to extend her neck, Helen travelled up to Karen\u2019s face and sloppily kissed the worn-out girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 Wonderful, Voyd~.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren couldn\u2019t form any words, too tired and overwhelmed with so much happiness. Never imagining her day would come to this strange but amazing outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLazily pulling herself away from Karen, who continued to lay on the floor. Helen scratched her quivering ass before spotting what Callie was doing. The slobby gator girl licking her sticky tail after climaxing not too earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her leaky prick rise up again, the froggy sloven super hopped towards the masturbating gator as Helen shoved her aching cock inside Callie\u2019s ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOOOOH!\u201d Callie suddenly yelled in surprised, her whole body pushed down onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t forget you, my sweety~!\u201d Helen remarked while drooling lustfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no warning, Helen slipped her cock into Callie\u2019s open fat cunt and began to madly hump into the blonde slobby reptilian, who was roaring happily from the surprising but welcoming fucking.</div></span></div></div>",

Her face was now double chinned, and her breasts actually had cleavage in the shirt she was wearing. She was not wearing her usual pants but rather had on a pair of light gray sweatpants. Her rear end bulged out of even this pliable garment, and a clear panty line was visible. Excess belly fat tensed her shirt, riding it up. When her husband walked into the room to see her, his jaw dropped; not only was the woman he married so much fatter, but she positively stank! She smelled as if she hadn't showered in days, and if he wasn't mistaken, she was passing gas right on the spot! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hun!\" Helen smiled, moving to kiss her husband. However, he detected her breath from several feet away. \"Umm honey I've got something really important in my office I'll be right back!\" Bob stammered, obviously not wanting to come into contact with the source of the foul odor. He hurried into his office and slammed the door, trying to think over the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen, unperturbed by this, waddled into the kitchen for a snack. Violet, who had just entered the kitchen after hearing her mother's voice from her room, gasped when she saw the massive rear end sticking out from their open fridge. She could hear her mother (was it her mother or was this just a joke?!) chewing and smacking loudly. Violet got closer. \"Mom?\" <br>\r\nA blast of foul air erupted from her mother's rear end, causing Violet to stumble backwards, slightly green in the face. Her twiggy figure was now pressed up against the wall of the kitchen farthest from the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen made a slow turn to turn and face her daughter. She looked positively delighted to see Violet. \"Sweetheart! Why so wide-eyed? Ohhh... I know you may think I'm acting a little strangely, but....\" She rummaged in her sweatpants' pockets for a moment, then pulled out something wrapped in napkins with her meaty arm. \"...if you just have a few bites of this, you'll understand! Then we'll both change how things get done around here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?!\" Violet asked, more than a little freaked out. <br>\r\nHelen smiled. \"No more chores or housekeeping for me! I'm going to sit back and enjoy myself! You can too!\" Trying not to look too unappealing to her daughter before she ate some of that city's cooking and began the process of \"changing her mind\", Helen took care to place her hand over her mouth for her next series of belches, and attempted to pass gas as quietly as she could...which was unfortunately not very subtle at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet pushed the wrapped object in her mother's hand away from her. \"No way! This is crazy!\" Violet felt like she was going to pass out, as the smells surrounding her mother were worse with her so close, and seemed to be intensifying in the small kitchen with each belch, breath, and fart. <br>\r\nHelen smiled. \"You'll see Violet. Every time you get stressed over school, or don't want to do your chores, know that Mom can be there to take care of her little girl!\" Putting the napkin-wrapped hot dog in their fridge, Helen grabbed a bag of potato chips and a package of salami and waddled off to park her butt on the couch.</span></div></div>",

A hundred pounds later, Helen's godawful stink had dominated the house. Every single room, even the garage, contained her disgusting scent of BO and greasy sweat. She stopped washing herself several weeks back, and refused to change her clothes more than once a week. It got so bad for Bob that he slept out in a tent most of the time. The kids got pretty used to it, however, although they couldn't be around it for a while at a time or else they'd faint. Helen understood that they weren't used to the lifestyle (yet), so she rented out a nearby motel room permanently so that the kids could stay there whenever they wanted. Dash was proud that he had an awesome mom who allowed him to eat anything he wanted and let him have bad habits! He no longer had to cover his mouth when he burped at dinner and he didn't have to clean his room. And he had a sweet motel pad with no rules!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet was starting to feel sympathetic towards her mother. Yes, she was a filthy pig, but something about her started to appeal to Violet. Violet was the only other person who would stay the night at the house, and she helped her mother bring food and buy her movies. Sometimes when Helen farted really loudly, Violet would sneak by and take a whiff, pleasing herself in the trashy aroma. Violet herself was starting to fart more leniently, although her mother's were loud enough to cover them up. She had also started to eat a bit more than usual, putting on about 40 extra pounds. She was still turned off by the unwashed factor, although she did start to wash her hair less than usual, which was now starting to build dandruff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen was talking on the phone, burping every sentence and letting out a never ending supply of farts. Snacking on ten chicken legs dipped in a giant syrup jar, Helen wiped her head with one of the legs to get some sweat off. Violet walked into the living room, carrying a plate full of salsa dip and pork rinds. She put the plate down and sat on the wrappings-covered floor, letting out a tiny fart. Violet opened a 40 oz bottle of Pepsi and started chugging, her third bottle this hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURP! Thank you so much!\" Helen loudly said, \"PHHHFRRRRRRRRRRRRRT! We'll be there on Friday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen hung up the phone and got Violet's attention by burping near her face. Violet smirked and let a burp back in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, we're taking a trip to Slobnia!\" Helen squealed, \"PHHHRFT! I'm taking the whole family on a trip to the town that changed my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet smiled. She was very interested in the foreign Slob culture!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell Bob and the others to URRRRPPP get in here, we gotta get packing by Friday! We're going for a whole month!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, *urp*, mom\" Violet interjected, \"Dad's going on an out of town business trip tomorrow, and Dash is starting Summer Camp on Friday. I... *urp*... don't think it's a good idea to bring Jack either, he's probably too young now for this, we can leave him with that babysitter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen farted loudly in dissapointment, chewing on the old chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRPPP! NOOO! My family is stuck here being clean freaks forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I'd like to go!\" Violet responded with a modest fart, \"I don't start college for three more months, and all my friends are on vacations themselves. Take me with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen smiled, then gave her daughter a big, dirty kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRP! Thanks, sweetie! Now get to the kitchen and start packing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet got up and grabbed some suitcases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I gonna pack in the kitchen? What about our clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How rude, Violet!\" she farted bitterly, \"You know better than to tell me to bring extra clothes! Don't bother bringing any more clothes for yourself, either, that's very disrespectful to the citizens of Slobnia. Also you'll be in PPPHHHFFRT, BIG trouble if I find any hygiene products in your bags, Violet Incredible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet gulped down a burp. She didn't want to test mom when she said her full name!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet packed up some food from the kitchen as Helen laid back, closing her eyes as the syrup spilled down her arms.</span></div></div>",

With each meal was a note, which Violet read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*urp* If you wish to get to Slobnia, go to First Class,\" it read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls got up and walked to the First Class area. Surprisingly, there was no one else there, only a bunch of empty seats. Helen sat down in one whole row, happy to have three seats to her body and food. Mirage and Violet sat in some other seats. A women walked to the front and let out a healthy fart. She was a brunette that was about 200 pounds and was covered in a filthy flight uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello ladies!\" she said, \"I'm glad to have you here to join us in our trip to the great Slobnia. I UUUUURPPP! recognize Helen over there, on your last flight we accidently brought you with us to Slobnia, but from what I see now it seems that it was okay with you!

This next month will be the greatest month of your lives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned on some switches and locked the doors out to the second class seats, then sat down in a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fasten your seatbelts girls, or use a couple to strap yourself down Helen, cause URRRP!, we're gonna be hitting some turbulence soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes later the plane started to shake.

Drooling a bit, she used her powers to stretch past some people and cut in line. And with a few snatches here and there she had a plate piled high with pizza, pasta, and donuts. The super then found a large table, watching as Mirage and Violet sat down as well, their own plates only having a little food on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up you two! You need to put some meat on your bones!\" Helen said, having already eaten five donuts. Farting, she watched as her ass expanded some more. \"Yes! Make me fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet and Mirage could only watch as Helen ate her entire plate in ten minutes. Her breasts increased several cup sizes, her ass was threatening to rip her extra extra large sweatpants, and her belly was causing her shirt to ride up immensely. All in all she looked like she had gained a hundred pounds from that one plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet nibbled on a cookie, her belly pooching out some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage had a bite of her steak, her rear end doubling in size.

They never felt full at all, so they kept gorging in the food. At first it was just simple orders like ice cream or meat, but after a while they started getting crazier, such as ordering chicken wings doused with soda or bacon and hot dog sandwiches with mayonnaise and honey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen was now a bit over 500 pounds. There wasn't a moment that this piggy woman wasn't farting now, and her breath and odor dominated the smell of food. Violet herself was starting to indulge a bit more and was a bit over 200 now. She was starting to take after her mother, chowing down several chicken legs in one minute as her dandruff rained onto the table like a waterfall. Mirage wasn't eating much anymore but was guzzling down soda like it went out of style. She was getting gassier and put on about 30 extra pounds. Her skin was getting greasier and shinier, as sweat dripped constantly down her cheeks. The girls were laughing and having a good old time, trying out new types of food and having farting contests. No one was able to top Helen, that was for sure. Her farts were already killing some of the plants in the restaraunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chubby waitress walked up and got their attention with a small burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, we're so happy that you enjoyed your time here,\" she puffed, \"But UUURRRPPP!, we're closing in five minutes so you'll need to go.

SQIGRRLISHLL. Mirages stomach gurgled loudly. Plopping on the bed after a big meal was not a good idea for her all too bloated belly, Sorry let me take care of business. PRFRRT.

Ha! laughed Mirage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey that gives me an idea! Mom, guess this one, Violet leaned over on her side stuck out her ass to launch a poot of her own. PPPOOT. What do you smell here?<br>\r\nMirage and Helen sniffed the putrid wind and thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIm going to say you had pistachio ice cream topped with garlic and kidney beans, guessed Mirage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat smells to me like pizza swimming in Dr. Pepper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow my turn, Helen took a deep breath and closed her eyes and let out a fart that sounded like a engine malfunctioning, PBEOUTRTTT! Oh that was a good one.<br>\r\nMirage held her nose and playfully fanned her hand in front of her face, Ill say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what do you make of it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell Ill say you had a Violet inhaled in the odor she was sniffing a rose, vanilla ice cream topped with fried shrimp. onion rings and mustard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage? What do you think? asked Helen she said as she fished a fry from between her thigh and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a Belgium waffles covered in *sniff* barbeque sauce?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nERR!

Just got lucky I guess, giggled Violet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuck shmuck. Thats talent, girl. She takes after her mother, a natural born slob! Helen said as she munched on her sweaty French fry.

Mirage sneered as she cocked her hip to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage, Violet blinked, that was AMAZING! My hair as all blown back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour belch was indeed impressive but it had very little stink to it. In other words your bark was louder than your bite, Helen said with a faux English accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell Simon, Mirage crossed her arms, well what did it smell like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmells to me like you drank a two liter bottle of mountain dew, mixed with coke, root beer, Tab, and whipped cream and A1 steak sauce.<br>\r\nDumfounded, H-how did you know that? Mirage said as she let out a quiet fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah mom, how did you know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirls, please Ive been slobbing up for months when you were still, she shuddered, taking *Gasp* baths with soap and still eating right. I mean, cmon! Just look at me! Big Beautiful and Stinky! Like that huge flower, that smells like rotting meat! Helens stained and straining sweat pants were hard to argue with. Helens quarter ton body greatly dwarfed both Violets 200 pound body and Mirages teeny 140 pound body was nothing compared to the blob Helen was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess its my turn. The score is 3 Mom, 1 me, and none for Mirage.

Of course, after their dinner they were more like napkins than swim suits. Helen's breasts were so big that her bra only managed to over her tits and her thong only gave her a wedgie and was on the verge of snapping. Violet and Mirage managed to get into their bathing suits, but still showed their hanging guts. They looked at the pool and saw it was completely filthy. Half-eaten food bobbed around, flies buzzed around the top, and the water had an murky green color to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CANNONBALL!\" yelled Helen. She dove into the pool and caused a major splash a quarter the size of a tsunami. Mirage and Violet were drenched in the foul smelling water. \"Come in, the water's fine.\" The two reluctantly jumped in. They agreed that the water was pleasantly warm and almost peaceful. The two ladies just laid on their backs and drifted around. PPPBBBBBBBBLIPLBLIP! Helen was turning the pool into a jacuzzi as she farted into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, nothing like the slob life. Right ladies?\" Helen asked. The two admitted that they were having fun in a weird way. They even started eating some of the food dripping in the pool. It was delicious, but it gave them horrible breath. They tasted the water and noticed that it was delicious. They drank some and they started farting worse and worse, not to mention make them smell bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPPBBBBLBLBLBLBLLLLBBBBBBB! PPPPPBBBBBBBBBBLBLBLBLLBBBBBBB! PPPPPPPPBBBBBBBBBLBLBBPBLB!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were trying to see who could make the most bubbles in the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am having the time of my life. I wish I had a pool like this back home.\" said Violet. \"Yes, the water is delicious. Helen, what's in the water?\" Violet noticed her stomach was growling and she let a fart loose. \"And where all the restrooms.\" Violet asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen had an idea. \"Tell you what girls. See the other side of the pool? If you can beat me to the other side, I'll tell you those secrets. But only use your \"natural\" abilities.\" BURRRRRRRP! The two knew what she meant and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all got ready to go, each facing the other side of the pool. \"Ready... set....go.!\" PPPBBBBBBLBLBLBLBLBLBLBLBLB! Helen got a head start and was speeding like a motor boat. Helen and Mirage managed to go, but they weren't going as fast as Helen They both desperately wanted to win, so they tapped into their gas and let loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBRRRRRRRRRRRPP!! BLPLPLPBLPLPLBPBLLPP!!!!<br>\r\nHelen turned and saw the tow coming up fast. Violet was using the farts she was holding in to avoid pooping herself to catch up and Mirage used her super belches to speed up. Helen tried harder but they were too fast. <br>\r\nBRRRRRRRR !!! PPPPPPRLLBLBLBLBLBLBLBL!<br>\r\nCRASH!<br>\r\nHelen saw the two crash and only one of them won. She smiled at the winner...</span></div></div>",

But I sort of have to go *really* badly, so if you could just tell me-\" \"Oooooh honeeeeey, denial isn't going to make things any easier~!\" Her fat mother cooed as she waddled over to her daughter. \"And it feels so nice knowing you don't have to stop what you're doing whenever nature calls~\" she continued, stroking her comparatively thin daughter down from her chest to her butt, smiling as Violet continued to fidget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing her flabby arms in annoyance, Helen turned her head to her side and said to a similarly anxious Mirage \"Kids these days! It's not like this water you're swimming in is any cleaner than what she's trying to hold in anyway!\" And with that both Mirage and Violet shrieked in unison, gagging as Helen smugly looked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM! YOU TOLD US THIS WATER WAS SAFE TO DRINK FROM!!!\" Violet yelled, about to launch into a rant before she realized in her sudden burst of disgust and anger she'd forgotten to keep herself focused on her certain bathroom problem, a series of bubbles erupting from her rear as her face turned bright red. \"... <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Whoops.</font>\" Was all the embarrassed teen could muster to squeak out as she felt her bikini bottoms slowly fill up, her eyes twitching as she tried to resist the urge to lean back and moan in relaxation, her time in Slobina already starting to warp her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe failed miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooh man, this feels <i>nice</i>~...\" Violet moaned as she felt her swimsuit starting to fill up so large it squished against the back of her legs, her mother hugging her in pride. \"Awwww, my little daughters becoming a beautiful slobby pig~!\" Helen said, Mirage starting to cup her hands and drink from the water as much as possibly before any of Violet's waste spilled over onto her side. \"Well it's good to know you were just lying to loosen Violet up Helen, this water's delicious!\" Mirage said as she started guzzling it down, Helen forcing a smile as she bent down to Violet's level whispering to her ear. \"*I wasn't actually lying about the water sweetie... But I'll get straight to work on her once you're my size~*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*... I already know mom, I saw you soiling yourself after you jumped in...

She turned away and tried to get some sleep. Later, at one o'clock, Helen's stomach started rumble. Apparently, pool water and 30 hamburgers were not a good combination. Mirage was woke up when she heard Helen fart. PPPPPPFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was covered with the smell of Helen's fart and her eyes started burning. \"Helen?\" she asked. She hoped she could wake the super up, but couldn't. Helen was in a food coma and couldn't be woken up. No matter how hard she poked or shoved, Helen stayed asleep, letting loose another fart. Mirage couldn't see, but she felt something hit her head. She touched it with her finger and noticed it was soft and warm. PPFFFFFFTTTTTT! SO more hit her as she smelled Helen's farts. Her farts were getting so powerful her shit was being shot at like crazy.

Mirage tried to ignore it and get some sleep, but Helen kept crapping herself loudly. Luck for Violet, she was wearing ear plugs and she was used to her mom's farts.. Mirage started to gag on the smell. She tried covering her head with her pillow. It made her farts quieter, but she could still smell it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor 30 minutes, Helen was pooing nonstop, like a fountain her pant started to expand as more poo filled it up like a water balloon. It soon smelled like fish, cheese, BBQ sauce, and armpit hair. Mirage couldn't take it. She decided to move into Violet's bed. She removed the pillow from her head but suddenly something else covered her face. It felt warm and soft, like a bean bag chair. PPPFFFFFFTTTT! She could feel it moving during that last fart. She soon realized that she was buried under Helen's pants. The had expanded so much it covered Mirage with Helen's poo. She k=had to get out. She tried to push it up, but she was too weak to pus it away.

As Violet began to feel the sweat accumulate over her body on account of the humid weather, the thought of a refreshing dip seemed almost heavenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached the water, Violet looked around for a place to change into her bathing suit. \"Err, Mom, isn't there a restroom or a shower or something that I can---\", she stuttered as her mother playfully pushed both her and Mirage in. Helen chuckled, \"There'll be no need for that, now let's get this thing going!\" while pressing a small button on a nearby pool console. Suddenly, a new current began to form in the pool. Violet turned to see a pipe expelling a murky, brownish solution from under the water, and gasped. \"Wait, what is that stuff? What'd you do?\", Violet nervously inquired as she paddled to the edge of the pool, only to notice that the drop off was too high for her to climb out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This, is the Soak Pool! While you can *urp* swim and play and all that stuff, you can also get odorized with some of Slobnia's most *PHhhhhhhhhhhrt* famous scents,\" Helen explained, \"I think today's batch is limburger cheese with a hint of skunk musk...\" Mirage had already caught wind of the aroma and began to gag. Violet got a whiff of what smelled like one of the ripest farts she'd ever smelt and plugged her nose. \"CANNONBALL!\", shouted Helen as she threw herself into the pool, sending a tidal wave of sludge over the heads of her guests. Soon, all Violet could smell was the filthy water that seemed to coat her body by the second. Helen gave a sigh of relaxation and several large bubbles rose out of the water. It was then that the combined stench of the putrid bath and her mother's eggy fart sent her to blissful unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet dreamed. She was in front of a mirror staring at herself, unable to move as indistinguishable blobs of people approached her. They raised her armpits and pulled out a perfume bottle simply inscribed \"Sweat\" and began to spritz her entire body. Another one placed a spoon full of beans in front of her, to which she welcomed with an open mouth and consequently replied to with a wet, bassy fart. All the meanwhile, folds of flesh became more and more apparent as the perfume was applied and the beans were consumed that she soon saw a new curvy, heavyset girl with a green gaseous aura - a far cry from her old self. And then, Violet fell in love.</span></div></div>",

Despite being pungent enough to knock her out earlier, Violet was fully embracing her smelly surroundings, letting every thick fume waft into her nose as she lazily floated along. Eventually the still somewhat frail teenager felt her head bump into a soft, fleshy wall, opening her eyes just in time to see her mother unload an enormous fart right in her face. *Prrrrfffffffttttttt!* \"Ooooh, that was a wet one! Tell me honey, just how RANK was that one to you! You're still a bit too <i>clean</i> for my liking, but before long mommy's gonna make sure you're a beautiful big slob of a girl!\" Helen said happily as she turned around and grabbed Violet in a tight hug, the comparitively tiny girl wedged between both of her mother's large boobs as bits of half-eaten, wet food driped on her messy hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling herself away, Violet tried her best to recompose herself. \"Thanks mom, but eh... Can we hit a buffet? I'm kind of starved since we got here and---\" \"Oooooh, I thought you'd never ask! As your mother I have GOT to make sure before this vacation is over, you don't fit <i>any</i> of your old clothes! Ooooh Mirage~!\" Slowly waddling out of the shallow end of the pool with a flabby arm wrapped around Violet, using her spare arm to scratch her enormous dimpled rear, Helen beckoned the third woman of their slothful group. \"*Cough* Yes Helen? *Wheeze*\" Mirage blurted out as she got off from her pool-side chair, still finding life in Slobnia hard to get accustomed to. \"My little girl feels like pigging out, and I thought since you're also... Erm... Finding things a bit hard to get used to here, maybe somebody a little more familar with Slobnia's rich culture could walk you through the average diet. Don't you want to have a body like this~?\" Helen teased as she playfully slapped her fat belly, grinning as she watched it jiggle and held it up to Mirage and Violet's faces to admire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even letting Mirage make up her mind, Helen dragged her outside onto the street, sniffing the air as if trying to hunt down which restaraunt would be the best for her little girl. \"Uh, mom? You forgot our suitcases...\" \"Not to mention getting changed--- Won't somebody say something with us in nothing but in bikinis?!\" Helen merely giggled and started to slowly waddle down the pavement, letting her big butt sway side to side as she continued to track down some food. \"Don't worry guys, if you stick with big blubbery me, nobody will mind that people of your... Skinnyness are broadcasting your secret shame to the world. And forget suitcases, lifting them is <i>hard work</i>, and we'll be doing none of THAT, thank you very much! Now, I can sniff out two different places Violet honey~. What kind of grub do you want to stuff yourself silly with first? The first place... *Sniff* Smells like a whole bunch of greasy, deepfried meat while the other *Sniff-PRFFFTTTTTT!* heh heh, whoops!

The smell in the kitchen didn't improve much but Violet was still able to tolerate it, her mind focused on other matters. Violet nervously held her arm against her body concern for her mother beginning to over take her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mom... What's happening to you?\" Violet spoke softly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his study Bob was running over every possible explanation he could think of. Being a veteran super hero his first conclusion was she might be a robot, his wife couldn't have changed that much in just a week. But then there is the matter of her smell and sweat, she produced biological secretions that seemed to complicated to mimic with any robot. It was possible this was some sort of deformed clone or impersonator sent to take Helen's place. But why kidnap someone only to send back a replacement that looked and behaved so differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen why did I ever force you on that vacation...\" Mr. Incredible was kicking himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob needed to find his wife before anything happened to her he couldn't live with himself if he lost her to some villain trying to get to him. Pulling the GPS locator out of the drawer he tried to home in on the chip located in his wife's super suit. However to his dismay the signal placed her suit in the suitcase she had lazily left by the front door. Bob was at a lot for how to move forward from here, and he was a bit miffed to think whoever did this may have stripped his wife's suit off her to send back with this doppelganger.. assuming she was a fake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob Wanted to march right in the living room and apply his super strength to this person claiming to be his wife and demand an explanation. But he was at a loss for more information, this could be some unwitting actress, but Bob was so filled with rage that something had happened to his wife he could almost care less if he rung the neck of some innocent accomplice. And then there was the slim chance this was his wife, and they had done something terrible to her, whoever 'they' were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had one option to fall back on but he hated to take it, Mr. Incredible would prefer to solve his own problems but this was his wife and there was nothing he wouldn't do for her. Pulling a small red card from his wallet Bob began to dial the number on the back. After one ring a monotone voice answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello You've reached the hotline for cupid's flowers deluxe, we're sorry but we are currently experiencing a shortage from our suppliers, if you would like for us to contact you when we can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob fumbled with the card holding it to the light to see secret messaged watermarked between the layers of card \"Um.. I...oh, I just needed to know your rates for... Calla Lily's\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause before the emotionless voice continued \"I'm sorry but those flowers are not offered in this region, perhaps we could interest you in a different flower...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob scanned the card again with the light behind it \"That's fine any flower will do provided you can promise me a speedy delivery\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a click as the password was accepted. After the incident involving Syndrome the government had set up a small division to handle the supers exclusively, keeping them in contact and providing assistance should any more super villains surface. Bob waited a moment for someone to pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Please state your superhero identity and number for verification\" a feminine voice answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Incredible number 35773\" Bob replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Mr. Incredible?\" The voice sounded surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob took a moment before he recognized the voice \"Mirage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, you remember me\" Mirage cooed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the liaison for the supers and the government?\" Bob was a bit shocked to hear Mirage wasn't in a prison for her collaboration with Syndrome despite his recommendation that she was helpful in bringing the super villain to justice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes they offered me this position to make up for helping Syndrome with his schemes..\" Mirage sighed \"What do you need assistance with Mr. Incredible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My wife!\" Bob suddenly remembering the urgency \"I think she may have been kidnapped, or changed or.. .I don't know..\" Bob trialed off still in the dark what he was dealing with<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, slow down and try to explain to me, what happened? Mirage tried to calm him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... She went on the trip and she or whoever that maybe came back... Different\" Bob sighed in frustration \"If it's her then she's not herself, her manners and attitude has changed and she's clearly heavier than when she left. She's so different and there's something... wrong with her or it or... I don't know!\" He bellowed losing his patience<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Mirage slowly thought \"I'll see what I can do for you. Unfortunately all of our agents are in London, Edna Mode contacted us just yesterday under suspicion her new fall line was going to be stolen by some villain calling herself 'the super model' so we are a bit short handed. To be honest I'm the only one in the office today but I'll see what I can do about getting you some more information\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...Thanks\" Bob said defeated, knowing his wife may be in danger and there was nothing he could do for her was killing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Helen had raided the kitchen for everything she could find. Wrappers and empty boxes were everywhere. Helen stood in the middle of her rampage with a satisfied smirk on her face as she looked over the mess she had created. Letting out a loud belch She checked the fridge once more. Stretching one chubby elastic arm behind her to scratch her massive behind all that was left was the half eaten hotdog she had brought back. Giving it a knowing smile Helen stood up and grabbed her car keys and headed out the door for more food, one last blast of gas erupted from her monstrous ass as she strutted her smelly flab toward the car.</span></div></div>",

Each bag was stuffed with junk food. Cookies, cans of whipped cream, and even a large cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey...we need to talk,\" Bob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen's face finally appeared, with it's three chins. She was chewing on something and talked with her mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing hon! URRRRP what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Can't you see what's happening to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen looked down at her large form and back to her husband, noting the concern in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll admit there's more of me than there was and I,\" she paused for a fart. \"Haven't been the best mannered person in the world but I'm happy Bob. I don't have to worry about working out or denying my body the food it craves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this isn't what the woman I married would have wanted,\" Bob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bob, I'm still Helen Parr. I love you, I love our kids. I'm just loosened up a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob sighed and ran a hand through his thinning hair...</span></div></div>",

Inside two rather bloated women in skin tight leather stealth suits stained with food and covered in sweat seeping through the material watched with great care. One of them a blonde wearing glasses weighing close to 470 pounds turned slowly her bulk pressing against the monitoring equipment that was installed on either side of her and pressed a red key on her panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Urrrrp] Nineteenth hour of observation has passed, subject has been in contact with family for six hours and fifteen minuets\" She paused and let out a strong sigh \"still no indication that DNA encoding has taken effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other woman a young brunette with short hair and southern accent weighing just under 305 pounds glanced back at her for the go ahead to follow, after a small nod from her partner in the back she started the engine and began to tail Helen's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure we shouldn't stay?\" She spoke up while driving \"That call we observed from her husband to the government agency may be a problem if they intercept her when she gets home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the more reason to stay with her now\" The woman in back replied \"If they plan a trap for her return we'll spot it before she is in danger. Now keep your eyes on our target Agent Six, she's making a right turn\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgent Six turned in time to see the car ahead of them take a right and pulled over into the turn lane just in time to keep with her. \"How do we know the encoding took no effect, She responded to the slobbification more aggressively than any other subject, plus she did bring back some of the food for her daughter.\" She reached over and grabbed a handful of donuts to cram into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True she was highly receptive to the slob changes, but those were just enhancements to basic human traits. All of our other subjects were average women, Elastigirl was our first 'super's subject we were brash to assume the results of the slob changes would carry over into the DNA encoding.\" The other woman scanned her notes\" She's shown no desires to recruit other supers beyond sharing her new affinity for food with her daughter. Clearly her super DNA created anomaly in the encoding process. All the women back in 'the city' took to both the slobbification and encoding to give them the desire to share their changes with those around them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but after how long it took to locate a super and find her secret identity we didn't exactly have the luxury of waiting of holding her for observation like all the other women we've recruited[Phhhhhrt]\" Agent six reasoned and let out a loud fart \"We had a very small window to keep her for the process. With no other supers to test on we either find a way to activate the DNA encoding or wait till she leads us to another super to test on. Any word from the organization on a possible solution Threebie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Agent Three...\" The other woman growled and picked up a meatball hoagie \"They said their working on the analysis from the tests of the samples we got from her. Still no word on any breakthrough, just continue observation and hope she suddenly has the urge to bring all the other super women a 'hot dog' like she did for her daughter [BRRRAAAAAAAP]\" she belched and took another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Incredible arrived at the grocery store and headed inside grabbing two shopping carts. The van following her pulled up to the front of the store and both women quickly jumped out. Inside Helen Parr left a trail of drool on the floor as she looked at all the food around her. Working her way up and down each aisle leaving a rather strong odor in her wake. Both carts began to fill with all the sugary treats and junk food Helen passed. Empty wrappers and crumbs fell to the side as Mrs. Incredible couldn't help but indulge as she shopped. Helen threw an arm load of ice cream cartons onto the top of one of the monster piles of food and picked the last one out of the freezer peeling off the top and scooping out a handful for herself dribbles of melting ice cream running down her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she neared the front of the store Helen took note of a few women beginning to enter the front doors. It seemed like some of the ladies coming in were more... likeable. Helen couldn't place her finger on it but these women seemed more trustworthy. Their shirts were tight, some even straining the buttons of their blouse. Most of them were in the 140-190 weight range but they were all wearing clothing they had begun to outgrow. Most were beginning to show the start of sweat stains and a quiet belch could be heard from one or two as they moved into the store with a hungry look in their eyes. Helen didn't realize it but she was beginning to prefer the company of women who understood the value of a good meal and knew how fun the reproduction of such gluttony could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashiers broke from their stares of these odd women entering the store to gasp at the two overloaded carts Elastigirl was struggling to push. Several bag boys tried to assist her but the smell of Helen's B.O. as she worked up an even greater sweat trying to move her carts sent them reeling as they gagged and gasped for fresh air. Helen started off upset she might be burning precious calories with her exertion but after seeing how much the effort was building up her natural musk she decided she could live with it. Slinging an arm length's or sweat off her brow and onto a horrified cashier on the next checkout lane Helen began to unload the mass of food still unable to keep herself from munching on some of it as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl at the counter tried to hold her breath but it was no use there was to much to ring up and the stench seemed to invade her nostrils even without taking in air. She tried to ring up the food as fast as she could to get this slob away from her. Helen noticing how little respect she was getting took a bite of her garlic breadsticks and let out a loud belch right in the young girl's face. The poor girl retched in response jerking back away wanting to run, but her manger quickly approached with a clothes pin on his nose and pointed her right back at the register. Helen smirked as the girl turned around and placed her hand on the next food item. Helen let out several noxious farts and burped once more as she picked food from the carts to munch on as she emptied them. By now the girl working the register was so desperate to get her out of the store she had begun to just grab arm loads of the food and drag them across the scanner barely reading one or two of the barcodes. By time the carts were empty and all the food moved past the scanner Helen barely ended up paying for even 1/10 of the food she had picked out. Ringing up the obviously incorrect total of seventy dollars Helen began to pull out her check book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no!\" The girl blurted out before thinking \"Uh, here!\" The girl quickly pulled seventy dollars from her purse under the counter and placed it in the till. \"There, you're paid up!\"she smiled nervously praying the disgusting blob would leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Than-[Braaaaaaap] you\" Helen smiled and grunted letting out a series of gas blasts as she tried to build up momentum to push her carts out of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the two agents of slob were standing behind a several fold out tables lined with food.They had peeled off the skin tight suits and put on more casual outfits both dressing in a blue blouse with pale blue button up vests and short blue skirts that were so tight on their corpulent bodies it was a wonder they even managed to get them on. Agent three wiped some sweat away from her eyes \"Do you have your lines ready? She should be finished shopping soon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, [Urrrrrp] hopefully this will get her started on the right track\" Agent Six replied and turned to another customer trying a jelly donut from the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady trying the donut took one bite, the sweet yellow filling squishing out and onto her cheek. After just a few moments the woman's eyes lit up and she inhaled it. She gladly purchased two bags worth of donuts and candy bars from the two obese women along with several pies. As she headed into the store to purchase the rest of her shopping list she took a few more donuts from the bags and enjoyed them. By time the woman had reached the second sliding door and entered the store the seems on her pants were already started to frey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One good thing about the data we collected from elastigirl\" Agent six smiled as she watched the woman disappear into the store her body already beginning to swell causing her to jiggle and her clothes to grow tighter and tighter as her panty line became visible through her pants. \"The study of how a super's altered DNA reacted to the chemicals that induce weight gain sure helped us to boost the effects on everyone who eats them. I think we've doubled the effectiveness of the compound since Miss Parr returned home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to find out if it reacts even better with our gracious benefactor\" Agent Three nodded to the door as the bottom heavy Helen came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen zoned in immediately on the table covered in food and gladly took the detour away from her car with the heavy carts in tow. Helen drooled as she looked over the table scooping up a cherry pie before even asking if they were for sale and without even aknowledge the two women behind the table. Helen moaned in joy as the rich taste danced on her tongue. Helen looked to the two ladies smiling at her, they were both fatter than her and covered in sweat as the blond on the left let out a fart. Helen could smell them the moment she left the store, Helen couldn't help but think these traits made both these women very likeable and already she liked them even before saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helwo\" Helen mumbled through a mass of pie already stuffing the rest into her mouth and licking the pan clean \"[Urrrrp] These are really good\" She smiled and grabbed a few clair to stuff in her mouth.</span></div></div>",

We were just on a lovely trip two weeks ago.\" She picked up a hunk of fudge and stuffed it into her mouth smearing chocolate as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We realized the food here wasn't nearly as good as the food there so we started ordering food to be shipped back home.\" The blond continued \"But we soon realized we had to share this stuff with everyone.\" She pause to produce a hot dog with onions dripping with cheese and grease from a tinfoil wrapper under the table a took a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen's eyes went wide seeing it \"That's a... You've been to there too?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh you know it?\" The blond smiled \"I should have known. You certain seem to understand how good it feels to let yourself go and just enjoy all life has to offer, and that life offers some pretty good food. \"She slurped down the rest of the dog and pulled out a card from her purse handing it to Helen. \"If you ever want any food from there just call us. If there's anyone you think could use a lesson in enjoying life we have plenty of these special treats to share\" She patted the tinfoil tray and pulled a container of stake wrapped in cheese and bacon like sushi and covered in onions popping a few into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen wanted to get a few treats for Violet but first she had someone else in mind. Reaching into the tray she grabbed a sausage biscuit topped with bacon dripping with grease and ran back into the store. The girl who rang up her food was leaned over her register still trying to breathe as the stench in the air took it's sweet time to dissipate. Helen abruptly grabbed the girl and pulled her into a tight hug with one arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what are you doing you fat cow!\" She screamed \"Let go of m-\" She was cut off by the biscuit being shoved into her mouth. Mrs. Incredible held it there until the girl stopped gagging trying to spit it out and began to taste it. First she chewed slowly as the taste hit her but quickly devoured the whole thing becoming weak at the knees over the flavor. Helen scooped her up and carried her back out to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just thanking you\" Helen smiled as the girl was still in shock over the taste absent mindedly trying to lick the grease off Helen's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen returned to the table and reached into the tray again pulling out a deep fat fried taco covered in cheese. She placed the young woman back on the ground and handed it to her who snapped out of her daze and greedily inhaled it. Helen smiled as the girl sucked the cheese off her fingers and dove into a blueberry pie without a second thought getting blue pie filling all over her uniform as she made loud obnoxious sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will need a few treats\" Helen watched and the girl dove face first into a bucket of pudding made out of donuts and cream the buttons on her uniform beginning to stretch as sweat stains lightly dotted her pits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take anything you need\" The Brunette happily offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at the repurposed NSA headquarters Agent Rick Dicker was reveiwing Mirage's report on Mr. Incredible's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bob is a good friend of rhe agency but a full investigation to moniter and document the subject in question is not possible with so many of our agents already deployed in the field.\" Rick sighed as he placed the clip board back on Mirage's pile of paperwork \"I'd love to give him a hand but the best we can do until we have more manpower is just keep an eye on the family via satalite surveillance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he's really worried about his wife\" Mirage pleaded \"Couldn't we go pick her up and bing her here for testing or contact another agency for help on-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick put up a hand to stop her \" This Agency is not on the books, as far as most of the goverment knows the NSA is still closed indefinitly and this facility is not operational, nor could we bring a suspect here and reveal the location\" Rick paused and let out a sigh \"Look kid, I like Bob too but until we have the personnel to run the tests we just can't handle his request yet. Unless you want to go out on field work to do the reconnaissance on Mrs. Parr to determine if she is really Elastigirl and what may have happened to her, Bob will just have to wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage huffed and folded her arms as she leaned back in her chair.</span></div></div>",

Picking over the options before her she picked up a slice of pizza topped with extra cheese, pepperoni, onions, mozzarella sticks, bacon, and a helping of macaroni and cheese. Helen moaned with delight as she stuffed the greasy pizza into her mouth, she had almost forgotten how good the real food she had tried on her vacation was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Om nom om] I really missed this food\" she sighed contently and let out a loud fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why not take an entire tray with you?\" The blond offered pulling a second foil covered tray from a heated pouch and offered it to Helen. \"Feel free to call us anytime you want more, food like this is to good not to indulge in as much as you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Incredible couldn't bring herself to turn down such a generous gift her appetite growing as the slob food over powered her once more. She placed the warmer tray on her cart and loaded up a few bags of pastries eating a few as she did so. Helen's shirt was tight and started to ride up even higher as her pants stretched to their limit the seems pulling in opposite directions as the stitching began to show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[ Urrrrp braaap urp] How much do I [uuuuuuuuuuuuup] owe you?\" Helen asked belching uncontrollably<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it, you need it\" The blond waved her pocketbook away \"Just promise to enjoy and share\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got [ppppppphrt] it!\" Helen grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Helen struggled to push her carts back to her car the two agents watched \"She still just seems to want to share the food in general, I don't think any of the greater programming has taken any effect\" Agent Three sighed and farted for a few seconds<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she went pure slob after just three days in the city, [uuuurp] now that she has some more of the food from there maybe it will have a chance to kick in\" Agent six said hopefully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't hold your breath\" Agent Three looked at her filthy partner as six bit into a deep fried hamburger sandwiched between two cheese burgers \"We may have to take drastic measures if the organization can't find a simple solution\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! She's leaving!\" Agent six suddenly noticed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the, How did she load all her food so fast?!\" Three panicked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's elastic remember?\" Six said \"She probably wrapped her armed around all the food at once\" The two girls grabbed the foil covered trays and boxes of food. \"What about these tables and the fattening pastries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgent three looked at the two tables of pastries and then at the blimping cashier girl her uniform coming apart at the seems and the blouse ridding up on her growing pot belly and love handles her face currently buried in deep fried banana split. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll take care of them\" Agent Three decided \"Lets go before the target gets out of our sight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home Helen arrived just about dinner time. On the way she had picked up two pizzas. Helen got one for Bob and Dash, the other she had eaten herself and replaced with one from the foil tray. Helen had eaten off a few of the more unusual toppings such as the chicken nuggets and mini corn dogs. She had also stopped by a wall mart for some new clothes. In the past Helen usually got something casual but nice like a silk blouse or a designer skirt from a discount store but for some reason ever since her trip she just wanted something grubby like the sweat pants she was wearing. Helen picked out several sweat suits as well as some over sized tee shirts she could wear without pants plus larger bras and panties, the ones she had on were so tight it was uncomfortable. If there was one thing Helen wasn't going to put up with anymore it was anything that was uncomfortable such as notions like.. moderation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling for Dash as she came in the door Helen set down the first few bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dash I got pizza! As soon as you unload the car you can eat!\" She called out trying to hold in a burp. As soon as she spoke a yellow blur rushed past her and in flash the bags from the car started to pile up in the kitchen. A few moments later dash came slowly walking out of the kitchen panting out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez mom [gasp] did you buy enough food?\" Dash tried to catch his breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really\" Mrs. Incredible thought to herself with a smile. She noticed Bob standing in the hall looking at her with some consern, he could see she was slightly bigger. \"Hey sweetie\" She smiled and walked over to give him a kiss. Bob held his breath as she got closer, as Helen gave him a kiss he could taste cheese and pulling away a trail of drool remain connected to their lips. Bob's skin crawled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey\" Bob started wiping the drool off and taking a step back. \"We really need to talk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe after dinner\" Helen smiled and silently let her fart pass. She handed him the pizza box. \"Could you also feed Jack Jack for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...sure\" Bob said slowly \"But that talk-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, later\" Helen smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob waved for Dash to follow and grabbed Jack Jack taking them to his study to eat so they could get away from the smell.</span></div></div>",

Mom\" Violet greeted her mother, pausing as she caught a whiff of her mother's B.O. once more. Violet was already in her PJs since she usually ate dinner then studied before going to bed early on a Sunday night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Vi\" Helen beamed. I got a pizza for us, why don't you set the table and get started while I put some of the frozen food way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"s-sure\" Violet agreed not looking forward to sitting that close to her mom for to long. Violet watched as her mom headed into the kitchen, the sweat pants skin tight showing every dimple of cellulite and her shirt the seems beginning to tear apart to make room. Violet could even see where her mom was started to waddle back and forth as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet set out two plates and sat down and opened the box grabbing a slice for herself. Helen's arms stretched back and forth putting the ice cream and frozen TV dinners away as fast as she could. She wanted to rejoin Violet as soon as she could. In the dinning room Violet was lost in thought as her mind pondered the current state of her mother. She was very worried her mom might have had some sort of mental breakdown, how could she get so fat and smelly like that and act like it was normal? Helen appeared at the door just in time to see Violet bring the first slice of pizza to her lips as her mind was so preoccupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet's taste buds rocked her train of thought and made her jaw drop in awe. Violet couldn't seem to register the full extent of this flavor. She quickly began to chew though, moaning as she stuffed the rest of her pizza into her mouth Violet just pressed the entire slice in chewing loudly as she did so. Grease poured out over her fingers and out the sides of her mouth. Violet was quick to roll her tongue over each finger and lick the sides of her lips sucking up the taste. Violet descended on the pizza box grabbing a slice in each hand gobbling and snarfing at the slices one after another getting cheese and pizza sauce all over. Helen smiled and reached back into the kitchen grabbing the foil tray. Helen sat across from Violet as she crammed the 5th slice of pizza into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good huh?\" Helen smiled at her daughter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[om nom nom] yeah [snarf gobble] good [urrrrrp]\" Violet barely manage to reply not even taking her eyes off the food<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen pulled the top off the tray and placed it between them before grabbing a slice of pizza and a chocolate chip pancake wrapped around a sausage from the tray and pigging out herself. The two Incredible girls ate loudly getting grease and various cheeses, sauces, and other food bits all over themselves and the table. The more they ate the more they ate like pigs. Violet turned from the now empty pizza box and stuffed a deep fried grilled cheese sandwich into her mouth. Helen slurped back a bowl of chilie filled with garlic and cheese fries the mess leaking over the edge of the bowl and onto her face. Violet reached into the tray and pulled out a large burrito overflowing with cheese and onions, As she bit into the cheese burst out the other side covering her hand in cheese and beef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls just kept eating and eating the fattening food in the foil tray between them for a solid 20 minuets until it was almost all gone. As Helen bit into a burger covered in gravy her shirt began to tear away to small to fit anymore. Looking down in surprise Helen's sweatpants also gave up at that moment ripping and tearing open as they denigrated yielding to the mighty ass Helen had. Standing up her clothing fell away in shreds the food stained rags falling into a pile on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[om nom] Guess I need to [braaaaap] Change\" Mrs. Incredible shrugged at her daughter who was to busy eating to notice. Helen turned and grabbed her bag of clothes and walked back to her bedroom letting out a fart with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet licked some crumbs off her hand from the deep fried cheddar and sour cream covered potatoes. Reaching back for more Violet let out a startled belch when she found it empty. Violet tipped the tray up to lick it clean but she still needed more. Violet burped again loudly and scratched her butt. Violets body had started to plump up her PJs were stained with food and what were once loose and roomy were starting to hug her hips and backside ever so slightly, her belly was stuffed with food pressing out against the fabric causing it to lift up and reveal some of her packed gut. Violet wobbled into the kitchen to hungry to get her balance after her new center of gravity. Violet chanced upon of the bags of pastries and quickly started to gobble them down one after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen pulled at the elastic of her panties till they snapped and held them up to eye level. \"Amateurs\" she scoffed and tossed them aside. As Helen pealed off the rest of her outgrown outfit admiring her new girth. Helen stood before the mirror and let out a satisfied burp watching as her flab resonated with the vibration. She was over 200 pounds by now. Her belly was getting larger and she had what could almost be called melons to cup in each had on her chest. Helen's hips flared out dramatically as her now legendary ass swelled out starting to lose it gravity defying lift. She gave it a good slap to watch it wobble but managed to dislodge more gas. Helen happily release fart after fart waiting her cheeks slap and shake. After a while of playing with her smelly flab put on a new larger pair of panties and threw on a night gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen found Violet in the kitchen still wolfing down pastries albeit at a slower pace than before. Helen leaning on the doorframe and watched almost with pride as her daughter stuffed two entire cupcakes into her mouth making her cheeks bulged with sugary confection. Violet was started to turn into a real butterball. The super fattening pastries were working their magic on Violet right before Helen's eyes. Her PJs were not tight on her plump body, the young girl's body filling with fat. The buttons on her top were starting to separate as the growing girl became wider than the top was meant for, her belly making the ever shrinking top lift higher and higher on her chubby belly packed with food. Violet's pants were tight her hips swelling out, while she still had some time before hormones decided if her hips would follow in her mother's footsteps she was already sporting a decent accumulation of fat on them leading back to an equally impressive gain to her lower half's backside. The outline of her pink heart pattern panties clearly visible. As Helen watched her Daughter pig out the lowest button on her PJs that was hung up on the packed gut of food gave up and popped off flying across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[[[ <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://a.imageshack.us/img31/4659/parrslob.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://a.imageshack.us/img31/4659/parrslob.png</a> ]]]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet chewed a donut slowly her mouth wide open showing the food inside rudely. Her too tight PJ's showed sweat stains and Violet was even starting to become a bit fragrant with B.O. However it was not noticeable over the presence of her mother's smell. Violet let one hand go free of food for the first time since she started eating to stuff her it into her pants to scratch the side of her ass. Violet let out a roaring belch followed by a yawn and two more smaller burps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for bed sweetie?\" Helen said beaming with pride over her young daughter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[hic] Sure mom [yaaaaaa-uurrrp-aawn] I really need to lay down for a while\" Violet said her face growing tired. She grabbed a few more pastries and let her mom lead her to bed as she munched on the treats. Violet's head felt fuzzy and she couldn't understand why she felt so tired. To be honest Violet was barely aware of the binge she had just indulged in. Violet's mind lazily pushed these thoughts down keeping her from focusing in what she was doing to herself and she just mindlessly enjoyed the pastries rapidly disappearing from her armload. Mother and daughter farted and belched freely as they walk out of the room.</span></div></div>",

She felt as if she had the flu; her stomach was bothering her, she smelled of sweat, and the last thing she felt like doing was getting out of bed. As Violet willed herself to a sitting position, she noticed one sensation that was definitely not associated with getting sick; despite a painful stomach ache, she was also starving! She put a hand to her gut, trying to puzzle out why she felt so strange, when she detected a significant change in texture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE?!\" Violet shrieked as she jumped to her feet; a fart escaped from her now much more voluminous rear as she did. Violet knew this wasn't some horrible nightmare the moment she glanced in the mirror. She was clad in the bra and panties she put on yesterday, and they definitely looked to be her normal, size 3's and a-cup wear. Her body, however, was no longer fitting these specifications. Her bra looked ready to explode, and her panties were so tight they left very little to the imagination both front and back. A tiny micro-roll of fat rolled over the topmost edges of her undergarment. Violet felt like she was going to vomit; her once totally flat stomach was now a serious potbelly that exerted enough weight to cause two downward slanting creases on either side of the small of her back. There was no longer space in between her thighs when she stood. Her rear end had grown banana rolls underneath each cheek and smallish dimples played across her backside and inner thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet couldn't take the discomfort anymore and unhooked her bra. For once in her life, she had noticeable breasts. Violet, feeling their weight and pushing on them a little with her hands, sighed. She used to be peeved at being flat chested, but now that she finally had some weight upstairs, the rest of her body had to draw the eye away from them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the disorientation that one feels upon waking up faded away, memories of last night began to filter into Violet's head in rapidly sharpening clarity. Her mother did this to her, and it was changing her! Violet ran a testing hand through her hair. Having gone unwashed, it was starting to become oily. Licking her lips, Violet tasted a greasy cheese-like tang. Last night she was doing exactly what her mother was! Violet tried to stifle a small string of belches that surfaced as she stood and puzzled things out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet willed herself to throw on sweatpants and a sweater (It was altogether too warm for one, but it was the only thing that fit halfway decently!) and to apply deodorant. As she was stroking the stick underneath her arms, she had a pang of panic, as if she were on a roller coaster that had just reached its highest point before the drop. The deodorant felt sticky, unpleasant, and downright gross under her arms. Trying to ignore that she was passing gas again, Violet grabbed her books and vowed that she would march past her mother and whatever temptations she offered, get on the school bus, and try and figure out what to do next over the course of the day. She thanked the universe for her powers of invisibility, as she would rather not give her classmates more opportunities to guess how fat she had gotten than were absolutely necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet's mind raced as she noticed the changes in her body as she was descending the stairs. \"Oh my god, what is happening to me?! I'm getting winded going DOWN stairs! Urgh...and I feel my ass shaking all the time now....I've gotta drop....gotta...\" &lt;Frrrrrrt!&gt; She froze in awe at the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet stepped into the kitchen to observe a smorgasbord of breakfast delights strewn on every available surface...except in a 10 foot radius around her mother, who was still in nothing but a nightgown and panties as she greedily rolled five or six pancakes into a cylinder, crammed them into her mouth, then proceeded to drink from an uncapped bottle of syrup. Her ass was jutting out far enough to bulge into and flow around the creviced made by the kitchen drawers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen looked happy to see her daughter, and positively happy to see her daughter's thighs. Her eyes scanned Violet's body greedily. \"Sweetheart, don't go to school today...\" Her mother cooed in a tone that just screamed \"my poor little overworked baby!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...ummm...uhhh\" Violet just didn't know what to say, the resolution she had made to herself just seconds ago now forgotten. In the back of her mind, Violet noted her breath was kind of strong as she stammered; she had forgotten to brush both last night and this morning. <br>\r\nViolet mentally told herself that she stopped in shock at the image of her mother, but part of her knew she was really paralyzed by how delicious the buffet looked. In fact, her mom's flabby, layered pear shape was almost kind of graceful looking...if you got past the fact that she was so gross! Violet's mind was going all over the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast burritos, clearly overstuffed with meat and cheese, over-sized pancakes and waffles, heaps of bacon, fat-laden T-bone steaks, all manner of sugary fruit juices, and package upon package of butter beckoned to Violet's increasingly ravenous appetite. The grease dripping from the meat onto lower strips of bacon or sausage links in their respective piles was hypnotic. The smell was fantastic, even when mixed with the tropical atmosphere of her mother's sweat and constant belching and farting. The kitchen was nearly twenty degrees warmer than any other room in the house! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit, sweetheart!\" Her mother waddled over to the table, pulled out a chair, and belched as she gestured. Eying her daughter, she smiled. \"Eat up! My little girl put on such a great foundation last night, now its time to build!\" She half-sang in a maternal voice. Her belly rested on the back of the chair for the moment her mother was positioning it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet tried to mentally compromise. \"I can just enjoy the feeling of all that grease sliding down my throat for just a few minutes, until the bus comes, then i'll throw some of those pancakes in a brown bag and...\" Violet shook her head as she began to take absentminded steps toward her foul-smelling mother. \"What am I thinking?! Get out of there Violet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet stumbled backwards. \"Mom, listen this is all really nice but I'm going to have to pass! I'll see you after school...umm...bye!\" Violet nearly ran from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen put her hands on her hips, letting her bare breasts slip out of her nightgown. \"I don't under -burrrap- stand\" she said out loud. Helen took a break from eating (with one of her hands) by bringing her fingernails into her smelly, damp armpit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet suddenly reappeared, now visibly gasping for breath. Before Helen could do more than let a fart slip out, Violet grabbed a foot-long breakfast burrito in each hand, about faced, and ran back out of the house, leaving behind some of her own gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet was halfway through the burrito in her left hand, a heavenly bacon-sausage-ham-cheddar-egg mix, and had succeeded in dirtying her sweater with the oily morsels that fell from the poorly-contained wrap as she gobbled it up. \"God this is so good! I can't believe I like this! What's happening to me?! Maybe just one more trip inside....who cares if I miss school and have a bite to eat with mom just this once....but if I do that I'll never be the same Violet again! I'm being brainwashed!\" Violet belched loudly, flecks of egg spraying from her mouth. \"I've gotta stop doing that....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet saw her school bus rounding the corner; it was time to choose. Violet's stomach roared with hunger; she felt less full AFTER eating some of her mom's 'cooking'! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its just that addictive, stop now!\" Violet's conscience screamed. \"It's just that good, go have more!\" Violet's mind whispered.</span></div></div>",

She finished the burrito that was already in her hand and grabbed as much food as she can. She didn't notice that her mother's breasts were visible or there was a pleased expression on Helen's face. Violet kept thinking to herself 'just one more, just one more, just one more....\" as she stuffed another handful of bacon into her mouth and a waffle and so on. The little voice telling her to go was blocked out by the noise caused by her flatulence, munching, and stomach growling. She had dropped her backpack and was leaning over the table getting her sticky fingers on everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you take a seat Violet?\" Helen offered. She was happy to see that her daughter was enjoying the food. \"No thanks mom *pffffft*, I'll be leaving in just a urrp sec.\" Helen looked past her daughter out the open front door and saw that the bus was already driving away. \"Actually hon I'm sure the driver will wait. After all, he knows you take it everyday so I'm sure he won't mind waiting a minute or two.\" Helen felt a slight twinge of guilt lying to her daughter but Helen thought it was for her own good. What Violet didn't know wouldn't kill her. Violet thought it over and thought it made sense. She would be done soon and leaving in a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever a few turned into a minute, which turned into a couple minutes, when turned into a half hour. Violet lost track of time as she savored the buttery pancakes and guzzled down juice and syrup. Her legs were getting tired from supporting her so she eventually took a seat. Helen eventually resumed eating with her daughter, feeling a sense of pride in her. She noticed that every few minutes Violet would fart and burp louder and stinkier more often. There were nothing compared to Helen's but it was a start. Every now and then Violet would have to scooch her seat back because her growing stomach was pressing against the table. Helen's belly on the other hand was getting so big that it was resting on the table. Vi's bra couldn't take the pressure from her new breasts and eventually snapped. Violet didn't hear it over the sound of her fart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later Violet was finally full, her shirt pulling back so that part of her gut was visible. Her butt crack was noticeable and her pants were extremely tight. As for Helen, she had a remarkable muffintop and her boobs had gone up a cup size. Both women had terrible breath, were breathing heavily, and had many stains on their clothing. The table was scattered with empty, dirty plates with dried butter and syrup. Violet groaned as she rubbed her bloated belly. She wasn't used to eating this much and had gotten stomach ache. She looked up at Helen and said, \"Mom? I thunk urrp I got tummy *pffffft* ache. I don't think I can go to school.\" Helen leaned over, ripping a fart as she rubbed her daughter's gut. \"Don't worry I'll call the school and tell them. I guess it's a good thing you didn't go today.\" Violet nodded in agreement as she struggled to get back on her feet. Helen helped Violet up and the two went into the living room to watch some Tv together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet laid on her back with her head resting on her mother's belly as she moaned and let out a cacophony of burps and farts. Helen just rubbed Violet's belly and let out some gas of her own. Despite the pain, Violet loved having a big belly and loved the meal. She couldn't believe she almost went to school and missed this. The stomach ache passed an hour later but she didn't tell her mom because the belly rub felt nice. The way Helen's hands lightly pressed against her doughy skin was blissful. Around noon there was a knock on the door that startled the two. \"Oh that must be the takeout I ordered. Be right back.\" Helen said as she got up, accidentally blasting a fart into Violet's face as she passed. The scent was strong but instead of being disgusted like she expected to actually liked it. She took a big whiff and smiled. Helen opened the door and expected a deliver boy but was face to face with....</span></div></div>",

Her mental resolve faltered slightly when this allowed her subconscious to present even more vivid images of tempting food against the dark backdrop of the inside of her eyelids but Violet gritted her teeth and took several more steps further from the kitchen she longed to return to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad violet been more aware of her surroundings she might has noticed the pair of hands stretching their way from the back door of her house as they stealthily opened her backpack. Helen's elastic appendage removed a weighty english text book and replaced it with a paper bag containing several more breakfast burritos along with a few cheeseburgers wrapped in bacon covered with crisco and a thermos filled with a rich peanut butter and chocolate milkshake topped with heavy whipped cream. Violet's mental strife waged on and prevented her from registering the shift in weight on her back as the switch was made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet's stomach began to ache in need of more food. The once rail thin girl felt like her abdomen had become so hollow she was in danger of implosion. Violet put a hand to her new jiggling pot belly to remind herself there was indeed still plenty there and no where near as hollow as her subconscious craving made her feel. The soft new flesh flowed into the space between her fingers and bubbled up and down in step with her stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching from the kitchen Window as her daughter trudged to the bus stop with such difficulty. Helen frowned at the amount of resistance Violet seemed to be putting up against simple enjoyment of such wonderful food and the grief she was putting herself through for it. Helen stretched her arms to the coffee pot to pour herself a new cup. She spooned in almost half the cup full of sugar and added a thick glop of cream before grabbing a candy bar to stir the mixture with. As Helen watched her poor daughter disappear out of sight the bus came rolling down the street breaks wailing as it came to a stop at the corner for her. A moment later there was a burst of wind through the house as Dash bolted for the front door and down the street to continently emerge from behind parked car as if her had been waiting there all along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bus Violet silently moved to the back finding an empty seat. Her friends noticed her pass but couldn't get her attention as she took a seat further back than she typically did. Placing her bag beside Her Violet tried desperately to clear her mind before she reached school but for some reason she swore she could <i>smell</i> the burritos still as well as cheese and bacon! The smell made Violet's mouth moisten. Every few minuets she had to wipe her sleeve across her lips as her mind kept wandering into food filled daydreams and she would forget to swallow the torrent of drool she was producing at just the thought of food coupled with the heavenly scents she couldn't seem to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride on the bus was miserable and agonizing for violet. Her stomach starting rumbling low and softly regardless of the two or three burritos that should have been digesting in there. However the more vivid and tempting her daydreams became the louder and louder her belly roared. By time the bus was within sight of the school's flag pole Violet's stomach was making kids as far away as the front seat look around in curiosity for the source of the rumbling. Once the bus pulled into the drop off circle around the side of school Violet bolted for the front door her backpack trailing behind her. Violet's stomach was growling with such ferocity it both sounded and looked like a puma exploding out of the bus as the dark haired girl tried to avoid the stares of her classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet moved as swiftly as she could to the second floor hallway where she could have more privacy as most students remained on the first floor to converse until first bell. Violet burst into the girl's restroom and checked the stalls for anyone who might be there already. Once she was sure she had the room to herself Violet stuck her head in one of the sinks and started turned the faucet on full blast. Violet gulped and chugged the water as fast as she could trying to fill her stomach to quiet it. The water was bland and possessed none of the rich flavors she was craving so desperately. A feeling of disgust seemed to fill Violet along with the water, as if she couldn't stand something so simple and dull using up stomach space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when she had consumed enough water to make her belly press tightly into her shirt as it swelled and moved fabric aside the hunger pangs only dulled slightly, yet the intensity of her appetite only grew. Yet Violet achieved the effect she had hoped, her stomach's rumbles had grown considerably softer and what little was left seemed to mute itself in the fluid. Violet lifted her head up to examine herself in the mirror. Her face was flush and looked damp, At first Violet assumed it was just the water from the sink but as she calmed down she realized she felt slightly saturated all over. She lifted her shirt's collar and looked down across her skin. This was no cold sweat of panic, the brief exertion she had preformed from the bus to the restroom had tired her out more so than it should have and heated her to the point her body was sweating. Violet's legs were weak and she was feeling exhausted all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet would have liked to take moment to rest but the sound of the first bell pierced her mental veil and brought her back to reality. Violet stared dumbstruck at the door to the restroom her mouth slacked and she tried to recall what her first class was. Her mind was slow to start as she tried to clear her focus. It was Monday so today was her A schedule. Violet knew that, why was it so hard to recall right now? Violet was a bright girl, she had some of the top grades of her class, were these changes affecting her mind as well? Violet rubbed her temple slick with sweat, She's a Sophomore in high school so a block schedule should be second nature to her by now, she was probably just stress about the events of this morning is all. Violet quieted her mind and it came to her, A schedule, Monday, first period was...</span></div></div>",

Violet looked down at her ever softening form and the sweat that clung to her body. If she got winded from a mere walk from the bus what would gym class do to her? Still she figured some exercise might be good for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe locker room was filled with Violet's fellow seniors, some of them sniffing as their noses caught a rank stench coming from Violet as she passed by them. Violet quickly changed into her gym outfit, thankful that her clothes still managed to fit her, even if her tummy was pooching out a fair bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later she was out on the hardwood floor, waiting for the instructions from her teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright class we're going to be doing some good old fashioned laps today. Get your rears in gear and give me ten laps around the basketball court!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more eager students complied at once while the slackers merely rolled their eyes and started on a light jog.

But she had hardly made it halfway around the court before she stopped, stooping over and holding her knees, panting heavily as sweat stains started to appear underneath her armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet didn't have time to notice them however, as the teacher's whistle echoed throughout the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a move on Parr!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eighteen year old then resumed her run, her breathing becoming heavier and heavier the farther she managed to put one foot in front of the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile with Helen....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oven dinged right as Helen managed to scarf down some of her breakfast burritos, the increasingly slobby super getting up and waddling towards the kitchen. Opening the oven, the smell of the freshly baked brownies wafted towards her nose and she started to drool. Once they were out of the oven and cooled down, she snatched up two and shoved them into her mouth, chewing with abandon as flecks of the treat landed on her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she cared of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better eat something else. Don't want to waste all of these,\" Helen said aloud. It wasn't from some diet that those words came. Helen had crushed some of the onions she still had from the hot dog those kind women had given her earlier and sprinkled them over the brownie mix. A plate was all that she needed and maybe to clean herself up just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she'd be ready to go to her neighbors, the only ones usually home at this time of day housewives and mothers like herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped they'd all love her brownies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a massive fart and scratching her ever increasing ass, Helen went to take a bit of a nap before heading out to spread some of the lovely food she had been introduced on her vacation.</span></div></div>",

As Helen looked at her food she had prepared and got an idea. If she couldnt get to Violet her friends could. Helen knew that Violets two best friends mothers lived just down the street. Helen decided to pick up her conventions and walk over to their houses. Helen left the house in the same pair of clothes she had been wearing for the last couple of days. Her plain white t-shirt had multiple food stains and wet arm pit stains which let off bad BO. Her elastic pants were not much better they were stretched to their limit with a wet stain right along her butt crack. Helen bring a slob didnt care as she arrived at the first house. She gave knock on the door and waited. Julie the mom of Violets first friend opened the door. Julie was a blonde woman who was slightly overweight. She had been beautiful when she was young but let herself go after having a couple kids. Julie took a moment to recognize who this fat smelly women was but then recognized her face. Helen oh hi how are you doing she said a little awkwardly. She placed her hand on her nose to try and stop the smell that was coming from Helen. Hi Julie I just wanted get someone to try my food that I have been cooking. Julie personally just wanted Helen to leave but then she could smell beyond Helens body odor to smell the Food Helen was carrying. Julie stomach rumbled, she was on a diet and had not eaten anything in a while. Ok Helen Ill help you out Julie said but only for a little while Betty is coming over. Good that cuts down my work Helen thought to herself. Betty was the mother of Violets other friend. Helen placed down her food and got out a bowel of cookies.</span></div></div>",

A fuzzy feeling seemed to surround this daydream as if it was a comforting place to be surrounded by such sweet dishes. Violet shook her head and sent specks of saliva flying as she erased these images from her head. \"No!\" she steeled herself, home ec. was about the cooking not the wonderful delicious food they would be making. Violet snatched her book bag from the sink and held it to her chest as she hurried out the door and down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes Violet was stammering into home ec. her legs feeling like jelly after the dash to class. It wasn't terribly far but Violet was winded and worn out already considering she hadn't sat since she disembarked the bus in such a panic. Violet took her seat near the front like the good over achiever she was and wiped the sweat from her brow. A few more students filtered in and the last bell rang before the teacher stood and began her lesson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning everyone!\" Ms. Elderbrook chimed happily as she stood before them. She was a kind teacher, 5' 5\" short light colored hair and a pair of pointy tipped glasses styled to look like like they were from the 50s. She was reasonably thin, she had been fairly petite when she took the position but with all the cookies and fudge and brownies she had to taste every period every day she had developed a small pot belly despite her daily trips to the gym to combat it. \"Today is the day we put those skills to the test hmm?\" She smiled brightly and started passing out recipe guides. \"We will be each making a dish every day this week to present for the school bake sale this coming Saturday! Each of you will be making something different on each day I have you so we aren't all using the same cooking utensils at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet being one of the brighter students of the class as assigned to the role of lead cook for her group and got the sheet of what they would be preparing today. Violet's mouth filled with drool once more as she read the title \"Marble Fudge Cake\". A sharp class sounded through the class room as Ms, Elderbrook opened the curtain that separated the classroom from the kitchen ushering the children to stand and start cooking. Violet stared hard at the tantalizing image of the dish they were to prepare printed on the paper before her. Violet's group was already waiting for her when she got there eager to find out which dish they would be making today. Violet meekly handed over the paper slightly relived to to have it out of her sight for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy these are really good!\" Ashley exclaimed as she took the paper and showed it to the other two girls Violet was paired with. Ashley was blond with a red hair band parting her bangs from the rest of her hair, a little short but a well developed body already showing the promising curves she had developed and not an ounce of fat on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but they are hard to make!\" Ginger frowned putting a hand on her hip \"Marbling the fudge just right without mixing it too much can be a challenge\" Ginger was a bit taller than the other girls with long brown hair down to the small of her back which she kept combed nice and straight and a large pair of round glasses to frame her face, like Ashley not an ounce of fat was to be found on her, if not for her modest B cup chest she would have looked as thin as a rail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I wish we could have a slice!\" Suzie giggled looking at the picture. Suzie was the largest of the 4, just under 180 pounds she looked plumper than she was due to her height being about as tall as Ashley. She had curly black hair she kept styled somewhat erratically as was her style of being slightly different from most girls with a hair band with a bow on it and large hoop ear rings and a sticker shaped like a star on one of her chubby cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this time Suzie\" Ashley smiled at their friend \"Ms Elderbrook would throw a fit if we ate the food for the bake sale\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I know\" Suzie smiled back wishing she hadn't made the remark because of her status as the fat girl in the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get the pan for the cake so we can start, Violet you're better at chocolate than we are, I guess you can handle the fudge\" Ginger said as she turned away from the work station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls split up taking to their roles as Ashley and Suzie rounded up the ingredients and Ginger got the pots together. Violet tried to keep her focus on the work ahead as she started grabbing blocks of chocolate and breaking them up to put into her melting pot. Violet stared longingly as the creamy swirls of chocolate as she stirred the pot. Violet was hypnotized by the brown spiral before her, she just kept adding more and more blocks of it her focus growing more and more on the creamy goodness before her. Without realizing it Violet had melted nearly 5 blocks of chocolate when all she needed was 1 and a half for this recipe. Violet started to panic as the pot was almost too full in danger of spilling over as she stirred the chocolate to keep it from burning. Violet looked around to make sure everyone was distracted by their cooking, Ms. Elderbrook was showing one of the other students how to whisk a batch of lemon bar crust without throwing the flour and sugar everywhere as she added the butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet grabbed a spoon and dipped a large glob from the pot and tried to dump it back into the wax paper wrapper the bar had come from but most of it stuck to the spoon as the glob had begun to harden as soon as it came in contact with the cool spoon and left the larger pot of warm chocolate. Only a small dab hung off the spoon onto the wax paper. Violet bit her lip, she tried to use her other hand to brush it off but it just stuck to her fingers instead and the large pot overfilled with chocolate was in danger of burning what was on the bottom without constant stirring. Violet without thinking just jammed the spoon in her mouth and slid the chocolate off with ease with her tongue. Violet was washed over by that fuzzy feeling again as the chocolate melted in her mouth. It was so comforting the stress of her huge error seemed miles away and Violet's body relaxed the tension flowing out of her as food came to comfort her. Her hand didn't need to be told twice as she dipped it in the pot again and took another spoonful, then another and another. Violet's mind was at total peace and she didn't even worry about eating all the extra chocolate, she would find an excuse for it all be missing later, it wasn't important to her right now. Spoon full by spoon full Violet literally ate her problem away. Violet was so absorbed by her chocolate induced daze she wasn't paying any attention to anything else...</span></div></div>",

She looked over Ginger's shoulder at the cake batter she was mixing and gave her a nod of approval. Turning she looked to the stove where Violet was still savoring her chocolate daydreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember constant stirring is the key to creamy chocolate Violet\" she sang as she stepped up next to the young heroine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill ran down Violet's spine as her teacher moved in next to her and looked over the work station before her. First Ms. Elderbrook took a good look at the chocolate pan before her with a critical eye, noticing the pithy amount of chocolate still left at her station. Violet cringed slightly as Ms. Elderbrook began scrutinizing the empty wrappers of the chocolate blocks, looking for the rest but not finding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Violet...\" She paused counting the wrappers \"How many of these did you use...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, you know...\" Violet tripped all over herself trying to regain her composure. \"That is I... the chocolate... I used...\" Violet's mind raced for a way out \"I... used what the recipe called for!\" slipped out of Violet's mouth as her stomach twisted into a knot and her body numbed with coldness. She knew there was no way to hide her crime and flat out lying was suddenly a less attractive option now that she heard how absurd it sounded coming out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But your pan clearly has more than amount called for by the recipe\" Ms. Elderbrook tilted her head slightly and opened her book to the recipes for that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three bars\" Violet blurted out not even thinking before she spoke, her lack of a defense just left her on auto pilot. \"That's how much I used when I bake this with my mom, I guess I didn't really pay attention to the recipe.\" Violet trembled with nothing to hide behind but her flimsy story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" the young teacher thoughtfully mused. \"You probably baked a layer cake with your Mom, I'm not sure how well this recipe would come out if all that chocolate was added...it would probably be inedible!\" Violet leaped onto her teacher's comment for dear life. Feigning surprise, Violet put her hand to her cheek. \"Oh! That's right, I completely got the recopies mixed up in my head, we baked a layer cake just last week!\" <br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nViolet emerged from Home Ec with her shoulders slumped and her head in the clouds. There was no way Miss Elderbook didn't pick up on some serious hesitation, and her friends, while more dismissive of the missing chocolate, definitely shot her some looks that inquired of her mental health when she explained the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her horror, Violet found her concentration growing even fuzzier despite her sudden gluttony. A moment after sitting down, Violet could have sworn she smelled some sort of savory aroma wafting from nearby. At the end of English class, Violet had taken all of three lines of notes, then had proceeded to sketch a heaping plate of eggs and bacon as Hamlet's character synopsis. Realizing this as the bell rang, Violet cursed herself under her breath. <i>\"I need an A on this exam and I spent a half hour zoned out! Home ec isn't a big deal but if I mess up on this it's going to wreck my average!\"</i> Violet left the classroom anxious, ignoring that she was doing quite well in English and pretty much every other class. Violet wouldn't harp about it to her friends or parents, but she took a quiet but intense pride in her rather high average. While lapsing on a single test would barely affect it, Violet did not achieve her high marks in the first place through complacency. She would have to hit the books hard tonight, and then after that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet's friends finally tracked her down; Violet had blown past their lunch table, clearly worried about something, emerged from the lunch line with a plate heaped with mashed potatoes and chicken fingers, sat at the closest available table, and began tearing into her meal as if she hadn't eaten in days. They gossiped amongst themselves as they watched her and had their plans of going up to her and asking what was wrong foiled as she dashed back into the lunch line as they approached. When Violet returned, she had yet another plate of food, and the look on her face was enough to make them decide it was best not to break her concentration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but if she took the time to read the last act tonight, would she be able to work all of her geometry problems? Not that her mom would care in her current state...what was up with mom anyway? What time was it? <br>\r\nViolet realized she had been daydreaming again. <i>\"It must be time for lunch.\"</i> she thought. Glancing up at the clock in the hallway, her jaw dropped. Everything clicked into place. She had taken her lunch period...and overeaten. \"But...I'm <i>starving!</i>\" Violet whispered to herself. That was when the smell hit her again. She stopped cold, wheeled around searching for a source, then, eyes widening, Violet tore off her backpack and unzipped both compartments. Despite being nearly a half day old, the smell of the breakfast her Mother had stealthily packed for her was both strong and inviting. Violet noticed a little drool had fallen from her lips into her bag as she loomed over it, her belly pressing gently against the fabric of her sweater as she hunched over. Well aware that she had just eaten over twice the amount of food she normally did during lunch, Violet grabbed the paper bag from her backpack, grabbed the bookbag with her other hand, then sprinted off into the nearest girls' bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere where eight foodstuffs wrapped in foil and a thermos inside the paper lunch bag. Violet ripped open one of the smaller looking packages to find an extremely large cheeseburger. Despite being loaded with bacon, the sandwich held together in her hands, glued in place by generous amounts of lard. Violet inhaled deeply, knowing deep down that this meal would be different from cafeteria food; it smelled....real. It would fulfill her crazy appetite...for better or for worse. As her teeth sunk into the oily buns, an image of her mother, obese and gluttonous, too fat to do more than waddle around and eat, ran through her head, but the taste of the burger quickly rendered her powerless. She found her pace picking up, and unlike the cafeteria food, which she was shoveling down to fill the void of her hunger, Violet was enjoying every last bite of her current meal. After devouring her second course, a positively overstuffed breakfast wrap packed full of sausage and cheddar, Violet rapidly unscrewed the thermos. Hoping for soda, Violet was pleasantly surprised to find a milkshake. Despite the beverage being nearly as thick as molasses, Violet gulped down a quarter-thermos, tasting whipped cream and peanut-butter, finishing the motion with a refreshed \"Aaaah!\" For the first time since breakfast, Violet felt her stomach start to fill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPositively flushed with pleasure and eager to enjoy the rest of her meal, Violet dashed into a bathroom stall, snapped the lid of the toilet down, and sat down to eat. However, before she could get very far into her next lard-bacon cheeseburger, she noticed she had begun to sweat; the heavy sweater she had worn from home to cover her new belly flab was a slightly weather-inappropriate. Ripping off the annoying garment, Violet noticed that the what tank top she had on under it had ridden up over her stomach. It also showed a bit of her newly developed cleavage. Violet cared extremely little about how unflattering her outfit was, however. Even as bits of ketchup, milkshake, and greasy egg dropped onto her shirt, Violet had not the slightest care for her appearance. By the time she neared the end of her meal, Violet's face had reddened and her perspiration had started up once more, indifferent to her scantily clad state. Sticking the last bit of cheeseburger bun into the thermos to sop up any remaining peanut-buttery indulgence, Violet finished her meal. She felt almost full, and totally satisfied. She brought a greasy hand to her now distended gut and caressed her midriff, more than a little relieved to not hear it roaring with hunger. Her greasy fingers coated her gut with an oily sheen, which, in Violet's hazy opinion, felt extremely nice. She sat there for a few moments, rubbing and admiring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n((( <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/2223/violet.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/2223/violet.jpg</a> ))) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet tried her best to get herself on her feet and out of the bathroom so she wouldn't miss more than half of her biology class. A smile on her face for the first time that day, Violet began to head down the hallway to the stairs, letting a little pent-up gas out with a belch. Her mind began to clear, and as Violet felt the slightest prick of a hunger pang returning, she began to wonder if she was forgetting something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Violet saw Miss Elderbrook staring at her, very perplexed, from across the hall...and when she realized she had forgotten to put her sweater back on.</span></div></div>",

A tense moment passed before Violet leaned forward and quickly tried to sprint away. Her packed gut bounced painfully up and down and she could feel the fabric of her sweatpants begin to make contact with itself between her thighs but Violet had no explanation to give to her teacher so she simply ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Elderbrook watched concerned as Violet started to run. She was worried why Violet had behaved so strangely in class earlier and now seeing her come out the bathroom flushed, covered in sweat, and a total mess, she was certain something was amiss with her pupil. Ms. Elderbrook called out to Violet and tried to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet ducked around the corner, what was she going to do? Violet looked around for an escape but the hall stretched on classrooms on either side. Where could she go? If Ms. Elderbrook followed her she had nowhere to hide. Glancing over her shoulder Violet found that indeed her teacher was giving chase, again Ms. Elderbrook called out for her to wait. Violet had to get away, eventually her pursuit would draw attention and more people would see what a wreck she was. Violet cursed herself for giving into indulgence like she had. Now she was caught in a bind and exposed for everyone to see what she had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a light bulb went off in her head. 'That's it!' She thoughtlessly said aloud. If people couldn't see her, then her appearance wouldn't be an issue. Violet dashed for the next corner and cut into an alcove behind a row of lockers. Violet yanked her shirt over her head as fast as she could and stuffed it into her book bag with the greasy bag her food ad been in. Her bra and pants quickly followed as well as her shoes and socks. As crazy as it seemed Violet sat in the secluded row of lockers naked as the day she was born. Hearing Ms. Elderbrook's footsteps draw near Violet tossed her bookbag onto the top of the lockers and held her breath as she used her powers to render herself invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Elderbrook neared the lockers and looked down the aisle as she passed. Violet was no longer in front of her so she must have been hiding in here. But even as she passed within just a few feet of the poor naked girl she still could not find her. Ms. Elderbrook continued searching as she left Violet behind and moved on to another hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet gasped for air as she exhaled finally, the chase had been so difficult she was red as a tomato now and more than out of breath. Violet retrieved her bookbag from atop the lockers despite her body crying out for a long break. However as she pulled them back out she found they were in worse condition now than before. Her shirt was crinkled and stained through and through with grease from the paperbag. What was worse the thermos leaked specks of peanutbutter and chocolate milkshake all over her pants and underwear. As Violet redressed she was a total mess with stain and grease from head to toe. There was no was she could go to her last 2 classes of the day like this. Violet took a look around to see if Ms. Elderbrook was still nearby and made a dash for the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nIt hadn't been easy, Violet had to hide outside near the bus stop until school let out. Fortune had smiled upon her and the buses were there before the bell rang so she was able to get in and move to the back before any possible classmates could see her. Violet rode until the bus came to her street and almost as fast as her brother ran down the alise and around the house on the corner never letting anyone get a good look at her exposed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Home Violet was exhausted. She slumped down on the couch and sighed, worn out. Hearing the door open Helen knew her kids must be home. No sooner had Violet fallen into the embrace of the couch cushion, her mother entered the living room with a tray of greasy pizza rolls and cheese fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright mom!\" Dash shouted \"After school snacks!\" He hopped up and down excited to see a change in the usual 'healthy' options their mother gave for snacks. But before he could zip over to the tray Helen stretched the tray up to the ceiling far from his reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Dash this is for Violet\" Helen smiled at her energetic son. \"But there's money on the counter in the kitchen. Why don't you run to the store and pick yourself out something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting fudgey bombs!\" Dash yelled as the blur vanished into the kitchen and out the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go sweetie. A nice snack to help you recharge after a long day at school\" Helen softly smiled at Violet. There was quite a bit of pride in Helen's voice, looking at her Daughter in the food stained tank top and belly poking out from under it seemed like as big of an accomplishment as the straight A's Violet always had on her report card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet's mind seemed to wash over with contentment seeing the tray before her. Without hesitation she leaned forward pressing her pot belly into a jelly roll and grabbed a handful of both the pizza rolls and fries in each hand. Violet let the fries rest on her stomach as she used her free hand to pick pizza rolls up and pop them in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen as so happy to see her daughter eat that she reached down and gave the meager hints of love handles on either side of Violet's tummy a playful squeeze. \"You've been such a good girl I'm making a special treat for you tonight!' Helen beamed and happily returned to the kitchen her flab shaking in step with her swift stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet looked back at the fries on her belly and started picking them off and gobbling them down. But in the back of her head she knew it wasn't her. As the last stick of fried potato left her belly leaving behind a string of half melted cheese that tried to cling to both the fry and her belly at the same time Violet took a good measure of her surroundings. Violet looked across her torso, she had slumped back when she began eating and could see the landscape of food stains that was her messy tank top with the cheese covered hill in the distance that was her belly. It was both captivating and terrifying at the same time. Violet's mixed emotions whirled about in her head. Violet looked around at the room, empty plates and discarded candy wrappers seemed to occupy every surface in the living room, every food item Helen had eaten in the last several days left behind some form of stain or packaging she had yet to clean up. And before her the tantalizing tray of fattening foods beaconed to her. Violet shut her eyes and tried to focus, why was she letting herself pig out on this crap?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet rolled onto her feet and tried to stand. Her tired legs protested but she forced the effort into them and stood. Against better judgment Violet grabbed a few more pizza rolls and jogged up the steps away from further temptation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen Helen had picked up the phone and dialed the number given to her by the two lovely women she had met outside the grocery store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi I would like to get some more products shipped to me from the city we spoke about yesterday\" Helen let her free hand put a few chili dogs in the microwave. \"Yes, I'd like to order some supplies to make a nice big dinner for my daughter.\" Helen shoved some cookies in her mouth while she waited on the microwave. \"It's sort of a reward for... well it's difficult to explain but, I'm really proud of how she's let herself loosen up lately ya know? I don't know why but I really am proud the improvement her attitude has taken lately.\" Helen's finger taped the counter impatiently as the microwave continued to spin her chili dogs around and around before her. \"Really? That's wonderful thank you so much! Yes it would be perfect for her! Thank you again\" Helen hung up the phone delighted, she didn't know why but the ladies seemed to take special interest in the reward she had for her daughter. Just then the microwave let out a ding.</span></div></div>",

But this reprieve lasted only a few hours, as a smell suddenly came to Violet's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffing, her nostrils flaring as she recognized the scent, Violet's growing stomach let out a growl. Swiftly shutting her open book, Violet got to her feet, images of the food waiting downstairs for her overpowering the conflicting part of her mind that told her to stop. Heading downstairs, she soon rounded the corner to find her mother, all two hundred and some odd pounds of her blocking Violet's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry Violet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet nodded, Helen pleased at the gleam in her eye and the not so little amount of drool spilling from her lips. Helen then moved aside and Violet approached the table, a wide grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her favorite food: spaghetti!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't drenched in grease or appeared any more fattening than regular spaghetti but the scent...the scent went a long way in increasing Violet's hunger as she took in the creamy looking tomato sauce and the carefully arranged meatballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot waiting any longer, Violet grabbed a fork, swirled up some noddles, and shoved it into her mouth. She didn't just plow through this bite in one go though, wanting to savor the hearty pasta, biting down and not caring a whit as some of it fell onto her tank top, adding more food to the already ruined article of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen watched as Violet plowed through the spaghetti, all the while eating her own meal of chili dogs and cheesy bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so proud of her daughter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet was stuffed. Somehow she had managed to eat every bit of food her mother had given her, explaining her belly's current imitation of the globe. Groaning, Violet opened her mouth but the only thing that came out was a belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen, rubbing her much larger stomach, chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so cute Vi, but don't hold it back. I know you have more in there!\" Helen then preceded to let loose an even louder belch, the mother of three farting after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet was about to follow her mother's example when those conflicting thoughts from earlier in the day returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasn't this wrong? Wasn't she ruining her life by acting like this? Why was her mother so slovenly in her ways now? And why was she following after her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen watched, a bit concerned, as Violet's expression went from painfully sated to concerned. Stretching out an arm, she rubbed Violet's stomach slowly, her mind already working up a solution to erase her daughter's concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wrong Violet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" Violet asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still have plenty of room for dessert!\"</span></div></div>",

Getting up, she rubbed her sleep-crusted eyes. Something felt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, she gasped as she noticed the newly gained weight from the previous night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of her wanted to scream. Another part of her wasn't that discouraged by the gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the latter part that eventually won out and Violet got out of bed, deciding to not change out of her pajamas or take a shower that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was always tomorrow after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way to the kitchen Violet heard something sizzling along with a heady aroma of bacon. Her mom greeted her with a loud belch and Violet couldn't help but notice the weight her mother had gained as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning sweetie! Don't worry about school, I called and explained that you'd be taking the rest of the week off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet knew she should be concerned about missing that much school, her being senior and all, but she found herself shrugging her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom. What are you making?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"French fries, bacon, hamburgers, hot dogs, and I think I put some burritos in the microwave,\" Helen answered, leaning over to fart loudly. She brought a hand filled with chips to her mouth and chewed nosily before grabbing an even bigger handful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen grinned at Violet's enthusiasm and soon had the table groaning under the amount of food, including several pies from those nice women at the supermarket the other day. Sitting beside her daughter, Helen soon dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hours later....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen extended her right arm and rubbed Violet's stuffed belly, coaxing louder and louder belches from her daughter's bloated frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my Violet,\" Helen encouraged, letting loose a series of farts and belches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach woman, thanks to the odd food from the supermarket, had gained twenty pounds, Helen's weight going to her butt and belly while Violet's breasts and belly had increased in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the life,\" Violet said before farting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage started with the flight records.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Mrs. Incredible's plane had crashed there had to have been a record of it somewhere. But so far she had no such luck. Sighing, the former henchwoman decided a lunch break was in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage was currently in the same town as Mrs. Incredible, doing exactly as the Agency had suggested she do. Oddly enough the rest of the women in Helen's neighborhood had been steadily gaining weight as well. Something sinister was at work, Mirage was sure of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was still hungry so she decided to get some food from a hot dog vendor. This particular vendor was quite obese and had brunette hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'll you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One hot dog please, no toppings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming right up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Mirage was handed several minutes later was a hot dog loaded with onions, relish, and plenty of mustard and ketchup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked for a plain hot dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. It would be such a waste to throw that away, wouldn't it? If you have that one I'll give you your original order for free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage thought about it for a moment and finally nodded, biting into the dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished it, she didn't notice the gleam in the vendor's eyes. What she did notice, however, was how hungry she was all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later Mirage went back to her hotel room, several hot dogs in her hands. The vendor walked towards a black van and knocked in a specific way. The door opened and the brunette smiled at her blond coworker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPFFFFFFT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man that was torture to hold it in that long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but your sacrifice paid off. Now that woman should be on her way to slobdom. And our tracks can remain hidden. Now how about we have our own lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"</span></div></div>",

She sat at the computer in the house they had built for themselves in the middle of empty space, and rather than working with her human counterparts to fight Jack Noir, she was busy rolling dice around in her hand and searching through the history of John, the human who she had been chatting with his entire life. She noticed one thing coming up over and over, his pure hatred for Betty Crocker. She had no idea who this witch could possibly have been that could cause such mayhem. She searched through the history of humans and found something surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just some 8kery?\" she said in confusion, stunned to find that this accursed Betty Crocker was just some company that made cakes. Then again human food was so disgustingly sweet and sticky that who knows, maybe it had been the cause of great disgust to those who ate it. Vriska looked back at the other trolls, each at their own computer, and Vriska had long since realized she had no need for them. She had a plan to take out Jack, and it didn't require any of them. She grinned as she looked at her dice, which had the ability to manipulate her powers and even reality itself. If she rolled an 8 on all of them, then perhaps she could have some fun and expose them to the evil that was Betty Crocker before she got rid of each of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVriska rolled her dice, all eight of them clinked against the floor and rolled across the metallic floor. Each of the trolls looked up and noticed that Vriska was planning something, but it was too late, the dice all slowly stopped their rolling. The first came up an 8, followed by another, then another, and another. Vriska was known as the Thief of Light, because of how she had stolen all the luck she needed to make sure that all her rolls came out how she wanted. Only four more and they came up 8.... 8..... 8......... 1? Vriska couldn't believe it, how could one of them not have come up an 8? In fact not just an 8, but a 1? She then looked up from the die and saw that her sister, the blind Seer Terezi, had stopped the die prematurely with her cane. She smiled and licked her lips, not knowing what Vriska was going for, but knowing that she had stopped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of blue light and suddenly Vriska, Terezi, Feferi, Nepeta, Kanaya, and Aradia found themselves transported away from their base, and they were inside of a giant factory that smelled of creamy deserts.</span></div></div>",

Caught by surprise, Vriska was pinned to the floor by her sleeves. Terezi glared at her, revenge showing through her crimson glasses. She had been tolerance of Vriska's repeated injustices, but this was the last straw. The Thief had a smug grin on her face, almost daring her \"sister\" to kill her. But death was too good for her. The Seer had something better in Mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer comrades, however, were notably less interested. Aradia had already warped away, abandoning what she believed a doomed timeline. Nepeta and Feferi, forgiving almost to the point of obliviousness, were discussing how they planned to escape the factory. Kanaya, though, had to make a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding an exit was the main priority, but she had a lot of pent-up feelings towards Vriska, and what Terezi was planning seemed like the perfect opportunity to vent them.

Terezi was surprised at Kanaya's interest, but welcomed the assistance. \"GO OV3R 4ND K33P H3R MOUTH OP3N\" the blind girl replied, wandering to the side with a sense of motive. Kanaya went to Vriska and complied with Terezi's orders.

Quickly, she began to pry it open as both Kanaya and Vriska watched intently. With a snap and a creak, it opened to reveal a five-foot-tall rack of baking trays, each tray holding 24 freshly baked cupcakes topped with creamy chocolate frosting. Terezi wheeled the rack over to Vriska's awaiting maw, chuckling to herself at Vriska's face as the aroma of the confections hit her nose, juxtaposing the Thief between fear and delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying anything, Terezi picked up one of the fatty pastries and shoved it into Vriska's mouth. Vriska struggled all over her body as she was forced to chew the alien confections. Kanaya watched her face as she swallowed, getting a pleasurable satisfaction. this cupcake alone had caused Vriska's stomach to bloat significantly, but nobody noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVriska paused as she thought to herself: she loved it!

Ravenously she scarfed down the confections, getting frosting strewn across her face as Terezi and Vriska watched dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay,\" Terezi said cautiously, \"These human foods are clearly not as torturous as I predicted.\" She sniffed the air again, an upset frown taking place of her devious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerezi 'looked' back at Vriska. She still hadn't stopped. \"Kanaya, you keep an eye on the spiderbitch, I'm going to find some of this stuff to try for myself.\" Still silent from shock, Kanaya focused her gaze on Vriska's oblivious feast as Terezi wandered off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a few minutes, Vriska had gone through dozens of the treats and had yet to come up for air. Kanaya was powerless to stop her, and was more fascinated at the already-visible effects of the binge. Her belly had expanded much more, riding her black shirt up and straining on the button of her jeans. Her chest bulbs were even bigger than normal, rounding out to at least a DD-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVriska's rear was sticking out at Kanaya as she ate, and had grown about twice its original size, fitting super-tightly in her jeans. Every now and then, the oversized asscheeks would rip a long, raunchy fart, hitting Kanaya at point-blank range. She felt she should be disgusted by Vriska's gas, but for some reason, each whiff of the butt fumes simply made her hungrier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blueblood emerged, cheeks full of flavor. She turned to Kanaya and belched loudly, splattering her face with half-chewed bits of cake. Before the jade-blood could so much as flinch, Vriska fell to the floor tired and bloated. Lethargically sitting up against some crates, Vriska unbuttoned her jeans, freeing her now-sizeable gut. Vriska moaned in relief, rubbing her big gray belly with one arm and lifting her buttcheek with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PFFFFFFFFTTTTTTTT!\" The tailwind from that blast was enough to dishevel Kanaya's hair. The gas was almost intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes shifted from the remaining cupcakes to the contented Vriska...</span></div></div>",

She opens it the same way she opened the last one, and is taken aback by the sight that greeted her nose.A large, three-layered cake covered entirely in bright red icing and dark red laces of frosting was standing before her. A small amount of drool slips out the side of her mouth, getting wiped off by her sleeve as soon as she notices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached the cake cautiously, desperately trying to keep her composure as she pinched off a sample, its crimson scent taunting Terezi's sensitive nose.<br>\r\nSlowly, she places the piece of cake on her tongue...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flavor surged through her body, leaving Terezi awestruck in sensual pleasure. With hardly any thought, she dove into the cake with her tongue protruding anxiously. She began shovel the cake into her eager mouth, smearing frosting around the area of her face. Between mouthfuls, she would either burp or moan in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious Crockercorp food already went to work on Terezi's body. Her belly bloated like beach ball, although almost surpassing the size of one. Her breasts expanded to about two or three cup sizes and was now stretching the symbol on her black shirt, accentuating the icing stains. Her hourglass figure had evolved into a big, wide booty, each cheek bigger than an Earth basketball, and with juicier thighs to match. Her black sweatpants could barely contain Terezi's newly-enlarged butt, small tears in the seams forming forming as she farted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerezi chuckled. She had always been fairly \"loose\" about her gas, often unleashing squeaky SBD's during a conversation and laughing mischievously when the other party smelled it. Now, though, her farts were far more potent and loud, and she loved it. Terezi bit her lower lip and ripped another fart, this one sounding like a motorcycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FFFRRTT-RRTT-RRTT-RRTT-RRRTT</b>. The tears were stretched by the errant vibrations of her plump, gray asscheeks. Terezi sighed with relief and began to lick up the last remnants of the once-towering pastry. She rubbed her gut and gave it a squeeze, forcing out a sudden belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSluggishly, she got up and half-waddled back to where she left the other two...</span></div></div>",

Eyes widening, she looked around and noticed other students all dressed in Hogwart's robes but she couldn't recognize any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer last clear memory had been of falling asleep with Ron at their flat. A smell came to her nose then and she gagged a little. Each and every one of the students were hugely fat and stunk something fierce. Flatulence and belches rang out like a hallelujah choir and Hermione was about to speak when she felt a someone staring at her. Looking up, she saw Mrs. Weasley with her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon's mother was extremely obese and had food stains all over her robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Weasley-\" but Hermione was cut off by the matriarch burping in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione, you need to gain some weight, you're far too thin! And as teacher of this class at our beloved Slobwart's School we're going to do our best to make you the fattest, messiest, laziest, and smelliest witches of your generation!\" Taking out her wand, Mrs. Weasley swished it at Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing the bookworm knew a large banquet had appeared on her table, all the foods incredibly greasy and most of them rotting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione felt her stomach rumble and she picked up a donut, biting into it and moaning at the incredible taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the donut was finished, Hermione felt her stomach rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPFFFFT! The fart that wafted from her was the loudest and smelliest Hermione had ever made. Blushing fiercely, she was about to apologize when she felt her stomach pooch out, her once slender stomach now a cute little pot belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, isn't that precious! Your assignment is to eat all the food on your desk, understand?\"</span></div></div>",

Always leaning towards the plump side, she was now weighed down with colossal saddlebag hips, a noticeable belly-apron that was tucked into a house skirt that Hermione figured to be larger than her bedsheets , and upper arms that were much wider around than Hermione's waist. She was noticeably huffing and puffing; the extra weight made even standing a chore, it looked like. Aside from the weight, Hermione noticed with disgust that the normally cleanliness-obsessed Mrs. Weasely was sporting extremely large sweat stains under her armpits and where rolls of fat pinched at her clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione glanced down at her newly chubbified stomach. \"Is this some sort of hex?! It can't be- I would have read about it somewhere! I demand an explanation for this, Mrs. Weasely!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione got a sweet smile as a reply, then a \"Just eat a little bit more, sweetheart, and you'll be so hooked you won't care about the particulars! Give your overworked brain a chance to relax for once!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione saw with horror that Mrs. Weasley wasn't trying to be manipulative; she honestly believed that Hermione needed to be fattened up and that being piggish was good! Hermione reached for her wand, but found that it was missing. Mrs. Weasely scowled and put her hands on her meaty hips. Hermione saw her hands sink in to them several inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now dear if you aren't going to be a good girl I'm going to have to make you!\" She held out her wand and announced in a clear voice, \"Accio Books!\" Hermione saw some of her favorite textbooks fly in from another room in the school. Hermione wondered if they took her belongings and brought them into a room at this new school when they abducted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Weasely brought her wand to a history textbook and tapped it. The book's shape quivered, then melted completely, reforming into a plate of hot dogs. \"Each and every one of your books will get turned into something useful if you don't stop being so silly, young lady!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione's jaw dropped- her books! There were few things she loved more in the world. Hermione collected herself when Mrs. Weasely turned one of her favorite books of spells into a gigantic ham. As the mammoth woman extended a hand towards another beautiful, leather-bound tome, Hermione shouted out.<br>\r\n\"STOP!\" Without giving herself time to take back her decision, Hermione reached down and grabbed a greasy chicken wing from the table in front of her, and tore into it, cringing at how oily it was. Hermione let out a belch, and grabbed a bowl of pudding next, praying that she would be told to stop before she had to eat it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Hermione noticed that she was barely getting full; in fact, the more she ate, the more she wanted. She stopped trying to hold in her gassiness, since it was only an equally gassy, nearly 600 pound woman watching her feast. She felt her body softening, but tried not to think about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mrs. Weasely said something that made her stop in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once you finish up, be a dear and go get Ginny from Hogwarts? Just convince her to eat some of our food; my poor little girl is out there, rail thin and gas free! She trusts you, so by the time she notices something's wrong she'll be nice and addicted!\"</span></div></div>",

Hermione Granger was larger after eating her previous meals, her ass tearing her robes and her face now sporting a double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that much of an increase, about ten pounds or so but with her sweat adding a noxious smell to the mix Hermione felt like she had gained even more. Steeling herself, she looked at Mrs. Weasley and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I refuse to lead Ginny to this fate.\" The words would have had more impact but Hermione farted right after that and blushed once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Weasley's face turned red, whether from exertion or anger Hermione couldn't tell. More and more books were soon transformed into lobsters, hamburgers, and pizza. Mrs. Weasley then lifted a large dollop of ice cream towards Hermione's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide Hermione, do it for mommy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione kept her mouth shut as long as she could until gas roiled around in her stomach and she belched, the witch using that opportunity to shove a spoonful into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have all the time in the world to wait for you to come around to us dear,\" Mrs. Weasley said, smiling as Hermione rubbed her belly which had gained a few more pounds and now poking out from her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long could Hermione last?</span></div></div>",

Hermione guessed that Miss Weasely knew that Ginny wouldn't come on her own, and made sure the appropriate transfiguration charm was cast to make her look unassuming. She knew that her true body was that of a flabby, somewhat smelly witch though, as she was dying for some of Mrs. Weasely's cooking and was fighting the urge not to pass gas. Realizing she had just a few hours before sunrise, Hermione snuck downstairs and got to work. <br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny arose the next morning to find the house empty except for Hermione, who sat at the dining room table with breakfast already made. Confused more than anything, Ginny inquired as to what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing at all Ginny! It has just been ages since we've spoken, and I thought we could catch up! Forgive me for letting myself in, I got here late last night and didn't want to wake you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny was a little confused, but was glad to see Hermione. Sitting down across from her, the girls had their breakfast. Ginny noticed two very strange things about the following hour; the food was tasty, but it was awfully heavy and rather greasy, and Hermione seemed to be eating like a girl three times her size. While both girls truly enjoyed the chat, Hermione was anxiously holding in the worst of flatulence as Ginny at more and more of the cursed food she had prepared, and Ginny wasn't sure why Hermione had such terrible table manners all of a sudden. She would now talk with her mouth full, and had spatters of syrup and ketchup all over the front of her sweater by the time the meal was over. The funny thing was, Ginny felt hungrier than she did when she started! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More?\" Hermione asked, a double chin starting to fill in her face. Ginny was about to say yes when she noticed Hermione seemed to be rapidly gaining weight! <br>\r\n\"Hermione!\" Ginny stood and stared wide eyed as her friend grew fatter and fatter until she was nearly 300 pounds! Her belly was so big it was hanging and her breasts were like melons! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione took advantage of the surprise, grabbed a handful of bacon that she had just conjured to offer to Ginny, and shoved it into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny tried to spit it out, but it was just so...heavenly! She let the second handful of bacon go in easier. By the third, she was letting herself be fed. Ginny was sure something was very wrong, but one or two more bites wouldn't hurt....<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-WHAM-. <br>\r\n\"Mommy!\" The doors to Slobwart's cafeteria burst open, and 200 pounds of pear-shaped farting redhead ran into the spacious room in a far-too-tight skirt that revealed the better part of her round, fair-skinned ass barely covered by white panties and starting to be dotted with cottage-cheese like cellulite on the lower portions. Ginny was out of breath by the time she reached her mother, and beamed up at her with her new double chin and chipmunk cheeks, not mindful of the sweat stains growing under her armpits that had developed during her run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My little girl!\" Mrs. Wesely beamed and opened her arms to smother her overweight daughter in her generous belly and hefty bosom for an embrace.</span></div></div>",

However the happy scene was interrupted thanks to three colossal roars coming from three fatty bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time for reunions, let's stuff our guts!\" Mrs. Weasley proclaimed. Hermione and Ginny nodded quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Weasley then took out her wand and soon enough food was making itself. Forty inch pizzas, hoagies of all kinds, and more types of food came to life over the next thirty minutes. Grabbing three slices of pizza, Hermione shoved them into her mouth at the same time, gobs of cheese, tomato sauce, and grease splattering everywhere. Ginny had chosen donuts and was munching away at two chocolate ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Mrs. Weasley, she had chosen to munch on several links of sausage, letting spicy farts escape her rear after ever couple of bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the three gorged and gorged, Mrs. Weasley's robes getting tighter and tighter as her eyes gleamed at the progress of the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was now four hundred pounds of witch, her clothes nothing but tatters on her round body. Most of her gain was in her belly and butt however her thighs and face also gained considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny had gained mainly in the belly and breasts, neither quite the size of Hermione's but larger than they had been. The youngest Weasley was now a round butterball weighing two hundred and ninety pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Weasley walked up to her charges, noticing Hermione's flushed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter dearie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione moaned a bit, her fat face flushed red. Mrs. Weasley patted her back a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRRPPPPPPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PFFFFFFFFTTTTTTTTT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belch and fart Hermione released stunk up the room but she wasn't groaning anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mrs. Weasley! I guess I shouldn't have held those in for so long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Hermione, we never hold things in anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny glared at the two, noticing how motherly her own mother was being to Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed to get her attention off of Hermione!</span></div></div>",

The sleeping redhead tossed around a little in her sleep. Hermione waddled closer to Ginny and leaned in until her mouth was inches from her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BURRRRPPPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny's eyes fluttered open at that but soon the smell was making her woozy. Through her hazy vision, she was only able to mumble one word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her...mione?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud clanging sound roused Ginny to consciousness. She found herself strapped to a high chair, a large bowl of mashed potatoes before her. But the most frightening thing was the sight of her obese mother and the stink that followed after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! What happened to you?!\" Ginny's question was answered by a large fart and Mrs. Weasley grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginerva, you are far too thin! You need to eat up and gain some weight as the baby of the family, understand young lady?\" Ginny was about to snap back when she heard a loud belch coming from her right. Turning, Ginny's eyes nearly popped out of her skull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione Granger, her best friend and the cleverest witch of her generation, was now three hundred pounds of slobby witch. Like Ginny Hermione was in a high chair but she wasn't strapped down. She was burying her face in a large bowl of pudding and chewing with her mouth open. Finally noticing Ginny's expression, Hermione beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it lovely Ginny? We don't have to worry about what we eat or if we're too fat. And the smells are smashing!\" Here Hermione farted and inhaled her gas deeply. \"Eat up! Eat up, eat up, eat up, eat up, eat up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...this isn't you...what have they done to you?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ginny's question went unanswered as Mrs. Weasley took a large spoon and dug it deep into the potatoes. Hefting a large amount, she shoved it into Ginny's mouth before the eighteen year old could shut it all the way. Ginny swallowed the potatoes and found them to be the greatest food she had ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly rumbled for more and soon Mrs. Weasley was sweating buckets as she shoved more and more potatoes into her voracious daughter's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelching once the spoon was removed, Ginny looked down at her body. Her belly was now poking far out from under her shirt and her butt's growth had given her a wedgie. A double chin was appearing on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for the next course?\" Mrs. Weasley cooed and brought out...</span></div></div>",

No one found this to be a truly horrifying change, so no efforts were being made to undo it. If anything, it made Granny rich beyond her wildest dreams and able to retire into the rather large lap of luxury. But our tale concerns yet another \"Granny\" from Storybrooke, one whose Savior  magic had enabled her to go without a single gray hair despite the fact that she now had an adult son with a daughter of his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma Swan was now well over three hundred pounds and yet was still able to squeeze into her trademark red leather jacket. A slight grin crossed her face as she noted how her footsteps could still cause slight tremors in the town's sidewalk despite the various magical reinforcements that had been put into place. Yet another reason why she had been dubbed Storybrooke's number  one slob. There was not a single person in town that could out-eat, out-belch, or outdo the Savior Sheriff in any aspect of her new lifestyle and  she loved it far more than having to deal with fairy tale villains and whatever new variation of the ever repetitive Dark Curse they used at least once every few months . Even her own family submitted to her when it came to various slob competitions...except one. Henry's daughter Lucy was affected by the new  curse more slowly than Storybrooke's other many thousands of inhabitants. Her weight gain and loss of concern for manners and hygene was a slow and gradual process from the start. On any other given day, the town's heroes might have looked to this as a key clue in unraveling the nature of the curious transformation, but as previously stated, no one felt the need to concern themselves with such things this time around. Emma was actually equally parts concerned and amused by her granddaughter's rather prominent competitive streak. The kid was already much fatter than most of the other children in town and seemed almost over eager to catch up to her parents and the other adults. The Savor was almost certain that Lucy would turn their lunch date at Granny's, Emma's current destination, into some kind of challenge. Not that Emma minded very much. It might even be a fun way to bond with the grandaughter she still just barely knew. So, she thought with a smirk, bring it on. </span></div></div>",

Lucy belched a big belch that shook her very chubby little girl frame and made Emma snicker like an immature teenager. \"Nice one, Luce, but can you do this? The savior sucked in and unleashed a   far bigger belch that made her grandaughter's hair fly back. Lucy smirked and belched even louder than before, almost matching her  supernaturally youthful grandmother's efforts. Emma's eyebrows raised in genuine astonishment and a strange feeling of pride swelled in her now even more ample bosom. Could it be that she had finally found a worthy opponent among her own flesh and blood? At long last?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intense competition continued on for several more minutes. The sheer force of the belches being belted out would've normally shaken the foundation of the  diner and created a mass panic. Now, once again thanks to magical reinforcement, as well as the mystically altered mindsets of the diner's patrons, very few even paid mind to these rather childish proceedings. Those that did however, were quite notable. The first was Regina Mills, the former Mayor of Storybrook and former Evil Queen of the original Enchanted Forest, now turned founder and Good Queen of the entire United Realms. She was also Lucy's adopted grandmother and the second biggest slob in  town, her immense gut nearly blocking the proceedings from other interested parties. This included Jacinda, Lucy's mother and the \"New\" Enchanted Forest incarnation of Cinderella. Jacinda was a \"skinny\" slob at 210 and had the least impressive belch on record. Thus, she was feeling almost jealous of her young daughter's skill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, there was Mary-Margaret Blanchard, Aka Snow White, who was the fourth biggest slob in town, but was too humble and kind to care. She just enjoyed watching her company compete. On occasion, she would lean over as much as her huge gut would allow and take a big whiff of the smell produced by one of the belches. Such a thing was quite pleasant to her now slobby senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding  out the small audience was Zelena, former Wicked Witch of Oz and Regina's older half-sister. She was once Regina's rival for biggest slob until Emma surpassed them both, Now, as Emma defeated her grandaughter with a mighty belch that knocked her from her chair, the Mills sisters were faced with a rare oppertunity. Would they take it? Yes! </span></div></div>",

The Savior haughtily agreed and ordered the table a massive pot of chili and beer so that everyone could have proper fuel for the next round. Lucy was far too young to drink beer, so she opted for the two Mills Sisters to act as her champions in the new contest. They agreed and things were soon set in motion. The three biggest slobs in all of Storybrooke proceeded to eat and drink with the gusto that had made them famous [and infamous} during those first six months of the new supposed \"curse.\" Mary-Margaret and Jacinda soon joined Lucy in observing the gluttenous mini-contest with a very curious mix of disgust{something that was becoming more and more difficult to feel with each day that the curse was in affect}, and jealousy. The other patrons of the diner were far more enthusiastic and began cheering them on, even ordering more food and drink for them in an effort to keep the entertainment afloat. Many of these same customers also ordered double,triple and even quadruple portions of food and beer for themselves because of a combination of nerves and a sudden increases in their own already rather extreme appetites. It was as if the mere sight of these three still incredibly sexy women being so glutenous and disgusting was causing everyone around them to embrace their magically induced slobby nature just a tad bit more than they already had. Was it yet another effect of this rather bizarre new curse? Once again, yet another very good question that might have been posed by someone like Henry or even Lucy were they still living in the Storybrooke, or even United Realms, of the still very recent past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, all anyone there, including a rapidly gaining Lucy, seemed to care about was the outcome of the forthcoming juvenile contest. Some had even managed to turn the slobby trio's binging session into an unofficial contest by taking bets of which woman had managed to eat more. Finally, Emma stopped an let out a belch loud enough to shatter every window in the diner. \"Bear that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mills Sisters looked at one another and nodded. They then sucked in and burped simultaneously:\"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer force of this combined burp, aided by only a little magic, propelled Emma across the street from the diner and into a nearby wall. Only her immense layers of \"padding\" allowed her to remain unharmed as she slumped to the ground. The Mills sisters suddenly stood over her, grinning triumphantly and farting at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Zelena, will you start us off?\" \"After you, little sis.\" As the supposedly Good Queen proceeded to fart on the defeated Savior, Emma vowed revenge.         </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It has been two months since Emma had lost to the Mills and all she's done was eat to cope with the fact she lost. She had gained tons of weight. Her boobs had grown to an MMM size, as Emma was only wearing a huge black bra that was still struggling to contain her glorious boobs, revealing cleavage that seemed to go on forever. Her belly was exposed and she constantly found herself rubbing and patting it, enjoying the vast smoothness. It was hanging over the waistband of her skirt. Her ass was now 75 feet across, and had turned most of her skirts into mini skirts. However, to avoid exposing herself she resorted to wearing spandex underneath. She landed on her couch with a loud thud, the cushions deflating under the great weight. When Emma landed her skirt could no longer contain her backside, and it snapped off, showing off her black thong a little bit of ass cleavage. \u201cOh no, I didn\u2019t expect that to happen for at least another week\u201d, said Emma to herself as she picked up the remains of her skirt. Emma reached for a couple boxes of pizza. As she reached, more of her thong became exposed increasing the amount of ass cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma wanted to get back at Regina for beating her before so she decided to call her for a sumo match. She also called Granny to be the referee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later Emma heard something from outside the room, \"BBBUUUUURRRRRRPPPPPPPP\". Just then, Granny waddled in enjoying some food, and was very big. Granny's boobs were probably GGG size and still perky. She was wearing a tank top that was very strained and revealed cleavage that was very curvy. She was sipping on 5 bottles of Mountain Dew, which were lodged into her cleavage and all over her tank top. Her belly was unimaginable, as it hung completely over the waistband of her pajama bottoms, almost to her knees, and made her tank top rise up. Her love handles were almost 2 feet each and were very flabby, but none of that was compared to her hips, thighs, and ass. Her hips were already double her arm length and her thighs were very thick and round. She was waddling over to Emma while munching on a very big sub she made, but this one was almost 20 feet long and maybe 7 feet high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWow your belly is huge Granny.\u201d Emma said Granny replied, \"I know I love to eat.\", as she patted her gigantic belly, as it wobbled like crazy. \"But nothing is compared to this\", she replied, as she rotated her humongous body and showed Emma her titanic ass, which was probably 35 feet across. She then slapped it and watched it jiggle like jello, \"most of the food I ate went to my ass, and I love it\". She then landed her ginormous ass next to Emma in front of the TV and ate some of her sub, getting sauce and breadcrumbs all over herself. Halfway through it, she let out a big belch, \"BBBUUUUURRRRRRPPPPPPPP\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a half an hour later the ground began to shake as Regina came up to the house. The first thing that entered the living room was Regina\u2019s now enormous boobs, which were now a JJJ size, and she was wearing a very stretched out v-neck t-shirt, which showed off tons of cleavage. Regina also had a super sized cup of soda from McDonald's in her enormous cleavage and had orange stains on her shirt from the orange soda. Her shirt covered most of her humongous belly, but her bottom, as well as her largest, belly roll was hanging out of her shirt jiggling like crazy. \u201cHey Emma I'm gonna beat you...uuuggghhh\u201d, said Regina as she entered the front door, \u201cuh oh, I think I\u2019m stuck\u201d. She looked behind her and found her now 55 foot ass was wedged in the doorway, clad in the largest pair of short shorts ever seen. \u201cA little help?\u201d, asked Regina as she pushed at the sides of the door, but her thick love handles and wide hips would not budge. Emma and Granny waddled over and pulled. Regina finally popped out of the doorway, jiggling madly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSo Emma why did you call us over?\u201d asked Granny, munching on some fries she found in her cleavage. \u201dYeah Swan what's the big deal?\u201d Regina shouted, picking herself up and patting her enormous belly, seeing it jiggle. Emma waddled over, munching on some chocolate doughnuts, one around each pudgy finger, and was about to tell them why, but all that came out was, \"BBBUUUUURRRRRRPPPPPPPP\".</span></div></div>",

The only real rule was that absolutely no magic was to be used at any time during the match. Regina rather arrogantly accepted and transported the obese trio to Storybrooke's local gym. It had fallen on hard times thanks to the various citizens' new acceptance of morbid obesity and the fact that the strange new curse was somehow able to keep everyone in good health, but there was a ring in the place that could be used for boxing and wrestling. The two women climbed into the ring and squared off when Granny gave the signal. Emma and Regina both spent the next several minutes pushing against each other with neither one giving any ground. Both began to sweat profusely, it having been sometime since either one had actually engaged in so much physical activity. They soon had some very visible sweat stains and the rancid smell of body odor soon lingered in the already musky air. Such a powerful stench proved enough to awaken at least some of Regina's supposed \"queenly refinement\" and she winced from the smell, this combined with the sudden confusion over exactly what she was doing at that moment, caused her to give ground. Emma decided to press this sudden advantage and began screwing up her face in what, at first glance, appeared to be concentration. Then...\"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-RRRRRRRRRPP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Savior's powerful belch was able to knock Regina further back, as was the equally powerfully stench of it. Emma then bumped her royal rival with her immense gut and sent the \"Good Queen\" toppling to the ground. With an almost evil chuckle, the gorgeous blonde proceeded to sit on top of Regina, her massive butt cheeks thoroughly smothering the former mayor's face. \"Wait for it...\" the Savior  said as  she raised a chubby hand in the air and silently counted down from three. Then, her immense gut began to rumble and she unleashed the  longest, nastiest fart she could muster, the sound further drowning out Regina's already muffled scream. When Emma finally stood up, the Good Queen was totally unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I win, right Granny?\" Emma turned to see that the elderly werewolf was too absorbed in eating yet more food from her cleavage and hadn't even been paying attention to the match. The Savior scowled in mild annoyance. \"Yo,Granny!\" The referee suddenly snapped to attention and looked up in surprise. \"Have you started yet?\"      </span></div></div>",

The pleasant middle aged woman was waddled to the front door of her office by her partner, Bob Vance, of Vance refrigeration. The portly couple embraced, their large bodies colliding as they smooched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhyllis waddled into her long time paper sales office, taking the trudging twenty steps it took to get to her desk. She knew the twenty steps by heart, she had counted them many a time. Plopping her rear down in her extra wide and reinforced chair, she settled in for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the office workers started to arrive for the day. Stanley huffed and puffed as he made his way over to his desk to join Phyllis. Kevin sauntered in along with the rest of accounting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly one of the last people to arrive was Pam. Pam Beasley slowly made her way though the large wooden door she had the pleasure of staring at during the day from reception. Her current girth had required careful precision through the tight space, even though the door had been widened in the past year, mainly due to her size and her size alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had gotten stuck in the new larger door just a month ago, and needed to be helped by Jim who was coming in behind her. Her wide hips, packed into her nondescript polywool gray skirt, had met both sides of the doorframe, and she needed a good shove to pass through. Jim was more than happy to push on his crushes backside to help her out of the situation. His thick hands dove deep into each of her cheeks, until she finally popped through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow a month later, the opening seemed even smaller to the young Pam. Everyday she took her time, cutting through at an angle, only catching a little bit of her soft belly on her way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast to arrive, like normal, was Michael, but of course he burst into the office in a typical high flying fashion, energized and ready to pump up his team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright everybody! Surprise announcement! Everyone drop what you are doing. Jim hang it up. Hang it up Jim.\" He repeated until the young man complied. \"Great. Alright, so today we are going to...\"</span></div></div>",

He would have thought this would call for cheers, but corporate was allowing these parties about once a week to keep the staff happy and from leaving to a competitor, who usually offered free lunch every day. \"So party planning committee, I want to see those wide rears in the conference room ASAP.\" He said with his typical smile before turning around and heading into his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three members of the party planning committee groaned as they all exerted extra energy to heave themselves up from their chairs. They waddled their way into the conference room and started their weekly tradition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam sat closest to the window in one of the new wider bench seats that the office had ordered recently to adress some 'growing' concerns. Angela sat at the head of the table as usual, and the team was rounded out with Phyllis to her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlatters of donuts lay on the table of the conference room, and none of the women were shy about helping themselves before things even got started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls chatted about the plan for the afternoon, but it wasn't long before they could hear the door opening and Michael sauntered in. \"How are my party planning bitches doing?!\" He said jokingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be a lot better if we had some notice, and these things were not sprung on us.\" Angela replied nastily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh this one bites.\" Michael said with a laugh while grabbing one of the donuts from the table. \"So what's the plan?\" He asked genericly \"I know Pammy knows all the best places for chow in this city.\" He said putting a hand on her shoulder before bringing it to a weird place. \"I mean just look at her, she looks like a girl who likes to eat, am I right?\" He said to the other two women in the room. They knew better than to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Pam's gonna order pizza, and I thought I'd get cupcakes...\" Phyllis started to recap what they had discussed, not that it was much different from last time, and brushing over his rude comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Double it.\" Micheal said plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Double what?\" Angela asked perturbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Double everything. Double the pizza, double the cake, double the booze.\" The last one he said as if he was already tipsy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We weren't going to have any booz-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just double it!\" He said as he marched out.</span></div></div>",

Phyllis needed to lift her sizeable rear every time she went back for another sugary delight, and as seen already, Pam with her massive stomach could just barely reach the platter due to her size. Angela had the easiest time. A lot of her weight flocked to her chest, so she just plopped her mamories on the table and used them as a ramp for the donuts up into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later the three women were seen leaving the conference room, brushing crumbs off their chest.</span></div></div>",

Pam remembered that she had tons of food in the break room for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jim wanna get food with me in the break room?\" Pam asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love to.\" Jim said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but you will have to help me up first.\" Pam told him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim attempted to pry the massive worker from her seat. It was no easy task lifting a woman of Pam\u2019s great size, even if the two were only a few pounds apart. Their great guts squished and slapped against each other. Jim\u2019s grasp on Pam soon devolved into a bulky bear-hug, forcing their breasts (Pam\u2019s boobs and Jim\u2019s moobs) into a mushy mound of four massive mammaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Jim!\" Pam whined, \"That hurts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jus\u2019\u2026Jus gimme\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim could feel Pam\u2019s weight rising from her chair, which only made it seem harder in the long run. Ultimately though, he would have to give up. His friend was much too fat and he was far too out of shape to help anyone out in anything physical. Ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever he didn\u2019t simply just give up. By the time his grasp gave way, Jim was already mid-tug on Pam\u2019s supple shape. Then out of nowhere Pam pops out of her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey get into the break room and Pam puts a ton of food on the table and the two dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table was covered with dessert food. 2 large, double-layered chocolate cakes, 3 cheesecakes (one oreo, one strawberry, and one plain), 4 gallons of ice cream of assorted flavors, 4 assorted pies, and a rootbeer float for both of them. There was also 6 2-liter bottles of soda for them to wash it all down with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam shoved the food into her mouth with one hand while rubbing her tender, quivering belly with the other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"URRRRRPPPP\"</i> she belched after sucking down half a bottle of soda. She had soda dripping down the side of her mouth, and some ice cream had found its way to the side of her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim squealed as he inhaled the contents of his plate. Between burps he tried to speak to the tastes he was experiencing, \"mm..so bubbly <i>URP</i> I can't wait to try more <i>HIC</i> soda...\" This continued on as he reached his arms out, raking more food towards his mouth as his ballooning stomach thundered forward. He didn't seem to notice that his dress shirt had ridden up over his belly button and trickles of chocolate sauce had dripped down onto his belly from his multiple chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Pam <i>URP</i> can you share <i>HIC</i> more of the food <i>URP</i>?\" asked Jim<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam patted her bellowing belly and was going to answer, but all that came out was, <i>\"BBBUUUUURRRRRRPPPPPPPP\".</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(Fast-forward 2 hours)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table was destroyed, about 6 giant platters that had been previously full of food were now empty, leaving behind only garnishes, discarded napkins, and utensils. Jim had just finished eating, his chipmunk cheeks were covered in confectionery sugar, and his fingers were brown with melted chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam's massive gut was fully exposed. Her hands were placed atop the shelf of a stomach in front of her. Her massive thighs were covered in discarded napkins and crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she leaned back and patted her belly, the chair finally gave, and Pam fell to the ground, her leg kick the table, send food flying. Her immense belly was flattened and oozed all around her like an ocean wobbling and jiggling along with her overflowing cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either of them could react the plates of food that fell on the floor it seemed to be the last straw for the chair Jim sat on, and he also when down in a heap of wobbling blubbery mass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Jim\u2019s blubbery backside cushioned his fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael we need some help!\" Pam yelled and Michael waddled as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam was wiggling like crazy trying to get herself to at least a sitting position. Jim was already sitting up, and Dwight came in pretty quick for his size and was trying to help Jim stand by pushing against his friend's titanic ass. \"Come on push!\" Jim exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am! I am!\" Dwight exclaimed as his hands sank into the wall of blubber that is Jim\u2019s ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Michael was trying to get Pam up but failed to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dwight I need your help\" Michael told Dwight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey grabbed Pam\u2019s chubby hands and tried to pull, they were turning red with effort, but was unable to hoist her up. Michael tried to help by pushing against his friend's titanic ass. He pushed with all his might against the wall of blubber. However, Michael was too much out of shape to add enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Pam, we need help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Michael can you just fetch me the rest of that cheesecake-I'm starving!\" as her belly let out a loud grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I need her to help me with Jim.\" Dwight waddled over to Jim and tried to pull him up with Michael trying to push on his swollen posterior. With both helping they were able to get him on to his feet. Jim\u2019s monumental gut fell down with a juggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it was time to help the most bloated of the overweight workers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDwight and Michael grabbed on Pam\u2019s hands while Jim pushed her monumental backside. Pam\u2019s chin was pressed against her sea of cleavage which was overflowing out of her top. Jim\u2019s hands were sinking very far into her blubber as he tried to help up his great butterball of a friend up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim claimed \"Okay, everyone 1. 2. 3.\" And one more push Pam as upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they leave the break room Pam spots a poster Angela put up for the party. She walks over and read the poster and it says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u><b>Food Party</b></u><br>\r\n<b>Where:</b> Conference Room<br>\r\n<b>When:</b> Right after work today<br>\r\n<b>Dress Code:</b> All clothing is provided because it will be messy. <b>Men:</b> Tank Top and Shorts <b>Women:</b> Crop Top and Short Shorts</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam was so excited that she went back to her desk and pretended to do work for the rest of the day.</span></div></div>",

You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re time in the limelight is over Cameron. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a new talent to carry our franchise and give professional voice actors a chance to shine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBull<i>shit!\u00e2\u0080\u009d</i> The actress shouted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou just want a cheaper actress!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u00e2\u0080\u009c...I can neither confirm nor deny that accusation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not fair! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been playing the character for 20 Goddamn years!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She fumed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does this new chick have that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t?!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u00e2\u0080\u009cExperience voicing more characters than one can count on a single hand, being 20 years younger, having a calmer temper\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d</i> The person rattled off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI deserve this role more!

Betrayal at having her role taken away from her. Envy toward the woman who received it. Disappointment for losing out on a potential source for money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut above all else: Rage for how powerless she was to change this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the best way she sought to convey that anger was to throw her phone at the nearest wall, leaving a thin gash in the structure. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, some young punk wants to take my job. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see about that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing a long, stressful car ride, Cameron arrived at the residence of the actress who had \u00e2\u0080\u0098pilfered\u00e2\u0080\u0099 her role. Pulling up in the driveway, she exited her vehicle and stomped to the front door, banging on the wooden structure, sporting a gray shirt, black pants, and white shoes. After a couple seconds, the sound of footsteps on the other side could be heard, growing louder until the turning of locks replaced it, and thus the door opened outward to reveal Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowering at six feet tall, the stranger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oily bronze skin glistened in the Sun. Her thighs were thick enough to touch each other and stretched her black sweatpants to its very limits, Cameron even spotting some small tears on the front. A dome-shaped belly jutted out in front of her, poking out underneath her sweat-soaked beige t-shirt. Resting atop her rotund tummy was a pair of perky C-Cup breasts, the milky cannons nipples pressing against her shirt. Paradoxically, her arms and legs were rather toned, albeit covered with a layer of adipose, giving her a slightly intimidating appearance. The woman yawned and brushed away some disheveled, dirt-colored hair from her eyes. She looked as though she just got out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 3:00 in the afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d The brunette greeted with a cavalier wave, her smile flashing yellow-tinted teeth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you want?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for Cameron to regain her composure upon viewing her rival for the first time.  She got a whiff of the brunette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breath and winced. Between the stench of digested onion chili dogs and the piss-colored chompers, Cameron concluded that this woman had a severe case of halitosis, or at least went a few days without brushing her teeth. However, she reminded herself about what she was doing for and got back on track. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m here because you stole my role away, and I want it back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress stayed mute for a couple seconds, appearing to be deep in thought, before she snapped her fingers in revelation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWait a minute, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re Cameron Diaz! You probably heard about me landing the part of Princess Fiona in the new Shrek film. Name\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Carla Waters, by the way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Carla, you should know that since I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been playing the character for so long, I would make a much better choice to voice her now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cameron explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe movie execs think that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m old news, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to prove I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve still got what it takes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla put a crumb-covered finger onto her soft double chin, musing over her choices. On one hand, she earned her position fair-and-square, so she really didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to entertain Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vendetta. On the other hand, being able to show up the predecessor to her current role would do wonders for her confidence in performing the part, not to mention the good publicity she could score herself and the film for winning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlright, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s have a little competition. First, a gas contest, then a slug eating contest, and finally a martial arts contest. Best two-out-of-three wins.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron blinked in confusion at the mention of that second contest, but nonetheless nodded in agreement. Carla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mud-hued pupils lit up and she led her inside the house. Cameron got a good look at her backside, Carla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glutes sticking out as far as her breasts, even with some cellulite being visible through the fabric. Upon entering, Cameron recoiled in disgust as her nostrils were assaulted by a miasma of fetid odors, unknown to her host. Her eyes meeting piles of sweaty clothes littering the staircase to her right. There was no sign of a basket nearby, though. As Cameron continued into the kitchen, her shoes treading over hair-blanketed carpets and floors, the assault of smells grew in intensity. Surveying the new environment, she discovered several sources of the stenches, such as a sink overflowing with unwashed dishes and silverware, and a garbage can filled to the brim with trash. When Carla opened the back door, Cameron couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave the cruel cooking room quickly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to the interior, Carla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backyard was far less toxic to the nose. On her left was a picnic table, conspicuously topped with platters and lids. To her right was a swimming pool, although rather than water, it was filled with mud. Her curiosity reached a boiling point and she turned to Carla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy is your house a shithole?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla faced Cameron, showing no signs of being offended. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been living like an ogre for the past few days to try and get into the role. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m eating gross food, letting gas out when I feel like, playing in the mud, etcetera,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Carla stated plainly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get this show on the road, starting with the gas contest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron scoffed internally, thinking that a gas contest would be child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s play. While her flatulence wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too well talked about, her belches were a thing of beauty. She has proven that she can burp on command on the Jay Leno show, had one of her accidental <i>Coca-Cola</i> burps added into the first <i>Shrek</i>, and even won the first inaugural <i>Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards</i> celebrity burping contest for the Best Burp Award. There were no shortage of reasons for her to assume certain victory.</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">Carla proceeded to puff up her checks and let out a thunderous belch. \u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\"><i><b>*OOOORRRRRRRP!*</b></i></span>\u201d The blast of gas carried a consistent bassy pitch as it roared to life. For the next two seconds, the louder-than-average burp boomed into the air, a smell of digesting roast beef augmenting her already rancid breath. When it ended, Carla smiled at Cameron. \u201cYou\u2019re up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron glared back at her. \u201cYou call that a belch? This is a belch!\u201d She taunted, thumping a fist to her chest, and let out a thunderous burp of her own. \u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\"><i><b>*BAAAAAAAArrrrrrrrp!!*</b></i></span>\u201d Three seconds was how long it took for Cameron\u2019s eructation to run its course, starting with an abysmal pitch that ascended to a heavenly one halfway through. Her belch rang out louder than Carla\u2019s, however it\u2019s scent was severely lacking, considering Cameron had skipped breakfast and actually bothered to brush her teeth today. Nonetheless, she was satisfied with her gaseous outburst when it ceased, sneering at her rival afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla quickly swallowed a deep breath of air, her face adopting a look of intense concentration. She bobbed her head back into her neck for a second before bopping it forward emitting another gargantuan burp. \u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\"><i><b>*HYYYYYYYUUUUUUURRRRRRRRP!!!*</b></i></span>\u201d Once again, the pitch of Carla\u2019s eructation was a monotonous baritone, sounding more akin to a growling lion than a young woman. An aroma of chicken joined her previous beefy fumes to form an even more putrid fog. Cameron found herself flinching at how loud Clara\u2019s belch was, four seconds being the time needed for it to fade out of existence. \u201cThat felt good!\u201d She said, patting her belly in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron stared at Carla in shock, bewildered by her nonchalant attitude toward her burp. Then, she gripped her stomach with both of her hands and began gulping down a large amount of air, every inhale causing her belly to expand in her hands. When she felt her stomach reaching its maximum capacity, Cameron pushing down hard atop her stomach, letting rip another monstrous burp. \u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\"><i><b>*baaaaaahhhhhh-UUURRRRRRRRRRP!!!*</b></i></span>\u201d Cameron\u2019s second belch had an opposite pitch to her first, beginning at a soaring soprano and then dropping to a contralto near the back half. In terms of stench, it was a little better than before, drumming up some broccoli dinner from the previous night, but not much else. It matched the loudness of Carla\u2019s last burp, though barely eclipsing Carla\u2019s eructation from a length perspective at four and a half seconds long. As it concluded, Cameron smirked at Carla, thinking that her burp was insurmountable. \u201cBeat that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla giggled innocently, causing Cameron to arc an eyebrow in confusion. The brunette then clutched her knees and leaned down, bopping her head back as she began swallowing down as much air into her stomach as she could. After a few moments, Carla reeled her head forward, pressed her hands into her stomach, and pushed out a truly wondrous belch. \u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\"><i><b>*BWWWWWWUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!!!!!*</b>{/ i}</i></span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reeked of day-old meat lovers pizza, amalgamating with her prior aromas to form a trifecta of foul fragrance that forced Cameron to fan the fumes away. Blaring for a total of eight seconds, the immense eructation erupted with enough power to ripple her lips. It rang with sufficient volume to be heard by the surrounding households over their lawnmowers and held a gravelly pitch for its duration. After it ended, Carla thumped her chest to force out any leftover pockets of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Cameron growled, knowing that she couldn\u2019t exceed Carla\u2019s closing belch. Her failure in what she considered her area of expertise sparking a competitive fire that she wanted to fan into the next events. Rather than actually voice her defeat however, Cam opted to move on to the second half of the contest. \u201cLet\u2019s see how the other end works.\u201d Cameron declared before letting out a fart. <span class=\"cbrown\"><i><b>*FRRRRT!!*</b></i></span> Unlike her burps, Cameron\u2019s opening fart maintain a constant bassy pitch, rocketing out of her ass at a volume that matched her first belch. It only lasted one second, and displayed a faint scent of red beans. Cameron sneered at Carla as it ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla just smiled at Cameron in response before hiking up a leg and letting out a fart of her own. <span class=\"cbrown\"><i><b>*PHhhhhHFFffffFT!!*</b></i></span> Carla\u2019s bout of flatulence had a pitch like a roller coaster, commencing at a low altitude before rising up to a plateau, then plummeting into a valley and boomeranging back onto the peak, before finally descending  to ground level. Her air biscuit equaled Cameron\u2019s in the loudness department, though it pissed all over Cam\u2019s fart with a stench of digested cabbage-and-garlic burritos. When the gurgly ass-ripper concluded after two and a half seconds, Carla wafted the wretched odor over toward her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron took a whiff and her cheeks turned a shade of green after being exposed to the tainted air. Carla laughed childishly at the display, to which Cameron responded by gritting her teeth, squatting down and squeezing. <span class=\"cbrown\"><i><b>*PBBBBBBBLLLLLLRRRRRRT!*</b></i></span> Once again, Cameron\u2019s butt bomb boomed with an entirely cavernous pitch, though it was quieter than her last fart. The booty-quaking blast lasted for three and a half seconds before stopping, leaving behind an aroma of fermented cheese to blend with her other fart\u2019s breeze. When it finished, Cameron locked eyes with Carla, breathing slightly more heavily after her flatulence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla took a deep breath and relaxed her anus, letting out another fart. <span class=\"cbrown\"><i><b>*SSSssccchhHHHLLllrrrp!!!!*</b></i></span> Her backwind bellowed forth from her rectum with the pitch of a brass instrument, which then soared to a higher melody before crashing into a chasm, and lastly ascending to a heavenly whistle. It rumbled almost as loudly as her last belch, the contrast with Cameron\u2019s fart only serving to highlight Cam\u2019s hushed flatulence. It ceased after three and a half seconds, onions and jalapeno peppers polymerizing with her prior fart\u2019s fumes to create a fetid fog which made Cameron\u2019s eye water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla smiled smugly at Cameron, who merely glared back at her. Cameron then closed her eyes, clenched her teeth and ripped another fart. <span class=\"cbrown\"><i><b>*ppppphhhhhhhhsssss...*</b></i></span> With a pitch like a steaming tea kettle, Cameron\u2019s third fart slid out of her ass with little noise to indicate its presence. It was just audible enough for Cameron herself to hear, though Carla was unable to listen. However, the cloud of ass gas did eventually make its way to Carla\u2019s nostrils, and the smell actually made her wave the haze away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile that did have a pungent sting,\u201d Carla lectured. \u201cSilent but deadly is no way to win a farting contest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron slumped over, not feeling anymore gas brewing inside her. <i>Alright, she just got lucky. I\u2019ll kick her ass in the next contest\u2026 Wait, what was it called?</i></span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">Carla motioned Cameron over to the picnic table, removing the lids from the platters to reveal the dishes being served. Cameron recoiled in surprise and disgust upon viewing it, to which Carla giggled. \u201cI did say that the second contest would be to see who eats the most slugs.\u201d Without hesitation, Carla grabbed one of the mollusks and slurped it up. She sloshed it around inside her mouth before swallowing. Cameron gawked at the slug forming a bulge in Carla\u2019s throat as it sled down into her stomach. \u201cSee? Just like that. <span class=\"cbgreen\"><i><b>*UUURRP!*</b></i></span>\u201d She explained, punctuating it with an unintentional belch. She took a seat at one side of the table and began to gulp down the slugs, slime dripping from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron sat down on the opposite side of the table and yanked a slug from one of the platters. Cautiously, she lowered the invertebrate into her mouth. Once it connected with her taste buds, her gag reflex instantly kicked in, a torrent of revulsion surging through her body. It took all of Cameron\u2019s willpower not to simply void her stomach contents on the spot. For a moment, she considered surrendering, surely no role could be worth enduring such a distasteful display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, another thought popped into her head, one where she was walled up in her house, watching the premiere of the new Shrek movie. Carla stood on the red carpet, decked out in a vibrant green sleeveless dress that hugged her curves snugly and soaking up praise from the press. She smiled warmly at the paparazzi snapping photos of her, although it belied an insidious sneer that Cameron could have sworn was aimed at her through the television. Then another scene flashed in her head, this showing the blonde a vision of Carla being given a multitude of voice over roles, playing characters that receive top billing and even winning some awards for her performances. Meanwhile, Cameron found herself more and more strapped for cash, forced to tunnel into her savings to survive for she was unable to find suitable acting jobs. Eventually, she would wind up sleeping under a highway overpass, looking up at her successor\u2019s face plastered on a field of billboards, all because Cameron lost this one role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No,</i> Cameron mentally snapped. <i>Like hell that\u2019s going to happen.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith renewed resolve wrought from her completely rational thought process, Cameron choked down her slug, sheer pride fueling her ability to fight the urge to vomit. When she felt her meal sink into her belly, she moved to another, though finding it harder to grip due to the slime coating her fingers. Wrangling the slippery slug, she dropped it quickly into her mouth, swallowing it down as quickly as she could. From there, the process repeated itself, Cameron lifting more mollusks and squeezing them past her lips. The only pauses in her consumption were when she would need to belch out excess air, the eructations ejecting slug slime and saliva from her mouth along with sending the taste of digesting gastropods waving over her tongue. After a few minutes, Cameron cleaned her platter of the last slug, rubbing her now distended stomach as her food rested within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, that was gross,</i> Cameron thought, trying not to fall into a food coma. <i>But at least I can keep go-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\"><i><b>*BHHHHHHUUUURRRRRRP!!!!!*</b></i></span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron\u2019s internal musings were interrupted by a deep, wet belch, courtesy of Carla. The brunette soothed her belly, currently swollen several platters-worth of slugs and glistening with spit and slime. Cameron\u2019s jaw dropped when she saw that every other platter on the table had been licked-clean, except for hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like I win,\u201d Carla declared, smiling in triumph. Pushing her chair back, she heaved her heavy tummy up into the air. \u201cNow, we move on to the final contest: martial arts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron lifted her stuffed body out of her seat her and followed Carla to the mud pool, all of her burning passion for victory now snuffed out. Carla had so utterly demolished her in two of the contests, so even if she were to win this one, it wouldn\u2019t change the outcome. In any case, it\u2019s not like she was an expert in combat, as she hasn\u2019t felt the need to exercise given her lack of consistent work, and the roles she did land didn\u2019t require much physical exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo stopped just shy of the pool, Carla dropping into a fighting stance and Cameron not even bothering to defend herself. Carla rushed Cameron and threw a palm strike at her opponent\u2019s engorged gut. Before Cameron could regurgitate her slug snack, Carla swung the sole of her left foot unto Cameron\u2019s thighs, sending her splashing into the mud pool. Carla squatted down and sank her hand inside the mud, pulling out Cam\u2019s head and yanking her back onto dry land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, looks like I get the part,\u201d Carla stated. \u201cMaybe I can talk to the producers and see if they can get you a another part.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron had been in the business for long enough to know what that really meant. \u2018Another part\u2019 was code for \u2018low-paying bit role that any hack with a functioning brain could perform\u2019 and there was no way that she would suffer that indignity. Wordlessly, Cameron grabbed a towel and wipe the mud off of her, then she walked back to her car, ignoring the questions of her actions asked by her rival\u2026 no, her superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing a long, stressful car ride, Cameron arrived at her residence. Opening the front, she entered her abode and collapsed into a chair, too exhausted by today\u2019s events and burdened by failure to do anything else. The blonde soon felt herself growing drowsy, and eventually she fell into a deep sleep. Hopefully, everything that transpired would just turn out to be a terrible dream when she woke up, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron\u2019s eyes opened, but she was not in her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, she wasn\u2019t even her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere the fuck am I?!\u201d She screamed, whipping her head back and forth to view her new surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sight was encompassed by large, sturdy trees and lush grass. The canopy above her was dense enough to block out most of the sunlight, casting the forest in a calm shadow. Without a sense of where to go, Cameron decided to simply travel down a dirt path in no particular direction. After a few minutes of walking, she noticed that the forest was becoming lighter, the foliage above her growing less dense to allow more solar rays passage onto the ground. The blonde took this as a sign that she was getting closer to a clearing of some sort, and wishfully a way out of the forest. More time passed, and the actress eventually came upon what looked like Shrek\u2019s house. The sight of such an iconic location caused memories of her time as Princess Fiona to come rushing back, as well as the realization that she lost one of her most famous roles. Cameron tried to get her mind off of that by looking around the swamp to see if anyone was around. She searched the house, the mud pit, and even the outhouse, but there was no sign of life to be found. However, when she checked the pond, Cam nearly gasped in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWading in the water while stark naked, a human Princess Fiona conducted a search of her own, though Cam couldn\u2019t see what she was looking for. Soon, the redhead came to stop and smiled as she evidently acquired her quarry. To Cameron\u2019s befuddlement, Fiona then squatted down and clenched her teeth, a bout of flatulence then ripping through the water. Bubbles of gas rose to the surface and popped, releasing their stench into the air. Immediately following this, a fish breached the top of the pond, it\u2019s belly facing up. Fiona licked her lips and grabbed the aquatic animal, likely going to prepare it for lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019re there, Cameron,\u201d She stated. \u201cNo need to be shy. You can come on out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCam just stood on the shore of the pond, slack-jawed at what she just heard. \u201cH-H-How do you know my name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona giggled. \u201cBecause you\u2019re dreaming. I also know why your depressed and I\u2019m going to train you to take back your role.\u201d She explained, extending a hand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiaz mused over her position for a moment before walking over to shake Fiona\u2019s hand. \u201cSo where do we start?\u201d</span></span></div></div>",

Inside the illumination, Fiona\u2019s form began to morph. Her slender frame thickened into a stockier, chubbier build, her clothes magically expanding along with her. Her skin turned a shade of green, matching the vegetation surrounding the women. The redhead\u2019s small nose expanded into a bulbous one and her pearly white chompers became yellow and stained. To complete the transformation, her human ears warped into the elongated trumpet shape that ogrekind was well known for possessing. Once the metamorphosis ended, the light dimmed away, leaving a plump, smelly ogress standing in the place of the fair human monarch. \u201cNow for Round 2.\u201d She declared, flashing Cameron an asymmetrical smirk and crooked eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron returned. \u201cAlright.\u201d She took a sharp breath, then sank her stomach in, emitting an eructation that rippled her lips with sheer force and stunk of broccoli and slugs. \u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\"><i><b>*BHHHHRRRRRRAAAAAAP!!!*</b></i></span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou call that a belch? This is a belch!\u201d Fiona taunted before slapping her belly and launching a burp powerful enough to ruffle Cam\u2019s hair and loud enough to echo throughout the swamp. \u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\"><i><b>*GHHHHHHHRRRRRRROOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAP!!!!!*</b></i></span>\u201d When the belch ended, Fiona chuckled at her compatriot\u2019s bewildered expression. \u201cLet\u2019s get started on your training.\u201d She motioned Cameron to follow her inside her house, where a massive spread of food had been laid out on the dining room table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnails and slugs piled high like mountains, worms and caterpillars stringed around like spaghetti, and cooked rats and frogs filled with fungus akin to a turkey filled with stuffing. Speaking of which, an actual turkey also sat on the table, along with a chicken, boar, ham and lobster. Stacks of waffles drenched in syrup resided in the center of the table and a barrel of mead rested on the floor. For dessert, a fourth of the table was taken up by a wealth of pies, cakes, cupcakes, \u00e9clairs, parfaits, and croissants. Of course, the feast would not be complete without a cornucopia engorged with several dozen onions. Even the fish that Fiona caught earlier was there, albeit not flayed or cooked in any way. Cameron found herself gulping down drool that filled her mouth upon lay eyes on the buffet, even the stranger delicacies somehow appearing appetizing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll eat the ogre food first. That way, your body can build up a tolerance to gross things,\u201d Fiona instructed. \u201cThen you can move on to the human stuff. This will also strengthen your body so you can perform martial arts better, as well as give you plenty of gas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Cameron obeyed, taking a seat and commencing her meal.</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">She decided to start with the gastropods, picking up a fat, slimy slug and slurping it up. To her surprise, it didn\u2019t taste bitter when it went down her throat. In fact, the slime gave it a sweet flavor, one that she retasted after letting out a satisfied belch. The blonde then sampled a snail to see if it was any different. Grabbing one by the shell, Cam sucked its body out of its carapace, grinning as a tangy feeling tickled her taste buds. With a gulp and a burp, Cameron was hooked on these munchable mollusks, scooping up more slugs and snacking on snails, shoving them into her mouth at a rapid pace. All the while, slime from the snails and slugs oozed from her lips and dripped onto her shirt and pants. Eventually, all that remained of the gastropods was a small puddle of slime and vacant shells, her lips stretching into a contented smile as she belted out another powerful belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron then moved on to her next course, worm and caterpillar spaghetti with beetle meatballs. At first Cam grabbed fork to stab and twirl the arthropods and annelids before bringing them to her lips, but then she pondered something else. If she was going to act like an ogre, then why do something as civilized as using utensils? Upon reaching that conclusion, the blonde tossed the silverware aside and opted to shovel the invertebrates down her gullet with her own two hands, much to Fiona\u2019s delight. Her cheeks bulged with every ingestion of the worms and beetles, Cameron gobbling them up so fast that she barely bothered to savor their flavor. From what she could gather, the worms and caterpillars were rather chewing like noodles, and the beetles were crunchy like nuts. The beetles in particular gave her a bout of flatulence, her butt blasting fart after fart to fill the house with her bodily odors, not that she or Fiona seemed to care. Soon the spaghetti fully joined the mollusks in Cam\u2019s stomach, the blonde ripping a splattery fart to signal her satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron moved on to the last ogre food, ogling the fungus-filled cooked rats and frogs with gluttonous intent. Once more forgoing the use of utensils, she sought to lift a rodent and squeeze the mushrooms and mold into her mouth like toothpaste. Then, she threw the rat inside and chewed it up along with the fungus. After swallowing, she did the same with the frog, dry fungi gushing into her mouth before being masticated alongside the amphibian. Cam\u2019s throat swelled like a frog as she gulped down her food, the actress smirking at the comparison. The last rat and frog were swallowed simultaneously, this time with the fungus still stuffed inside them. Her cheeks ballooned like a chipmunk\u2019s as she crammed them in her mouth, eliciting a giggle from Fiona and subsequently an eye roll from Cameron herself. When she gobbled the pair down, Cam put a hand on her throat to make sure it wasn\u2019t too burdened by its load. She took a moment to pet her gut, now pooching out slightly from the filth she devoured, and ripping a coterminous belch and fart that further polluted the already foul hovel that Fiona called home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished her ogre cuisine, Cameron advanced to the turkey, tearing off the drumsticks and sucking the cooked skin and white meat off the bone, before shoving the bone down her gullet as well. The stuffing was next, Cam using her tongue to scrape and lick every last crumb from within the turkey. Lastly, the turkey itself was torn into, Cameron\u2019s jaw crushing up the hide, muscle, fat, and even skeleton until there was nothing left. The other poultry was attacked afterwards, Cameron repeating the same tactics used on the turkey to take down the chicken. First, the legs were ripped off and gobbled up, followed by the main body of the chicken as it had no stuffing inside to pilfer. Like the turkey, no trace of the chicken\u2019s existence remained when Cameron was done. The boar met a similar fate, starting with the apple being plucked from its mouth and popped into Cameron\u2019s. After that, Cameron wrapped her lips around the swine\u2019s head, using her no-longer-pearly whites to cut it off at the nape. When she finished decapitating and gulping down the head, the actress ripped apart the body, spit and juices splattering across the table as she tore the animal asunder. Fourthly, another piece of pork, this being a smoked ham stood in her way, though not for long. Compared to the full pig, a mere leg cut was child\u2019s play to consume, as Cam chomped through the pork in a manner of seconds. Now, only the lobster remained to oppose Cameron, who split apart the carapace of the crustacean bare-handed. Liquid butter was poured on the innards and Cameron wasted no time clawing the meat and stuffing it in her face. Soon, the lobster was utterly disemboweled and Cameron punctuated her carnivorous consumption with another ghastly belch, this one sending a visible trail of green smog soaring through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her gases wafting around her, Cameron would still single out the aroma of the golden-brown waffles perched in the middle of the table. She yanked the plate over to her and crammed the fluffy squares into her maw. Syrup and butter coated her hands drizzled onto her clothes as more and more waffles were eaten. Each waffle possessed a starchy flavor, complimented perfectly by the butter\u2019s smoothness and the syrup\u2019s sweetness, sending a rush of pleasure across Cam\u2019s taste buds. Over the course of a few minutes, the towers of waffles were demolished, leaving Cameron rather parched. Then, she spotted the barrel of mead standing on the floor to her left and sought to quench her thirst. Lifting the barrel with stunning ease, Cameron tilted the opening toward her mouth and let the alcoholic beverage deluge into her stomach. With the skill of an expert drinker, Cameron guzzled the mead with need to pause, feeling it fill up her belly like a water balloon. Once the fluid had been drained, Cam dropped the barrel and toyed with her bagging belly, giggling as it jiggled and sloshed with all the liquid it housed drenching the solid food within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another roaring belch, this one raining saliva and hazing alcohol around the dining room, Cameron commenced her attack on the desserts, first gunning for the pies. Pumpkin, apple, banana cream; the variety of pies that Cameron planted her face in and scarfed up the contents of were as vast as the calories contained in them. When the last of the pies was devoured, Cameron went for the cakes, pleased at their having equal diversity to the pies so as to prevent the eating from getting monotonous. The array of chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, and other miscellaneous cakes were swiftly consumed as Cam gobbled them up like a pig in a trough. Subsequently, she blazed through the cupcakes, throwing them into her mouth, wrappers and all, triturating the frosting and wrappers before gulping them down. The \u00e9clairs were her next target, Cameron squirting the filling into her throat before flinging the pastries itself past her lips. Parfait after parfait were then shoveled inside Cam\u2019s maw, the rich cold dessert slurped out of their tall glasses. Finally, the croissants found themselves munched to bits by the actress, their dry taste serving as a nice contrast to the previous desserts\u2019 moisture. Yet another eructation erupted from Cameron, this one having the rainbow-colored haze swirling throughout the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the ultimate course, Cameron reached out to obtain the onion-filled cornucopia and the fish. However, a hurdle prevented her from reaching it: her own stomach. With a current diameter of three feet, Cameron\u2019s tummy looked downright cartoonish. No matter how much Cam pressed forward, her fleshy cushion would not yield passage for her. Just when was about to throw in the towel, another idea struck her. Changing her position so her right side was facing the table, the blonde managed to just barely grasp the cornucopia and fish. Like a cup, Cameron tilted the cornucopia over, allowing the onions to descend her esophagus, none of them being chewed in the process. Once every onion was eaten, Cameron tossed the cornucopia aside and focused her attention on the fish, the marine animal still reeking of Fiona\u2019s fart. At this point though, Cameron was too lost in her own gluttony to care and simply sucked the fish past her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her entire feast consumed, Cameron laid lack in her chair, clothes marred in a myriad of food and drink stains, though something about her physiology felt...softer. She poked and prodded various parts of her person, noticing a change to her physical appearance for the first time since she began eating. Her body digested the food far more quickly than any realistic metabolism would allow, causing her face, belly, butt, and breasts to swell up with fat. However, the protein in her various meals also strengthened her musculature, her arms, hips, and thighs growing more toned and veiny to support her blubber. At least that would explain how she was able to lift the mead barrel so effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Fiona inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron was about to comment, but was interrupted by a bubble of gas surging blasting past her lips and another one flapping out of her ass. The belch blew Fiona back a few feet and the fart carried with it the scent of her feast marinated in stomach acids.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll consider that a yes.\u201d Fiona said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow what?\u201d Cameron questioned, massaging her globular gut to coax out more gas.</span></span></div></div>",

Fiona relocated her jaw and grinned. \u201cGreat. Next, I\u2019ll stick my head inside your mouth. You can gulp me down after that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona stripped down to her bra and panties, walked over to Cameron, and shoved her head past the blonde\u2019s lips, causing Cameron\u2019s cheeks to swell. Once inside, Cam instinctively swallowed, sending Fiona\u2019s head into her bulging throat, the ogress\u2019s breast now privy to a fondling from Cam\u2019s tongue. Wielding her enhanced strength, Cameron used her hands to grab Fiona by the ass and cram more of the regal figure within her maw, Fiona\u2019s head penetrating the sphincter and now residing in the belly. Another gulp and Cameron was now savoring the flavor of Fiona\u2019s midriff, moaning gleefully at its sweat-soaked taste. With Fiona halfway inside, Cameron heaved her legs up and allowed gravity to command the ogress\u2019s lower section to slide down Cam\u2019s throat. When Fiona was fully ingested, Cameron huffed and wheezed for a bit before feeling a deep gurgle emanating from her belly. Said gurgle grew in power, shaking her flabby frame like gelatin, and then it traveled up her esophagus. She could tell what this meant by greatly underestimated the ferocity of her eruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\"><i><b>*BWWWWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOP!!!!!!*</b></i> </span>\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron\u2019s eructation was of such unGodly magnitude that it transcended any and all laws of reality, so powerful that it formed cracks and rips in the entire dreamscape. Soon after, the blonde\u2019s fantasy was literally shattered, leaving only herself floating in a void of nothingness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron\u2019s eyes opened, and she was in her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her body was different from when she first went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck happened to me?!\u201d She screamed, gawking at her new physique. Then, the memories of her dream flooded into her mind, replacing her rage with confusion. \u201cWait a minute. If that wasn\u2019t real, then how did I turn up like this?\u201d She got out of the chair and lifted it over her head with ease, proving that her strength was no illusion. \u201cMaybe she was right about me needing to eat her to become a bigger slob,\u201d Cameron concluded, her thoughtful expression quickly morphing into a vengeful sneer. \u201cAnd I know just how to test it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Cameron rushed over to Carla\u2019s house, finding a note on the door that said \u2018Come in\u2019. Marching through the entrance, her nostrils were again pervaded by the miasma of fetid odors, but now she hardly showed any reaction. The dilapidated aspects of the house no longer repulsed her, in fact they even gave her some ideas for remodeling her own home after her business here. Cam opened the back door, seeing that the picnic table was once more topped with platters and lids, doubtlessly filled with more scrumptious slugs. She found Carla, the young upstart making mud angels in her swimming pool, eyes closed to the blubbery blonde before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Carla!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shout brought Carla out of her peaceful stupor and she gasped upon laying eyes on Cameron new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCameron, is that you?!\u201d The brunette exclaimed. \u201cWhat happened to you?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a really good nap,\u201d Cam summarized. \u201cAnd I want a rematch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I already won,\u201d Carla reminded. \u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t at my best before,\u201d Cameron elaborated. \u201cAnd I know that you want to see who\u2019s the bigger slob now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla mused over her options. For one, she had won her role fair and square, so she had no reason to accept the challenge aside from bragging rights. For another, those bragging rights could also be good publicity. After all, who else could truthfully claim that they had not only beaten Cameron once, but again when she had apparently undergone a metamorphosis where she became a much bigger slob? The job opportunities would be pouring after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019m in,\u201d Carla agreed. \u201cSame rules as last time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine by me,\u201d Cameron accepted. \u201cI won\u2019t lose again.\u201d</span></span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll go first.\u201d Cameron pressed her hands on her hips and sucked in a swift breath of air, compressing her tummy to push out the opening belch. \u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\"><i><b>*HYYUURRRP!*</b></i></span>\u201d As far as first burps went, it was nothing special, lasting for one-and-a-half seconds exactly and being just loud enough for Carla to hear. It carried a flat low-pitch and smelled like a burrito stuffed with garlic, beef, and onions. When it ended, Cameron motioned for her competitor to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou call that a belch? This is a belch!\u201d Carla retorted, following up by taking several sharp inhalations  and putting a hand to her chest, coaxing out a burp of her own \u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\"><i><b>*BRRRRhhhh-eeeeUUUUP!!!*</b></i></span>\u201d For the second belch of the contest, she came out swinging, the expelled gas bearing the scent of deep-fried cheeseburgers and spoiled milk. The roaring eructation scared away a group of birds resting in nearby trees with its loudness. During its three second duration, the belch scrapped the depths of pitch before elevating to a heavenly soprano, which then tumbled into a subterranean pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron rolled her eyes at the display, an underwhelmed frown etched onto her face as she gulped down a copious amount of oxygen. Her already protruding gut pooched out even further until there was no more space to hold all of the air, and with that, Cam socked her fist into her stomach, sending a maelstrom barreling through her esophagus at full throttle. \u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\"><i><b>*BWWWWWWWWWUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP !!!!!*</b></i></span>\u201d Cameron's boisterous belch possessed so much power that it made everything shake, Carla having a hard time keeping her balance as the burst of gas rung for a grand total of ten seconds. A monotonous tunneling pitch made her eructation sound like an ogre roar and its loudness drowned out the surrounding symphonies of neighborhood leaf blowers. The burp contaminated Carla\u2019s backyard with a fog fueled by expired hotdogs wedged between molded wheat buns, a gallon of soda, and ghost peppers, potent enough to make even Carla\u2019s eyes water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, you have improved,\u201d Carla conceded through fits of coughing. \u201cBut let\u2019s see by how much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron picked up what Carla was putting down and massaged her ass, coddling out the first fart of the contest. <span class=\"cbrown\"><i><b>*prrrRRRRrrrt!!*</b></i></span> This bout of flatulence began with a pitch as high as a kite, which then lost altitude and plummeted to the gravelly ground, before regaining its former  soaring position. It was slightly louder and longer than her first belch, able to be clearly heard by Carla and lasting for two seconds. The smell leaking from Cam\u2019s ass was like beans slathered in hot sauce, lubricated with anal sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad, but see if you can top this!\u201d Carla boasted, raising a leg and trumpeting forth her own ass blast. <span class=\"cbrown\"><i><b>*PLLLLLLBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRT!!!!*</b></i></span> This fart blew with the scent of maggot-infested steak and dog food, wilting away the grass beneath her. It funneled past her intestines for four seconds, an even low pitch blowing from her booty. Some neighbors even cranked their heads to view the source of the noise, a testament to the fart\u2019s loudness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron merely sneered and squatted down, allowing another gale of backwind to rip through her derriere. <span class=\"cbrown\"><i><b>*pbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb-LLLLLLLLLLLLLL-aaaaaaaaaa-RRRRRRRT!!!!!!*</b>{/ i}</i></span> To call this howling hurricane a simple \u2018fart\u2019 would be akin to naming a tsunami a \u2018splash\u2019, Cameron\u2019s corpulent form quaked from the pure power of her ass gas. One sniff of the foul fragrance nearly caused Carla to blow chunks, the remaining greenery in her backyard withering away in the face of Cameron\u2019s shit-scented brown fog. It commenced as a high-flying pitch before sinking to a cavernous depth, then rising to an even greater height and finally falling to the nadir. The neighbors had to shield their ears to prevent hearing damage from the eight-second-long air biscuit, thankful when it ended at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, you win the first contest,\u201d Carla admitted. \u201cNow, onto the next one.\u201d</span></span></div></div>",

Without another word, the contestants began to dig in, each taking their own approach to their consumption. Carla sought to speedily slurp up her prey, her finger moving like lightning as they picked up a slug, brought it to her mouth, and reached back for another while she swallowed her current quarry. The brunette made certain not to waste a second. Meanwhile, Cameron went for the brute force method of gulping down the gastropods. Clawing at multiple invertebrates at a time, Cameron unhinged her jaw and crammed them all into her maw, their lubricating slime making it easier to ingest them. Her cheeks looked downright comical as they inflated with every handful of slugs being stuffed past her lips. Both of them attacked their meals with no sense of hesitation or breaks, the duo holding in their gas to avoid belching and allowing the other to take the lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA swirl of emotions whirled through Cameron\u2019s head. She felt proud beyond words for winning the gas contest after being so thoroughly demolished the first time. That pride was magnified now that she was able to eat scores of mollusks and be hungry for more after barely being able to polish off a single platter previously. Her training with Fiona really paying off! On the other hand, she was surprised at how Carla was still able to keep pace with her in spite of her metamorphosis. She was certain that this competition would be more one-sided, but Carla and her had devoured around the same number of slugs, with the number of unopened platters able to be counted on a single hand. This match had truly come down to the wire, and as their bellies filled up with more succulent slimeballs, the urge to expel the air imprisoned within climbed. A woman had to bow to the building pressure at some point and eventually one did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\"><i><b>*GLLLLLuuuuuuRRRRRP!!!!!*</b></i></span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thundering eructation ejected from the pits of Carla\u2019s gut, her lips undulating before the burp\u2019s force. It matched the loudness of her final belch from the first gas contest and the pitch was a low coralto with a dizzying soprano peaking in the middle third of the burp. The gaseous eruption carried the stench of digesting slugs mingled with the odors of all her previous belches and farts from yesterday\u2019s and today\u2019s contests. Her beastly belch far lasted for three seconds, which would ordinarily be quick for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, three seconds was more than enough time for Cameron to clinch victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carla blasted her belch, Cam seized the opportunity and lifted the final platter to her mouth, tilting its contents into her mouth. She thought back to Fiona\u2019s instructions for eating her and dislocated her jaw to inhuman proportions, sending the platterful of slugs plummeting into her tummy in a single gulp. By the time Carla\u2019s belch ended, Cameron showed the vacant platter to her and gave another piece of evidence as to the slugs whereabouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\"><i><b>*BLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!*</b>{/i }</i></span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one flex of her stomach muscles, Cam launched an ogre roar of a belch, blowing Carla\u2019s entire body away from the table with its power and being loud enough to echo throughout the neighborhood. For eight seconds, it exploded with a consistent abysmally deep pitch. Like Carla, Cameron\u2019s eructation also reeked of dissolving gastropods amalgamated with her prior fits of gas over the two days\u2019 contests, which given her current state, made the burp far more potent than Carla\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. The scent was too much for even here desensitized nose to handle. Using her remaining strength, she bolted to the nearest trash can and void her meals over the past day into it, nearly making the container overflow. And with that, she fell unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with her work, Cameron, leaned back in her chair and patted her belly, ripping gas from both ends. \u201cI guess this means I win the fighting contest by default.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Carla had called Dreamworks and declined the role as per the agreement with the blonde and Cam was currently in talks with one of the agents about playing Fiona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?!\u201d She shrieked into her phone. \u201cYou\u2019re <i>still</i> not picking me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cCorrect,\u201d</i> The agent answered following a check up on their ears to detect hearing loss. <i>\u201cYou were told that you would be considered to play the role of Fiona should Carla back out, not that you would actually get it.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho did you pick this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAn actress who also played Fiona,\u201d</i> The agent said. <i>\u201cShe voiced her in the video games and we felt that it was time that she got a job in something bigger. Her name is Holly Fields.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron\u2019s eye twitched. \u201cThanks for the head\u2019s up.\u201d She unceremoniously ended the call and went to put on some clothes, seeing as she was in the nude up until this point. <i>Time to pay a visit to this \u2018Fields\u2019 chick...</i></span></span></div></div>",

At first, she was stumped for ideas, but then she was informed of this strangely named spa resort. Though initially skeptically, the Canadian-American actress eventually heeded the praise that many of its clientele heaped on it online, and gave it a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, the blonde left her car, having driven away from the city for a solid hour a reach her destination, and got a first hand look at her vacation spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'The Fat Farm'?\" Veteran Voice Actress Tara Strong asked to herself, reading aloud the sign that bared the moniker of this establishment in big silver letters. As far as she could tell, neither aspects of the name fit the spa itself at all. It looked just any other spa that Tara could have gone to, complete with the typical pool and hotel additions, and she had yet to encounter anyone here who could be considered 'fat'. Tara raised an eyebrow in confusion, believing that she may have taken to wrong turn in that fork in the road some odd miles back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, sheer curiosity compelled her to continue and she walked through the front doors into a large reception area. There a rotund redhead with blue eyes, freckles, rectangular, black-rimmed glasses and a ponytail sat at the front check in desk, toiling away on a computer. For some reason, the woman's dull white coat was muddied with sweat stains on her armpits and food stains everywhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well, it is 90 degrees, and she might've just had a big lunch.</i>\" Tara mentally rationalized. \"<i>Still, one would think that she'd have a backup coat just in case.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat greeting brought the blonde out of her thoughts, and she walked toward the smiling receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. I'd like to sign up. My name is Tara Strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><i><b>THE</b></i></font> Tara Strong?!\" The receptionist gasped. \"Oh My God! I'm your biggest fan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 44-year-old chuckled lightly. She was used to reactions like this whenever someone recognized her. It was cute to be honest and actually pretty funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\" Tara squinted her eyes to read the employee's name tag. \"...Carrie.\" Then, she turned her head to get a better view of the inside, which was no less ordinary in appearance than exterior of the spa. \"I take it that this is the Fat Farm that I heard such great things about. I don't know why it's called that though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before, this was just a farm built by a wealthy family, but it was sold and converted into a spa.\" Carrie explained giddily. \"Now, it's a paradise where women can just rest and relax! Well, anyway, for you, the first week of our treatments here is absolutely free! That is, if you'd like to try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara pondered her choices. She didn't want to abuse her celebrity credentials to get preferential treatment. It was a cliche negative stereotype which she had no desire to perpetuate, and on top of that, it just felt a little wrong. However, something was motioning her to play the \"I'm famous\" card, just this once, though she could not place her finger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love that.\" Tara agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Here are your choices in our activity pamphlet.\" Carrie said, handing a small pamphlet to Tara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. <span class=\"cgreen\"><i><b>*BBBhhuurrrpp!*</b></i></span>\" Tara replied before getting cut off by a short, yet loud belch. It reeked of the two Diet Pepsi and Coca-Cola cans that she had on the way here. \"Excuse me. That just slipped out.\" The blonde giggled nervously with blushing cheeks and her right hand covering her mouth too late. Surprisingly, the receptionist also let out a giggle, though hers sounded like genuine amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that, Miss Strong. Everyone does it, including me.\" To prove her point, Carrie casually belted a belch that put Tara's to shame. It carried (pun intended) a scent of digested pizza, hot dogs, burgers, soda, and other food and drink that the vocal artist could not immediately identify, and was putrid enough to make her fan away the incoming fumes. She flinched at the sound of the burp, which roared with enough force to ruffle Tara's signature golden locks. The length was also impressive, clocking in at three seconds - triple the duration of Tara's comparatively minor eructation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Tara muttered, earning another giggle from Carrie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, we all let out some tiny puffs of air, so you shouldn't feel bad.\" The ginger reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>'Tiny puffs of air'?</i>\" Tara thought, incredulous and a bit miffed that she was so easily out-burped. \"<i>Mine was just an accident. If I could work one up on command, I'd have won. Wait, why am I thinking about that?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're right.\" She said, regaining her composure. \"Thanks for the... uh, advise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, and the treatment are down the first hall on the right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, and please, you can just call me Tara.\" The VA said as she walked down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara arrived in her room, glad to finally get this week of R&amp;R started. She had met a few people on her way here. They were all nice, though their figures were at the very least pudgy and at most morbidly obese. However, Tara was not one to judge people based solely on appearance, as that was another stereotype which she did not want to legitimize (though given what occurred earlier, that might not last long).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that must mean that the food here is good, right?\" She quipped in solitude. \"And speaking of food...\" She pulled out the brochure provided to her by Carrie and gave it a good reading. There, she reviewed some options that caught her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the mud bath sounds nice and relaxing, but I skipped breakfast and lunch today, and the buffet looks delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking for a bit, she decided to go to the...</span></span></div></div>",

She had been so lethargic lately, stumbling around as if she was half awake. Even her major caffeine habit wasn't helping. It was a huge drain on her mood, and the chatroom picked up on it immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I feeling down?\" Dodger said, reading out a question from the chat. \"No, just hungry is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been feeling very hungry lately, though not due to lack of food. Dodger had actually been eating more than usual, but her need to eat never seemed to leave for long. It was only because she was a professional that she wasn't eating right now. That determination was being whittled down as the minutes went on, and there was a rising movement in the chat for her to eat something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine.\" Dodger gave in. \"But you're going to have to deal with the sound of me chewing into the mic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Dodger headed for the kitchen to fix a snack.

The age difference between them was a single year, though it had lead to some pretty cunning quips from both at times like this. It was not their only difference however: Whereas Ronnie was a twenty-year old half native american with brown eyes, shoulder-length dark hair, and a fit body molded from years of outdoor sports, Lucy was a nineteen year old,almost stereotypical blonde haired, blue eyed Caucasian girl with a bit of a gut that she'd managed to maintain through a life of junk food binging and being rather lazy both on and off her job as a sales clerk at the local mall. Both girls were the best of friends however and had been so since anyone could remember, being tomboys who loved to compete and could belch and fart with the best of them. The former trait was why Lucy  frequently insisted on challenging her buff BFF to contests of strength despite a constant losing streak. The latter trait was how Lucy intended for that day to be one where said streak finally came to an end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubtly lifting her leg a bit, Lucy proceeded to let rip a silent, but deadly fart. The potent smell assaulted Ronnie's nostrils a minute later and she grimaced. \"Jeez,Luce, what the-?\" Ronnie's admonishment was cut short by the sensation of her arm being slammed down onto the picnic table. She raised an eyebrow at the evilly smirking blonde. \"Really, girl? Is that really how you wanna play it? Okay, then. BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURP!\" Ronnie suddenly belched with such force that it blew Lucy's hair back and exposed her to a smell even worse than what she had just let out. \"Ugh! What the hell have you been eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie shrugged. \"Not much. I've been saving room for this picnic. Once I'm filled up, I'll show you a real belch.\" Lucy laughed a little at this. \"Sounds like another challenge,one I happily accept. I can always eat more than you anyway.\" <br>\r\nNow it was ronnie's turn to laugh. \"We'll see.\"     </span></div></div>",

Goku had vanished hours ago while Gohan was with Videl and Goten was hanging out with Trunks. She was about to storm out and find them when suddenly, her stomache rumbled far louder than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'm hungry\" Chi-chi muttered to herself \"well, no sense in waiting around for those lazy boys of mine.\" She sat down and began nibbling on the small rice dish she had made for herself. As she ate, Chi-chi was rather shocked by how good it tasted. In fact, it was the most delicious thing she had ever eaten. Who knew she was such a good cook?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChi-chi finished the rice in record time but found she was stiill starved. She reached for a rather large leg of poultry, some bird Goku had<br>\r\nfound while hunting early that morning, and dug in. Like before, she was finished in seconds but was still hungry. She was soon devouring every dish within reach, eating at a speed that would shame ever her husband. Eventually, she had eaten every course of the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back in her chair Chi-chi moaned in pleasure. \"That was sooo good-Urp!\" She let out a quick belch and began rubbing her belly, which had nearly tripled in size. It was at that moment that Goku came home. \"Chi-chi, are you-whoah!\" The saiyan stared at the scene before him with wide eyes, shocked and a little impressed that his wife had managed to eat so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're home\" Chi-chi noted lazily \"well, sorry to say we're out of food. Don't take so long next time, would ya?\" \"Uh...right, sorry.\" Goku replied sheepishly \"I'll just find something else for me and the boys then.\" \"Being me back something too\" Chi-chi ordered \"I'm starving!\" Goku almost went pale at that. From the looks of it, Chi-chi had finished off enough food to satisfy himself and his two sons and she still wanted more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to upset his wife however, Goku simply nodded. He quickly powered up and took to the air, back to the place where he usually did his hunting. All the while, he wondered about his wish. What exactly had Shenron done to his wife?</span></div></div>",

Goku was forced to quickly master domestic work in order to keep living conditions preferable for his children and herself. He'd even learned to cook in order to better satisfy his spouse's new Appetite. In a surprising turn of events, he proved better at all of this that Chichi ever had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Saiyan hero had once thought that witnessing such events would make his wife angry, though it didn't. Nothing seemed to anger, or even excite Chi-chi anymore. She seemed to be in a state of total apathy which only mildly subsided in the presence of food or something funny on television. Goku couldn't help but be amused at his once uptight wife's new love of fart jokes and other Scatological humor. One of the few bright spots during the first few strange days was the way Chi-chi would use such jokes to make Goten laugh as they played. This quickly faded however as Chi-chi lost all interest in doing anything with her youngest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku currently eyed her in her chair, fat at well over 250 pounds and still dressed in the same clothes she had worn all week. They were now beyond rumpled and coated with all manner of crumbs and sauces, left-overs from previous feasts that only made the clothes smell even more sour. This combined with his spouse's own rather pungent body odor made the Saiyan warrior more than a little hesitant to approach his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chi-chi, come on, we're due to meet Bulma and her family at the new West City Buffet in an hour.\" Goku tried not to let his impatience show in his voice. Having to assume his wife's former role had forced him to forego  any and all training for the entire week. While this was certainly not an overly long time and he'd suffered no noticeable decrease in either strength or skill because of it, the normally cheerful Saiyan found himself becoming uncharacteristically irritable and was honestly struggling not to lose his temper these days. After all, who could he blame but himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChi-chi let herself be given a long overdue bathing and be dressed in fresh clothes that better fit her larger frame. Goku then picked her up and used Instant Transmission to take them both to West City. He was eager to talk to Bulma about  what had occurred and hoped his oldest friend might be able to revert his spouse back to her old self. With the Dragonballs currently unable to grant another wish, it was his only hope.       </span></div></div>",

Chi-Chi had never summoned Shenron before, but she had seen it done enough times that she practically knew the ritual by heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma loaned the Dragon Balls to Chi-Chi, as payment for a favor that Goku did for her. The Earth was at peace, so there was no problem with Chi-Chi using them to make a selfish wish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"State your wish,\" Shenron said, as he emerged from the balls, a huge, green serpent that seemed to be in constant motion. Chi-Chi, unsurprisingly, didn't even seem slightly intimidated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish for a day where I don't have to worry about anything! 24 hours where all of my problems go away, and I'm free to do whatever I want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wish has been granted,\" the dragon said. The sky cleared, the dragon vanished, and the balls hovered in the air before they spread themselves all across the Earth, to be assembled again in a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" Chi-Chi said. The human housewife found herself transported back to her home, but a few things were noticeably different. Firstly, Goku, Gohan, and Goten didn't seem to be home. As far as she knew, she was the only person in the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly, she seemed stuck to the couch she was sitting on. On a table in front of her was a banquet of food-the most delicious she had ever seen. Fresh, steaming meats and vegetables, seemingly all for her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer house wasn't the only thing that changed, though. Chi-Chi looked down, and realized why she was unable to stand from where she was sitting. The relatively slender woman had suddenly become a huge, slovenly blob of fat! Her corpulence dangled over the couch, and it was difficult to tell where her fat gut began and where the rest of her rolls of chub ended!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was she fat, but she was quite unsanitary too! Even though she hadn't eaten anything yet, her huge gut was covered in what appeared to be food stains, along with a layer of sweat that she could definitely smell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChi-Chi wasn't horrified by this sudden transformation. In fact, she was delighted! This was her ideal situation. No husband, no kids, nothing in the world to worry about, including her own hygiene. She was free to eat as much as she wanted, and be an absolutely disgusting pig of a woman for a full 24 hours without anyone bothering her. Shenron must've been a mind-reader, because this was exactly what she wanted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChi-Chi shifted herself on the couch. The motion stirred her stomach, causing a huge belch to erupt from her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURP*</span></div></div>",

Every dish was devoured in a span of minutes and not a single crumb  survived.Chi-chi's weight  soon doubled and her now enormous belly threatened to burst from her stained dress even as it rested on her table. More belches escaped her lips, followed by a huge fart escaping her engorged rear. This caused the chair she was sitting in to vibrate and then shatter under her immense weight. Chi-chi burst into a fit of giggles from her now spot on floor, blushing with only the tiniest bit of embarrassment at her situation. This was just how freeing Shenron's magic was for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Son Matriarch picked herself up slowly, letting out a few more farts in the process. She pondered what exactly she should do next when a monstrous roar sounded in her ears. It was as if a dinosaur had found it's way to right outside her door! But that simply wasn't possible on a day like this...was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChi-chi eventually looked down and saw that this roar was actually the cry of her immense stomach. She wondered idly if this sensation was even more gas, or was it  yet another bout of hunger her transformed body was experiencing? She experimented by attempting to belch on command. Once this failed, she bent over and attempted to squeeze out yet another fart, only to again be met with failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" the Son matriarch mused, \"guess I am still hungry after all. I guess this must be what Goku and the boys feel like everyday.\" She turned back to a table filled with nothing but dirty dishes and scowled for the first time since making her wish. \"If I wasn't such a lazy fat ass now, I could try cooking more food. I wonder if...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the table was perfectly set once more and the empty dishes were again piled high with various foods. Specifically, the Son Matriarch now beheld a banquet of cakes, pies,  and various sweets the likes of which even Majin Buu would be envious of. Shenron must've anticipated that it was time for dessert. As a drooling Chichi literally dove into her next course, she pondered her next move.      </span></div></div>",

Kakarrot had been sent to Earth conquer it (read: avoid becoming another one of Freeza\u2019s puppets.) and his mother, Gine, was taking a walk down a hall when suddenly-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>WHAM!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding on the floor, the ironically pacifist Saiyan rubbed her butt as she got back on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Watch where you\u2019re going, bud-Burdock?\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a better look at the person knocked her over, she could see that was her mate: the low-class Saiyan warrior, Burdock, sporting a crazed look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here, running into me?\u201d Gine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI came here to get help from the other Saiyans. I got a vision that Freeza would destroy the planet and he sent his mook, Dodoria, to kill my squadron. The others think that I\u2019ve lost it, so I\u2019m going to take him on by myself.\u201d He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all stunning news to the meek meat package employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBurdock, you can\u2019t. Freeza\u2019s too powerful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if it seems impossible, I\u2019ve to try something to defend us.\u201d Burdock argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I won\u2019t be of much help. I\u2019m not a fighter, remember.\u201d Gine pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but you can still get off of the planet in case the plan fails.\u201d Burdock stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat plan? You\u2019re probably just going to fly into space and try to blast Freeza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than doing nothing! Find a space pod and go to another planet, now!\u201d Burdock instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGine thought about it for a bit. Sure, it sounded crazy, but Freeza wasn\u2019t exactly the nicest guy in the universe. That, and her lover sounded pretty serious about the situation. Eventually, she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll go, but I hope you make it out of this alive.\u201d Gine agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Burdock said with determined smirk, though he was surprised when Gine pulled him in for kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t an ordinary good-bye kiss, it was passionate. Their tongues entered each others\u2019 mouths and Gine\u2019s right leg lifted up. Gine wanted them to remember this for the rest of their lives (Spoilers: which in Burdock\u2019s case, wouldn\u2019t last much longer). After a few seconds, she relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s in case your \u2018plan\u2019 doesn\u2019t work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatching her playful grin with his own smirk, Burdock ran outside to meet his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove as fast as you can! We won\u2019t have much time left!\u201d Burdock shouted behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGine nodded and headed back to the place where Kakarrot had been sent to Earth. In a few minutes, she\u2019d arrived and was in the midst of determining where to fly her pod to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I follow my son to Earth? If someone found out where he was, then I wouldn\u2019t fare much better.\u201d Gine questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving little time to dwell on the matter, she ultimately chose to go to\u2026</span></span></div></div>",

Gine\u2019s soft heart was utterly shattered by the sight and she was balling her onyx eyes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>An unspecified amount of time later\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bumpy landing for Gine. Though she was sleeping the whole way through (After all, it was a long trip from Planet Vegeta to Earth), that didn\u2019t stop the Attack Ball from causing a shit ton of damage to the place it crash landed in. Once it did land,  the snoring Gine awoke from her depressed slumber and disembarked. She yawned and stretched like any other person would, except her \u2018bed\u2019 was a 1.5 meter-wide space pod that moved at 2,627,980,686,828 meters per second. The attractive alien floated out of the smoldering crater that was about 7 feet in diameter and 9 feet in depth and was surveying the environment around her. She could tell that she was in a building of some sort, judging from the gaping hole in the ceiling above her. On the bright side, it was daytime so it was easy to see what was around her. There were 6x6x6 foot wooden crates surrounding her that were filled with something. Gine easily popped open the top and saw stacks of frozen beef patties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 What are these things?\u201d Gine thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffed them cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey smell like meat, but they\u2019re cold and hard and flat.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a bite and chewed for a few seconds\u2026 then she squirmed in disgust and spat it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Bleck!</i> This tastes awful.\u201d The pink-clad female muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to heat it up using her ki. Forming a small ball of yellow energy, Gine placed it under the patty and it heated it to normal standards in a couple of seconds. The once red disc of dead cow was now a brown, juicy, steaming piece of dead cow meat fit to serve to the average fast food customer. Biting into it again, Gine\u2019s eyes widened as she had a different reaction this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! This is much better!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she lacked the violent nature of her brethren, she damn well possessed their appetite, as she began gobbling down the strange delicacy. Gine ate quickly, but still kept it at a pace where she could savor the flavor. Its soft texture felt heavenly to her and the thick grease brought pleasure to her taste buds. I just a couple of minutes, the food was utterly gone, lost forever in Gine\u2019s digestive tracts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, that was so good. <span class=\"cgreen\"><i><b>*BBBRRRAAAPPP!*</b></i></span>\u201d The oil-haired woman emitted a ghastly, 3-second burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks darkened to a light shade of cardinal and she clapped her hand to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d The female Saiyan apologized in spite of the supposed absence of witnesses to her slight lapse in manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she decided to look for a way out of this place, hoping to discover what city this building was in. Seeing a door, Gine stepped through and found herself in the front side of the building. She could a counter, some tables, chairs, and, booths, and a big screen with pictures and names of food. Finally putting two and two together, Gine realized that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in a restaurant of some kind. It looks so much different from the ones on Vegeta, but it has some basic similarities.\u201d Gine concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelieving this place to be closed due to the lack of people inside, Gine sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least I won\u2019t run into the locals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing that caught her eye was a machine with nozzles and colorful labels. For some reason, Gine was drawn to this contraption and stepped toward it. The alien refugee pressed one of the nozzles and saw a weird black liquid squirt from it, so she tried it again and placed a cup that was next to the device under the sprayer. Once the red cup was full of the strange concoction, she examined it closer and saw small bubbles popping in it. Then, her stomach growled, reminding her that she hadn\u2019t eaten since her escape. With a shrug, Gine sipped the liquid, and grinned at its sweet taste, so she gulped the rest of it down in only a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was great!\u201d The extraterrestrial fugitive exclaimed. \u201cThis stuff must be some kind of beverage. Well, whatever it is, I know I need more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed the cup away and stuck her head underneath the machine, turning on the nozzle and letting the bubbly fluid rush down her throat. It continued to cascade into Gine\u2019s mouth, filling up her belly a little, until it stopped after ten minutes. The mother of Goku sighed in disappointment. \u201cI guess it\u2019s out,\u201d Then, she turned to the other nozzles. \u201cbut maybe the others are a different story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tested her theory by pushing on the other nozzles, and squealed in delight when more of the fluid descended. For the next hour, Gine swallowed each drink, each with their own color and flavor, until the last drop landed on her tongue. Gine stood up and rubbed her now bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh\u2026 I feel so much better now.\u201d She said as the gas from the soda pushed back up her esophagus and burst through her mouth, \u201c<span class=\"cgreen\"><i><b>*BBBBBBEEEEELLLLLCCCCCHHHH!*</b></i></span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second characteristically rude belch rang throughout the vacant restaurant, but when it ended, Gine couldn\u2019t help but giggle in spite of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me. It must\u2019ve been that drink.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she thought back to the boxes of food in the back, and how savory the contents inside were. Maybe being here wouldn't be so bad. On the other hand, her son was on this rock too, and he might need help.</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">It had been a long time since Gine had crash landed on Earth, decades as a matter of fact. One day became two, then three, then a month, then a year. Though to her, it just blended together. Over that time, she had grown overly complacent with her odd living arrangements. You see, she <i>had</i> planned on finding her lost son, but the food was so damn good that she just couldn\u2019t bring herself to abandon it and her love showed. Her fairly toned abs had melted into a thick mass of blubber. That pretty face had grown a couple chins. Her pink armor expanded to conceal most of her body, but it was littered in sticky soft drink, French fry grease, and sweat. Her perky ass was now sagging. The perfect skin that encased her body was slathered in shiny oil and populated with pus-filled pimples from the greasy grub that had passed for her diet all these years. With a supply of food so vast that it would\u2019ve lasted decades even without rationing, she had no need to hunt, so she moved around less and less often. On occasion, she\u2019d muster up the energy to use the primitive restrooms inside of the building, but that was the extent of the \u2018exercise\u2019 that she engaged in. Even then, she found herself voiding her bladder and bowels in places other than a toilet, like the floor for instance. Soon there was more Saiyan urine and fecal matter out of the washrooms than in them, so the place became an almost literal shithole. That wasn\u2019t the only reason that the place stunk, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\"><i><b>*BBBBBBUUUUUURRRRRRPPPPPP!!*</b></i></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe relative silence surrounding the building was blasted into nothingness by a rocket of gas exiting the woman\u2019s mouth. It clocked in at five seconds and was loud enough to scare off some bird perched in a few nearby trees. Luckily, they didn\u2019t stick around for the smell. If it were possible, the restaurant smelt worse after the booming belch bellowed from Gine\u2019s mouth. Any life form that for some reason still inhabited the area around the building could see actual lines of green smoke come out of the windows. And what response did the guilty girl have to her disgusting display?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a good one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Gine was content with her actions. Why wouldn\u2019t she be? With no one around, she felt less self-conscious about minuscule things such as bodily emissions or personal hygiene. In fact, she enjoyed it. Pushing limits on the length, volume, and foulness of her belches and farts. Using all parts of the restaurant as her own personal toilet. It was like heaven for her. Gine donned a goofy smile and resumed feasting upon her seemingly endless bounty. She slurped down the myriad sodas that lied before her, long since abandoning the need for a straw or a cap. Pespi, Coke, Mountain Dew, all so delicious and all so cold, found their way into the extraterrestrial\u2019s gut. It was required to wash down the double bacon cheese burgers that she\u2019d so vigorously scarfed down a few minutes prior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis \u2018Sprite\u2019 tastes wonderful, though it\u2019s not as decadent as the \u20187up\u2019.\u201d She muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering how she knows what they are? Well, the Saiyan had gradually learned what food was inside of the restaurant by using the menu and labels on the crates. Although, she probably would\u2019ve gorged on the delicacies anyway, given her current weight of 300 or so lbs. Yes, her way of life was pretty good. However, one person would arrive and change it significantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello. Who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mouth stuffed with onion rings, Gine shifted her widened eyes toward\u2026</span></span></div></div>",

But these areas paled in comparison to her belly.

She almost began to worry about the state of her now-pudgy figure, when she heard a loud, compelling noise:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Gurglegurgleblargleurglegurgle</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she had no idea what it was. A wild animal? A rogue shinobi's dangerous jutsu?! But, to her horror, it was worse; her globular belly was gurgling, crying out for more delicious food like that terribly fattening ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe, at first, held strong, hoping the hunger pangs would erode so that she could continue about her business. Five minutes later, she found herself walking into a seedy looking restaurant, the \"Hog's Heaven\" buffet. An enormously fat woman stood at the front desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How much for a meal?\" Tsunade sheepishly asked the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much? It's free!\" the woman replied, somewhat confused. \"Oh, you're new around here aren't you? No wonder you're so skinny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade ignored the remark, assuming she'd misheard the woman. \"Thank you!\" she said, and walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell hit her harder than any punch she'd taken in her life; the buffet was enormous! And terribly, terribly greasy! She felt bloated just being in the same building as this food! But what small hunger pangs she had tripled in seconds, as she filled two platefuls full of fatty ramen, sushi, even some newfangled dish called \"burritos\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nibbled the food at first, but as time passed, each bite grew until she was shoving fistfuls of food into her mouth. Her stomach slowly swelled every time she swallowed, her clothes quickly tearing seams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-PHHHHHRRRRRRRRRRTTTTT!-</b> She groaned, blushing. How could she be so rude?!

Her attitude, her size, her... <b>gas</b>... And now, she wanted Tsunade to become the same?! A gassy, bloated pig, whose only interest was eating?! She pinched her nose again and held her breath, but aside from that, she didn't have any idea what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune, on the other hand, frowned. She waddled closer to Tsunade, close enough that Tsunade could feel Shizune's belly gurgle and churn, and looked her Hokage ion the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're stubborn. You've got a lotta potential to be pretty, y'know that? I've seen the way you eat when no one's lookin'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, then smiled.<br>\r\n\"Then again, I don't haveta convince you. I saw you eating before you noticed me...\" she said, the smile now a devilish grin. She waddled off, collected plates and bowls of only the greasiest stuff from the already-greasy buffet, and plopped them right in front of Tsunade, occasionally picking something off a plate and shoving it into her mouth. \"You'll thank me later\" Shizune grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade, however, was something between embarrassed and furious. How could her friend do this to her?! She opened her mouth to accuse her, but a loud, long belch bellowed up from deep in her belly, cutting her off before she could begin. She only ended up blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after holding her breath so long, Tsunade gave in and inhaled. She regretted it instantly; the smell of all that greasy gourmet food was all she needed to completely ignore whatever inhibitions she held. She immediately began slurping ramen, gobbling rice balls, scarfing down burritos... And Shizune simply stood by and gleefully watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, Tsunade sat back, having gone through at least half the buffet. To her ever-so-slight dismay, she was almost constantly farting or belching. Her belly had reached the dimensions of a yoga ball, sloshing and gurgling underneath a curtain of fat rolls. Her derriere was the size of two beach balls, nearly breaking her chair and completely tearing through her pants. And her once huge breasts were now titanic; no top would be big enough, let alone the teeny top she was wearing.<br>\r\nShizune was ecstatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, that looks better! Don't you feel good?\" she giggled, massaging Tsunade's titanic tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... kinda <b>-PPPPHHHHHRRRRT-</b> do...\" Tsunade muttered, blushing lightly.</span></div></div>",

Once Kurenai was situated and Tsunade stopped giggling like a schoolgirl, Shizune noticed just how many more bubbles were being created in the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you've apparently been bitten by the gas bug,\" Shizune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai nodded, blushing a bit as a massive bubble broke just behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP, yeah, I just love it so much.

Tsunade would be her witless lackey, eager to be told what to do, to be dominated. But where would Kurenai fit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it came to Shizune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab us some food and feed us until we're full,\" Shizune said, with a tiny hint of command in her tone. Kurenai nodded and grabbed plate after plate. \"When you're done stuffing the both of us, we'll return the favor and make you fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai nodded again and started to cram more and more food into Shizune's mouth before focusing on Tsunade.</span></div></div>",

She approached her good friend with the interest of comforting her. She had little else to do right now anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mirajane, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white-haired young lady sighed. \"Erza, you know how I hate to waste food, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure anybody would agree on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Listen, I went through so much trouble this morning to make my brother his favorite breakfast meal, and yet he didn't even take a single nibble! All because he had to go off on some stupid mission!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...see...\" Erza scratched her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirajane's eyes suddenly lit up, and she said, \"Hey, would you like it, Erza? You look hungry, after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do? Er, well, what did you make him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby back ribs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ribs? For breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a big guy. He likes his meat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza could understand that. \"Do you...have them with you right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" And just like that, Mirajane pulled out a plate piled with a stack of ribs on it, all of them coated in a thick, messy layer of barbecue sauce, and placed it on the counter. Erza gulped. She never ate ribs much before, but they did look pretty good. Although they were made from the meat of the flying fish Hane-Sakana, it was cooked with magical flames that made the fish meat taste more like pork. Erza suddenly felt a little hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do with them?\" Mirajane bemoaned.</span></div></div>",

As Marinette ran up the stairs in a rush waving to her parents now, Sabine hated how she was always in a rush and seeming so neurotic. \"Honey I don't think Marinette is really happy, she hardly eats nowadays and acts so odd.\" She said to her husband Tom Dupeng.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now dear we have been over this, just because she has been acting a bit more hyper and not eating as much does not mean there is anything wrong with her.\" The fat and wide male baker remarked to his chubby Chinese wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she hardly sits down to dinner with us and doesn't eat the lunch's we pack, I just worry she used to be such a glutton when she was little is all.\" she sighed recalling how her daughter used to be such a chubby and cute child who loved to much on sweet treat's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night Sabine came up to her daughter's room and knocked on the door, having a tray of tarts, eclairs, and cookies. \"Marinette sweetie I know your studying, but I thought we could sit and talk you see I-\" She was cut off as she opened the door and saw her daughter missing, she was stunned at this and grumbled, taking a seat at Marinette's desk to wait for her. Sabine looking at all the constant pictures of Adrian, she honestly could not see what Marinette saw in this rail thing pretty boy. \"I've met him and he seems nice, but I'll bit he is secretly stuck up and half in love with himself. She needs to find a sweet boy not so fixated on looks.\" She though looking at one of the pictures and crumpling it. \"She started acting this way when she met him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about another hour Marinette climbed into her room from her window, the girls face growing pale as she saw her mother waiting for her. \"Oh uh, mama hey.\" Her nervous chuckles evident as she then tripped falling flat on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its past tea time, and right near dinner. You left no note and slipped out your window, do you have any idea how dangerous that is?\" Now it made some sense why she was so skinny, it was so she could sneak around more easily. \"I demand you tell me where you were young lady!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama, can we please not do this right now? I can't tell you its a secret.\" Marinette picked herself up and then bowed deeply her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your grounded, no phone, no TV, no going out, not until you tell me what is going on. I am very worried about all of this Marinette, you didn't used to be so secretive and sneaky.\" she let out an aggravated sigh now, it was like her own daughter was living this secret life. \"I just wanted us to sit and eat treats together like we used to before you became this secretive skinny rail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-you can't do that to me!\" Marinette said with her jaw dropped. \"I am a good kid mama, I can promise I am not in any danger.\" Of course that part was a lie, she was in danger almost every day as Ladybug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does a good girl sneak out at night to do who knows what?\" Sabine scoffing at the flimsy excuse. \"You are asking me to trust you when honestly this child in front of me is not the Marinette I raised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarinette got red faced with anger and shouted. \"MAMA, I LOVE YOU BUT GET OUT I DON'T NEED TO JUSTIFY WHY I GO OUT OR WHY I DON'T WANT YOUR FATTY TREATS!\" the girl screeched, she then gasped at seeing the heartbroken look on her mothers face as she ran out carrying her tray and crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the door was slammed, Sabine ran downstairs to the bathroom and cried. Little did she know that in a secret location the villainous Hawkmoth heard her cries. \"Awwww, is there anything more heartbreaking then a mother and child at odds? Such a sweet woman who merely wants her daughter to be well fed and happy. It is the perfect recipe for my akuma, now go and evilize her.\" He cackled while twirling his cane as a butterfly flew out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black butterfly floating in through the bathroom window it went into Sabine's serving platter as her eyes glowed with the akuma symbol. \"Buddhamama, I am Hawkmoth you wish to feed all the starving children and make them happy and harkon back to when they were safe yes? Well I will bestow upon you the power to feed and mother the world, all I ask is that after stuffing Ladybug and Catnoir you bring me their miraculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Hawk-Moth, let all my children grow fat, happy, and safe.\" She was laughing manically as her skin turned gold, her gut shooting out into a medicine ball like shape, her butt growing bigger like as if two watermelons were in her pants which turned into a long miko skirt and her shirt turning into a long white open robe with gold flower designs and a drink jug tied around her waist. a beaded bra going over her now larger melon breasts while gaining a big, silly grin and drooling. \"I shall feed all the children and make them my big babies, but first to get my own sidekick in Buddhagirl AKA Marinette she will never refuse my treats again!\"</span></div></div>",

She had never been at a hotel with it's own theater, so she was impressed by the hotel, despite the more disgusting people staying and working at the hotel. So she decided to see their movie theater, hoping that they had a good movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to the theater, she noticed that all the people lined up to get snacks or see the movie were thin. Everywhere else she went in the hotel, there were numerous obese and smelly people scattered through out the hotel. So it was a little stranger to see that none of the movie goers were slobs like the majority of the guests at the hotel. Then Julie thought \"Well, maybe those guys are too lazy to go to a movie theater, when they could just watch TV in their rooms.\" Though the people about to see the movie were thin, she noticed that the workers at the snack bar and ticket counter weren't. They were almost as fat and smelly as some of the guests Julie encountered earlier, but she could put up with them as long as she got to see the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she did before going to see the movie was go to the snack bar for popcorn and a soda. Though she was surprised when she discovered the size of the average popcorn tub and soda cup. They made the average large at movie theaters look tiny, compared to their sizes. \"Uhh...Do you have any smaller sizes?\" she asked the obese girl at the snack counter. \"Smaller?!? Ha! No way, our hotel is dedicated to giving people everything bigger and better than any other hotel! It's either take one of our special popcorn tubs or go hungry during the movie.\" Julie decided that even if she couldn't finish the whole thing, she could eat the leftover popcorn later. She ordered one popcorn and one soda, and again was surprised when she saw how much butter and salt she put on her popcorn, but rather than complain about that she put to much on, Julie decided to head to head to the ticket counter to hurry and see the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she got the ticket, she looked around and noticed how how messy the theater was. Garbage from the last audience was everywhere. Candy wrappers, spilled popcorn and soda, chewed gum and other forms of rubbish were scattered through out the aisles and seats. Julie managed to ignore it though as she was focused on her first experience seeing a movie in this hotel. When she sat down she forgot all about the garbage and went into a state of bliss. The chairs at the movie theater were incredibly soft and warm, plus they had lots of leg room so she could stretch if she wanted to. It helped her relax as the trailers finished playing and the movie started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough when the movie started, she was a bit disappointed. It was a silly movie about two girls try to fatten each other up due to their silly jealousy of how thin the other was. Normally Julie would have left instead of watch this garbage, but she was so comfy in her chair that she didn't want t get up. So she sat through the movie despite it's bad plot and gross humor. About twenty minutes into the movie she noticed that almost everyone in the audience was belching and farting. She simplly ignored them and continued to watch the movie, though she hadn't realize that she was also expelling gas as she watched the film. As the movie movie went on, she began to enjoy it with each passing minute. The characters went from annoying and gross to charming and beautiful. She loved the movie more and more with each second. Little did she realize that the reason why she was loving the movie was because through out the movie there were subliminal messages telling her that being fat and gross is better than thin and clean. The audience was also affected by the hypnotic messages so the whole theater was now filled with people that want to be slobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the movie ended Julie became bored and need something to do. That she decided to...</span></div></div>",

First, she thought was dirty and filthy. Because of the messages' influence, however, she began to accept the theater's unique sense of atmospheric fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's go check out the pool.\" Julie said to herself, \"I heard it's supposed to be 70 feet long and 12 feet deep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back to her room, Julie switched out of her clothes and into a greyish-purple one piece thong. Walking down the hallway, she couldn't help, but look at her surroundings. Inside her mind, the messages that she received from the movie started toying with her. She stared at the dozens of paintings depicting fat Mobiens that hung on the walls. Her nose embraced the rancid odor of passing gas originating from people's gullets. Normally, she would have gasped for breath. Even spit and barf onto the floor if it reached its worst. But Julie's original thinking was slowly changing. How much longer before she's completely rewired to embrace this uncouth way of existing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking it to the pool, Julie was simply ecstatic by the sheer size of the hotel's indoor pool. She heard was 70 feet long. It had be 110 feet long! From the darkest depths of the deepest trenches at the pool's very end, she estimated it had to be 15 feet. Perhaps more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an impressive pool!\" she exclaimed loudly, \"I could work out....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, her mental reprogramming began to initiate its purpose. Julie paused for a brief moment as her mind told her to say something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, it will be nice to just wade and soak in it.\" she said with a more slothful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the shallow end, she was surprised to learn more about the pool's blue liquid. It didn't feel like water at all. Her feet began to sink deeper into the pool. It felt like she was stepping into a sea of thick hair shampoo. Even worse, it was lukewarm like someone had turned on too much heat. Julie didn't care though. She just stepped deeper into the slimy body of blue brew. It was getting thicker the deeper she went. Once she was up to her neck in the ghastly toothpaste-like fluid, she began to sigh and relax. What she didn't know was her body was beginning to act like a sponge. Some of the ooze began to pass into her body. She was too focused on how pleasant it felt being inside it that she didn't know what changes the gunk began to deliver.</span></div></div>",

The slime began to absorb into her skin faster now that she was on dry land.As the strange slime began to dissolve into her body it added on to the bliss she was already feeling. Her belly was growing even bigger and softer, giving her more to play with. Soon her breasts also began to expand, going up a couple of bra sizes. Her body continued to expand, making her weight above two hundred pounds. As her body expanded more, her swimsuit began to rip. She was to busy playing with herself to notice that stitches in her suit were being pulled apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRRRIIIIIPPPPPPP!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, her swimsuit ripped in half. Luckily the only part that ripped was the part that covered her stomach. When her suit tore apart, it went from a one piece swimsuit that covered her whole body, into a rather revealing bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she realized what happened, once again she wasn't surprised. Quite the opposite, she looked at herself and thought \"Wow! I look great. I bet Ben will love my new look. This place has done wonders for me!\" Messages from the movie were growing stronger as her body continued to change. She wanted to get bigger and better, and of course at this hotel, it would be easy to gain weight. She was so determined to gain more pounds that didn't want to exercise or play tennis. Though she felt like she was missing a few things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed other women at the hotel were bigger than her. Even some of the skinny women from the movie theater were already packing on the pounds. Plus she noticed that they each of them were filling the air with their continuous gas from their bodies. A few days ago, she would have been disgusted by all of this, but now she was envious at them. She hoped that she could be as fat and as putrid as all of them. She couldn't explain why, she just had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided that that best way to be as beautiful as any of them was to ask them for help. She noticed one women laying by the pool that was bigger and smellier than anyone else. If she was going to get help, she looked like the person to ask help from. \"Excuse me miss, but can you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just say excuse me? We don't say words like that anymore. If you want something around here, you don't ask politely, you demand for whatever you want! It especially works better here if you're rude\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, how did you get so big and beautiful. Pleas...I mean, Tell me now, you big hippo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's more like it. If you want to be like me, you've got to go to the best spots of the hotel.

The air was filled with steam and gas as several large guests relaxed. Some were getting massages deep within their fats, others were having lard rubbed on them, and a few people smelled different types of farts. However, Julie had her eyes on the mud baths. She dipped her fat toes in the bath and sunk into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhhhhhh. This is better than the pool. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mud seeped into the pool and surrounded Julie. She sighed and ran her hands through its creamy texture. Slowly she rubbed her fat belly with the mud and giggled as it tickled her. She began rubbing it in between he breasts and underneath her belly. The mud began to relax her, calming her, lulling her to serenity. She was so happy she began to get lazier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrgrgrgrgl<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her happiness was interrupted when her stomach began to growl. She saw a table with food on it, but it was too much work for her. She sighed as her stomach rumbled again. She felt weak and useless as she ran her muddy hands across her body. Then, she had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought one of her filthy hands to her mouth and licked it. She was surprised and how good it tasted. She began to lick her hand slowly as tasted the mud. Soon she began to clean her other hand with her tongue until she started grabbing handfuls of the mud and putting it in her mouth. She began to eat the mud with one hand and rubbing it on her with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOooh, this is delicious! So much flavor! she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted her weight and dived headfirst into the mud with her butt in the air. The pool was constantly being refilled with mud so her visible butt was soon covered by mud. She farted a little and caused some mud to fly out of the pool, but she only giggled. While she ate, one of the chubby female employees noticed her eating. Julie eventually noticed and was a little embarrassed, although she didn't stop, just slowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see you like our special baths. The female employee said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUm yes, Julie admitted. This mud is so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh ha ha ha, that's not mud. A lot of people think it is, but it is something more tasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally? What is it?</span></div></div>",

Her animalistic noises were merely mumbles beneath her pile of pleasure. Her stomach, breasts and butt continued to grow bigger. Like a leech drinking blood from human skin, her body swelled with each pound of delicious food. Her bikini was still holding strong for now. Her body odor continued to began more and more rancid. Whether from her sweat and her food together or alone, it didn't matter. Julie's BO was becoming more like tear gas each second she grew. Some of the girls outside could feel their eyes watering already.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't resist the delectable pile of food that was in front of her. Every morsel of food in the pile had strong flavors that were too hard for Julie to refuse. Julie had never been able to pig out on food like the food in front of her before. She was always dedicated to watching her figure like most girls, but not anymore. Now she was free to taste all the unhealthy food as she wanted. All the chips and snacks made her taste buds go wild, even the rotten fruit and beans were tasty to her as her old self disappeared slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal was even better since she was no longer pressured into using manners. All her life she was told to eat politely, but now that she knew this hotel encouraged rude behavior, she felt like a heavy burden had been lifted. She was finally free to eat as much as possible without any etiquette to hold her back as she devoured anything edible in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough her bliss ended when a obese female employee came and took Julie's meal away from her.\"HEY! I'm not finished yet!\" Julie shouted as she tried to take her food back from the employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad! Eating time is over for you.\" The employee said as she took the food out the door and locking it on her way out, so the ravenous Julie couldn't follow her. Julie was angry that her meal was already over, but then the door opened again. Julie got her hopes up, believing that the employee had returned to give her back her meal. However, it wasn't the same employee from before. It was a another girl who was slightly thinner, but way more putrid than the girl that took her food. The girl even made a loud fart once the door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I see that your appetite has improved since you arrived here. You've also become quite rude and sweaty in a short period of time, very impressive for your first day here! Because you've made such progress it's time for a very special treat for you.\" The young and eager(at least eager for a slob) employed said with a bright and cheery smile that showed off her chubby cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Julie could ask what she was talking about she handed her a pill and a glass of water. Julie looked at the objects and asked \"What's this for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just something to help your body after that big meal. Trust me, this will *uurrrrpp* do wonders to your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie wasn't too concerned about taking a strange pill. After everything she had been through that day, she didn't question any of her changes or the hotel itself. So she took the pill and chug down the water without hesitation. Once she did, another change began to appear helping Julie become even more of a slob than before...</span></div></div>",

Better to release it than keep it bottled up inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mentioned it, I'm feeling a little too inflated inside.\" the young Asian teen said before before bending over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth she and the employee smiled as a powerful blast of her bowels' wind erupted out! Like a cannonball being fired, it made an almost explosive sound as it shot forward! A few windows were shattered from the blast as shards of broken glass littered all over the ground. Even more destructive was the rancid odor that aired itself out of her butt-hole. The dull, gritty paint that the walls were coated in began to corrode as the odor passed. Even Julie held her breath for a moment before inhaling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man. Urp! Being a pig is so much fun!\" Julie said, \"This hotel makes me wish I can stay here forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny thing you should say that.\" the employee said, \"Would you really stay here forever if you were given the chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie's response was...</span></div></div>",

She's tried wigs, implants, hair tonic, etc. None of them have come close to recreating her luscious locks. All that changed when she got a postcard from the one bimbo she hated the most. Her former teammate and stooge, Lindsay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow she managed to actually win a season of Total Drama even though she had as much tact, intelligence, and memory as a goldfish. Heather suspected the bitch cheated and slept with the producers but then realized that Lindsay wouldn't be smart enough to think of that. More likely than not the big boobed blonde got lucky and outlasted everyone else. For the last two weeks she made the headlines of all the tabloids going to parties and flaunting her wealth with Beth. Heather envied her and would have mauled her if she had the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did get her chance when she got a postcard stained with grease from Lindsay. The reality star had disappeared off the face of the world after she posted online about going on some special vacation and no one has heard anything from her in two weeks. Heather hoped she died in a plane crash or choked on one of those plastic six pack rings but that wasn't the case. She wrote about how well she was doing and how she wanted to patch things up between them. Heather almost balled up the postcard right then and there until she read that this country Lindsay was at, Slo-bata or whatever, had some new hair growth techniques. The postcard even had some plus sized women gorgeous hair hanging down to their feet. Lindsay was offering to pay for the treatment and plane tickets so Heather figured she might as well take advantage of this. She'd get her hair back, schmooze up to Lindsay, and mooch off of her millions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Lindsay forgot to mention was that Slobata was absolutely disgusting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, it was a beautiful, tropical paradise with dozens of shops, beautiful jungles, and a dazzling beach perfect for getting some sun. The problem was with the people. Every single person here was morbidly obese, wore loose fitting clothing that showed off too much ass and belly, and smelled like an outhouse. It was like Owen set up a family reunion here and he was the smallest one. If Lindsay couldn't get Heather her hair back, she was going to throttle her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather hopped into the first cab she found, which was remarkably spacious, and rode off. The driver was gargantuan and had his gut pressed into the bottom of the steering wheel. The cab floor was littered with wrappers, take out bags, and soda cups, some of them leaking a sickly sludge. Heather hiked her legs up and gave the driver a paper with some directions sent by Lindsay. It should have been a ten minute drive straight to Lindsay's hotel, but after thirty minutes, Heather realized that relying on Lindsay was dumber than trusting Chris to properly test a challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver wasn't much help either since he stopped at every fourth drive thru to order enough food to make Owen nauseous. Even worse, he had an even worse case of gas and refused to lower the windows  unless he was making an order. Heather tried to speak up but the gas was so thick she could taste the beans he digested. She kept her mouth shut and waited hoping that this would end soon. Instead it just seemed to go on and on and on. To the point where she was getting hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather wasn't sure how much more of this she could take. The directions were underneath one of the drivers' take out bags easy to reach. If she wanted she could make a break for it and walk the rest of the way. There's no way the cab driver could catch up with her if she bolted. <br>\r\nBut she was also a stranger in this bizarre land. She could end up even more lost than before. The cab driver ripped another sloppy fart and Heather gagged on the stench. She had to make a choice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She yanked the sheet of paper out from under the bag, undid her seatbelt, and bolted at the first stop light they came to. The driver shouted at her as she ran down the street past pedestrians who took up the entire sidewalk. She squeezed past the sweaty slobs and kept running for about a block or two until she was positive the cab driver wasn't following her. It wasn't until she stopped at a park that she collapsed on a nearby bench that was strangely well enforced. The air was still congested with gas but at least it wasn't as thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, why did Lindsay have to pick the smelliest dump in the world for a vacation?\" Heather thought aloud. If she had to guess the ditzy blonde likely got tricked into coming here with no clue what the locals were like. Or maybe she did knew and wanted to feel good about being the skinniest bitch here. Heather certainly felt better about her own beanpole figure when she glanced at the gluttons around her. She'd rather die than become one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven how thirsty she was, that might sooner than she expected. Her throat was parched from all that running and it was rather warm out that afternoon. Even in her croptop and shorts she was heating up. Which is why she grinned when she saw a water fountain nearby. She leapt to her feet and walked over. Another glutton across from her had their lips around their faucet. Heather grimaced and scoffed before turning away. Heather bent over and pursed her lips from the refreshing liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she was sprayed in the face with ranch dressing. It spewed with the intensity of a high pressure firehose  and drenched her entire face. She took her hand off the button and stopped before she swallowed another mouthful of the white sludge. Heather gagged and coughed, blowing globs of dressing out of her nose. She didn't notice a heavyset guy approach her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be new around here,\" said a stranger with a strangely smooth voice. \"It's hard to work this right the first time. I can help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Heather could respond, his belly pushed into her back and he grabbed the back of her head. Before she could fight back, he pressed the button on the fountain and she got hit again with a strong stream. Heather tried to tell him to stop but once she opened her mouth the dressing filled her maw and she had no choice but to gulp it down. The former castmate resisted but his grip was too strong and he was too heavy to shove off. He moved her head so she couldn't face away and the surge was too strong to close her mouth off from. Her stomach swelled like a water balloon and started rounding out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather finally put her foot down, quite literally, and stomped on the guy's foot with her heel. He cried out and let go of the button and Heather. She took the opportunity to book it after that ignoring the shouts of her irritated feeder. Once she made it to the parking lot, she wiped the ranch from her eyes and paused to catch her breath. A gas bubble from up her esophagus and surfaced with a tangy belch that Heather despised. The small belly bump poking out of her waist angered her further but not as much as the damp sensation of being soaked in ranch dressing. Even worse, she left her suitcase behind in the cab and didn't have a change of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when she was about to give in to despair, she noticed a clothing store off in the distance. It was a chain she recognized but appeared to be part of a larger mall. Her initial plan was to go shopping once she regained Lindsay's trust but she refused to spend another hour in these sloppy clothes. Ignoring the odd and hungry looks she got, Heather stomped over to the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interior of the store was surprisingly well kept and pristine, although the smell remained awful and everyone in her was still fat. Heather ignored them and made a beeline to the women's section, but not before grabbing some towels off of a display and drying herself off. Once that was taken care of, she had to search the entire store for clothes in her size. Which was harder than she expected given the smallest size she could find was XXXL. Heather was about to call it quits when suddenly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On a typical morning in the Equestrian town of Ponyville, the numerous array of Apple bearing trees of Sweet Apple Acres would be lush and verdant with full red fruit and thick green leaves. However, today was not a typical morning. The land of horses was still very much deep into the harsh winter, the ground once blanketed in grass now in snow, the trees the standing dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack, Equestria\u2019s element of Honesty and Sweet Apple Orchard\u2019s Head farmhand, looked down at the slopes dirt path with a concerned frown. The orange coated Earth pony wore her significant red-black plaid jacket to protect herself from the biting frost, her Stetson hat only covering her blonde hair. She had a love and hate relationship with the sight of the dead trees in her orchard; on one hand, she was enjoying the time off from the Apple bucking season, but on the other bend it was sad to see all her hard work die off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Applejsck was certainly getting herself comfortable in the last frill of the winter months, that much could be seen by her figure. The Orange Earth Pony had always been a big eater, and naturally on the chubby side, but all her work bucking trees kept her flab in check. With no apples to buck, the lively mare gained a firm and round paunch in her midsection, as well as her impressive backside. Years of bucking apples off trees built up the muscles in her legs, developing an impressive pear shape that made heads than whenever she went. A true hell of the south, if Ponyville was in the south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMighty sad t\u2019see the ol\u2019 place this way,\u201d she muttered to herself, a slight frown on her rounded face, \u201cAh know it\u2019ll come back in spring, but still pretty hard t\u2019watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ample bottomed earth Pony walked back to the main barnyard, her boots crushing the snow underneath and her soft booty jiggling up and down, left and right in her gait. A cold breeze crept through the dead forest of Apple trees, making Applejack shiver on the cold and her blubber to ripple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrrr, colder than a penguin\u2019s pyjamas today,\u201d she shuddered, using one of her many colourful colloquialisms, \u201chope the barn\u2019s a lil\u2019 warm at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack came into the family home\u2019s front yard and saw her big brother, Big Macintosh coming out from the barn, prompting a grin to form on her freckled, chubby cheeks. The huge muscular pony chewed a piece of wheat between his teeth, adjusting his blue flannel shirt beneath his trademark horse collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowdy Big Mac,\u201d Applejack greeted, looking up to face her older brother, \u201ccheckin\u2019 out the supplies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEeyup,\u201d Big Mac nodded, as laconic as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019re they all lookin\u2019?\u201d she enquired, a hopeful grin on her face, \u201cstill mighty nice Ah reckon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac slowly shook his head. \u201cNope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Nope\u2019?\u201d Applejack cocked an eyebrow, grin falling into a frown, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with \u2018em?\u201d She trotted up to the barn door, surprisingly easy with her muscles carrying all that flab, and pushed it open with a hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Apple Fanily are quite thoughtful and well prepared when it comes to their trade, their ansestral Business passed on from generation to generation; with the lowering demand of apples over winter, they decided to keep their last bountiful harvest and stockpile it in the barn until after the Winter Wrap-Up. The only problem was, since it was getting colder and the trees were close to ending for winter, the apples weren\u2019t exactly as healthy as usual, but still quite healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack turned on the light inside the barn, revealing bushels filled with small mountains of apples of all colours and types, as well as buckets of packaged apple desserts like pies and fritters, and barrels of apple cider. Her green eyes widened at the collection, feeling her large appetite wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Bout to go bad,\u201d Big Mac suddenly spoke up, snapping her out of her little trance, \u201cReckon we got a good few days on \u2018em.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat worried the young mare. She\u2019d never had a single apple go bad before. \u201cCan\u2019t we make \u2018em into fritters or somethin\u2019? Get some use outta \u2018em while we can?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope,\u201d the large stallion shook his head again, \u201cToo many of \u2018em. Gonna wait fer Granny Smith to think of somethin\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack frowned, not liking the idea. These apples only had a few days left, and there were so many of them! But nonetheless, she nodded, deciding her grandmother and matriarch of Sweet Apple Acres would have the best idea for what to do despite her eccentricity. \u201cAlrighty then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two left the barn and headed for the warmth of the farmhouse, Applejack taking one last longing glance at the abundance of apples before closing the barn door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she did, the smell grew stronger. It smelled like melted chocolate and other yummy smells. Kitty's tummy grumbled hungrily as she rubbed it gently. \"Like, I totally knew I should've eaten before we left, but Scott rushed us out before I could even grab a banana!\" Kitty pouted in dismay. She looked around carefully. No one else was there but her. \"Well... maybe a sip wouldn't hurt.\" Kitty decided with a smile. She carefully picked up the beaker and sniffed it again. It really did smell heavenly. \"Here goes.\" She said bravely and took a sip. It smelled like chocolate, but tasted like pie going down. \"Wow!

She then swallowed and burped loudly. *BBBBURRRRRAAAAPPPP!!!* \"Excuse me!\" she giggled as she tore another large chunk off the drumstick. Kitty tore through the fried chicken rather quickly. By the time she was done, she was burping up a storm. *BBBURRRRPPPP!!* *AAARRRRAAAPPPP!!* *OOOORRRRRPPP!* \"Wow! Like, I've totally never *UUUURRRRRPPP!* burped this badly in my *OOOORRRRAAAAPPPP!!!!!* life!\" She giggled. \"Like, what should I try next? *BBBBAAARRRRPP!*\" Kitty eyed the table in delight. There was still numerous desserts and snack foods to eat. \"Like *BBBUURRRRRPP!!!* I think I'll try the cake!!!\" Kitty smiled, grabbing the seven layer cake. She picked up a fork, but something told her that wasn't a good choice. She looked at the fork thoughtfully and then tossed it aside. \"Like *UURRRRRPPPPP!!!* there's totally *BURP!* more than one way to eat a cake!\" She smiled and then, plunged face first into the cake. Soon, she was loudly slurping, chomping and inhaling the cake, burping and now farting in-between bites. \"Like this is *UURRRRAAAAAPPP!* totally *PPOOOTTTT!* the best *BRRRAAAAPPP!!* cake I've ever *BBBLOOORRRRTT!!!* had!\" She grinned, her face a mess of frosting and crumbs as she started licking them off with her tongue while using her napkin to wipe her forehead off, only to eat that a second later.

The sorceress cast a spell and Diana suddenly found herself in a strange, rundown  version of her current home  where every other building was a fast food place! The effects of this showed on the population as every man, woman, and child was morbidly obese. They also dressed in wrinkled and messy clothes that were covered in food stains. She walked through the streets trying to spot something familiar, but whatever she did see was distorted in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople seemed to recognize her and were glad for her presence, but looked at the Amazon somewhat oddly. She thought she heard a few people muttering about her losing weight as they passed her by. She continued to walk until she heard her own stomach growl rather loudly. Had it really been that long since she'd eaten?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug, she decided to enter the nearest burger joint. The smell of grease and body odor wafted through the air, nearly making her gag. The customers around her were quite gassy and added to the unpleasant odors every few minutes. One couple, a teenage boy and girl who were covered in acne, were having  a belching contest when the boy suddenly farted. Rather than be disgusted, the girl farted right back and started a new contest. Diana shook her head at the sight, unsure whether to be disgusted or amused. A particularly disgusting belch suddenly caught her attention and her jaw dropped when she saw the offender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie!?\" It was indeed Cassie Sandsmark, demi-goddess daughter of Zeus and bearer of the title of \"Wonder Girl.\" She was as obese as anyone and was clearly struggling to fit into her uniform. The biggest, messiest burger that Diana had ever seen was clutched in her hands. The teenage super heroine turned at the mention of her name and let out a gasp of her own. \"Diana!? What happened to you!? You look so...thin and you smell like you've had a shower!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was Circe,\" Diana explained, deciding to ignore the clear disgust in her young protege's voice. \"She cast a spell and-now-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains it.\" Cassie interrupted in a relieved sounding voice. \"Come on, let's get you fattened back up and kick her ass!\" Before Diana could object, she was hoarded into the booth and served a burger even more massive than the one Cassie was eating. It was disgusting looking, but her stomach still roared at the sight of it. What could she do?        </span></div></div>",

(This means that only characters not used in onomatopoeias will count toward the 4,000 character quota, so for anyone who relies heavily on using them, either use them less and be more creative in your stories or just stop writing on this interactive altogether.) <br>\r\nPlease add a creative title to chapters. It makes the chapter sound more appealing to other readers.<br>\r\nUse good grammar, spelling, and punctuation.<br>\r\nMales could do any of the stuff above, but the main focus must be about females doing any of those things.<br>\r\nI can delete chapters that break one of these rules.<br>\r\nAlso if one wishes to continue their stories, they should add \"(reserved)\" in the option(s) that they want to add in to prevent other people from furthering the tale in a way that they don't agree with.<br>\r\nIf you have any questions, please ask.<br>\r\nOther than that anything goes, have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor anyone who has a request that they'd like to give me, there are some rules in place for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. I'll only be writing stories. My artistic skills are horrible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Said stories will only be around 2,000-5,000 characters long. This goes for Deviantart, Aryion.com, Fanfiction.net, and Writing.com. I'll need at least three days to completely one story. Sorry, but my writing process is very slow. This character limit also applies to any story that I am requested to write on my interactives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. I'll typically just do stories centered around giantism, burping, and/or eating, so keep that in mind if you decide to send me requests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. I'll write fanfiction involving characters from already established fiction (i.e. Certain Western Animation, Films, Comics, Video Games, Anime/Manga, etc.) &amp; about anyone's original character, just characters that exist in fictional works. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. I'll only write about certain fictional works that I'm well versed in, so if I'm not familiar enough with the work that you want me to use, then I'll have to deny your request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. I reserve the right to deny any request I choose, so hope that I like your ideas enough to use them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. I'll only be taking one request at a time, so if I decide to take a request from one person, then everyone else waits until I complete the work that I'm already doing, regardless of what site I get it from. (i.e. This means that if I take a request from someone on Deviantart or Writing.com or Aryion.com or Fanfiction.net, then I will NOT accept another from anyone else on Deviantart or Writing.com or Aryion.com or Fanfiction.net or any other website until the current one is completed.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Anyone who requests me to write something must write something for me in return. This goes for every site that I am a part of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Will Do / Won't Do</b><br>\r\nI will do any stories involving giantesses, females burping/belching, eating, and/or performing oral vore. I will also do farting if I feel like it. I won't do anything involving giants, males burping/belching, eating, and/or performing oral vore. I also won't do any other kind of vore besides oral. I won't do anything involving sex or featuring characters below eighteen engaging in sexual activities. I also won't do expansion of any body part besides bellies. I won't do videos and/or pictures because my artistic skills are horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Pricing</b><br>\r\nNone. I don't know how to send or receive money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese are the rules that I've set up and I expect everyone to follow them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy and PLEASE Add!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">[UPDATE!]</font></b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><u><i><b>8:40PM Midwestern Time, Saturday, June 9th, 2018:</b></i></u></font> I recently had a conversation with <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'rainbowriderv', '', '', '', '2', '', 'ON', '101255834'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'rainbowriderv', '', '', '', '2', '', 'ON'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: rainbowriderv\r\nMember Since: March 9th, 2017\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;font-weight:bold;cursor:pointer;\">rainbowriderv</a></span> <span class=\"noPrint\">(<a title=\"View rainbowriderv's Community Recognition\" class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/authors/action/overall/user_id/rainbowriderv',%20'CommunityR_101255834',%20'400',%20'650')\">15</a>)</span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/rainbowriderv','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/rainbowriderv\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'rainbowriderv', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  4/13/20', '4/13/20', 'March 9, 2017', '', '', '2', 'Registered User');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-2.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101255834',   'mess101255834_1587032216', '710', '540');  event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101255834/in/1\" target=\"_top\" title=\"Email User: rainbowriderv [Offline / Private]\" class=\"imgLink imgPortLink noPrint\"><span style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/mail-off.gif\" width=\"22\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><span class=\"noPrint\"><span id=\"new_ffrainbowriderv\"><a class=\"imgLink\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" onclick=\"doAjaxO('ffrainbowriderv', '', 'post', 'https://www.Writing.Com/main/my_favorites.php', 'action=fanfav&amp;fav=1&amp;user_id=101255834&amp;nopad=1&amp;new=1&amp;ajax=new_ffrainbowriderv');\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Click to add rainbowriderv to 'My Favorites'. \r\nClick again to become a 'Fan'. \"><span id=\"ffrainbowriderv\" style=\"padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/favplus.gif\" style=\"padding-right:1px;\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></a></span></span> and I feel like the '4,000 character minimum' rule might be discouraging some people who might otherwise contribute.
