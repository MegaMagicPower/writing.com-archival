No, today would not be normal by any means, for Bart Simpson was heading over to the home laboratory of Professor John Frink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his junior year of high school, Bart had taken a job as an assistant to the prof, assistant being the polite term for his position.  In reality, the Simpson boy was a glorified guinea pig for experiments that most sane people wouldn't want happening within a 50 miles of their home, but Bart needed the money for a car.  He wasn't Frink's ideal test subject, but no one else applied for the job, and monkeys were expensive, dammit.  So the two were stuck with each other, although there were some benefits of their professional relationship.  Namely, a recent experiment had given Bart a more than size increase of that which dangled between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Frink was all set to go by the time the teenage prankster got there.  A glass chamber sat in the middle of the testing area, surrounded by orange caution cones.  Frink himself was busy at a control panel, typing in numerous calculations before he turned to Bart and gave him the day's briefing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, young Simpson. *gu'hey* Today we will be testing my new invention, with the lever pulling, and the button pushing, and the 'oh god my insides hurt from the machine!'  I have created a machine that will tear open a hole to a different dimension. *m'hey* Now step in the platform and don't touch anything, while I send you to another world, or to a fiery, unbelievably painful death. *ga'hoyven*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart was already in the machine when Frink finished speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what was that last pa...\" Bart began to ask when the Professor threw the switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For SCIENCE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world Bart landed in has a very...</span></div></div>",

As the nausea cleared up and his vision stopped swimming, the Springfieldian found himself in front of a red door that lead into a yellow and green colored house.  After Bart regained his bearings, his next move was to look over himself in the hope that all of his limbs were still attached to his body.  Upon inspection, Bart discovered that while he had survived the dimensional travel, his clothes had become ragged and torn from the journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, everything's were it should be,\" Bart commented, \"I guess it's time to meet the locals and find out where exactly I am, and hopefully get a change of clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spiky haired young man followed the path up to the door, and gave it three hard knocks.  There was no immediate answer, but Bart could hear sounds of movement from inside, and gave another three, much louder, knocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, dammit! Hold on!\" came the irritated reply in a woman's voice.  Seconds later, the door was thrown open and a redheaded woman dressed in a green blouse and beige pants stood at the threshold.  \"What the hell do you want?\" she asked indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart was taken back by the demanding tone the woman used, as well as the sexy curves that she hid beneath her tight top and pants.  His predicament soon came back to the front of his mind, and he was faced with how, exactly, he could explain without sounding like a crazy person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the redhead, she, too, was momentarily speechless at the sight of the fit, well built young man with the strange yellow skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ma'am\" Bart started, \"I seem to be a little lost.  Could you please tell me where I am exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in Quahog,\" the redhead answered, \"and my name's Lois Griffin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where is Quahog exactly?\" Bart continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rhode Island.  What the hell happened to your clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart's mind worked quickly to come up with an excuse, luckily it was well practiced in lying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of fell into a thorn covered bush a ways back, and it tore my clothes up, and I don't really have a back up set of clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois looked at him with discerning eyes before she opened the door wide to allow him into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come in.  I can at least let you take a shower, and give you some of my husband's old clothes to wear so you don't look like a bum at least.\"</span></div></div>",
