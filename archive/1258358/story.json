All we need to do is find someone to trick into going along with it and soon the Kingdom will be ours!\" replies the other one.<br>\r\n\"I suppose so!\" responds the first.<br>\r\nGetting a little freaked out by their conversation you start backing out of the alley. Unfortunately you trip and knock over a garbage can.<br>\r\n\"Well well well, what have we here?\" exclaims the first man. Suddenly he grins wildly and points at you. \"Get him!\" he orders.<br>\r\nYou try to scamble away but are caught by the second man.<br>\r\n\"You know boss I think he's just the person we've been looking for!\" announces the second man.<br>\r\n\"I think you are right!\" replies the first as he raises a strange device and points it at you. Then he activates it and there is a flash of light.<br>\r\nWhen you come to your vision is partially obsrtucted by some translucent blue cloth. brushing it away you see a lovely young woman staring back at you. She was dressed in a sky blue satin dress with a matching blue veil on her head. Her face had a confused expression on it which troubled you as you thought that nobody that beautiful should ever be so confused. You reach out to comfort her when you realize that you are looking at a mirror. In fact you are the lovely lady dressed in blue!</span></div></div>",

It seems that that part of it had not been a dream.<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a knock at the door. You started to panic. You'd just been turned into one of the most beautiful women you'd ever seen when, all you'd wanted was directions to your hotel.

Surely you could find some benefits in living as Juniper, Pulling yourself off the bed you looked down at the blue dress you wore. It was a dress but it was of a better make than anything you'd ever worn, somewhat gracefully moving back to the mirror you'd experienced shock peering into before you got a better look at your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were quite good looking now, the dress matched your blue eyes perfectly, in combination with your delicate facial features and luscious brunette hair that reached just above your shoulder-blades you were a beautiful woman. Your mind wondered for a minute as to what Juniper's mother must look like to create somebody this good looking especially given how relatively plain looking the king looked. Nothing seemed fake, not even the rather sizable breasts lightly sagging on your chest. After some more brief internal deliberation you sat at the end of your new bed and came to the conclusion that as far as you were concerned you were now Princess Juniper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up off the bed you walked over to the door and knocked lightly, it swiftly opened and you could see a maid on the other end. \"Is something wrong princess?\" she asked bowing her head deeply, composing yourself in as close as you could attempt to a regal manner you responded \"Yes, i have decided i will be joining my father for breakfast\". The maid looked up, \"I assume after you've freshened up?\". You were confused as to why you needed to freshen up but you weren't sure whether or not the maid knew about your situation so you decided to play along, \"I suppose so\" you said pretending to seem almost disinterested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid waited for you to step back into the room and then walked her way over to the closet, peering inside you could see that it was almost half the size of your bedroom and it was completely full of all kinds of dresses, Jewelry, shoes and more. The maid returned with a bundle of clothes and gestured towards the mirror moving a small table and a chair to it. Sitting down the maid got to work 'freshening you up'. Putting on silk stockings and a pair of heels with a rather small heel, she also began to style your hair, turning it from long flowing locks into a bun held together by a jewel encrusted golden band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with the styling and shoes was a rather skillfully applied layer of makeup, it was only light but it felt foreign and alien almost uncomfortable. Soon enough the maid stepped away and let you get up, looking in the mirror you once again were in awe of your beauty you looked regal before but now you looked the part. The maid waited patiently at the door for you to stop admiring yourself, once you were out the door which the maid closed behind you the maid led you through the exquisite palace. It was unlike anything you'd ever seen and you began to feel reassured that at the very least you'd be inheriting this amazing house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Through here princess\" the maid said opening a double door.</span></div></div>",

You are excited to see what is at the end of the corridor, but to your dismay it looks like there is nothing special at the end of the path. Suddenly, on the barren wall at the end of the corridor, a black door appears magically. Your feeling of depression quickly disappears as you run up to the door, hearing the clicking of your heels echo in the corridor. You twist the door knob, but it will not budge. Feeling sad again you wonder what to do now. Suddenly, writing in red says, \"Only the heir to the throne can open this door.\" This confused you so much because the last time you checked, you were now the one and only heir to the throne. Princess Juniper did not have any siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were about to turn around, with your cute new face pouting, a sterling silver necklace with a solid gold key attached to it appeared around your neck. Completely shocked by this occurrence, you almost forget about the door. Then it hit you, this is the key to the door! You face the door and are about to take off the necklace, when the key slowly rises from the end of the necklace and points toward the keyhole. A beam of energy shoots out of the end of the key and goes into the keyhole. Then you hear a soft click. As the door opens on its own, you look down the pathway to make sure the coast is clear and step inside with the door closing behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the door is a small room that looks like a secret study. In the corner is a bed. There is also a small collection of old books in a bookcase on the other side of the room, as well as a desk. There is a huge chandelier above lighting the entire room.  \"This is like straight out of Harry Potter or something...\" was all you could mutter. This stuff was amazing but what you were really interested in was a gold ring with black trim, and a red ruby in the middle. The ring was rested on a stand in the middle of the room. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, you hear a ghostly voice say, \"Your kingdom is in danger, this will help you protect your home.\" You guess the voice is talking about those men in the alley way that got you in the Princess' body. There were planning on taking over the kingdom by weakening its monarchy. Your were not a fan of playing hero but you did want to get revenge, and hopefully your body back. Also, if they did attack, you would be defenseless in this body and might die. Something had to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your mind made up, you put on the ring. It feels so natural on your left ring finger. As you gazed at it, the ruby started to glow brightly. Then, a black cloud covered your entire body as you were lifted off the floor. You could hear fire all around you. You could feel it burning your entire body. But there was no fire that you could see. Everything was black. You screamed but could only hear the roar of the fire. You started to black out, but as quickly as it came, it all stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell with a thud on the ground. You took a few seconds to gather yourself and stood up. Something felt different. You noticed that you were no longer wearing a dress. In fact, now you had on a black armor corset and tight, black, leather pants with a thin sheet of armor covering them. To your surprise the clothes were very flexible. You guessed it was some sort of magic fabric. \"Well I guess this is better than a dress\", you chuckled to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to get a better look at yourself, so you went over to a full body mirror. You could not believe what you saw. Your hair and eyes were dark purple, and your skin was now a burnt orange color. You looked like an insanely sexy demoness! \"Woah...\", was all you could say. You noticed that your voice was stronger, more powerful,and seductive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I am a demon now then I should have some amazing powers\", you think out loud just to hear your voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then you aim and a blast of fire launches from your hand and incinerates the bug. \"Yeah! Direct hit!\" you cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you try the shape-shifting.

You also feel your privates again.The transformation was complete! You think about just staying like this forever and return to your normal life when you suddenly feel the change reverse. You are a demoness again. The ghostly voice says,\" Shape-shifting is not permanent. Do not try to escape your destiny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to accept your fate and wonder what to do now.

But bluntly....<br>\r\n\"You bastard,\"  you walk over to Stephan, smiling. \"You tricked me,\" you say as you kiss him quite passionately.<br>\r\n\"Do you mind?\" He asks.<br>\r\n\"I'm just going to have to punish you,\" you say wickedly as you bite his ear and he coos happily.<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, you'd like to use the guest bedroom.\" The witch says, even though her suggestion barely registers, it's a good one. And you and Stephan retire. There, you do all the things you've been thinking of doing to Stephan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you awake and find yourself helping her fix breakfast. In addition, your wearing the kirtle she loaned you when it hits you that the witch has adjusted other things in you. You know how to act like a woman borne and bred to this world without thinking it. Your former self, wouldn't being getting eggs from the kitchen or cooking or humming a folk toon which the witch picks up and you sing together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you happy, my dear,\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite,\" you say, and you mean it wholeheartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" she hands you a mirror and you look into it. You now have freckles and are blonde. Your brown eyes are now blue.<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Consider it a wedding present,\" she says \"now no one will think of you as the missing princess.\"<br>\r\nYou nodd and give her a hug. She is being a good friend and in the years to come you think of her as your first friend in your new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day you and Stephan return home and the next day, your bann are submitted to be wed. Even on the trip home, you and he talk, and you find you laugh at the same things, like many of the same things, and bluntly, you two are perfect for each other.</span></div></div>",

Who is accomplished, and feminine. Only then, will you be fit company for our master.\"<br>\r\n\"But why am I being tied up?\"<br>\r\n\"We must administer the first potion, and our patients often struggle through the first phase.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"We don't want treasures such as yourself injuring yourself\", says the older woman.  With that another hand grabs you, a large muscular man. He forces your mouth open and the old lady pours a potion down your throught. You find yourself stuggling, then thrashing as your muscles throb and tear, trying to escape the nightmare in your mind as your doubts, your nightmares, all your fears are spoken and you live them once more. They overwhelm you, and you cry and whisper. at some point you stop struggling and the woman who administered the potion is holding your limp body, brushing your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear girl\" she says, sympathetically. \"We don't want to leave you in that nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this to me,\" you mumble, still consious but too weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter, but from now on, until you finish your training, when you think of your past, you will only see the nightmares, we find it is a good motivator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver, anything would be better than going back. Damn right, it's a good movtivator. \"What must I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight, only drink this,\" She hands you a potion. \"It will relax you and prepare your mind for learning,\" you nod. You would do anything this woman says right now. So you  drink the potion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she puts you to bed, you feel relaxed, your mind feels soft, like you are ready to absorb whatever you are going to be taught. In fact it feels good to be open, to be mallable, to be open to suggestion. You think someone is whispering this into you as you sleep, but you only smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything is better than the nightmares.</span></div></div>",

They ask you to get dressed, and without thinking you put on pants, a shirt, and your long hair is short again, like you were when you were a boy.<br>\r\nThe old woman is there, as is another woman, and they inspect you. To you, your eight year old self, you can tell they are not pleased.<br>\r\n\"Why do look like this\" the woman who poisoned you, inspects you. \"Do not lie.\" She is scary, and feeling like a small child you cannot help be intimidated.<br>\r\n\"Speak up.\"<br>\r\nI---I was a boy.....until they transformed me,\" you tell your story, in fits and starts. After that she and the other woman converse and you strain to hear what they have to say. Maybe they'll free you, you wonder for a second.<br>\r\nThe blonde woman, the second woman, instead comes forward. She is immaculately dressed and she smiles at you pleasantly, and leans down, and though she has a knife, you don't feel threatened when she cuts the boy's clothing from your body. \"This is the first thing we must correct then,\" and she leads the now naked you to a mirror where you look and your obviously female preadolecent you the mirror.<br>\r\n\"This is who you are,\" she says, her voice dripping like honey. \"Every day you will look at it, you will accept it, and take care of it. Do you understand.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'mm,\" you say, and already your voice sounds girlish, so different than before. But you don't want to think of before as nightmares start to creep in. You concentrate  on what she says.<br>\r\n\"Good,\" and with that your first lesson, how to dress begins. The next day it is dancing, all day, as the the sweet blonde woman and and the darkly woman become your teachers. The training goes on for years as you learn to dance and excercise, as you learn to dress and carry yourself like and a proper lady. As time goes on your breasts budd and your menses comence, and you come to accept these. Every once in a while you are tested in subtle ways, to see how you identify yourself. Tests to see into your soul that catch you unaware, coming from \"Beauty\" as you come to think of the blonde woman and \"Mother\", all testing your self image. As the years go by, you think of yourself more and more as a girl, and a very feminine one that they are molding you into. As resistance dies, you begin to take pride in your accomplishments and pride in passing these tests.<br>\r\nOccasionally, rarely at first, you have encounters  with young men and at first, then simply seem like boys. But some whispers in your mind from Beauty while you sleep, and you begin to dream of being a lover, being held in their arms, and doing other things. Oddly, the man who appears most in your dreams is very much like the man who asked you to be a concubine, and you blush whenever you think of him.<br>\r\nAt last, when you are sixteen again you are tested, though you don't notice it and it is not mentioned to you. For you, Juniper, are literally unable to think of yourself as male, and when you encounter evidence of your former masculinity it literally means nothing to you. You remember before....though you don't like to think about it, but when you do, it's you, Juniper living that life....which seems utterly unimportant and alien.<br>\r\nYou wake up in the middle of the night....and Beauty is sitting by your bed, stoking your hair. You find you are hungry, and thristy, but you feel warm and comforted to have her here.<br>\r\n\"What happened, where am I.\" <br>\r\n\"In the training house,\" she say calmly, \"you've been here about a week.\"<br>\r\n\"But I remember years,\" you say.<br>\r\n\"It took years to overcome, an unusual complication that would have disrupted your training.\" She smiles knowingly, \"But we only had a week, to make you ready, so you lived years in a week.\" <br>\r\nA servant brings you food, which you, begin to devour, but then stop yourself, remembering your manners and etiquitte. A girl such as yourself must always take care in such things. Beauty smiles a private smile as she notices your restraint.<br>\r\n\"What's next.\"<br>\r\n\"Once you are strong enough, we will have another session like this where you will learn various arts, music, painting, poetry, riding and then another period of rest and recovery, after which we'll have another session.<br>\r\n\"What will I learn there.\"<br>\r\n\"How to please a man,\" she says simply. You blush, you wish you could go strait to that lesson. <br>\r\nDuring the next few days, you find your in a room very much like the dream home you were in, and you find many of the gowns you were wearing hanging in the closet. In this time Beauty is your frequent companion and confidant, and you are very comfortable with this. You find yourself getting ready for the next day where you again will enter the dream world where you will become more like they (and now you) wish you would become and are happy about this. The night before---</span></div></div>",
