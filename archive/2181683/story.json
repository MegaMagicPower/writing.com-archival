You had something depressing and miserable that you had to do tomorrow and you were dreading it. You tried to go to sleep but you just couldn't get your brain to quiet down. So started to think of a way to cheer yourself up. Then it hits you, DISNEY! You turn on your television and launch <b>Disney+</b>. You see the Disney logo and all of a sudden the screen turns white and starts to brighten. The glow intensifies as your entire room is bathed in platinum blonde/white gold light. You close your eyes as the light becomes blinding and with a flash the light vanishes.  The screen returns to normal and says Disney+ but it never fully loads, not that you're still there to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have vanished along with the golden light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes. Where are you? </span></div></div>",

At least, that's what it looked like. It looked old, with stone walls and a floor, and furniture looked like something out of a medieval movie. And then you looked at the bed. The occupant was hard to miss, and you can't believe you didn't see her sooner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was HER: Sleeping Beauty. Princess Aurora. Briar Rose. Whatever you wanted to call her, she was absolutely stunning. Golden hair fell gently around her head, her lips red as the rose. Her dress, once just a beautiful bit of animation, was now a real work of art. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were closed, and you let out a soft gasp. You knew where you were: The tower! After she was cursed, Sleeping Beauty was laid to rest in THIS TOWER, to await True Love's first kiss, to break the spell! But\u2026 the Prince wasn't here. At least not yet. For all you knew, he hadn't even left Maleficent's castle yet. But maybe\u2026 maybe you could\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn some level you knew it wasn't a good idea. You weren't part of the story, you couldn't break the spell. Rose didn't even know you. You would essentially be kissing a sleeping stranger. In the real world, that would be a crime beyond creepy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you weren't in the real world. This was a fairy tale! The rules of the real world didn't apply, did they? What would be the harm? Just a quick\u2026 or long\u2026 kiss with the most beautiful woman you'd ever seen, and then you could figure out what you were gonna do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching her, you cupped her cheek, her skin as soft as silk. Leaning over, you paused only a second to consider if you should go through with it\u2026. Ah, screw it, what's the worst that could happen, right? And with that thought, you pressed your lips to hers, closing your eyes and basking in the wonderful, borderline magical feeling of her mouth on your own. You practically lost track of the world around you. Even if this was all a weird dream, it was a wonderful dream! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then\u2026 wait\u2026 something was wrong\u2026. You opened your eyes in shock as you realized\u2026. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Princess Aurora's mouth is creeping up yours, pulling you closer. You try to pull away, break off the kiss gone wrong, but you can't! Her arms have come up and are holding you still. Slender they may be, but their grip is as tight as steel! Her eyes are still closed, she's still asleep, and your struggles and muffled screams aren't waking her, cannot wake her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really begin to panic as her mouth widens and the lips slip over your eyes, submerging you in darkness, with only the vague outline of perfect teeth surrounding you. Her tongue reaches up and licks your face, tasting each new inch of you that passes into her maw. You try to push away with your legs, throw yourself sideways off the bed, none of its working. The arms begin pushing you forward, funneling you into the princess. Your entire head is now inside, and she's quickly working her way down your neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her sleep, Aurora's dreams are wonderful. She's happy and content with the man she fell in love with, and their wedding is the stuff fairy tales are made of! The best part though\u2026 is the cake! Made by her Fairy Mothers, its a huge chocolate cake with strawberry icing\u2026 and its all for her! She doesn't even feel a little self-conscious as she begins to put the cake where it belongs: Her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sleepy murmurs of appreciation at your taste go unappreciated by you, as her swallows echo around your head. Past the teeth, past the gums, look out stomach, here you come! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should be impossible, but its not! Your entire body is being swallowed, inch by inch, foot by foot, with unrelenting hunger, by this slip of a princess. Your head is outlined in her throat as you are forced downward, before slipping past her breasts into the gastric holding cell below. Even as you stretch her out, even as you make her dress bulge and thrash, it does not tear, and she does not wake. And why would she want to? She's having the best dream of her life! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear as you enter her gut that she had not eaten today. The stomach is hungry and waiting, gurgling and roaring ominously as you are crammed into it. Splashdown. You try to steady yourself with your hands, but the walls are slick, and the muscles keep pushing you back before you gain any ground. Already you feel an uncomfortable warmth where her stomach's juices have touched you. You don't want to think about that right now. You just want to get out of here! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, that's not likely to happen, not for a while at any rate, and certainly not before Sleeping Beauty is done with you. She slurps up your legs, holding your feet in her large, chipmunk cheeks for a few last moments to savor you and then\u2026 Gulp. She sighs and lays back, basking in the sense of fullness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as your feet join you in the dark flesh prison you go completely ape. You throw punches wildly, you kick with all your might, making the stomach bounce and dance. You scream at the top of your lungs. Someone, anyone, help! Please wake up! Please help me! If this is a dream, you desperately want to wake up! If its not, you can only prey the prince gets here before\u2026 before\u2026 Oh god\u2026 You scream again. Please! Please hear me! Princess please! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA momentary gurgle and then\u2026 <b>BUUURRRRPP</b>! A belch to put a dozen truckers to shame, spittle flying across the room\u2026 but still she does not wake. Instead she gives a pleased sigh, pats her massive, dancing gut, and rolls over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that didn't work\u2026 what now genius?  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, that didn't work. You're still stuck here, and worse, her belch pretty much robbed you of all your oxygen. Blearily you try to find some way out. Maybe you can find the entrance to her esophagus and you can crawl out, or at least let more air in! Your hands stumble blindly\u2026 its getting harder to think, and the unsettling feeling on your skin is getting stronger. Is this really it? Is this really the end\u2026 ? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, the princess dreams the sleep of angels, even as her stomach's dance becomes more and more subdued. A set of hand prints appears, pressing desperately from the inside. They press once\u2026 twice\u2026 And with a *glorp* that echoes in the silent chamber, it stills. The princess releases a final, breathy belch, and then her stomach goes about its work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes. How much? Who can say, but certainly the princesses gut smoothes out, growing rounder, then progressively smaller and smaller. It gurgles and groans as it takes apart its special surprise treat to feed the hungry body of the princess. Parts of you plump up her breasts, even more goes to her rear end, and a little bit is spread over various parts and systems. She is a growing young woman after all. Through it all, Aurora smiles\u2026 until\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<span class=\"clgreen\">Pft</span>* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small release, barely audible at all, released a small amount of your new forms new smell. Immediately, Aurora frowned. Good god what was that smell? Could she ignore it? She was so comfy\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>Grrrr</b>**<span class=\"chunter\">PRRRT</span>* A second, louder burst made its way from fattened cheeks. A smell was beginning to creep into the room. Worse, a feeling that was once a pleasant fullness was now an uncomfortable pressure down south. Great. This was going to need to be taken care of, and now, or things would get a lot, lot worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill with eyes closed, still asleep and blind to the outside world, Aurora rose from her bed, feet flinching at the cold stone floor. She shuffled along, her new rear rolling back and forth, squeaky farts escaping to befouled the room with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room had no toilet, nor a chamber pot. It was thought the only occupant of the room would never leave her bed until the promised day her True Love woke her. No one thought some random idiot would come in and feed himself to the hungry girl. There was, however, a window, with a fairly sizable sill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, opening the window, she turned around, pulled her dress up until she felt a cool breeze on her rump, and backed up until she felt the sill on the back of her knees. Thus she sat, her ass hanging out the window. Once she was comfortable, and ready, she stopped holding it in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour release from the darkness of her bowels took the form of a conga line of logs sliding, one after the other, down to the darkness below the tower. They were a rich, dark brown, full of shards of bone, pitted and heavily corroded, not one having survived in one peace. Occasionally, the flow would be interrupted by long, trumpeting farts that, like the horn blowers of the kingdom, heralded more of your arrival. A smell not unlike a septic tank full of corpses emanated from her flawless rear, drifting down on the wind. It might have been possible that your remains might have served as manure\u2026 but the stench of Rose's gas would almost certainly kill any plantlife it came across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes, the flow slowed, and then finally, stopped. But rather then get up, the Princess, who had managed to remain sleeping, even in such an odd position, placed a hand on her gut and pressed down. As she did, her ass opened and released one final, trumpeting gust the echoed for miles around, scaring birds from their perches in the surrounding forest. What had once been your final cries for help, your screams for mercy, and your whispered prayers for salvation had been turned instead into obnoxious, horrifying, foul smell, wet fart. And when it was done, and Aurora's asshole winked closed, disappearing behind her cheeks with a soft clap, she made her way back to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dress fell over her skin, and her covers and bed welcomed her back. And she easily found a comfy position, and went back to her dreams. She never knew you had visited, and after she was awoken, she would have no idea you had come to kiss her, or that she had eaten you, digested you, and excreted you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had once been a whole, living human, with hopes and dreams and a lifetime of experiences. And yet this Disney Princess had easily over powered you and stripped that all away, leaving you without even your dignity, and certainly no body. And she'd done it all in her sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthor's Note: Well, that's all I have planned for this particular plotline, but rather then just end it, I'll leave it open in case anyone else wants to come along and keep it going. Maybe she eats the Prince and starts sleeping walking and eating everything she comes across. Maybe your soul/mind end up trapped either as fat on her body, in your remains which will grow into\u2026 something, or maybe you've become a fart on the wind, and you'll experience new adventures and humiliation. I don't know. Up to you. For me this is the end, but for you, let it be merely the prologue\u2026 </span></div></div>",

But you ARE that colossal dump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassment is soon replaced with pain as you slam into the ground, luckily managing to not break anything. You shuffle around.

Great, and you were hoping you were done with such smells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat exactly is the punishment here? Is this a jail cell? An oubliette? Did the princes plan to just dump you here and then leave and forget about you? You were hoping for a little more mercy but maybe it wouldn't be a very long sentence? If there were guards you could plead your case? Worst case scenario you could always try and escape whatever prison you were in... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora stands and turns to stare down at you. It feels wrong to see eyes you know hold great love and kindness glare at you with such distain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you understood the nature of your punishment yet, criminal?\" She'd never asked for your name. You get the feeling she wouldn't use it even if you told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can see you have not. Very well. From hence forth you are to be assigned to the role of Royal Toilet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? What the Fuck? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour expression must have shown. She giggled. It was far to fond a sound for what she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me. You are now sealed inside this toilet. Whenever I come to relieve myself, I shall do it here. Onto you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to beg. Tell her she can't do this. \"You are so very, very wrong, slave. I have the power here. Not you. My every morning constitutional and late night trip will be yours to enjoy. And you shall stay there for as long as I desire\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...but what about food and water, you ask. Surely if she wants to keep this torture up, she'll have to feed you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks. It looks wrong on her face \"What do you think you're there for, slave?\" She savors your horror, then gestures to the four walls that surround you \"The fairies made this prison, enchanted it. Merryweather did much of the work. Waste will sustain you. You will never grow sick eating it, though I doubt you'll ever learn to enjoy it's taste. It will also keep you alive, so even if you don't eat it, starvation will not free you. Only I can. Of course if the waste piles up enough I can make it disappear from up here. So no letting it rise so high you can reach the top. So unless you want to be swimming in it, I suggest you don't let it get that bad. The smell will also stay down there, no need for me to smell such things after all, not when I have you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will see you every day slave. Likely several times a day. My mother may visit from time to time, but do not expect mercy from her. Who knows, maybe I'll allow my friends to use you. I don't know what fairy bowel movements are like, but I know that can have them. I asked Merryweather. Perhaps I'll show you off to the other princesses I'll meet. I'll certainly figure out how to take you with me when I must travel abroad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in close, eyes narrowed as she glared down at you \"You'll come to know my ass more then you do the faces of your most cherished loved ones. Soon my ass will BE your most cherished loved one. My farts will be the breath of god you welcome into your lungs and my shit mana from heaven.\" She leaned back, and her face was suddenly all smile: gentle, loving and kind. You could almost believe she hadn't just delivered the most bat shit insane evil sentence down upon you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I must be off. There's a party to celebrate my return and then a wedding to the man of my dreams. Everyone in the kingdom is coming it seems. Well...not you obviously. I know that seems harsh. That this might all seem a bit...much. But think of it this way: You'll have a far more intimate relationship with royalty then any other peasant could hope to have. You'll see and hear and learn things no one else will. You won't be able to TELL anyone, of course, but learning can be its own reward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh! Also, think on this: There will be food from across the country at the banquet tonight. And I haven't had a proper meal in a while, so I'm going to try a little bit of everything. So in a way, you'll get to try a little bit of everything too! It's going to be quite a harrowing first day of work for you my little toilet slave, but I'm sure you'll manage. Goodbye!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that cheery farewell, she lowered a lid and sealed you away in darkness. Alone, all you could do was cry, bask in your own smell, and wait...

They're soft, with some give, but also some clear muscle. Merida is no slouch and she clearly works out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take all that information in in under a second; but before you have time to process that \"The Princess Just Pushed Your Face In Her Butt!\" You hear a rumble like a car before a sudden wind strikes your face. Did she just...? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly you're on the ground, gasping for breath, seeking a reprieve from the sheer Foulness that invaded your lungs! Oh god your mouth was open and everything! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you role back and forth feeling someone just took a shit in your nose, Merida is nearly doubled over with laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god yer face!\" She laughs, tears in her eyes. \"I'm glad I chose you for this, I can tell you'll be the righ' man for the job.\" She then grabs your wrist and begins dragging you back towards the castle. You want to struggle but between the lack of fresh air, her iron grip and sheer confusion you end up allowing yourself to be pulled along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she walks Merida begins to explain: Apparently the Queen had decided that her family needed to eat a more \"healthy and balanced\" diet as opposed to just \"meat, meat and more meat\" with the occasional role thrown in. Thus she'd insisted that each meal be accompanied by some terrible new thing. Broccoli, Brussel Sprouts, Cauliflower and other various veg forced their way onto the plate. And recently she'd decided the children needed more dairy to help them grow. And even though Merida was a teen, she'd still gotten served glasses of milk or slices of extremely potent cheese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, she says healthy, but it feels like there's a bar fight goin on in me bowels half the time now!\" She complained as she dragged you up a flight of stairs. You'd entered the castle and had managed to avoid seeing anyone, so you still couldn't find someone to help you escape her iron grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she practically jogged up the stairs, presumably to her room, you struggled to keep up. Suddenly, your foot caught a step wrong and you fell forward. Knocking into Merida, she tipped forward as well. She released your hand and managed to catch herself on the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the other hand, landed face first into the Scottish lass's ass. The sudden jarring impact seemed to shake something loose in her because-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPHHHHHHHHHHHRRRRRRRRTT!!!!</span>&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell was so powerful you were surprised you weren't flung back. The potent fog of rectal stink flooded the stairwell. Even Merida looked a little disgusted <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erguh, smells like Angus' stable. See, this is why I need your help! Now quit foolin around!\" She grabbed your collar and pulled you to your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were seeing spots. How? How could any one fart smell so bad? How could a human body produce such a smell? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi! Don't you pass out on me! I am not haulin' your arse up these steps! We're nearly to ma room, so stay with me! </span></div></div>",

Near the way was a massive bed fit for...well a princess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what exactly was this favor you wanted from me again? And why did it require you fart in my face? Did you want me to try talking to the queen to get her to change the foods she's making you eat?\" You were so confused and nauseous and confused. One minute you were in your own home and the next you were smell a Disney's princesses ass. Were you on drugs? You don't remember taking any, but that might explain things... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerida snorted before going over to a desk in the corner and rooting around the drawers \"Psh, nah. If I canna convince her I doubt she'd listen to some random nobody\" she chuckled wondering just how her mother would react. It certainly wouldn't be pleasant for the nobody. \"No, you're going to help solve me problem another way. All I need you to do...\" As she spoke she pulled out a locked box, which she quickly opened with a key she'd apparently been keeping around her neck, hidden beneath her dress. From it she produced a small, innocent looking cake pastry \"Is eat this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the pastry, then back at her expectant face. You recalled how in the movie a single pastry could cause quite a lot of problems. \"I'm sorry, but how is me turning into a bear gonna cure your terrible farts?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerida sputtered, her face turning as red as her hair \"How do you know about that? No, never mind I dannae care. It won't turn you into a bear. I promise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised an eyebrow \"O..k...so what does it do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll make things easier, trust me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, yeah, but see the thing is... I don't...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly frustrated she thrust the cake at you one last time \"Trust me, you're helping whether you eat this cake or not. It'll just be easier to solve the problem if you do. So what's it gonna be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the cake, you look it over, as though trying to divine its secrets without having to ingest it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So you've probably noticed just how bad ma gas is.\" She laughed, cracking off another toot *Pfrt*, causing you to wiggle even harder. \"I can't convince mom to change the menu, she's dead set on us eating 'healthy'. So if I cannot change what goes in one hole, I need to change what comes out the other. *Brrmpt* I can't just hold in me farts all the time, it makes me feel all bloated and sore. And I cannae just pop a cork up me bum either. Nah, I needed something a little more sophisticated...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she's been talking you've been dying. The heat and pressure would be bad enough, you're already sweating. But the smell, these tiny farts she's been letting slip, have rendered the air around you into a foul and funky fog. The stink is mixing with your sweat and clinging to your skin. If you get out of here, you're going to need a lot of showers. When. When you get out of here. You have to stay hopeful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hope was getting a lot harder to hold onto the longer Merida talked. You began to have a creeping dread you knew what her plan was. You just prayed you were wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerida finally shifted to the side and grabbed her tiny prize. Bringing him to her face, she scrunched her nose at your smell. \"Anyway, to make a long story short, I'm gonna cram you up ma stink hole so you can breathe up all me farts. Alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stomach dropped. You'd guessed by hearing it said \"WHAT!\" You screamed \"You can't be serious! I'll-I'll die in there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just rolled her eyes at you \"Don't be so dramatic, ya big baby\" she chided, as though she wasn't planning to shove a human being into one of the grossest places imaginable. \"You'll go up inside me, and sniff up all ma farts, so that none will sneak out my rear and stink up the place. It's the perfect plan! And since I gave you that magic cake, you're totally invulnerable. You won't die huffing my fumes. You don't need to eat or drink anymore either. I mean, you can still if you want, but I don't think you're gonna find another cake where you're going!\" She laughed and you struggled not to vomit at the idea of eating anything you found up this girls ass. \"Heck, ya won't even age while you're up there. I've made you immortal, you should be thanking me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of being in Merida's ass soaking up all of her farts forever was almost certainly a special type of hell. \"Please\" you beg, breaking down and beginning to cry \"Just turn me back and let me go. I'll do anything else. Just not this. Anything but this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerida sighed </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Quite yer cryin'. Are you a man or not!\" She stood and began hiking her dress up with one hand, keeping a firm grip on you with the other. \"The only way you'll be turned back is if I say the special magic words.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, what would those words be?\" You asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked \"Nice try.\" She gave an odd wiggle; it apparently wasn't easy exposing her butt from her dress one handed. But it seems she'd finally managed to get what passed for underwear down enough and her dress up enough that she was ready for the next step in her plan \"Let's get you tucked away in your new home shall we? You should feel lucky. Royal accommodations!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she moved you around back. Her ass was paler then the rest of her. But you could see a sheen of sweat on it, it must be warm under that dress. She pressed you into the cheeks, so soft and warm, and already the smell was strong here. Then she pushed deeper, shoving you through her crack and down towards the backdoor. Your face smeared with sweat and grim. While you didn't see any traces of past meals...yet, you knew that was an inevitability where you were going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you saw it: Her brown eye. The stink vault. Her asshole. Pink mostly but with flecks of brown. The stench was stronger here. The hole seemed to twitch and swell, as though it sensed your presence and was eager to make you part of it. And in the next second you were shoved face first into it. At first it resisted, the muscle unused to having things go IN to it. But Merida was persistent, and slowly but surely you were worked into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your head broke through to the other side you gasped. However bad her farts were once they'd left, inside her ass was somehow even worse. The dark walls were coated in slime and layer upon layer of fecal matter. A lifetime's worth of meals had journeyed down this tunnel and left their mark. Another push and most of your torso joined you. It was a tight fit, you could barely move. You tried to shout but got only a lungful of the foulest stench. You coughed and gagged, but there was no clean air to replace the bad. Not here. Never here. This is where stink was born, this was where stink lived. It was where you lived now too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA final shove and your legs and feet joined the rest of you. Merida's fingers gave a final push to make sure you were really in there, then they slipped out. The hole closed behind them, sealing you in darkness and the all consuming smell of the Scottish Princess's bowels. A few clenches worked you in even deeper, and you wept at the thought that you might never work your way back to the exit. You screamed but you didn't know if Merida could here you outside. All you could hear was the sounds of her body. The sounds of her guts working to transform her last meal into more stink and waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a great gurgling came from farther along in the dark tunnel and the whole thing shifted and quivered. And then suddenly you were being battered about the face by a whirlwind of stink. It was one of Merida's farts, freshly brewed by her intestines and ready to escape and befouled the air around her bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly it couldn't. Your body was almost a perfect fit, and it couldn't properly squeak by you. You breathed in and immediately vomited. This was what Merida wanted. You were going to breathe in this fart, and all the farts that came after. Either you'd suck all this foulness into your lungs, or at worst the tiniest amount might slip by, but so little as to be unnoticeable. And then you'd do it again. And again. For each and every potential ass blast until Merida was at last satisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Merida snapped her underwear back into place and lowered her dress back down. She could feel your desperate struggles and could only imagine how bad it must be in there. She almost felt bad for you... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she felt a fart coming down the pipe and braced herself...and nothing. She definitely noticed your struggles had increased. But no fart made its foul presence known. She grinned widely. It had worked! You were breathing up her farts before they could come out! Yes! She rubbed the spot where she thought she could feel you fondly. Definitely worth it... </span></div></div>",

Before we go any further, I need you to eat this, right now. That is the favor I want from you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 but why?

Now\u2026 Eat. The. Pie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused and more than a little intimidated by Merida you take the pie from her and quickly devour it. It\u2019s sweet, and doesn\u2019t actually taste that bad. Not great, but there\u2019s definitely a certain tingly aftertaste\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait\u2026 tingly aftertaste! \u201cWas that a magic pie?\u201d You ask, growing alarmed. She\u2019d promised it wouldn\u2019t turn you into a bear, but that didn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerida says nothing, just watching you intently. In a few seconds you realize what the magic is doing to you. It\u2019s\u2026.</span></div></div>",
