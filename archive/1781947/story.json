Not exactly stormy, where everything was flying everywhere, but the winds certainly weren't as tame as they usually were. Naruto was making his way back home, shivering just a small bit as another breeze blew by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I gotta get home...\" He mumbled softly, picking up speed. Just as his apartment complex came into view, something slapped him in the face. \"What the!?\" As the blonde pulled the piece of paper off of his face. Before crumbling it, he decided to at least glance over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u>Ichiraku Ramen</u><br>\r\nFREE RAMEN FOR LIFE!</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had to do a double take as he looked at the ticket. He inspected it, even pinching himself to see if it was a dream! \"Whoa, is this for real!?\" He asked himself, still in disbelief. There was only one way to find out! Turning around, Naruto made his way to Ichiraku Ramen to confirm it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchiraku wasn't very busy today. Teuchi and his daughter Ayame were bored. It was nothing less of a slow day. At least it was, until Naruto burst onto the scene! He had the ticket gripped tight in his fist as he walked to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto!\" Teuchi greeted with a smile, \"Good to see you! What can I get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, old man Ichiraku...\" Naruto said, holding no regard for Teuchi's name. \"Is this for real?\" He asked, a bit of childish excitement in his eyes as he awaited an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeuchi grabbed the scrap of paper from the boy. Looking over it carefully, he instantly recognized it. \"Oh hey... I wondered where this went... I made this as a joke between me and Ayame today...\" He chuckled a little, \"Man we were bored... It must of blown out of the shack while we weren't looking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was looking at Teuchi, a little bit of hurt, but a little bit of hope still in his eyes. \"S-So is it still good...?\" He asked weakly.</span></div></div>",

Upon hearing that, Naruto almost exploded with excitement. Running around with his arms in the air, this was a dream come true for the young ninja. After almost a full minute of celebrating, Naruto sat down and asked for the biggest bowl of ramen they have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeuchi then came back with the largest bowl of ramen Naruto had seen in his life. It was almost a foot in length and in width. It was filled to the brim with ramen and Naruto couldn't wait to dig into it. He then started slurping it down like a mad man and there was no signs of him stopping or slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeuchi wasn't really surprised or stunned by this since Naruto eats tons of ramen all the time. Once Naruto was done, his stomach was slightly poking out of his jacket and was barely growing while he was drinking the brine. \"That was amazing!\" Naruto exclaimed. \"I can't believe I can get free ramen for life at Ichiraku's now! From now own, Ichiraku's ramen is the only thing I'm ever going to eat!\" Naruto thought to himself. He continued this trend for...</span></div></div>",

His stomach was slightly bigger, and his face looked just a tiny bit chubbier but other than that he was the same old Naruto. Right now it was lunch time for the blonde ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey old man Ichiraku! Time for the second meal of the day, so hit me!\" Naruto shouted. \"Of course Naruto, but can I ask you something?\" Teuchi said. \"Shoot.\" Naruto replied. \"Are you really sure you want ramen for every meal, every day? I know you love ramen, but it can't be the only thing you ever have. Plus it's not very healthy and I can tell you're packing on a few pounds there.\" The old man said pointing at Naruto's bigger gut. \"Don't worry about it old man! Just because I'm gaining weight doesn't mean I'm becoming unhealthy. Plus I'm the greatest ninja ever! I can just lose this by training more often. No amount of fat can keep the future hokage down!\" Naruto proudly said.

To make matters worse, Ichiraku's started selling kits to make ramen on missions. Kits Naruto was getting for free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the last month, Naruto had gained 35 pounds, and his stomach was really starting to push against his jacket. His sensei noticed this. He also noticed the increased food had increased his chakra, increased his control, and most importantly, decreased the amount of demonic chakra circulating through the young Uzumaki's system. It seems the fat was acting as an additional filter for the foxes' chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSO, what should Kakashi do?</span></div></div>",

They weren't some mushy, best friends forever pair, no. They were more like your stereotypical \"bros.\" They ripped on each other, sure, but one always knew they had the other's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until Black Star started to <i>really</i> started to play on Soul's nerves. He was cool with Black Star's ocassional boasting, after all, it was part of who he was. He didn't mind when he beat him in arm wrestling now and again, or when Black Star tried showing off all the new moves he was learning. No, it was when Black Star's body started to develop slightly. His muscles got a little bit more tone to them, and not to mention he was growing hair all over his... you know what! You know. His underarms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a regular day in class, for the most part. The day when Soul realized that he couldn't take much more, and had to take Black Star down a peg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Soul! Come on! You wanna touch it!?\" Black Star asked excitedly, lifting his armpit to Soul's face. A lone, curly blue hair was there, and it was that hair that had only boosted Black Star's confidence even higher than what it was. The immediate musk repeled Soul away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, put your arms down!\" Soul demanded, waving his hand at Black Star's pit. The blue haired boy just chuckled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I <i>have</i> been working out a lot... But I bet you could probably tell, huh?\" Black Star said with a cocky smirk, flexing his strong arm for his friend. \"And check this out!\" Black Star lifted up his shirt, where his abs were just slightly more outlined that Soul remembered. \"I'm getting all kinds of big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul just rolled his eyes and groaned. Normally, he would have just played along and stroked the young ninja's ego, but he had to put up with this every day, in every class. At lunch. After school. One time, Black Star had even called him in the middle of the night to boast about how he thought he was getting facial hair! Soul really couldn't take much more of it. He had to think of something, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Black Star had taken his shirt off and started to show off his back, Soul heard two guys not far off talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I think I've gained a little weight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? No way! You don't look any bigger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure? Still... Kinda hurts my confidence, y'know? Gotta stay fly for the ladies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul heard them slap high fives, as he then turned his attention back to Black Star. \"Huh... So even guys complain about their weight?\" Soul asked himself. He hadn't really thought about it since he never really had any weight problems of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Doctor Stein came in, and everyone was seated. It didn't take long for another one of his psychotic lessons to ensue. As the teacher rambled, Soul began to think up a nasty plot to knock Black Star down a peg or two. At least enough to get him to stop bragging all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, much later, once school was over, the two boys, Soul and Black Star, were walking through Death City together. Soul's eyes were darting around, trying to block out Black Star the best he could for the time being. Black Star was, of course, showing off once again. \"Hey Soul! Did you see my abs?\" He asked, lifting his shirt again to show his friend. Just then, it caught Soul's eye. A flyer in a window of one of Death City's best restaurants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Death Row Full Course Deluxe!<br>\r\nTo those who can even finish this MASSIVE meal<br>\r\nWill find it entirely FREE of charge!</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul's shark-toothed grin slid across his face. \"Hey, Black Star, check this out.\" He said, pointing at the flyer. \"Death Row Deluxe... Wanna try it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star tilted his head for a moment as he looked at it. \"I guess it sounds interesting...\" As Soul heard this, he was a bit discouraged, but he had a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a shame...\" He said, \"I heard Kid ate one of these, no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssh, yeah, he probably had Liz and Patty help him!\" Black Star laughed it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? You saying the man who would surpass God can't handle a little food challenge?\" Soul said, goading Black Star on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shaddup! You know I could do it!\" Black Star barked back, punching Soul's arm a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why don't you prove it!?\" Soul said, punching right back. \"Show that stuck up little punk that you're three times the man he is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw that!\" Black Star said, \"I'll show him I'm SIX times the man he is! I'll take down two of these meals, and I can bet you I can do it in under an hour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul grinned. His plan was a success. He and Black Star shook hands. \"Sounds like we have a bet.\" He said, leading Black Star in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two Death Row Deluxes!\" Black Star announced as he came in. The man at the counter, smoking a cigarette chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, two? You're just a kid. That meal is gonna be the death of 'ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna see!?\" Black Star snapped back, seating himself as a nearby booth, Soul sliding in across from him. \"Bring it on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man just laughed again, the rest of the restaurant's patrons shocked at such a notion made by such a small child.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even with all the disbelief, Black Star was still a customer. He had to be treated fairly! Kicking back, since the food would take a little longer than most meals, he smiled at Soul, trying to show off those three tiny hairs he had under his arms that were barely visible. Soul immediately plugged his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! You haven't even taken a shower yet!\" He said, clearly annoyed. \"You're gonna gross out the customers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his nose plugged, Soul didn't even know that there was no smell! \"So what!?\" Black Star replied, \"They can learn what a future god smells like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was clearly annoyed, and thus, the two boys didn't have much conversation for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... So you really think you can do it?\" Soul asked, adding bits of pressure that would only push Black Star further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you hear me the first time? I'm gonna take down two of these things!\" Black Star said, arms still behind his head arrogantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those last words, the first course was brought to Black Star. It was a simple hors d'voures of finger sandwiches. Black Star laughed at the measely meal. \"Hah! This is gonna be a snap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man who served him, who was the same one at the counter earlier just grinned darkly at Black Star. \"Go ahead. Take a bite then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star didn't have to be told twice! He picked up the white bread sandwich, and brought it to his lips. Taking just one bite, he hardly savored it's flavor as he gulped it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see what--\" Black Star suddenly grunted, holding his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Black Star?\" Soul asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Damn! What the hell was that!? It feels like a baseball just landed in my stomach!\" Black Star said, looking up at the waiter with a scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told 'ya it wouldn't be easy, kid.\" He replied, \"It's called 'Death Row' for a reason. You eat too much and you're bound to explode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star, rather than frowning, actually cracked a grin. \"So if I finish this, I'll be known as the man that beat death, huh?\" He said in a cocky tone. \"Then give me your worst!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Black Star started to down the sandwhiches, slowly at first, but as soon as he grew used to the feeling in his stomach. In less than two minutes, he had the whole plate downed. Just to shame the waiter, who was still standing by, he licked it clean of even the bread crumbs, before letting out a loud burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next!\" He said, using his fingernail to pick at his teeth. The waiter nodded, taking the plate away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, not bad!\" Soul told his friend. He, of course, had been watching the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star just grinned a confident grin. \"It's gonna take more than that to beat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat, the next course was brought out. A long rack of ribs, covered in barbeque laid out before him. Black Star just grinned as he felt his appetite rush back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is more like it!\" Was all the blue ninja said, before diving in, tearing through the ribs. The meat was practically falling off the bone! He started sticking the bones in his mouth, one by one, like a well-oiled machine. The meat slid off and down his throat, filling out his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that Soul noticed a bit of a tent forming in Black Star's shirt. Slowly, his plan was coming to fruition...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the ribs safely stowed away in his stomach, Black Star pat his gut. \"Ah... Man, that was great!\" He sighed, wiping his face on his forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You full yet?\" Soul asked, smiling at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, kinda...\" He said, noticing how his stomach had swollen out just slightly. Before either of them could say another word, the next course was brought out; three huge burgers, one angus, one triple decker cheeseburger with bacon, and finally a classic burger, with beef that looked as if the cow was on steroids! Each came with a large order of fries. At this point, Black Star was also brought a complimentary drink that would be refilled the moment it was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy!\" The waiter said, grinning, \"Not many men can finish this course, let alone some child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star ignored the man's taunts, and lifted up one of the burger with meat and bacon to his mouth, taking a huge bite out of it. Chewing it up, he swallowed it, grunting as he felt something five times bigger hit his gut. He wasn't going to give up so easily!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Black Star continued to eat, Soul only watched on. With each bite of the burger, Black Star's stomach seemed to push out just a little further. Soul grinned as he saw this, as Black Star gulped down each bite. Little by little, like a balloon filling with water, Black Star's girth was expanding. He went from having a tight stomach to a little chubby kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlurping his drink down, Black Star took a big breath. \"Got it down!\" He said, handing the platter off. As the waiter exited back into the kitchen, Black Star turned to Soul. \"Hey... I'm getting kinda full... You mind helping me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Soul was a bit surprised, but soon regained his composition. \"What? You're telling me the great Black Star can't surpass a shinigami? I can just see it now...\" Soul shrugged his shoulders, feining disappointment. \"Black Star couldn't even beat the Death Row meal? What a wimp!\" Soul then said, mocking Death the Kid's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star blushed a little, as his nose wrinkled up in anger. \"Fine! I'll show him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meals kept on coming. A plate of porkchops. Wolfed down. Half a tray of lasagna. Torn to shreds. Two large ramen bowls with all the fix-ins. Gulped down 'til they were empty. Pushed on by his own ego, Black Star kept downing meals, much to Soul's surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Black Star's gut had begun to fill, growing filled with food. Soul could only see from above, but below the table, his shirt had slowly risen up. After the porkchops, a strip of his softened flesh was visible. By the lasagna, you could just barely see his naval. Not to mention his pants were increasingly tight. With the ramen, which made his soft stomach bounce with broth, the button on his pants was stretched to it's limits, just short of bursting. Black Star practically looked pregnant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was a dozen tacos. Black Star groaned unhappily, his stomach feeling as if it would burst. As if by instinct, his hands picked up the taco and he began to eat. At this point, he was rubbing his stomach, which helped ease the pain slightly. Each bite made his belly press out just a little further. By about the seventh taco, Black Star winced as his gut was pinned painfully behind the button. Just as his hands were about to move down and undo the button, it flew off like a bullet, just missing Soul's leg! Black Star now let out a big sigh, his stomach taking up the room immediately, as well as unzipping his pants. He began to eat once more, with renewed vigor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished off the last of the tacos, he let out another burp that actually shook his drink! He gave his manly gut a firm slap, looking up at the waiter. \"That all you got!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta admit, kid, you got spunk! Hope you're ready for dessert!\" He said, returning to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Soul, it's not so bad... You kinda get used to the swollen feel.\" Black Star said, talking to his friend. Soul had to admit, he was impressed! He was staring at Black Star's round stomach, almost as if admiring it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star laughed, shaking his stomach a little, playing with his friend. Soon the man returned, setting down a large dish. It was a whole pie, a la mode! Piled with vanilla ice cream, chocolate, and strawberry, whipped cream piled atop of that, garnished with chocolate sprinkles, and of course, a cherry on top! All of it had a generous helping of butterscotch syrup over it! Black Star actually drooled as he felt his appetite return once more! Grabbing up a fork, he began to dig in once more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly everyone in the restaruant was watching, eagar to see if some kid could actually do it!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Black Star powered through the pie, ignoring any tension and pain he felt in his stomach. Halfway through the pie, he stopped using the fork, shoveling huge chunks of pie into his mouth with his hands. With each passing chunk, his already overstuffed belly began to advance farther out, getting closer to the table. Finally, he took the last bite, and his stomach touched the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul watched in pure surprise as Black Star shot fists into the air, causing his belly to wobble, proclaiming, \"I'm the biggest thing ever! That was pretty easy, though\" as the small crowd cheered and praised him, only doubling his already immense ego. Soul recoiled a bit, pinching his nose, as Black Star's armpits were now exposed again. Soul couldn't help but feel happy for Black Star, but more importantly, he was happy with the amount of progress that he was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the waiter had come, saying, \"Wow! I've never seen a kid do this before!\" Black Star, egotistical as ever, responded with a, \"I told ya it would be easy. I am very big after all.\" Then he flexed his arm and patted his belly proudly. At that point, Soul noticed that the waiter was carrying another plate of the tiny sandwiches. \"What are those for?\" Soul asked. The waiter then turned back to Black Star, \"You did order two, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star stared back blankly, then he realized that he did, before playing it off and taking it as another challenge, cockily saying, \"Of course I did! I'm too big for just one!\" The waiter left, then Black Star stared at his meal, as his fullness had hit him at that point. Black Star then asked Soul, \"Hey Soul, do you think you can finish one? I definitely can, but I can't just hog it all!\"</span></div></div>",
