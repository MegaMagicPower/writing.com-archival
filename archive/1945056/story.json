Born with the power of Chaos, you have the potential to become the strongest of the Uchiha to ever exist. Ever since you were born, you lived in a world with bandits, assassins, danger beasts, and the Empire itself, though you weren\u2019t raised in the Capitol, far from it. But things would only prove to be a constant struggle for you. At the age of seven, powerful demons ravaged and butchered your clan. It was only due to the combined effort from your mother, father, and your older brother Itachi that they were sealed away. But since that day, you\u2019ve been on your own, seeking revenge no matter the cost. You constantly trained yourself, and 11 years later, you had become very powerful, your hatred continued to drive you to avenge your clan, and revive it finding someone to be at your side. But your hatred had hardened you, and you only desired someone powerful beside you. You had no idea if you would ever find that person, but eventually you traveled to the Capitol to join the Imperial Force, who was your best bet of finding that someone. You happened to be in luck, when a tournament was announced by Esdeath, the Capital\u2019s strongest. You decided to enter to sharpen your skills, seeing the competition, you knew using your weapons on them would be a waste of time, you wouldn\u2019t need them. Despite the reward of winning the tournament would be prized in cash, you didn\u2019t even care about that. You were just hoping to be entertained.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But you noticed you weren\u2019t the only one who wasn\u2019t impressed, looking up into the shaded part of the stands, Esdeath was bored herself. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSo, that\u2019s Esdeath. She is beautiful, but I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing her power for myself.\u201d</span> you thought. Up in the rafters, a member of Esdeath\u2019s team, the Jaegers, was with her discussing the battle. You may not have been able to hear them from this distance, but you could read lips. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cWhat do you think of them?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSince they\u2019re boring subjects, the battle itself is boring as well. I guess it was expecting too much to expect one capable using an Imperial Arms.\u201d </span>The crowd began to cheer as the sword wielder won. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cOh, it seems they\u2019ve chosen a winner.\u201d</span> The announcer had announced the winner and soon you were called to fight, along with a muscular man. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cThis next battle is the last match.\"</span> You stood in the ring, looking at this man and you thought he could at least entertain you. <i>\u201cOn the east side\u2026Kalbi the butcher! And on the west side\u2026Sasuke, the wanderer!\u201d</i> The crowd cheered as Esdeath observed you. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cIt looks like one of them is still a young man, maybe a year or two younger than you.\u201d</span> You looked at the butcher as he towered above you trying to intimidate you. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYou\u2019re quite small, aren\u2019t you? Guess I\u2019ll be taking home the prize money!\u201d</span> he said laughing. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI may have been excommunicated, but I\u2019m still a ninth-level master at Koukenji.\u201d </span>You looked at him without even flinching, not a glint of fear in your eyes. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Too frightened to speak?\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cTry to entertain me. Otherwise you will be a waste of my time.\u201d</span> <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWhat?!\u201d</span> The announcer had started the fight not three seconds after that. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cHave a full course of my explosive fist!\u201d</span> As he tried to land a punch to you, simply jumping in the air was enough to avoid it, but he did have some impressive strength, you had o give him that much credit. As you descended you landed a kick to him that, even though he blocked it, he was nearly forced out of the ring. This pissed him off and he kept attacking you with speed instead of power, you were easily able to block his attacks, even without your Sharingan. You easily exploited an opening and landed a powerful punch to is stomach, and he really got pissed off. He tried to crush you with both fists, but you easily tripped him with a sweeping kick. As he fell, you jumped up and kicked him in the face, slamming him to the walls outside the ring. Esdeath saw this and was impressed. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cThat young man is outstandingly talented.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYeah.\u201d</span> The announcer called it, proclaiming you the winner, causing the crowd to cheer. And despite the fight being so short, you found enough entertainment to smile, and the instant Esdeath saw that, she had a blush on her face looking at you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWe\u2019ve found him.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cA candidate for an Imperial Arms user, I presume?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThat, as well. But also\u2026\u201d</span> she said walking down towards you. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cCommander?\u201d</span> You noticed her approach you, and soon she was about six feet from you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSasuke\u2026That\u2019s your name, right? It\u2019s a nice name.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThanks.\u201d</span> You looked at her and thought. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI can feel how strong she is now that she\u2019s closer. I have to admit, its almost intimidating.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYour win just now was magnificent. I\u2019d like to give you a reward.\u201d</span> she said reaching into her shirt and walking towards you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThank you very much.\u201d</span> you said trying to give such a warrior some respect. But you were surprised when she put a shackle around your neck with the mark on her chest emblazoned on it. She looked into your eyes and placed a hand on your shoulder. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cFrom now on, you\u2019ll belong to me.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWh-What??\u201d </span>She started to pull you along and you fell over in surprise. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIt\u2019s too distracting out here. Come to my palace.\u201d</span> She said practically dragging you along. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cW-wait, hold on!\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNo, I wont wait.\u201d</span> She said yanking the chain and as your head went past her hand, she chopped you in he back of the neck, knocking you out, but before you lost consciousness you thought to yourself. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat the hell just happened??\u201d</span> As you fell she caught you on her shoulder, and she was completely infatuated with you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cLet\u2019s talk in my room, just the two of us.\u201d</span> She said picking you up, and taking you there to be alone. What on earth have you gotten yourself into now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you did, you noticed you were chained to a chair, and there were people standing around you.<span class=\"cyellow\"> \u201cOh, looks like he\u2019s awake.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cCaptain, he\u2019s waking up.\u201d </span>You soon felt a hand on your cheek. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHello, Sasuke. Enjoy your nap?\u201d </span>You looked at her as you loosened your neck muscles a bit.<span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cNice as it was, I would have preferred if you didn\u2019t knock me out like that.\u201d</span> you said in a way that sounded you were more inconvenienced than anything else. After taking a small look around you could easily but two and two together that these people were the Jaegers. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSo, you\u2019re the Jaegers. A pleasure.\u201d</span> Each of them began to introduce themselves to you. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cMy name\u2019s Wave.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI\u2019m Bols. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201d</span> <span class=\"crose\">\u201cI\u2019m Doctor Stylish.\u201d </span>the man in the lab coat said with a flourish. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cSeryu Ubiquitous. It\u2019s great to meet you! And this is Coro\u201d</span> she said saluting you, and even the small dog greeted you. <span class=\"clred\">\u201cKurome.\u201d</span> the girl said eating her snacks. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cAnd my name\u2019s Run. It\u2019s nice to make your acquaintance.\u201d</span> he said with a little bow. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNow that you\u2019ve been properly introduced. I have something to say. As you know, I told you all that I came to the Capital that one reason I returned was to fall in love. That said, Sasuke will not only be a backup for the Jaegers, but my lover, as well. Among the members here, do any of you have a spouse or significant other?\u201d </span>To the surprise of a few of you, Bols raised his hand.<span class=\"cnavy\"> \u201cHuh?!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cIs that true, Mr. Bols?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYep. I\u2019ve been married for six years. She\u2019s so perfect, I cant believe she\u2019s with me!\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThen I must ask, Bols\u2026What should I do in order to capture Sasuke\u2019s heart?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cThe trick to capturing your beloved\u2019s heart\u2026Never give up! I, myself, was rejected twice\u2026 But I got another chance, and that\u2019s when she finally became mine! Bear in mind that it does take some time.\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHmm\u2026I see.\u201d</span> she said writing this stuff down. You chuckled a bit, amused by all this. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cEsdeath, you flatter me, and I admit you do have qualities I like. But don\u2019t expect me to hand over my heart so easily. Now, if you all wouldn\u2019t mind, I\u2019d back up a bit.\u201d</span> They were confused by your words until you broke your chains, causing a section of it to fly over their heads into a wall. As you stood up, you moved your arms a bit to loosen them up. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMuch better.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWhoa, impressive strength.\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cChains aren\u2019t a problem for me. That said, I have a slight problem with the term \u2018backup\u2019 as if I am not strong enough.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI see. I will have your strength tested tomorrow, but for now, I\u2019d like you to just observe tonight\u2019s first mission for the Jaegers.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSounds fair.\u201d</span> Esdeath then explained that the mission was to eliminate a stronghold ran by a bunch of bandits, and that you were all to leave immediately, leaving via horseback. By the time night had fallen, you and the others arrived, but you had to stay back with Esdeath on a small mountain, while the others went to attack. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI still wish I could have went into the fight as well.\u201d</span> you said sitting beside her, watching the team to see what they can do. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cObserving their operation will be good for you.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI see. Very well then.\u201d </span>you said in a stubborn manner, and Esdeath placed her hand on top of yours, blushing a bit, which was unexpected. Just then you heard the alarm from the fortress and watched closely. Apparently Seryu has metal arms that can be changed when her Imperial Arms, Coro bites down on them, and her first weapon was a drill, cutting through the enemy, before changing into a small cannon to destroy the doors. You noticed Stylish moving in that flourished manner, so it was safe to assume he was bragging about creating those weapons. Kurome went in slicing the enemy apart with great speed and skill, Wave wasn\u2019t doing to bad either, backing her up, even though she didn\u2019t need it. Bols used his Imperial Arms flamethrower, Purgatory\u2019s Invitation: Rubicante, to set the whole damn thing ablaze, as Run used his winged Imperial Arms, Thousand-Mile Flight: Mastema,  to eliminate any who ran, by firing sharpened feathers through their heads. As they finished, the walked out from the inferno and towards your location. Needless to say you were impressed. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIncredible.\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSasuke\u2026\u201d</span> You turned your attention towards her.<span class=\"clblue\"> \u201cI shall train you myself. Eventually, you\u2019ll be able to do that much.\u201d</span> You smiled a little towards her. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou\u2019re rather kind.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAm I different from what you expected? To be honest, this is my first time experiencing these feelings\u2026Being in love. But it isn\u2019t bad.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI am honored to receive training from you of all people, but do not assume I cannot cause large amounts of destruction myself. I\u2019m stronger than you think. I will prove that much tomorrow.\u201d</span> She smiled at you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI look forward to seeing your strength. Come, it\u2019s time we returned to the Capital.\u201d </span>She said walking to the rendezvous point with the Jaegers, you following behind, once the team had been reunited, you all returned to the capital.</span></div></div>",

Needless to say, this was the first time since your clan\u2019s demise you were nervous, not helped by the fact the shower was within your line of sight, the glass door showing her silhouette . <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cDamn it, how am I nervous? I\u2019ve fought danger beasts, assassins and bandits. Yet I\u2019m almost sweating here. Keep calm Sasuke. Just stay calm.\u201d </span>you thought to yourself. After a few minutes, Esdeath came out of the shower, she was wearing next to nothing. Just a shirt that was short and revealed a good amount of her breasts. Despite JUST getting yourself calm again, you were instantly blushing from the sight of this. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSorry for making you wait.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI-it\u2019s fine.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d</span> she said sitting down. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cN-no, I\u2019m fine.\u201d </span>you said slightly moving away. She looked over to you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHmm? Are you nervous?\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cN-No!\u201d</span> you said trying to keep your pride. Esdeath smiled with a blush as well. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYou really are a cute one. Well, I\u2018m not quite sure what to do in this situation, either. But I\u2018m sure we\u2018ll figure it out, as long as we know what we want.\u201d</span> You looked at her, and thought for a moment after calming yourself. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cListen, I\u2019d like to ask you something. First off\u2026Esdeath, you like me, correct?\u201d</span> Before you could react, she kissed you full on the lips, and used a little of her strength to force you on your back. Crawling over you a bit. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIf I didn\u2019t like you, I wouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u201d</span> You were blushing more from the fact she had stolen your first kiss, and is on top of you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cTh-then I\u2019d like you to hear my request.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOh? What is it? Tell me. Say it clearly, so I can hear you.\u201d </span>You looked her straight in the eyes. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAs it is now, I hate the capital.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">It\u2019s natural for many to people feel that way. What of it?\u201d </span>As she spoke she kept that smile on her face. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIf I\u2019m to fight, I refuse to fight for the empire, nor do I wish to join the revolutionary army. I fight for my own reasons. And if the capital and empire get in my way, I will take them apart.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSasuke\u2026\u201d</span> In an instant she slapped you, much to your surprise. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhat the hell are you thinking, saying that to a general of the capital\u2019s army?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI realize my words may not be rational, but I have my reasons. If you side with the capital in that moment, then\u2026\u201d </span>Esdeath had stopped your words in their tracks by placing her hand on your other cheek, and licks where she slapped you before wrapping her arms around you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that. All you have to do is stay here with me.\u201d</span> she then looked you in the eyes. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI understand that you\u2019ve endured a lot in the past. But from now on, I won\u2019t let anything harm you.\u201d </span>She then moved back a little, resting her hands on her lap. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAnd I won\u2019t take any other lovers. I consider you my only man. And I won\u2019t ever let you feel lonely.\u201d</span> You were extremely surprised at her words, but you looked down, unable to meet her gaze. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019m happy you feel that way about me, but it\u2019s no good\u2026 This isn\u2019t about my happiness, not right now.\u201d </span>Esdeath did have an expression showing worry on her face. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIs it your family? I\u2019ll have them placed under my protection.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIt isn\u2019t that. Look, I have my reasons for fighting, and it is true I want a somewhat peaceful life and environment. To live my life as I see fit, outside the capital. I have a war to fight that concerns the fate of every man, woman and child.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSasuke\u2026\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cCan you possibly understand that?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI do not understand. I cannot understand how the weak feel.\u201d</span> You knew she meant ordinary people, but you weren\u2019t happy to hear that. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThe universal law is survival of the fittest. The weak are eliminated by natural selection. Those who die are weak.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cTh-Then, if you are going to stand in my way, the love you desire cannot be!\u201d </span>you said standing on the bed. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIf you do have feelings for me, I beg you to try to understand!\u201d</span> She looked at you blushing. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cEven that expression is nice.\u201d </span>she thought. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHowever\u2026That won\u2019t happen.\u201d </span>She stood up pointing at you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand our situation! You aren\u2019t the one who will change me. You are the one I shall change. That is the only outcome!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cJust because you want me to, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to change either! Even if you torture me.\u201d </span>She smiled at you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHeh, so stubborn\u201d</span> She thought to herself as she looked at you, placing her hands on her chest. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s exactly why he can smile like that. I want to see that smile again. And those feelings\u2026I want to posses all of him. In that case\u2026\u201d</span> She sat back down on the bed. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re tired after today. We\u2019ll discuss this again later. For now, let\u2019s rest.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span> You got off the beat slowly moving to the couch. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019ll just, sleep on the sofa.\u201d</span> She grabbed your hand.<span class=\"clblue\"> \u201cI won\u2019t do anything tonight, so just sleep in the bed with me.\u201d </span>You knew this one you wouldn\u2019t win. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cA-Alright, but I\u2019m going to take a shower first.\u201d</span> you said heading there. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThis goes without saying. If you cause a scene within these walls or try to run, it will mean your death. So don\u2019t try anything silly.\u201d </span>You chuckled softly, smiling at her. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIt will take more than the troops here to kill me, but I understand.\u201d </span>you said walking to the shower. Once again, that smile of yours got to her, and she placed a hand to her heart. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cTh-that smile\u2026\u201d</span> As you showered, she layed back and remembered the words Bols said to her and thought <span class=\"clblue\">\"You'll fall for me, Sasuke. This kind of plan is new and fun.\"</span> After you cooled off with a shower, you returned to her, and laid down beside her in the bed, getting some rest. The bed was comfortable enough that it was the best sleep you\u2019ve had in quite some time.</span></div></div>",

Leaving my embrace?\u201d</span> You gulped before jump straight up slipping under her arms and off the bed. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cG-Good morning, Esdeath. I was caught off guard, that\u2019s all.\u201d</span> you say trying to calm down before leaving to let her get dressed. As you walked into the main dining room, Wave and Kurome were already there. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cOh, good morning Sasuke. Did you sleep well?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMorning Wave, Kurome. I admit I did sleep better than I usually do, though I usually sleep in tree\u2019s to enjoy the night.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWait, you weren\u2019t hit by danger beasts?\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNo. I had my own layer of protection. At any rate, Esdeath sort of used me as a body pillow, which did catch me off guard.\u201d</span> Wave chuckled a little <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cI can imagine. Kurome, isn\u2019t it a little early for snacks?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clred\">\u201cMind your own business.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cIf you had more seafood, it\u2019d be better for you.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clred\">\u201cThen I\u2019d stink like the ocean, like you.\u201d </span>Wave was surprised by that remark. After a few minutes, Wave even pointing out the girl Akame from the wanted posters looks like Kurome telling you both she\u2019s her sister, who she wants to kill because she loves her, Esdeath walked in. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSasuke, we\u2019re heading to Mount Fake. We\u2019ll be hunting for the next few days.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMount Fake huh? Alright then.\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWave and Kurome, you\u2019ll be joining us. We\u2019ll hunt danger beasts, while keeping an eye out for enemies.\u201d </span>They both nodded. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cKurome and I will take the east side until dusk. Wave and Sasuke will scout the west side. In the evening, we\u2019ll switch. And Sasuke will be with me.\u201d</span> You raised an eyebrow wondering what she was planning. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cUpper-level Danger Beasts appear at night. It will be a good chance to impress him.\u201d </span>she thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut at Mount Fake, you and wave were walking before he started up the conversation. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say this back at the palace, but you sure have it rough. If you ever want to talk, I\u2019ll listen.\u201d You turned to look at him. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThank you. But I should be okay. I\u2019ve dealt with worse before.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWell we do have some similarities.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cOh? How so?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cHow should I put this? We\u2019ve seemed to have faced our fair share of hardships. And let\u2019s just say I\u2019ve met some real oddballs.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNo I get it. Trust me.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cAnyway, since we\u2019re so similar, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get along-\u201d </span>He saw you slowly drawing your blade. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cSasuke?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cDuck!\u201d </span>you said charging at him. He did so and you sliced some kind of tree beast in half. But doing so summoned a great number of them. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cThank you, Sasuke.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNo problem. Stand back.\u201d </span>you said taking a big inhale, and when you exhaled you let out a huge stream of fire. Wave\u2019s jaw dropped when he saw this be he started to fight with you. And he did notice a few elements that you used were Lightning, Fire, and Wind. At the end of it, you put your blade away and he turned to you. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cYou\u2019re strong, Sasuke.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThanks. Though for your safety, I was holding back.\u201d</span> He was shocked as hell to hear you were holding back. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWell either way, I do owe you for saving my life back there.\u201d </span>he said walking forward. After a few minutes of walking you sensed something off, and it was very evil. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWave hold on.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI sense something\u2026\u201d </span>Wave looked around. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cBut we\u2019re at one of the highest vantage points, the only ones here could be either us or Danger beasts.\u201d</span> He started to move forward but as he did, you figured out what was up and you saw he was about to get caught in something sinister. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWave, move!\u201d</span> you said grabbing him and while spinning a bit threw him a bit further back on the trail. In that moment some kind of demonic seal encircled you and began to cause you massive pain, and drain your energy. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cSasuke!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cStay back Wave! This seal is meant for me!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThis thing was designed to subdue and drain my power to where I would die. But I can dispel it! Though I might end up knocked somewhere away from here. If we get separated, tell Esdeath I will be at the summit!\u201d </span>You said as you plunged you Chidori charged sword into the seal, and as you expected the reaction was a powerful explosion that sent you flying. Wave was instantly sweating in fear for what he had to tell Esdeath. And when they met up, they returned to the capital. After Wave was punished, having stone blocks dropped on his kneeling knees, he told her the strength he saw you have. Esdeath knew you could have easily survived that explosion, and vowed she would see you again. </span></div></div>",

You from what you could tell you weren\u2019t that injured, just a couple cracked ribs. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cDamn, that\u2019s gonna take a couple days to heal up.\u201d</span> you said to yourself. But unlike you however, your sword was much worse off. It was severely damaged and cracked. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMy sword, judging from this much damage. I\u2019d say its got enough strength for one last attack.\u201d</span> You think back to how many battles you have won with that sword, and while it was only a weapon to some, it was like a partner to you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI must choose your final victim wisely old friend.\u201d</span> you said putting the blade away.<span class=\"cblue\"> \"Seems like it\u2019s time\u2026I use that blade\u2026\u201d</span> you thought to yourself. But for now you had to made do with your ninja gear, unfortunately the explosion somehow temporarily disabled your summoning ability, so you were going to have to go on foot. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Great, I can't even summon a ride. Oh well.\"</span> you said as you started walking, but you were already sensing enemies around you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSeems the fun never ends.\u201d </span>In a moment\u2019s notice you were attacked by assassins once again. One even binding your arm with a whip of some kind. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cA whip? Really now? I admit it can be useful if you bind an opponent. However\u2026\u201d</span> you said grabbing the whip and yanking it hard, forcing the guy to fly toward you, only to be greeted with a strong roundhouse kick to the head. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWeapons like that wont work on me.\u201d</span> You took the whip handle to use it for your own, and with one quick movement you wrapped it around one of the attacker\u2019s leg and pulled on it so hard he did a back flip as the whip unwound from the leg at the right moment. Another attacker tried to attack with a poison blade and you used a kunai to block it. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNot bad. One cut from that I\u2019d be dead.\u201d</span> You landed a kick to his stomach which sent him staggering back before throwing the kunai, right into the center of his head, causing an instant death. As the one who first attacked tried reclaiming his whip, you kicked him into the air over a tree branch. But using his whip you caught his neck and as he fell, the whip got caught on the branch and it snapped his neck. And to kill the last one, you pulled out a large Demon Wind Shuriken and it sliced right through him, and you caught it as it returned. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThat takes care of you fools. Now to head to mount fake.\u201d</span> you said as you started walking. As you continued to approach Mount Fake, you continued to think about what that demon seal was doing out there in the first place. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThings just don\u2019t add up. Ever since I arrived at the palace, I felt a darkness that I can\u2019t quite place, and then there\u2019s that demonic seal\u2026what the hell is going on at the capital? For now I can\u2019t worry about that, I have to get to Mount Fake, and fast.\u201d</span> you thought as you picked up the pace. Every now and again you would encounter danger beasts, using your powers to kill them quickly. However, when you cam across an evil-bird, you decided to kill it with a kunai to the heart, before using your flames to cook it. Evil-birds were a delicious delicacy that were around your old home, and Itachi taught you how to hunt and kill them, and while you weren\u2019t able to make different foods with them like your mother showed you, you were just fine eating them as they are. After that meal, you decided to place a protective barrier around you before resting for the night, saving some of the evil-bird for breakfast. Before you fell asleep, you thought to yourself <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNo matter what happens\u2026I will restore my clan..\u201d</span></span></div></div>",

Once you did a little stretching and ate the remains of the evil-bird. You once again started to make your way to the mountain. But as you were nearing your goal, you had sensed something to the east, and it felt unnatural. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThe hell? That doesn\u2019t feel friendly. Despite my need to get to Mount Fake, I need to find out what\u2019s causing this feeling.\u201d</span> you thought to yourself as you made your way to that location. Avoiding enemies and Danger Beasts along the way, you found yourself at some kind of ravine during the night. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d </span>Looking across it, you saw some kind of base in the mountains. And you could tell there was something going on. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019ve got to get over there. Maybe\u2026\u201d</span> You bit your hand and focused your energy into your hand. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSummoning Jutsu!\u201d </span>you said as you slammed your hand on the ground. A large cloud of smoke came from that point and when it cleared a large black wyvern had appeared from that spot. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSeems I got my summoning ability back.\u201d</span> you said jumping onto the dragons back. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d </span>The dragon took flight across the ravine and you could see some people in need of help. They were surrounded by things that you could tell were once ordinary people. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat the hell are those things. No matter. I will help these guys out.\u201d</span> You said as the dragon dived to them before you jumped off its back and landing a powerful punch to one of the attacker\u2019s faces. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cStay down, you abomination.\u201d</span> You turned to the people behind you and you noticed one of them was Akame. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou guy\u2019s are Night Raid huh? Well, I have no reason to fight any of you. So I\u2019m going to give you a hand.\u201d </span>In that moment, the leader of Night Raid, Najenda, came in on the back of an Air Manta, along with two other people. One jumping off the creature at high altitude and landing without a scratch. Using your Sharingan you could tell he was an organism-based Imperial Arms. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cNow, eliminate all enemies before you, Susanoo.\u201d</span> she said on the back of the manta. A few of them charged at him, but you also took some out with a pair of demon wind shuriken. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cDon\u2019t forget, I\u2019m your enemy too, freaks.\u201d </span>The small army seemed to try taking you both out at the same time.  And you led your half away from the others. Each time you threw your shuriken, you used the element of earth to impale them on crystal spikes. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou\u2019re no match for me!\u201d</span> As you fought, you couldn\u2019t help but wonder who was coordinating the attack. Though for the moment you stuck to killing these soldiers. However, you were surprised when you got a closer look at the corpses of the enemy.<span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cShit!\u201d </span>you whistled and the dragon came back and while still in flight, you jumped to its back before the bodies exploded. Luckily, Susanoo was an Imperial Arms, so as long as his core was intact, he could regenerate.<span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cThat was way too close\u2026Now who\u2019s causing this attack?\u201d</span> You said looking with your sharingan. After a moment, you found the attacker: Doctor Stylish. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cDoctor!\u201d</span> you yelled as the dragon accelerated toward him, Najenda also following suit with the air manta. Both you and Susanoo kept him form escaping. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSo I have you to thank for those freaks. Humans aren\u2019t your personal lab rats!\u201d </span>He looked at the two of you and he pulled out some kind of syringe and injected himself. <span class=\"crose\">\u201cIt\u2019s such a shame Sasuke. You were good with the General, and at the very least I was hoping to make you a test subject, but I will have to make due with killing you!\u201d</span> he said as his body began to mutate and grow. <span class=\"crose\">\u201cHere it comes! This is the ultimate in stylishness! I become a Danger Beast myself, and destroy all of you!\u201d</span> While two of his subordinates admired this, he grabbed them in his massive hands. <span class=\"crose\">\u201cYou are my precious nourishment! Let\u2018s become one!\u201d</span> he said as a mouth appeared across his abdominal area, devouring them both. The third tried to run, but like the others she was captured and devoured. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cYes! I eat this nutritious meat, and I level up!!\u201d</span> He ended up growing to massive size, his true body on the center of his forehead, but with the way the creature\u2019s body was built, it wouldn\u2019t be simple to hit. Half of the thing was made of metal for one thing, and you could tell it\u2019s skin was extremely tough. <span class=\"crose\">\u201cI\u2019m still not big enough. I\u2019m not close enough to being the ultimate Imperial Arms\u2026 To go higher, I have to get even bigger! For that, I will have you too!\u201d </span>he said trying to reach at you and Susanoo. You were both able to dodge, Susanoo trying to attack his metal arm, but despite his power, he couldn\u2019t damage it. But you took to the skies with your dragon to find a way to hit that weak spot. As Susanoo kept dodging, Stylish started to laugh. <span class=\"crose\">\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Organism-based Imperial Arms? You can hit harder!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHow about this!?\u201d</span> In that moment he felt a powerful blast hit his back, and you instantly got his attention. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cOne thing you should know Doctor, never turn your back on a dragon!\u201d</span> With his attention divided between you and Susanoo, the Night Raid member who wears the Incursio armor got Akame close enough to him, and with the two working together, they tried to hit him with the Murasame Imperial Arms, a sword who could kill anyone with one cut, but his skin was too tough. <span class=\"crose\">\u201cIt\u2019s no use! If it can\u2019t cut my skin, even the Ichizan Hissatsu: Murasame is useless.\u201d</span> Akame kept her eye on Stylish. <span class=\"crose\">\u201cTime for you to give up!\u201d</span> But he got caught off guard by the long-range imperial arms: Pumpkin, which was a powerful gun that had multiple options. <span class=\"crose\">\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou\u2019re distracted!\u201d</span> Stylish looked up and saw you plummet at him and you sent a massive amount of your lightning energy into your sword and sliced off his metal arm before the sniper of Night Raid, Mine, fired another shot, forcing him down. With the combined efforts of yourself and Night Raid, Doctor Stylish was dead as dust. Your sword shattered at that moment, and you were left holding the hilt. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cGood-bye, partner.\u201d</span> you said to yourself, bidding your sword farewell. The members of Night Raid thanked you and you bowed in respect before using the dragon to head back to Mount Fake.</span></div></div>",

As you were getting closer, you couldn\u2019t help but think of how things have gotten more chaotic than usual. But your thoughts were interrupted as the dragon growled, sensing something.<span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cWhat is it boy?\u201d</span> In an instant, something blasted some dark energy at you and your dragon, the two of you just barely dodged it. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</span> The blasts kept coming and eventually your dragon was hit, forcing it to roar in pain. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cRed-Eyes, no!\u201d</span> The two of you crash landed onto the mountain, and your dragon returning to the world you summoned it from. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cUgh\u2026Who the hell is attacking me?\u201d </span>You noticed a figure in a cloak, his face concealed so you couldn\u2019t identify him. He radiated with demonic energy. <i>\u201cHello, Sasuke.\u201d</i> You quickly got on your feet and got ready to defend yourself. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d </span><i>\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to know an Uchiha, especially when it\u2019s one who summons a dragon like that. Who else could?\u201d </i><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWho are you?\u201d</span> <i>\u201cYou will find out in time boy, but for now, I shall leave you with these.\u201d</i> he said as he snapped his fingers. In that moment, a few demons in armor showed up, and they looked strong. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cDemons\u2026You\u2019re with the one\u2019s who slaughtered my clan!\u201d</span> <i>\u201cCorrect. We will meet again, if you survive them that is.\u201d</i> he said as he walked away. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cGet back here!\u201d </span>you yelled charging in, but in that moment you almost got your head sliced off by one of the soldiers, and even though you managed to avoid it, the man in the cloak had vanished.<span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cDamn it!\u201d </span>The soldiers rushed to you to cut you down. <b><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d</span></b> you yelled as you let out a HUGE blast of flame, amazingly, they managed to avoid the attack, though you had melted a bit of the rocks. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWell, this should be entertaining at least.\u201d</span> you said charging in, using your shadow clone technique to make two more of you. Each one of you taking one on alone, but these things were strong. And what\u2019s worse, without that sword of yours, they way these things are leaning into you, you couldn\u2019t hit them hard enough to end this quickly. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cDamn these things are good.\u201d</span> As one tried to bring it\u2019s sword down on you, you managed to catch the blade between your hands. But as soon as you did, the creatures sent their own dark energy into them, and they caused you great pain. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAgh! Damn you!\u201d</span> You sent lightning into your hands and the two energies clashed, and a huge blast wave came from that point and sent you both apart, you did manage to destroy his sword however, which was good. Your clones did the same thing, even though the blast wave did destroy them in turn. You knew on this terrain you had a disadvantage, so you decided to get to the top as fast as you could. Luckily up there, the area was nice, flat, and level. The three creatures had jumped onto the summit as well and you looked at them, sharingan ablaze in your eyes. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI have to end this quickly. Otherwise they would end up overwhelming me.\u201d </span>Two of them charged at you at the same time, and using your martial arts you were able to knock them back. They each tried to kill without a hint of relent or hesitation. The more they did this the more you were getting pissed and you sent a great deal of lightning into your hand. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cEnough of this!\u201d </span>you said as you struck one in the chest, even extending that Chidori into the Chidori Spear, and changing it up a bit you made sure he died by having the lightning spike out of him, but one more came from behind and as you quickly called back your attack and you landed a kick to its stomach, forcing it off the summit. You had the chance to fight one of the remaining two alone, and you didn\u2019t waste this opportunity. You charged for him and you called on the power of wind to form a blade around your hand, the speed of it was so great it would either slice clean through, or tear him apart. The demon tried to end it with a strike to the heart, but you managed to knock his hand away and forced your wind blade into his chest, and the instant you did, the chest area was torn apart, killing him in one blow. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cTwo down, one to go.\u201d</span> You said as the third and final soldier returned. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cTime to end this!\u201d</span> you said charging at him. As you charged at him, you increased your speed and tackled him off the summit, both of you began to fall. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019ve had enough of you!\u201d</span> Your hand began to glow a purple color and you grabbed its face. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cEat this!\u201d Darkness Finger!\u201d</span> In that moment a great amount of shadow energy came from your hand, but because you kept your grip on his face, the energy went into him as you both crashed onto a path lower on the mountain, and you kept up the attack as you pushed his head into the mountain. Your energy went right through his head and when you let go, his body turned to dust. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cGood riddance.\u201d</span> you said painting a bit. You were pretty exhausted from the fight and you once again made your way to the summit. You took a minute to catch your breath but something crash landed behind you. As you turned your head, you heard a very familiar voice speak, and you knew who it was. Esdeath managed to show up thinking you were an enemy, and apparently she was using a Danger Beast she tamed to get into the skies. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYou will have to deal with me.\u201d</span> she said drawing her sword and pointing it at you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI\u2019ll test out my new torture method- Eh?\u201d</span> she said interrupted when she saw it was you, a blush appearing on her face. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSasuke\u2026\u201d </span>You thought to yourself <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cOn top of everything else, Esdeath shows up now?? Well, at least this time it\u2019s an ally who popped up.\u201d</span> But just as you thought that, you noticed Danger Beasts that felt human began to approach you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWait, are these more of the Doctor\u2019s experiments?\u201d</span> you thought. Before things could escalate into another fight, Esdeath sliced them into pieces before you could react. She even noticed one of the trying to crawl toward her, but she forced her heel into the creatures brain. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDon\u2019t get in my way.\u201d</span> She turned toward you and you thought she would end up striking you as well, but with that same blush she smiled at you and said <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSo this isn\u2019t a dream\u2026I\u2019ve been looking forward to the day we\u2019d be reunited, Sasuke.\u201d </span>You weren\u2019t sure weather to be afraid or relieved at this point, especially with that thing still alive with her heel in it\u2019s brain. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhy not put that thing out of it\u2019s misery?\u201d</span> you thought. Things definitely not getting dull around here.</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re the real thing. How dare you leave me? I was lonely.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI couldn\u2019t exactly control an explosion that propelled me into the forest, you know. Why are you here?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cLately, I\u2019ve been exterminating Danger Beasts harassing the capital. How long have you been here?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI just got here before you dropped in.\u201d</span> you said before you got out of her embrace. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cDuring the time, I fought Danger Beasts and assassins to get here. Though that explosion from earlier damaged my sword to the point it could only handle one more attack.\u201d </span>She walked over to you and began to gently feel your body. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI see\u2026Your physique has certainly become more pronounced. And you\u2019ve clearly gotten stronger.\u201d</span> She then began to stroke your head in praise. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYou\u2019ve done well in such a short amount of time! Surely, you\u2019ll continue to grow even stronger!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cUh, thanks.\u201d </span>You got your thoughts together and thought <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat am I doing? I can\u2019t be buttered up like this!\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThe Danger Beasts here are pretty much annihilated. They were annoying but\u2026\u201d</span> she said as she held you close to her again. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThanks to them, I was able to find you. This can only be destiny.\u201d</span> But that moment was quickly brought to a halt when you both sensed someone\u2019s presence. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThere\u2019s a surprising number of nuisances around here. The one that just hid\u2026\u201d</span>she said clearly speaking to the enemy. <span class=\"clblue\">\"I know you\u2019re there. Come out. If you do not, I shall not hesitate on attacking.\u201d</span> she said drawing her sword and pointing it at the enemy, who walks out form behind a boulder. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI thought I hid pretty well. But I gotta give it to you. As expected from the capital\u2019s strongest. Still, to encounter you out here\u2026I guess playtime\u2018s over.\u201d </span>The enemy said as he stood before you both. While he too wore a cloak to conceal himself, he was clearly human, and the cloak itself was different. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSeems as though you know why the Danger Beasts are everywhere. I\u2019ll escort you to the torture room.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019m not into that.\u201d</span> he said with a slight chuckle. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAnd ultimately, I\u2019ll have you clean up a big toy! Imperial Arms Shambala! Activate!\u201d </span>A ring of purple flame surrounded you two as a Yin-Yang appeared under you, this whole thing seemed to be some kind of seal, but not the kind you know. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</span> In a bright flash of light you two were transported somewhere else. The next thing you know, you were both on some tropical island. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat the hell is going on?!\u201d </span>You thought for a second after calming down. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cEsdeath, I need you to hurt me.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSasuke\u2026To think you had such a fetish. Just as I thought, we really are meant for each other.\u201d</span> she said blushing. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThat is not what I meant! Because of that guy, this all may be an illusion! So if we feel some physical pain, we might wake up.\u201d</span><span class=\"clblue\"> \u201cAlright. Here goes.\u201d</span> You braced yourself but instead of pain, you felt Esdeath kiss you full on the lips. And this was definitely not an illusion. She walked away a little, putting space between the two of you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIt isn\u2019t an illusion. The sensations are too real. The smell of salt and the ocean breeze\u2026temperature and humidity. This is probably all real.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhich means\u2026\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cMost likely, it\u2019s that guys ability. Have we been teleported somewhere else?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAn Imperial Arms that can manipulate time and space? Impressive.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cManipulating time and space is a superior ability. Definitely in the top percentile among the Imperial Arms. Just who is he?\u201d</span> she thought. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cFor now, let\u2019s check our surroundings.\u201d</span> she said as she placed her hand on the ground and created a massive pillar of ice, the speed it rose from the ground was incredible and you were forced to one knee. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWe\u2019re completely surrounded by ocean.\u201d</span> Esdeath was silent for a moment. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThis is a beautiful view. It\u2019s as though we\u2019re on a date.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou sure are calm.\u201d</span> you said still kneeling. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThe ability of the Imperial Arms surpasses the imagination. If you want to go on, you have to keep an open mind.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI see.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cBack to the main subject\u2026\u201d</span> before you could react, she was embracing you again. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIt\u2019s as though we\u2019re on a date!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cW-Wait a second!\u201d</span> just then a huge danger beast that seemed to be the same as Doctor Stylish when he transformed rose form the sea, it was almost exactly the same, except this one was decayed. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cA giant Danger Beast.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThat thing is as big as Stylish was. It took me and all of Night Raid to kill it last time. Can just two of us do it?\u201d</span> you thought to yourself. The beast charged at the pillar ready to kill. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHere it comes!\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI have no mercy for nuisances.\u201d</span> she said as she summoned a great number of ice shards in the air, all aimed at the Danger Beast. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSomething like you deserves skewering! <i>Weiss Schnabel</i>!\u201d</span> she said firing the ice right at it. And even though it was forced down as it was hit, it still managed to rise. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYou\u2019re tougher than I thought. This is becoming exciting.\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cEsdeath, that spot on his forehead, that looks like a weak spot.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHmm, my thoughts exactly.\u201d</span> she said touching the pillar with her hand. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWe really are meant for each other. <i>Grau Horn</i>!\u201d</span> she yelled as a massive spike of ice extended from the pillar right at the beasts head, but it did manage to dodge it just by moving its head. \u201cHow tenacious.\u201d You charged forward with your Chidori, running along the spike. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSasuke!\u201d </span>You jumped right into the weak spot <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cEat this!\u201c </span>you yelled as you struck it with your Chidori and killing it, the body crashing to the ground. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cMagnificent. I wanted to charm you by showing off\u2026But to think you\u2019d charm me even more. I even called out my special move\u2026\u201d </span>she said watching you. But then a smaller beast grabbed the tower and cracked it, causing it to break. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThere\u2019s still more?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cLeave it to me. I\u2019ll give it a fitting death.\u201d</span> she said sliding on the broken spike before jumping off it. With just a snap of her fingers, she created a HUGE sphere of ice, sending it to the Danger Beast. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201c<i>Hagel Sprung</i>!\u201d</span> she called out as the sphere hit its target, crushing it with little effort. You just looked up at her standing on the sphere in victory and thought <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat an impressive fighting style\u2026So this is the true strength of the capital\u2018s strongest.. She\u2019s\u2026incredible.\u201d</span> The two of you regrouped in the shade as she was supposedly taking some notes, when in reality, she was drawing. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIt seems there were only two of them.\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSo that\u2019s what he meant by cleaning up toys. And it seems this was the hiding place for a new type of Danger Beast.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAfter we\u2019ve rested, what then?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cFirst, we\u2019ll investigate our surroundings. We must gain an understanding of our environment.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cPanicking would be fatal. We\u2019ll stay calm while venturing out.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cFine by me.\u201d </span>She smiled as she drew, and thought to herself <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHmm\u2026it doesn\u2019t look like him.\u201d</span> She was drawing the two of you together. For the rest of that day, you both explored the island. Gathering food, drinking water, hunting and even taking in the island's beauty and wildlife. She decided to have some fun by putting a rafflesia flower on your head, which you shook off quickly in embarrassment, but you were happy to see her having fun, and admittedly, you were having a great time too. Something you haven\u2019t had in a long, long time.</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s already dark.\u201d</span> Esdeath held your hand. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cBut it was quite fun!\u201d</span> she said with a smile. You chuckled a bit and nodded.<span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cYeah.\u201d </span>You sat there in silence for a moment. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAnd I now know this island\u2019s location.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThis is a deserted island to the far southeast of the capital.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThe far southeast? We were teleported that far huh?\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cBasically, we are the only ones on this island. So, what would you like to do, Sasuke? It\u2019s your destiny, so you choose.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAs much as I would like a vacation, there\u2019s some things I need to take care of first.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHow boring.\u201d</span> she said standing up. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHow are you so composed?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIt\u2019s because I have an idea of how we can get back. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI see.\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHowever, I need you to do your part too. Got it?\u201d </span>she said walking away. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYeah.\u201d</span> you said following her. The two of you made your way back to where you originally arrived onto the island, and there was a purple spot glowing in the sand. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAs I thought. There was a clue hidden where we first teleported.\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cDoes this mean he can only teleport to places he\u2019s marked like this?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cJudging from the area he activated when moving us, it seems he can only move a few people at once. And that he uses a tremendous amount of energy to do so. He probably can\u2019t keep doing it.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhich means, if we watch over this spot\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThe gate may open eventually. That\u2019s one way to get back. Now, before we talk about the more likely way to return\u2026\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span> She quickly hugged you and forced your face into her chest. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSince it\u2019s just the two of us here, let\u2019s get to know one another better!\u201d</span> You quickly pulled back and fell. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cT-Time out! H-How about we get to know each other in a different way?\u201d</span> She crawled over you a little. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWould you like me to stop? Then tell me your story. First, where did you learn to wield a sword?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI was taught by my brother and various members of my clan. It\u2019s also how I learned to use all the tools at my disposal, to call on my sharingan and own powers, or at least how to use them.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI see, and how can you use lightning?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI-I was born with incredible powers, Esdeath. I can control Earth, Fire, Wind, Water, Darkness, Lightning, and Ice. Though I\u2019m not as skilled with ice as you are.\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cTo actually learn and control all that, you are incredible.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou seem like you can do about anything as well.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNot quite. I don\u2019t really take to the fine arts. When one of my subordinates would play his flute, I had no idea what was good about it at first. But tell me, why have you not mentioned your clan until now?\u201d </span>You were surprised by that question, but you decided to flip one on her. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBefore I answer that. I have a few things to ask you as well.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAlright.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou weren\u2019t born in the capital were you?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m from the northern border. Have you ever heard of the Paltas Clan?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI think I heard about them from my brother once. They\u2019re said to be amazing hunters.\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThat\u2019s right. I grew up as the chief\u2019s daughter.\u201d </span>She began to tell you her history, how she got her attitude of how the strong and the weak survived and even how she\u2019s the last of her clan as well. You were surprised to hear how that was a fact you had in common. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI see. Then, I\u2019d like to see what your Imperial Arms looks like.\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOh, that? My Imperial Arms is here.\u201d</span> she said taking your hand and placing a finger to the mark on her chest. She then explained how her power was obtained when she drank an urn of the blood of a Danger Beast that controlled ice. She even told you how those before her who tried it went insane, but she was so dominant she tamed the power in moments. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSo, you told me you would tell me why you never brought up your clan until now.\u201d </span>You gently got her off you, and walked to the edge of the beach. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cLike you, my clan is gone. I\u2019m all that\u2019s left. But they were destroyed by something far worse than any human, imperial arms, or Danger Beast.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</span> You looked at the moon telling your story. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201c11 years ago, my clan was at its peak. Itachi, my older brother was training me that I would inherit the Uchiha\u2019s Murasama, a blade passed down through the clan, the strongest warrior being able to wield it. However\u2026 that\u2019s when it happened.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Flashback-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cDemons began to attack the Uchiha clan, and despite the efforts of all our warriors, even the old tried to fight. But each one was put down by the demons. As this was happening, my brother had taken me to a small room beneath my house.\u201d</span> Itachi set you and the Murasama down before he placed some seals on the walls. <i><span class=\"cred\">\u201cSasuke, stay here. Do not leave this room until the seals release, do you hear me?\u201d</span></i> <i><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBut what about you?\u201d</span></i> <i><span class=\"cred\">\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Just stay here.\u201d</span></i> he said leaving you in the room. Hours passed before the seals were broken. When that happened, you climbed out of the secret room and looked around, your house pretty damaged. <i><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBig brother? Mother? Father?\u201d</span></i> You walked out of your house and you were horrified by what you saw. The bodies of your fellow Uchiha littered throughout, the blood all over the place. You about puked but sucked it up, and went looking for your family. After a few minutes of searching, you found them, but you were so shocked as to what you saw, you dropped the sword. Your mother and father were both dead, and Itachi was barely alive. <span class=\"cblue\"><i>\u201cBig brother!\u201d</i></span> you said picking up the blade and running to him, you were dragging the sword by the handle and the scabbard slid off. <i><span class=\"cred\">\u201cSasuke\u2026\u201d</span></i> <i><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cPlease Itachi, you have to live!\u201d</span></i> <span class=\"cred\"><i>\u201cSasuke\u2026Listen, beware the capital, and the demons will return one day\u2026I know you will be strong in time. Try to find\u2026someone to make you happy\u2026\u201d</i></span> <i><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBig brother, you\u2019re gonna be okay, you can make it!\u201d</span></i> He slowly reached out to you with one hand, and gently jabbed you in the forehead.<i><span class=\"cred\"> \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Sasuke\u2026\u201d</span></i> In that moment, his hand dropped and you looked at him in silence, processing this. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIn that moment, I lost all control of my emotions, and as if responding to the mixture of fear, rage, agony, and sorrow, the Murasama began to shine and every last drop of blood that belonged to my dead clan members were drawn into the blade. The color had changed and power surged through it. But at that age, I couldn\u2019t use it. I put the sword in its scabbard, and placed it in a secret storage base my clan used, in case I need it again.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Present-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI swore revenge, and to destroy those demons. I know Itachi meant someone high up in the capital summoned those demons. And I even remember someone from the capital visiting my clan the day before.

And when I find them, and the one who did this, I will kill them! And if you wont help me, then you can get out of my way!\u201d</span> Esdeath was silent for a moment, before embracing you close to her. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSasuke. I told you I wouldn\u2019t let you feel alone. I will stay with you no matter what. I\u2019ll help you get yoru revenge.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cE-Esdeath\u2026\u201d</span> You felt touched, and while you asked her how else you got back to the capital, you stayed in her embrace. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWe need to tame a Danger Beast that can fly, and ride it back.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cLeave that to me.\u201d</span> You said as you bit your thumb and walking forward. You summoned the same dragon from last time and got on its back. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cComing Esdeath?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSo you can summon dragons?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAmong other things.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI see. You truly are amazing Sasuke.\u201d </span>she said getting on, as the two of you flew back to the capital, you couldn\u2019t help but think to yourself <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThis feeling in my chest\u2026I-is this\u2026Love?\u201d</span> You may not have known it, but you may have been falling for Esdeath now.</span></div></div>",

Take your rest.\u201d</span> The dragon then returned to the world it\u2019s summoned from before stretching a bit. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cEsdeath listen, before I ask a favor, I need to make a stop. I need that sword I told you about.\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI see. Do you need a horse?\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNo, I can get there by foot.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAlright. But make sure you return to me soon.\u201d</span> You chuckled a little and smiled at her. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI will.\u201d</span> You started to move across rooftops to get out of the capital faster, soon making your way deep to the forest and into the mountains., and you found an area that is rather secluded. Using your energy, you placed your hand on a certain boulder that opened up a secret passage into the mountain itself. You walked deep into the mountain and saw your blade as you placed it long ago. Even without drawing the blade, you could feel the incredible power within. You grabbed the scabbard and placed it at your side, even placing your hand on the scabbard with your finger on the trigger, to make sure you get used to the feel of it. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve had my finger on any kind of trigger. An odd feeling, but I know this will come in handy.\u201d</span> you said to yourself. You knew that you would need to train with this blade to get used to its strength. With your new blade, you returned to the capital, and you walked to where the Jaegers meet. What\u2019s more, you noticed a big meal already set out, and the others smiled welcoming you back.<span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cWow, I didn\u2019t expect this kind of reception.\u201d </span><span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYou\u2019re our comrade Sasuke. We always welcome back one of our own after something like this happens.\u201d </span><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cAnd if it weren\u2019t for me, you wouldn\u2019t have been caught in that trap.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cRelax Wave. You had nothing to do with it. But I do appreciate this, my friends.\u201d </span>you said smiling. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cCome, Let\u2019s celebrate Sasuke\u2019s return.\u201d </span><span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cRight, Captain!\u201d</span> With a smile on your face, you had decided to relax for once, and enjoyed the feast that Bols and the others cooked up. Wave knew his way around seafood, so the sushi was amazing. Bols made some great soups, salad, and with Seryu\u2019s help, made some good chicken as well. On top of that, you even met the wife and daughter Bols had talked about before. You were amazed to see how love could find someone who has done what Bols has done, showing that you and Esdeath could easily could be together. The Jaegers had truly become like a family to you. Kurome even gave you one of her cookies, and you gladly accepted it. You sat with Esdeath during most of this, and you were happy around her. After the party, you decided to help clean up, and got to know the team better. After a while though, you had remembered you needed to train, and later on you gathered the Jaegers together, Esdeath included..<span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cListen, I need your help.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhat is it Sasuke?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI have a new blade that I need to test out. But the only one\u2019s I know I can use this on in training without killing someone are all of you. As such I request your help. I have a location we can train in without holding back. You guys up for it?\u201d</span> They looked at each other and thought about it for a minute. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI'm fine with it.\"</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cIf it helps preserve justice, let\u2019s do it!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cIt\u2019s the least I could do.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clred\">\u201cAlright.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDo you wish for me to fight with them?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNo. I need to train against the others first, then I shall face you one on one..\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cVery Well. Where is this location?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI will take you there now. Follow me.\u201d</span> you said walking outside. As the others follow you, you concentrate your power and used your power of Chaos Control to open up an entirely different dimension, dragging you and the others in. The area was like no other. Platforms of rock were everywhere, yet there were rocks, trees, mountains and other objects to use for cover and defense. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhere are we?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThis is my Chaos Dimension. A place I use for intense training. Here we could go all out without anyone or anything getting destroyed.\u201d On top of that, the way I have things set up, instead of taking a lethal blow, you will be forced out of the battle, and have to observe it. with that said... </span> You said jumping to one of the floating platforms. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI want you all to come at me with the intent to kill.\u201d </span>A platform moved to Esdeath and she jumped on, taking the role as a spectator this time. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cVery well.\u201d </span>Coro grew to massive size when she said this. Wave had called on his Imperial Arms, Grand Chariot to prepare for battle as well. And you slowly drew your blade, which glowed an ominous crimson color and surged with power. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d</span></span></div></div>",

In surprise, he let go of the trigger, but some of the flames flowed around your blade and you thought to yourself <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cOh now things are going to be good.\u201d</span> You charged in at great speeds, but before you could land a blow, Kurome blocked your sword, canceling the flames, and Bols moved to another platform as you and Kurome kept clashing blades. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cImpressive skills, but don\u2019t I\u2019m as easy to kill as the others you\u2019ve faced.\u201d </span>you said as you kept leaning into her, and she kept getting forced back to the point she was at the edge of the platform. Wave charged in as you attempted to force her off, you let out a huge burst of wind that forced them both back, each landing onto another platform. <span class=\"clred\">\u201cHe\u2019s good.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cNo wonder Esdeath has taken a liking to him.\u201d</span> Esdeath just watched intrigued, even sitting on the edge of the platform she\u2019s on. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cImpressive Sasuke. Show me what you can do.\u201d</span> Without warning Coro came in like a bullet to try and tear you apart, and you just sliced him down the middle, but before you could move on, Seryu charged in with a sword arm and you just barely dodged it, it even took a couple strands of hair off you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThat was close.\u201d</span> you thought as Coro started to regenerate. Run provided some cover fire for the others as he fired a barrage of some kind of steel feathers, it took quite a bit of speed to deflect them all. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSo this is what you guys can do. Alright then, no more holding back!\u201d</span> you vanished from their sight for a second and slash at Bols, but as you had assured them, he was forced to another spectator platform. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWhat speed. He was holding back until now?\u201d </span>Kurome came in with some of her puppets, and you were slightly overwhelmed at first, but you called on the power of earth to create two pillars of earth that rise in a diagonal direction to get her puppets out of the way. The two of you kept going at if for several minutes and the instant you saw an opening, you kicked her so hard she went into the air and by focusing energy into the blade, you managed to create an energy slash with a single swing. Not only did it send Kurome into the spectator area, but it did slice multiple platforms in half. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThis sword is incredible\u2026It can amplify the energy and elements I pour into it.\u201d </span>you thought. Run kept firing at you as you put your sword away.<span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cI won\u2019t be able to do much as he keeps going like this. I need to force him to the ground.\u201d</span> you thought as you tried to gather up your energy. You called on a great amount of wind and focused it into your hand. Once you got the power your needed, you charged right for him. He fired off another of those feathers, and you retaliated with a compressed bullet of wind, about the size of your fist. The instant the feather made contact, the bullet released so much wind it was on par with a massive hurricane. Coro was barely holding onto the ground of a platform using his body as a shield to keep Seryu from flying off. Wave just ended up slammed into a boulder, but still stayed in the fight. Run on the other hand was forced into the ground. The instant this happened, you struck him with your Chidori, and forced him out of the fight. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThree down, three to go.\u201d</span> you looked at Coro, Seryu, and Wave. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d</span> Esdeath watched you and thought <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSasuke, you\u2019re so strong. As I thought. You are my destiny.\u201d</span> Coro then equipped Seryu with multiple long range weapons, and you knew this could get ugly. She fired off a hail fire of attacks. And you could just barely avoid it. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNot bad Seryu. I can tell Stylish gave you quite the arsenal. But it isn\u2019t going to be enough!\u201d</span> you said getting closer and closer. But she fired on the platform you were about to land on, and while the blast didn\u2019t hit you, it obscured your vision. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cDamn it.\u201d</span> Just then she pierced the smoke charging in, this time with her drill arm. On instinct, you let out a huge amount of lightning with Chidori Stream, sending her back. With the very small opening you had. You threw your sword at her, and it pierced her, forcing her and Coro to the spectator area, the sword sticking into a boulder, but it damn near went through it. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNow it\u2019s just you and me Wave.\u201d </span>you said jumping to the platform and grabbing your sword. Getting it out was simple, as you pulled it out, you sliced the boulder down the middle, and like the pierced area of the boulder, the cut was smooth as marble. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAmazing.\u201d</span> you said as you put your blade away. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019m going to fight you with my bare hands this time Wave. Come at me.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cAlright Sasuke, here I come!\u201d</span> he said charging in, throwing a powerful punch. You easily caught it and the two of you began to exchange blows. Each managing to block the others attacks. This went on for several minutes before you hit him with an uppercut and kicked him off the platform and he began to plummet, but when he passed the last platform he could use, he was forced to the spectator platform, Esdeath applauding you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWell done Sasuke. Very well done. Now I wish to test your strength. But I say we all rest fist.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cAgreed, Captain!\u201d </span><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWorks for me.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clred\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span> You smiled and you nodded. You opened the way home and you all went to rest.</span></div></div>",

Even with the problems in the Capital, you were still able to enjoy yourself with moments like this. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cEnjoying the night?\u201d</span> she said breaking the silence and sitting beside you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYeah. I guess I am. Though I enjoyed that night on the beach more to be honest.\u201d</span> Esdeath chuckled a little. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI enjoyed that too.\u201d</span> Both of you sat next to each other, just enjoying the company the other provides. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYou sure you wish to battle against me? Even in that dimension of yours?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019m sure. It\u2019s the only way I can test my strength. You are the only one I could train against to push me to the limits.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI see. I will put your strength to the test Sasuke. But as you don\u2019t want me to hold back, you better not hold back on me.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI know better than to do that. You are the Capital\u2019s strongest after all.\u201d</span> She smiled and moved a little closer to you. This time, you stayed right where you were. You felt like you were getting closer to her than anyone else in years. Later on that night, Bols had worked with Wave to make a great meal once again, and you all began to bond as a unit. You even developed some strategies with multiple team members, creating combination attacks, and discussing how they would be implemented. You even took Coro\u2019s regeneration, speed, and power into account so you could be even more in synch as a unit. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI can\u2019t guarantee this tactic will leave Coro unscathed you know. At the absolute least, he\u2019s gonna get a hole through his torso.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cCoro can handle it. Right, Coro?\u201d</span> Coro responded eagerly and you smiled. Esdeath was just observing all this and became extremely impressed by your tactical expertise. You knew that they may end up fighting Night Raid with these tactics, but for the moment you focused on your upcoming brawl with Esdeath. You knew ice would be absolutely useless against her, and just because you had fire on your side, it was FAR from being the edge that could secure victory. You haven\u2019t even seen the full extent of her strength. But you have held back around her as well. So one thing was for sure, the team would soon see a brawl between two titans of battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours everyone had decided to rest, you sleeping with Esdeath once again. However, your dreams had started to become nightmares. You were in a dark void for a bit, before you saw your team all around you, brutally killed and their blood everywhere. You had started to panic, and you saw flashes of the battle that killed them all, a voice echoed throughout the entire area. As if targeting your sanity, the voice continued to haunt you. <i>\u201cYou will lose everything\u2026again\u2026\u201d</i> You tried to block it out, covering your ears. <i>\u201cYou cannot save them\u2026they will die\u2026and your will to go on shall be destroyed\u2026\u201d</i> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cShut up\u2026shut up!\u201d</span> <i>\u201cYou are weak\u2026.you deserve to be alone\u2026\u201d </i>You began to cry out in anguish before waking up in a cold sweat, panting heavily and shaking like a leaf. Esdeath was awake with a worried look on her face. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSasuke, are you okay? You\u2019re trembling.\u201d </span>You tried to catch your breath. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI-I\u2019m alright\u2026j-just a nightmare.\u201d</span> Esdeath wrapped her arms around you, and you felt your world calm down. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIt\u2019s alright Sasuke. I\u2019m here now.\u201d</span> You were amazed at how calm you were able to get so quickly. Considering not 15 seconds ago you were in a height of fear. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cTry to rest Sasuke. I\u2019m here for you.\u201d</span> she said lying down beside you. You followed suit and let her embrace you again, and it didn\u2019t take long for you to fall asleep again, and for the rest of the night you were able to sleep peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, after a lovely breakfast with your team, you reopened the Chaos Dimension and as the rest of the Jaegers sat on the sidelines, you and Esdeath stood in front of each other and slowly drawing your blades, your sharingan ablaze in your eyes. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAre you ready, Sasuke?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cReady when you are, Esdeath.\u201d</span> The team watched with great interest, knowing the battle was about to begin.</span></div></div>",

Sparks started flying really quickly as neither of you pulled any punches in this fight. Matching each other beat for beat for a little while before Esdeath forced you back with multiple ice spikes. Jumping backward to avoid it, you retaliated with smaller fireballs, Esdeath either dodging them or using her sword to slice them. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNot bad. But I\u2019m not done yet.\u201d</span> you said as you used wind to propel yourself forward like a bullet, and took a swing at Esdeath, she managed to dodge the attack by leaning back, returning your attack with her ice shards. The only reason you didn\u2019t take a hit was because you started to spin in the air, one of them even grazing your cheek. You landed on a platform, sliding to a stop and let out a sigh of relief. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cTalk about a close shave.\u201d</span> Esdeath created that giant pillar of ice like she did on the island, a great number of ice shards aimed right at you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cTake this, <i>Weiss Schnabel!</i>\u201d</span> she said firing them out at you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNot so fast!\u201d </span>You inhaled deeply and let out a pure torrent of flame, her attacks completely evaporating, and even hitting the tower. But like she did on the island, she just snapped her fingers and a giant ball of ice began to plummet toward you. <i><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHagel Sprung!\u201d</span></i> You used your Chidori and jumped toward the massive sphere of ice. It took a lot of power on your part, but you managed to drill right through it and get right up to her, your sword meeting once again. But she didn\u2019t waste time in separating you two and kicked you in the side, sending you toward another platform, you had to stick your sword into the ground to slow down. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThis is getting exciting!\u201d</span> you said charging in. Firing off multiple bolts of lightning, you were able to force her back for once, noticing the same grin on her face as your own. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou know Esdeath, I must admit that you may be the only one who could make a battle this fun for me.\u201d</span> She laughed a little in response.<span class=\"clblue\"> \u201cI must admit I\u2019m entertained, but I\u2019m far from finished Sasuke.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThat goes double for me.\u201d </span>Esdeath immediately came out and with a kick she sent more ice your way, and you returned the attack using Earth in a similar fashion, the two attacks canceling each other out. As the two of you fought, the others were in pure awe of this whole thing. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cSasuke is so strong to be able to keep up with the Captain!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYeah, but remember, they haven\u2019t even started to get serious.\u201d</span> Esdeath created a second sword of ice and slashed at you in an unrelenting assault. You were able to get a gap between you and using the power of darkness, your shadow created sharp tendrils and fired toward her, and she jumped back slashing at them at the same time. You were able to get above her and fire off projectiles of compressed wind at her. She used the ice to create a sort of cage to block them off, and while it did do just that, they were weakened enough to slice right through. However, rushing in like that almost cost you the fight, as Esdeath about forced her sword through your head, just BARELY dodging, even getting a cut on your cheek. Sliding back on the ground you decided to try something new. Running your hand along the blade, energy began to flow all around the blade. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cTry this one on for size. Crimson Thunder!\u201d</span> With one swing of your sword, a massive force wave fired toward her, sparking with the same red electricity as your sword. She created a wall of ice to stop it, but your attack not only shattered it, but sent her back big time, all with the sound of a thunderclap as well. The others were AMAZED to see this. As Esdeath landed on her feet, she began to chuckle a little, before letting out a burst of laughter. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSasuke, you truly are my destiny. It\u2019s been so long since I was hit by an opponent. I have to commend you for that.\u201d </span>That sadistic grin appeared on her face. That attack may have landed a hit, but it did require a great deal of energy from you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019m glad I can amuse you. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re done!\u201d</span> you said charging in, she did the same and as your blades locked, she looked you dead in the eye.<span class=\"clblue\"> \u201cNot at all. Show me what you can do!\u201d</span> she said landing a kick to your stomach with her heel, and you were in plenty of pain from that. This battle went on for well over an hour. The two of you matching each other perfectly. The others didn\u2019t avert their eyes for even a second. To them, this was a once in a lifetime battle. Both of you getting some hits in here and there, Your clothes were getting pretty damn torn up in the process. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYou may need a new outfit after this fight Sasuke.\u201d</span> she said with a laugh. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYeah, I can see that happening.\u201d</span> you said laughing as well. You decided to up the ante by breaking flames onto your sword before leaping towards her. You started to lean into her and she was forced back, but she didn\u2019t exactly stop her assault either. In fact, she did manage to knock the blade out of your hands before freezing you solid. The others gasped at the sight of this. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cIs it over?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Watch.\u201d</span> Esdeath jumped onto a different platform in a hurry, and the others quickly found out why. The ice around you began to glow red and in an instant a MASSIVE amount of flames came bursting from it, the flames firing out in such a way it was crazy. Esdeath was obviously able to dodge the flames, but it took a good amount of effort on her part. She turned her gaze toward you and saw you were panting heavily, your shirt just destroyed. Ripping it off, being it was pretty pointless to keep the shreds of a shirt on, you grabbed your blade and looked at her. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI am extremely impressed Esdeath, you are the first to force me to use my Wildfire Tsunami technique. I wont be able to continue for much longer. So lets have one more go!\u201d </span>you said taking a stance. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAlright then.\u201d</span> she said as she took a stance too, her sword pointing right at you. You sent a great deal of energy to your legs and you leaped toward her at great speed, to the point it surprised Esdeath. Just before you landed a blow, she smirked as she tried to dodge. <span class=\"clblue\"><i>\u201cMakahadoma!\u201d </i></span>In that moment time had stopped around her, and she sidestepped your attack. And when she allowed things to move normally, she landed a blow that if it were outside this dimension, I would have killed you. You looked up at her as you collapsed form exhaustion. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cH-How did you\u2026?\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI developed that technique so you couldn\u2019t run away from me. I may only be able to use it once a day, but it still useful.\u201d</span> You laughed as you were all returned home, still laying on your back exhausted. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cY-You truly are an amazing woman.\u201d </span>She helps you up and gets you inside, and you were smiling the entire time from that battle.</span></div></div>",

Often times, people who attempted to wield the sword for its power, had been killed by the sword itself\u201d she explained. \u201cThat\u2019s quite accurate\u201d you responded. \u201cFor you too know about the sword, and to hold a fake that looks quite like it, must mean you know something about it, so why did you come here\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stayed silent for a moment, and saw all the concerned looks on everyone\u2019s faces. \u201cFine, I guess I should talk. About two years ago, I woke up with no memory; however, I believe that the sword Ronin has something to do with my own history, which why I wish to travel to are learn more about myself, if any information still exists\u201d you answered. \u201cSo that\u2019s why he knew nothing about the capital or us\u201d Leone responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you do possess the imperial arms don\u2019t you\u201d she asked. \u201cBoss, how did you know that sword on his waist was a fake\u201d Akame asked. \u201cBecause the sword Ronin cannot be contained in an artificial sheath. After all, Ronin does mean, a samurai with no master. Which also means that if you have possession of that sword, then you must be the myth named Ronin itself\u201d she said. You remained silent and did not say a word. \u201cWell, is that true\u201d she asked. \u201cPerhaps\u201d you responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, if you don\u2019t want to be direct, then let me offer you this. I do have books that mention the sword, but unfortunately I can\u2019t just hand them to you\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t wish to join the Night Raid\u201d you asked. \u201cExactly right; however if you do wish to join, the books would be all yours to read. The decision requires commitment\u201d she responded. \u201cTough choice\u201d you commented. \u201cPerhaps you joining us may lead to history you wish to learn about, you never know\u201d she added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it for a brief moment.</span></div></div>",

Akame got into a fighting stance placing her hand onto her sword, ready to draw it. You stood there in place with your hands on your side not moving a muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe seems a little cocky, not getting into a fighting stance, he\u2019ll regret it\u201d the girl with pink haired said. You didn\u2019t let her sly comment bother you; however, that gave you a hint on how skillful with Akame is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFight\u201d the boss announced commencing the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a split second, Akame drew her sword and flew straight at you with her sword pointing right at your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*kssht*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone\u2019s faces filled with shock. Just as fast her movement, you dodged her attack, yet stopped her movement by grabbing her blade, holding in place with your left hand. Even Akame\u2019s faces filled with shock, almost as if she was horrified by your reaction to her attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u201d she questioned. \u201cWhat was he thinking, does he not know about the power behind Akame\u2019s sword\u201d the boy with brown haired asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the speed of light, you drew your sword with your right hand, pulling the sword upside down. Your sword followed along with your forearm, stopping the blade right in front of Akame\u2019s neck. \u201cFinished\u201d you said, ending the fight as if it were a finishing blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how\u201d you heard her team say in shock. \u201cHow is he even able to move\u201d you heard the boy with brown hair ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain from your wound on your left hand began to sink in with immense pain. And black markings began to spread from your left arm. However, the markings stopped spreading when reached it your elbow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRonin\u201d you said and the markings began to glow to white and shattered away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkame gasped from what she just saw, then pulled her blade away from your hand. \u201cWhat.. happened\u201d Leone said barely even able to let words out of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough\u201d the boss said. \u201cBut how did you\u201d Akame asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s true then\u201d the boss looked at you and asked. You\u2019re attention was drawn toward the boss. \u201cYou do possess the imperial arm, Ronin\u201d she asked. \u201cThat\u2019s the power of Ronin\u201d Akame asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut boss, how can you tell, you said the sword he held was a fake\u201d Leone asked. \u201cI wasn\u2019t wrong about that sword that he\u2019s holding. There many mysteries about the imperial arm \u2018Ronin\u2019, not all of its capabilities are known, even in written text; however, the ability to counter another\u2019s imperial arm in such a way, has definitely been scene\u201d she explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRonin, why don\u2019t you show everyone your wound\u201d the boss asked. You wipes the blood off of your hand and presented your palm to everyone. The wound that you got from Akame\u2019s blade was completely healed. Everyone was surprised by this. \u201cI also know that the Ronin, is capable of healing it\u2019s user\u201d the boss concluded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you\u2019ve figured out this much, I will admit, that I do possess \u2018Ronin\u2019\u201d you admitted. \u201cI thought just as much, that will be enough.

My name is Najenda, and I am the leader of Night Raid, that\u2019s why everyone refers to me as boss\u201d Najenda said.

Everyone had a little bit of an embarrassing look on their faces, as if they were sorry for your slight incompetence. \u201cI think you\u2019ll understand what I mean later, for now call me whatever you like\u201d Bulat replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Lubbock\u201d the boy with green hair said. \u201cAs you probably already know, my name is Leone\u201d the blonde haired girl said. \u201cMy name is Mine\u201d the girl with pink haired said, she had a little bit of a cocky attitude, but you sensed a little bit of empathy in her. \u201c\u2018My name is Sheele, and it\u2019s very nice to meet you\u201d the girl with light purple hair said. She seemed to have a nice and kind aura around her. \u201cI am Akame\u201d Akame said reintroducing herself, even though both have already faced each other. You knew from just that fight, she was quite the talented swordsman nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Night Raid. Now I understand rumors have called you Ronin in the past, but do you have a real name you go by\u201d Najenda asked. \u201cIt\u2019s true that\u2019s what people have called me, but I prefer not to be called that; however, my name\u201d you said but hesitated. You realized that you have never gone by an actual name, you must\u2019ve forgotten your name after you woke up two years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have a name\u201d Leone asked. \u201cC\u2019mon, everyone should at least know that\u201d Mine added. \u201cThe truth is, everything before two years ago I can\u2019t remember\u201d you replied. \u201cWhat, really?! What happened\u201d Tatsumi asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know, all remember was waking up in a grassy field, with no memory at all\u201d you answered. \u201cSo that\u2019s why you are trying to find answers\u201d Akame asked. \u201cYes, and all I know is the name Ronin, but that name doesn\u2019t feel right to me as a person\u201d you replied. \u201cDo you have a name you\u2019d like us to call you by\u201d Najenda asked. You thought hard for a moment but could not come up with anything. \u201cSorry, but I can\u2019t think of a name\u201d you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe we should give you a name, how is that\u201d Najenda asked. \u201cYes, that\u2019s okay with me\u201d you relied. \u201cOooo, maybe we should name you after a heroic hero\u201d Leone asked. \u201cOr maybe after a legendary swordsman\u201d Sheele added. \u201cWell, it can\u2019t be dumb as a name like Tatsumi\u201d Mine commented, mocking Tatsumi. \u201cWhat did you say, I think my name is great\u201d Tatsumi rambled. \u201cYeah, yeah. Of course you would say that\u201d Mine replies, giving Tatsumi a cold shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Tatsumi, I think you\u2019re name is great\u201d Bulat replied, giving Tatsumi a friendly grin and a wink. \u201cBro, why\u2019d you have to say like that\u201d Tatsumi replies, slowly sliding away from Bulat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think Yuki would be a nice name\u201d Akame said. \u201cOooo, that would be nice, fits him perfectly\u201d Leone responded. \u201cYuki does sound like a nice name\u201d Najenda added. \u201cYeah it matches your hair and your eyes\u201d Tatsumi said getting a good look at your facial features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does that sound\u201d Najenda asked.</span></div></div>",

Also I would like to apologize if I write some chapters are a little short, sometimes I don't have episodes or dialogue from the anime itself to give me a hand. and eventually I may redo storylines to improve them. with that said, here are my rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-there must be a chaos option<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -if you go with the chaos option, the name of the character is Sasuke Uchiha<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -normal, do what you want, but make it a good storry and no one liner chapters unless its a choice and please, keep those to an absolute minimum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -I will allow foot fetish and sex, but nothing extreme okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Also, despite how many of these characters get killed off here, I am going to say this once about the females main, NO KILLING THEM OFF! Either they can exist in their own storylines, or they can share it, but keep them alive, the men, you can kill but make sure they go out with a fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless you're chaos, you need to have an Imperial arms with only 1 power, that will be the Normal choice. in fact, I will make all normal choices, \"Imperial Arms\" get creative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun you guys.</td>",
