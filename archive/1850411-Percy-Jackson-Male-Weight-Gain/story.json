It was a Saturday so their was no big rush to get out of bed. He laid there for a while letting the sun wash over his body. Finally with a great groan Percy heaved himself from bed. He had recently taken to just sleeping in his powder blue boxers which he now roughly scratched his junk through before scratching his rear. Was it his imagination, or was there a bit of a jiggle back there? Percy shook it off and started to get dressed. Percy pulled his blue jeans up, but he struggled a little to get them around his butt. \"I have a little more junk in the trunk than I used to\" thought Percy  as he finally got his tight jeans buttoned. Next Percy pulled his orange camp half blood shirt over his. The size medium was a lot tighter and more form fitting than it used to be. Percy turned to look at himself in the mirror, his huge thighs were squeezed like sausages into his jeans and his slightly flabby chest filled out his shirt. The biggest difference in Percy though was his belly which was bulging out over his waistband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Percy thinks it's new Muscle or Does he Know he is getting fat? </span></div></div>",

He wasn't ashamed at all. He was curious.<br>\r\nTentatively, he slipped a hand under his gut (yeah, it was classified as a gut now).

What's up?\"<br>\r\nWill shrugged as he easily caught up with him. \"Nothing much. Are you heading to lunch, too?\"<br>\r\nPercy nodded, relieved that Will hadn't noticed the extra pounds he'd packed on.<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, what...?\" Will studied Percy's softer face, then glanced as his thicker arms and legs, his blue eyes ultimately landing on the not-so-subtle curve of his stomach. He placed a hand over the bulge, grinning playfully. \"What's this, Percy?\" He gave it two gentle pats, causing it to jiggle in response.<br>\r\nPercy's cheeks burned, tinted with scarlet. \"U-Um, nothing, Will.\"<br>\r\nWill chuckled, patting him on the back reassuringly. \"Don't worry about it, Perce. It actually looks really good on you, as strange as that might sound.\"<br>\r\nPercy's brows furrowed. \"Seriously? I'm... <i>fat</i> and you're saying I look good?\" He asked, bewildered.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it's not just me who thinks so. I mean,\" The blonde motioned around to nearby campers heading to the pavilion. \"Look, they're all looking at you, and they're practically <i>drooling.</i>\"<br>\r\nIt was true. All the other demigods were staring dreamily at their now-chubby hero.<br>\r\n\"Okay, look, all I'm going to say is, you look great, thin or chunky. It's up to you whether you want to stay this way, or go back to your old, lean self.\" Will finished, and without waiting for Percy to respond, sprinted off.<br>\r\nPercy had yet another decision to make.

He pulled out his normal attire (jeans, an orange Camp tee, and so on...) and threw them on. As he made his way to the door, he glanced at his mom's homemade blue cookies in a plastic container. Popping open the lid, he snatched a couple and practically moaned. They were <i>so </i>good\u2013 No, beyond just \"good.\" They were <i>devilishly</i> good. He was tempted to just ignore whoever was calling for him and finish off the whole tub of cookies.

You don't have... shoes on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got socks on.\" Percy shrugged laxly in response, finishing off the cookies. \"Also, this probably isn't the worst I've walked on without shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Percy!\" Chiron clip-clopped into the room. \"I apologize for sending Malcolm to wake you up, but this is... somewhat important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mentor nodded gravely. \"Mr. D and I have... received information stating that a god or goddess may have cast a spell on the Camp as an act of revenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what the spell is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron looked hesitant. \"We haven't figured it out yet, but we believe it isn't something major. Just\u2013\" He paused, his face a mask of concern and... something else Percy couldn't identify. \"Be careful, my boy? If you feel anything different or strange, tell someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shifted, suddenly feeling a bit guilty. \"Um, Chiron, I'm leaving today. Back to the city. For school.\" He sighed. \"I'm sorry, I can't help you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all right, child.\" To his surprise, the centaur smiled gently. \"I, though, should be the one who's apologizing. We're dragging you into another problem. You've already done so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy smiled in return, giving a small wave. \"It's fine, just give me updates, okay?\" He turned to walk away, but abruptly stopped. \"And I <i>promise </i>I'll Iris Message you right away if I feel sick, or anything different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Does Percy keep that promise?</b></span></div></div>",

That was a new record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the best part by far, was the food. Dam, he'd forgotten how good juicy burgers and salty fries were. And just<i> junk food in general</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he may or may not have gorged himself on whenever he could find, such as a pan of his mom's rich homemade brownies, a box of greasy pepperoni pizza, or tubs of Chinese food from that really good restaurant across the street...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight, like usual, he didn't even realize he ate that much until he mindlessly reached for another, only to find nothing was left.

He discovered a gallon tub of chocolate ice cream, but he realized he needed a spoon <i>after </i>he sat down on his bed.

He threw the empty tub under his bed, ignoring his stomach's angry gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid back down, gently running his hands over his surprisingly taut, yet fleshy gut. Breathing a sigh of contentment out of his nose, he passed out into food sated slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy woke up to his mom in the hallway calling for him to get up. After a few minutes of blinking open bleary eyes and yawning, he reluctantly slid out of warm, comfy bed. He was surprised to feel slightly cooler air hit his legs, until he realized he had probably taken off his jeans during the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSauntering over dresser, he pulled out some clothes. He crammed a shirt on fairly easily, (though he could feel a small breeze hit his stomach), but his jeans...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jeans, <i>gods</i>. Once he managed to get them up his legs with several hops, they were practically <i>suffocating </i>his thighs.

They didn't touch each other though, so that was a good thing. His arms, too, were flabbier and thicker, jiggling slightly whenever he moved. His face was softer, too, with something that would soon turn into a double chin. But his belly <u>by far</u> had the most obvious change. It bulged out over his tight waistband, and pressed against his shirt, creating an outline of the round object. The fabric even rode up an inch, revealing a strip of tannish skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" Percy whispered to himself. \"How did I let myself get this big?\" He lifted the shirt over his gut, causing it to bunch up. He poked the blob experimentally, letting out a small gasp. It was soft.<i> So soft</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could also grab a handful of the jiggly flesh. <i>Woah.</i> This was weird. <b>Percy...</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy let out a huge burp as he rubbed his tanned belly. And a belly was exactly what it was now, the demigods abs had slowly been covered in a thick layer of fat that'd formed into a decent sized pot belly that now hung over his crotch. He was currently collapsed on his back on the couch, his fat body proudly on display in the only clothes that fit him now, a pair of plain white undies. Percy currently rested on his significantly plusher ass that would never fit into any of his old clothes so large had it grown, and two jiggly thighs that now rubbed against eachother all the way down to his knees when he walked which was not often anymore. Above his belly lay an impressive set of moobs which would easily have been a B cup, maybe even a C, on any woman, and Percy's face had also chubbed up, becoming round and squishy with one extra wobbly chin situated beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all Percy had spent the last month doing exactly what the mysterious voice, which unknown to him belonged to his secret grandmother Adephagia goddess of gluttony, had told him to do, that is eat as much as possible and then spend time napping between each meal so each delicious calorie could place itself somewhere on his fattening form. That's were Percy found himself right now,  waking up on the couch from a very deep food coma which'd come after he'd stuffed himself with more food than any mere mortal would have been able to with the remains of his godly feast scattered around the room. Empty pizza boxes, donut boxes, bags and containers from McDonalds, KFC and Taco Bell, and even a pan which'd contained brownies cooked by his mother, lay around him, the contents of the feast having been stuffed into his belly a few hours before, and now he was awoken by the same unnatural hunger which'd forced him to eat so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy let out another humoungus belch as both his hands jiggled and wobbled his big pot belly, a grin plastered on his face as he admired his appetites handiwork. He didn't know what'd caused his sudden hunger, maybe just the stress of working so hard for so long, but neither did he particularly care, all he knew was that he loved his fattening body and was enjoying making it even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had however been a strange month for Percy as food seemed to appear randomly as fast as he could consume it. he would wake up after a binge to find the fridge restocked with all the food he'd eaten before, and huge feasts of take-away had started appearing at his door whenever he was hungry, having already been paid for by a mysterious benefactor who only identified themselves as a \"Friend of Poseidon\". Still, Percy hadn't been bothered to question it all too much, after all if someone wanted to help sate his appetite and grow his body larger he was more than happy to accept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hungry rumbling from his belly became angrier and more insistent Percy suddenly heard the door bell ring, and his grin widened as he knew exactly what that would mean, more food! He moaned and groaned as he tried to stand up, his attempts to bend at the middle rendered useless by his last feast, and he instead had to turn on his side and slide onto his feet so he could stand, having to quickly adjust to his new centre of gravity lest he fall back to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly waddled his way to the door, his fatty hips swaying side to side as his whole body jiggled from the speed with which he moved. Completely forgetting his mostly naked state Percy threw open the door and stood panting as he surveyed the stack of food which sat before him. Previously the food had been delivered by the normal way, from a junk food place by a delivery man, but this time a large collection of delicious and fattening Greek food simply lay before his door. A huge feast fit for an entire party of mortals, the likes of which they would likely eat on mount Olympus sat before Percy, and rather than questioning it's origin the tubby demigod simply couldn't wait to eat it. From huge roast animals to plates of sea food salads drenched in oil and a beautiful range of Greek desserts sat on twenty platters before the demigods house.  He quickly carried it all inside over a few trips, his divine strength still allowing him to lift more than a normal human even after a month of overeating and laziness, although the plates were considerably lighter by the time they reached the couch that Percy was looking forward to collapsing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, ten minutes later, Percy stood gasping for air with his hands on his squishy hips as he surveyed the feast that lay before him. Percy was almost afraid, even with his new appetite he didn't think he'd be able to finish this spread alone. Suddenly the same voice appeared in his head:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Go Perseus, eat! Gorge! Grow!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaliva filled Percy's mouth as his appetite roared to life, and he quickly flung himself onto the couch and pulled the first of many platters towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour hours had passed, and now all that could be heard in Percy's living room was gasping and groaning, the remnants of what had been a colossal feast lay scattered around the form of an incredibly engorged demigod. Percy's belly had been filled to the brim with food over and over, each time he reached his peak he had found a new surge of hunger as he shoved yet another mouthful of deliciously fattening food down his throat. The effects of his gorging were obvious, his once respectable pot belly had become a huge, taut ball, making him look 12 months pregnant. It sat proudly atop his otherwise chubby form, all elasticity and jiggle gone from his now tight sphere of a gut. Percy sat there, groaning at the pain his stuffed belly caused him, his hands rubbing and caressing all of the tanned skin they could reach to try and soothe the aching his gluttony had lead to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the young boy lay there rubbing his gut filled with calories, soon to be added to his already chubby body, a figure stood in darkness and watched him from afar. Adephagia stood and watched her handiwork with glee, her imagination churning with images of how fat her grandson would be now that he could feast in earnest. No grandson of hers would be a skinny warrior, prancing about and playing at war like his fool of a father. No, Percy would accept her gifts, gluttony and obesity, and soon there would be nothing anyone could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Percy's living room, the young boy was beginning to slip into a food coma the likes of which he had never experienced, the crushing weight of his belly was slowly becoming shrouded in his post feast laziness. As his hands dropped to his side Percy's grimace quickly turned into a soft smile as his thought were carried away to dreams of the feasts to come, each larger and more fattening than the last.</span></div></div>",

He shut his eyes to savor the last bites, as he moane D in pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou like it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPe R cy looked up to see Annabeth standing beside him smiling seductively, admiring the many folds of fat encompassing his face. Percy nodded his jowls jiggling as he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d She said kissing the Side of his fAce, \u201cI made those burgers with my love.\u201d She  went up her boyfriend\u2019s ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou want some more?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\t\u201cYes, yes Yes!\u201d Percy said, his voice husky, reverberating under his pounds of  fat. Droll flew From his mouth as hE did!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis lovers smile widened and she pulled a plate of brownies from under the bed, holding just in front of Percy awaiting mawouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell eat up!\u201d Annabeth said with glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPercy shook his massive head forward trying to smash his face into the plate, and devour the brownies, but Annabeth had put it just out of reach, on top of his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUgh Ugh Ugh\u201d Percy grunted with exertion trying to bring his face to the brownies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPercy Jackson the champion of Olympias was now reduced to a blob of fattened lard, bedbound by his own fat. Days and days of constant stuffing had left the fattened teen drowning in his own lard, and left in this useless state. His strong legs had not held his weight in weeks, and he wondered if they were even recognizable as feet anymore, or were just added pounds of pure fat. His toned abs had exploded out into a mammoth gut, crushing him under more then a tone of weight at all times. And his arms, once strong enough to bring down gods, monsters, and titans hung uselessly at his side, to big round and fat to move on their own. Muscles gone replaced by sweet delicious fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnnabeth!\u201d Percy pleaded trying desperately to find a way to get the brownies down his gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Annabeth asked innocently still by his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease.\u201d The fallen hero begged, out of breath by his momentary exertion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnnabeth smile turned to a grin as she sniggled against her boyfriend\u2019s flab, delighted by his helpless state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell if you insist.\u201d She said climbing onto his stomach, the plate of brownies in her hand. Slowly one by one she began to feed them into her boyfriend\u2019s waiting maw, one by one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPercy moaned again in contentment, as his ravenous appetite was given the one thing that had been carved into him as a source of pleasure, food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>Do you want to eat more, to grow bigger</b>?\u201d a voice asked a woman\u2019s voice, it was not Annabeth it deeper older, but all the same the voice filled Percy\u2019s head with a delighted fever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPercy nodded rapidly, and he could fell the voice smiling in pleasure of the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<i><b>Good, good, that makes you good Percy</b></i>.\u201d Percy felt his whole body shiver, the voice\u2019s praise made him feel as if his every nerve ending was being washed under a warm bath of pleasure, more then anything he wanted to please the voice again<br>\r\n. <br>\r\n\t<i><b>\u201cDo you like being good Percy?</b></i>\u201d Percy nodded, his eyes rolling to the back of his head from pleasure. The sensation of his girlfriend on his belly feeding him, bite after bite of sweets, coupled with the voices praise was growing to much for the young demigod to handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<i><u><b>So you won\u2019t fight this feeling, you\u2019ll embrace it?</b></u></i>\u201d the voice asked sweetly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNgh-Yes Yes ahh\u201d Percy moaned out through a moth full of brownie, his brain feeling as it would fry, but he wanted this feeling to last forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>That good, I\u2019ll hold you to it Percy, but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll be easy and I can offer plenty of\u2026 <i><u>encouragement</u></i></b>.\u201d With that the voice was gone, but the pleasure inside Percy continued to grow with each bite he took. Percy kept his mouth opened as his girlfriend continued to shove confection into his mouth. Percy hardly waited to chew, needing to fill his endless gluttony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut too soon Annabeth jumped off her boyfriend\u2019s stomach, Percy wailed in desperation his pleasure yet to reach crescendo. His girlfriend gave a sly grin and showed the previously stacked platter of brownies was empty. Percy gnashed his teeth, he need more, much more! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe door to Percy\u2019s room opened, and a cart was pushed in, one decked out in every form of sweet candy on could imagine. <br>\r\n\t\u201cHello Percy!\u201d Grover, his goat ygoodyo leggeded friend called pushing the cart in \u201cHungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPercy just opened his mouth in answer. Grover smiled wider and pushed his cart in, next to Percy. Behind him another cart came in, pushed by the smiling Face of Nico, and behind his came Jason, and Leo, Piper, all of them came in smiling bring in carts of food for Percy to consume. Percy could not have been happier. He opened his mouth wide and let the stuffing commence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPercy! Percy!\u201d Even the gods were chanting his name. <br>\r\n\t\u201cPercy Percy Percy!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe demigods eyes snapped open, he look around confused waking from a food coma. He looked around, he was in his living room he had just eaten the massive feast that had been brought to his door. He looked down at his body, he was out of shape and a bit bloated, but he was no were near bed bound immobile. <br>\r\n\tWait why would he? The vividness of his dream seemed to fade each second and even as he tried to hold on to it, it faded into just a dull feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPercy!\u201d a voice called in front of him, he looked up to see<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Percy relaxed onto the couch, hand slipping under his tight waistband to tug it down under his bloated belly. After a few minutes of burping and massaging his gut, Annabeth entered the room holding a plastic container of donuts and a large jug of whole milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised an eyebrow at the sight of Percy rubbing his clearly full belly, \"You sure you can finish all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine,\" He looked a bit smug, giving his gut a small pat. It jiggled softly. \"And besides, my appetite's been crazy lately,\" He added, \"Yesterday I ate, like, seven burgers in one sitting,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth took the lid off the cardboard box and picked up the first one. It was powdered, and probably had some sort of sweet fruit jelly in the middle. \"I'm going to guess that your increased appetite is your body's reaction to all the weight you've gained recently in such a short time. I think it's trying to keep up.\" She held the doughnut up to his mouth, \"Now open up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart, Wise Girl,\" He grinned, but obeyed, moaning softly when he found there <i>was</i> jelly in it. \"Mmm, they're good. You should try some, 'Beth.\" He said around a mouthful of donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth shook her head, \"I can't gain any weight. I'm still the dagger instructor back at Camp. You, on the other hand,\" She fed him another donut, \"don't have to worry about a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy smiled and ate the remaining donuts swiftly, silently hoping he didn't get hiccups. \"Y'know, I'll probably hit 300 by the end of the week,\" He said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth's eyes widened a bit, \"What do you weigh now?\" She asked, but she was more lustful than curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmh, 'bout 290.\" He answered around a mouthful of a chocolate filled donut. He then burped and reached for the jug of whole milk, but was stopped by Annabeth, who gently pushed his arm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your job is to eat, mister,\" She said, grinning playfully, \"I'll get everything for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy smiled, and cooed sarcastically, \"Aww, you're such a sweet girlfriend. Not letting me move a muscle and just get fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shush and drink,\" She held the milk up to his lips, and he gulped it down enthusiastically. He lifted a hand to signal when he was done, and Annabeth set it down on the table and grabbed another pastry. He belched loudly, then let her feed him once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how the Hades are you going to gain 10 pounds in a week? That's nearly one and a half pounds a day.\" She asked, tilting her head curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he looked bashful and swallowed down the rest of his donut, \"Yeah, I know. I, um, don't really know how it happens, but I usually gain about 12 pounds a week. 10 pounds will be, well...\" He smirked mischeiviously, \"A piece of cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth shook her head and tried to suppress her laughter at his terrible pun. He was such a dork. \"That was awful.\" Suddenly, her eyes softened and she cupped his soft chin, \"I love you, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned forward and gently kissed her, \"I love you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What next?</b></span></div></div>",

His face turned pink, drawing his attention to his own face, and he saw his slight double chin and chubby cheeks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that embarrassed him about this was the fact that everyone would have already noticed.

He couldn't get the button done and the zipper continued to aggressively retreat from Nico's belly.  He sighed and walked on numbing legs for a shirt.  Even his biggest one didn't conceal his belly.  He added a sweatshirt to that, which seemed to work.  He hoped nobody would find it suspicious.  It was mid summer after all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breakfast horn sounded. </span></div></div>",

They filled their bowls with as much assorted pasta as possible, and then chowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** *************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, Percy leaned back from the table. \"I am stuffed!\" he declared. Leo burped in agreement. \"I can't eat another bite!\" Frank cradled his swollen stomach. \"I can't believe we ate it all!\" Jason hiccuped. \"But it was -hic!- so good!\" Each of them sported a rounded out stomach. The waitress walked over to drop the dessert menu on the table. Percy picked it up and saw something called a \"Baklava Sundae Platter.\" \"Waitress!\" he called. \"Can a get a small sample of this?\" She came back with a small spoon with a little honey colored pastry and soft-serve ice cream. \"He tasted it. \"Oh, wow, this is good.\" Jason moaned. \"Oh, don't tell me you're going to eat more?\" Percy ordered the Baklava Sundae Platter. \"Yep, you are,\" Jason answered himself. \"No,\" said Percy. \"So are <i>we</i>. You've got to have this. <br>\r\nThe waitress returned with a platter just smalled than the Pasta platter. This had slices of the pastry in a large bowl in the middle, and various ice cream flavors on the outside. Percy forced every one to try just a spoonful. Each of them did, and instantly grabbed a bowl and filled it with some baklava and ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another hour, Jason moaned and leaned back in his seat, too stuffed to move.

He was gonna win this for sure.  He slid a camp shirt on and was a bit disturbed when it didn't cover his gut and the sleeves squeezed his arms more than they had when he was muscled.  His pants were the real issue.  They went up to his thighs without much issue, but stopped there.  It took a funny dance just to get them over his butt, and then they wouldn't zip up.  He decided to leave it unzipped and just button it as best he could without crushing himself and headed out for breakfast.  Annabeth had left him a note that he found on his way out.  'I won't be at breakfast or lunch today.  Studying to do.  XX -Wise Girl'.

Instead of being embarrassed like he would normally be under the circumstances, Percy shed his old jeans (with much difficulty) and put on a size bigger.  Even those were a bit tight, but he didn't want to spoil himself with the bigger ones.  He replaced his shirt with a loose one so he didn't feel so squished around his midsection.  Looking down, he saw the swell of his stomach below him and felt the pressure of two chins in his neck.  His butt pressed against his pants with strength enough to make him nervous and his legs were trapped in the denim.  The thickness of his arms is what got to him most, probably because that was the only bit of him not covered in fabric that he could see.  They shook as he moved, and he didn't like it.  Sweatshirt time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason paced his room wondering how on earth the son of Poseidon had managed that he did.  Not by pacing around and it eating, Jason thought.

He dropped the new clothes on his bed and and stepped on his scale.  He had gained thirty pounds just from his breakfast.  He was surprised at how much he would feel it weighing him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pulled his pants off, almost resorting to cutting them when it took five minutes.  The denim print was pressed into his legs which were even still burdened with intense stretch marks.  His shirt came off with the sound of popping fabric in his ears.  His stomach was rounded off with stretch marks as well. He winced and poked his belly as if to make sure it was real.  His finger sunk into the warm squish and it jiggled. Jason quickly covered it with his massive shirt and squeezed on his larger jeans.  He grabbed one pill from the stash he had taken from Percy and swallowed it, walking out to lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was already there when Jason arrived.  He was shivering food into his mouth almost faster than he could true.  Too many of the pills gave the feeling of intense starvation that didn't go away after you ate.  He felt sick, like his growing stomach was emptying itself as soon as it was filled.  His body swelled as it converted almost everything he ate into body mass.  His stomach popped from under his shirt and the button flew off of his jeans with the pressure.  His weight pushed himself into the seat at the table.  Gravity felt like it had too much against him.  He knew he should stop, this wasn't worth the bet.  But he couldn't.  He felt like his stomach was eating itself from hunger and he just couldn't stop.  The magical food-supplying plates didn't help his restriction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat and ate about four times as much as he normally would, most of which was converted into fat for him.  The stress on his pants was enough to pull the zipper down and make him uncomfortable, but the button stayed firmly in place.  His face felt obviously wider and chubbier as he ate, making it feel strange to open his mouth and chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Percy finally satisfied his hunger, he was almost too big to get out of the space between the table and bench.</span></div></div>",
