            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the an the not so distant future, there was a terrible accident. This accident caused a new race of people on the planet earth. However, this new race wasn't exactly new. A virus went out and shrank over 50% of the worlds population to about 3 inches. Men, Women, Children, and even some animal groups were affected. In the aftermath of this, there came the period of time that the governments tried to fix this, trying to return the people to normal. After that failed they looked into making the shrunked people more comfortable. This was impossible, as there were millions of little people around and not enough careful people to not harm this new race, accidentally or otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, instead of making them comfortable, they decided to try and make them more resistant. Thankfully, the shrinking had made changes to make this simple. Their genetic code was easy to minipulate. All they had to do was insert the desired trait into a future Mother, and the baby, and all after them, would have the traits. They could be given extra strength, or a resitance to acid and severe temperatures. This was a good day for the 'Tinies' as they were called. But, like most good things, it came to an end. As soon as it was determined that the Tinies could be of use by themselves, they were put to use. At first, it was just small things, like deep cleaning or things that humans couldn't do. But as the tinies gained more and more abilities, they proved capable of doing much more. But even a tiny that could lift 100 times his own wieght, couldn't do much more than move a bed around the house. A fire starter could make a blow torch intensity of flame, but not long enough to threaten a human, as some found out the hard way. Even with multiple abilities, tinies were still in danger of being stomped or eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, they broke off and formed communities of thier own. Breeding to make more powerful offspring with more abilities. When the humans heard about this they became concerned. Some acted out, squashing them out, literally. Obviously that wasn't the only thing the humans did to tinies they captured. But by the time good humans could stop the conflict, the tinies struck back. A few hundred deaths was all the world needed to make a war. Not a very fair war though. An order was given, that the tinies with abilities were to be purged. All traces of anything that could alter a tiny was destroyed and the remaining tinies, wither they took part in the war or not, were no longer protected. The humans could do whatever they wanted with them, when found. By the time 10 years passed from the war, only 1 sect of powered tinies remained. They hid out, till it died down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis group of Tinies were called the Backbreakers. They became legends, but not in some revolutionary way. They decided that, rather than become a threat to be purged, they would become an asset to be desired. They would help humans, clean their houses, operate as covert spies, and anything that a powered tiny would excel at. In a sense, they were the invisible servants, unknown to even the human masters they served. Usually, the only proof they were there was what was done. Like a mess of a home becoming constantly as clean as a whistle, regardless of how much the occupants messed it up, or a sudden file folder on a CIA operative's desk with information of a... task they were persuing. But sense they only numbered in the hundereds in the world, they were rarely anywhere. Even more so, because they died in service, like any other tiny found by humans, they were considered a pest. That was what tinies were now, pests. They lived in the wild or in houses, stealing food and barely surviving. Sure, some were more able or made friends with a human, but a majority of the time, they were pests. Enough so that house cats had a new source of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, this is what you are. Sent alone into the world to be of use. You are new to this, and travel along. But what are you???</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That was close,\" you said to yourself. You had just perched up on a branch as a snake had attacked. A normally harmless gardener snake, to humans, was a huge problem for you. Being only 3 inches tall had its downsides, obvioulsy. However, you were a Backbreaker and as such you had abilities that gave you a slight edge in such situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike most Backbreakers, you had the default abilities that all of them seemed to have. Stock abilities usually were; increased strength, increased durability, increased perception, and increased speed. Basically, you were safe from accidental death like being stepped on, kicked, or a host of other things like falling, or jumping, from your current perch (nearly 10 feet up a tree, human scale). However, being digested, bit, cut, chewed, constricted, and other such things still could easily snuff you out of existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour next set of abilities are ones that you had to train to aquire. You had magic and some other abilities, like increased sight for seeing in the dark and whatnot. Spells that helped you clean or remove something from a surface were commonly taught to Backbreakers, so they could do their work without notice. Some mastered different styles after that, like fire or ice, depending on where they were heading and what they liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour final set of abilities came as rare bloodline traits. Each clan under the Backbreakers had one and only one. Some could survive any liquid, acid or water didn't matter. They could breathe under wather or survive a trip through a digestive system... if swallowed alive. Others had a portal ability, allowing them to teleport relatively long distances to avoid capture or death. You on the otherhand had regeneration. It was the most covetted but also the most shunned. It allowed you to be, pretty much immortal. You could be dismembered, digested, splattered, or whatever. When you died, you spawned in the last 'safe' place your brain was aware of. Usually it was a home or shelter that you were hiding in. But what was shunned about it, was that it was not painless. You still felt everything, knowing that you would be alive seldom lessoned the pain of being digested slowly by a snake, or ripped apart by a cat. Playful cats could find your hiding place and do it again. Some of the smarter sapient cats would ask before torture, then got there and resume, letting others know of who and what you are. Dogs were nicer, but same problem. Humans were to big, but if a scientist got a hold of you... you shuddered at the thought. They could cut off a limb and wait for you to grow it back, then repeat to do their... experiments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, for now, you were looking for a place to be useful. You were wondering what to do. So you sped off, avoiding many hazards, until you reached a halfway busy street. You looked around the vast crowd. You saw everything human children to old anthros walking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthros were the government's attempt of replicating the accomplishment they did with the Tinies. The best they could get was anthro humans. At first is was a horrible mistake, but some actually liked it. And, with breeding, formed an even more diverse setting among humans. Dragonesses, Nekos, wolf anthros, and so on. It was now the new trend, if someone could afford the insanely high price, or be lucky enough to be born already as one of these anthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end you decided...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look around the area, and are about to leave, when a young woman catches your eye. As she comes closer, into the square you are looking over from your spot in an overhanging tree, you notice she has a tail and two cute cat ears that flicked and swiveled on her head. From your distance, you couldn't see much of her. You could see her fair skin, her dirty blonde hair that was pulled up in a ponytail at the moment. If you had to guess, under that not so revealing work uniform was an athletic build, even if she was a little on the short side at near 5'5\". But from that far away, it wasn't her looks as a woman that caught your eye. You would have to get a heck lot closer than you were to gawk at her womanly features, or lack there of. It wasn't that she was a Neko or Anthro. There were a few in the crowd, some that passed by were very impressive as they noticed, grabbed, and ate a few tinies that were hiding. No, what stood out to you was the way she was walking. It looked like she had a never ending slump. Like nothing ever went her way, as if luck had abandoned her and misfortune made its home in her. As if to prove that, a teenaged human on a skateboard 'accidentally' plowed right into her, said his appology, than left. She trudged down the street. She needed help, and you needed to give it. So you followed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing a person that much larger than you was usually a bad idea. Tinies would have to run all out to even keep up with a slow walk of a normal person. But as a Backbreaker, you had the ability to follow her. The hard part was doing it so that you weren't noticed. Human life wasn't dead. People walking their pets, going to work, mowing their lawn, or whatever were all things you had to dodge and avoid as you followed her. It would be much easier if you could ride on her shoe or something. But that would risk her seeing you, and that would be bad. So you followed until she turned into a small apartment building. You had to use every one of your stealth spells to avoid detection as you narrowly made the door and was able to climb the stairs after her. You hid behind a plant next to the door she stopped by. With a sigh, she opened her door and went in. You were grateful that she wasn't aware enough to look at you coming in after her. You quickly found her torn up couch and hid underneath while she closed the door. She didn't even bother locking it as she put her purse down onto the well worn table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again...\" She groaned as she hurried over to an open pantry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climbed a lamp that was next to the couch then leapt onto a book shelf that was high enough that you could look out at her without her seeing you. From you new vantage point, you could see much better. Most of her stuff looked secondhand and worn. Most of the rest looked like it was worked over by a family of rats. What she was looking at, was a big mess on the kitchen floor. It looked like something got into her chips and other snacks, took what they wanted, then left the rest where it lay. Now that you were closer, you could see her better. Her clothes might've been a little worn, but it was evident that she kept herself very well. Not suprising, as nekos usually did well in that department. Using their inclinded cat abilities and features to help better than any store bought product. Then she turned and you could see her face glaring at the rest of the room, looking for the culprits. Her face, if not etched with saddness and defeat, was more 'cute' than attractive. Her pouty lips and fair features complimented her petite form and cat like mannerism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, you tinies are wearing me thin. All I got is this apartment, and you are slowly taking that away from me as well.\" She said in a sad tone as she walked over and sat on her couch. It was as if she didn't know what to do. Now that you knew it was tinies that were responsible, you could see the tell tale signs. Holes in the walls for them to hide, dripping from a pipe under the sink for water, and the small scale vandalism that was everpresant in a tiny infested home. She then curled up on the couch and whimpered before falling asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw a few tinies ease out to observe as the others made thier way to get more food. You decided to put a stop to it... and get to work. You leapt over and slid down the lamp post to the ground. Then you pricked the young neko's foot with a dart. The dart was actually a knife, but too small to humans to be more than that. Either way, you could dip it into different things to replicate effects; poison, venom, sleeping powders, or whatever you could make/find. This one made her sleep. You needed time to work after all, and looked like she could use the rest. After that you ran over to the tinies as they worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job with that neko. What you stab her with?\" asked the look out as he greeted you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sleep toxin. Is this all of you?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now. We've only been here a few weeks. The apartment owner is good about ridding the place of us after a while. But this beast hasn't said anything. I think she needs the apartment and can't afford to be kicked out, if she says there are tinies infested in her walls,\" he answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to have to ask you to leave now,\" you said in one shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" He asked, taken a little off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was simple, but I'll say it again. I need you all out of this girl's apartment. Do not return,\" you resplied back as the others joined him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think we'll leave, just because you say so?\" asked another, as he put doen the pile of chips he was carrying. \"If we aren't being scared off by a giantess neko,  you're not going to fair much better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last warning, please leave or I'll drop you in her tiny trap,\" pointing over to the little stick mat left out. It was kind of like a fly strip, only for tinies. But if the tinies knew about it, it lost a majority of its ability to ensnare them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I think you are a little over your head kid. What if we decided to throw YOU in that trap?\" he said as two of them came to grab you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that if you used too much ability, that they would tell your new hoast and that would be the end of that. Luckily, your perception wasn't something they could see. So you moved in and around them as they attacked. You dodged and landed a few punches in areas that quickly immobilized them. Some were in pain, others were unconscious. There were only 5 of them, so it didn't take you too long. With that done, you pulled two of them over to the thin stick strip and threw them into it. You did the same with the others, making sure they rolled to get good and caught. Soon, they were all caught and all awake. So you started walking to the the young Neko girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, where are you going?\" asked one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go wake her up now. Obviously I can't be around when she finds you there,\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! No, you can't do that!\" exclaimed another, the one that led the charge to attack you. The others were trying to free themselves but to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't need to waste any more words on them. You warned them, fair and square. Now you had a problem. You had to get work done, but you couldn't while they were watching. So you needed them gone. Unfortunately, they chose to stay. Only one way to stay, for them at least, and that was in the neko's belly. You knew that they, like most anthro species, liked tinies as meals. Perhaps this would help cheer her up. You walked over to her one overhanging foot that you stabbed before, dipped your knife into a waking solution, then stabbed her again. You quickly got out of sight and made sure the tinies couldn't see your accent to your bookshelf perch. She started to stir and the tinies started to panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... that was a weird dream,\" She stated as she she swung her feet over to the ground and got up. She probably wouldn't have even noticed the tinies if they hadn't been screaming in panicked efforts to escape. \"Am I still dreaming?\" she asked as she walked over to her trap and picked them out of it, depositting them on the table. \"How in the world did you ALL get trapped in there? I have to admit, I never thought that silly thing would actually work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't... just please let us go!\" begged a few of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What good what that do? You'll just come back and steal more of my food and ruin more of my things. You already stole most of my food. I was actually going to go hungry tonight. I don't get paid till tomorrow.\" She asked them. She stroked one of them with her finger. Her neko side was coming out, including the cat side's affinity with playing with her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, we'll do anything you ask of us. Anything!\" begged another of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" they all said at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... ok, but I am hungry so I need to eat a few of you. How about we play a game. Give you all an equal chance of living and I get to eat tonight?\" She offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't you just let us go?\" one of them asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I COULD just eat you all too.\" She said with a stern voice. You were slightly suprised. You didn't know a neko to give any of their meals a free pass. That wasn't what you were taught, nor what you'd seen. If there was one group that could, it was humans, and that was not very often. She was either really nice or really manipulative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, We'll play any game you want.\" They all said. It would appear they understood well enough not to push it, like they did with you. At least they were learning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, I can't play anything like hide and seek. That would be pointless with you all. I could... yes that will be perfect. Ok, here's the game.\" She said. You were right. This little distraction had lifted her spirits a good deal. You were glad she wasn't so far gone as to be in depression. \"Ok, it is going to be like a little tournament. I will put two of you in my mouth. That way I get to taste all of you at one point. You each have to get out as fast as you can. It is just, that I can only let one out. So 3 of you get to start an new life, NOT IN MY APARTMENT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there are 5 of us. Which one doesn't have to play?\" one asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very observant little guy. I'll let you all decide who gets a free pass. You see, I'm not heartless. After all, it wouldn't be fair if you all ate all my food and I get nothing.\" She said back then let them talk amongst themselves. You couldn't hear from your perch. But finally one man came forward. \"So you get the free pass. I'll just stick you here for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the tiny in the middle of the table then looked at the other 4. She seamed to be dividing them up as she plucked one up than another. She held them amazingly gentle for what you thought she would, or had seen others do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, first round boys. Remember, first one out of my lips. Don't worry about falling, I'll catch you.\" She winked at them then opened her mouth wide. She was careful as she lowered them both into her mouth then leveled out her head. She sealed her mouth and hummed as she worked them around in there. You half thought she was going to swallow them both anyway, but she opened her mouth a few minutes later. \"Weew, co on (Well, come one),\" she said with them in her mouth. There was a flurry of movement that she moaned to. You could see indentations as they hit her cheek. Apparently they were really fighting in there. Finally, one of them appeared on the other side of her lips, jumping out. She barely caught him in her hands. With that she closed her mouth over an audible yell from inside. She smiled around the arms that were protruding from her mouth. With a slurp they were in and she moved them her morsle around then tilted back and swallowed. You saw the lump travel down her throat and disappear behind her chest. \"Oh my, if I get this every time you guys steal from me, then you're all welcome back anytime.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the man in her hands then put him gently down next to the other free man. She then picked up the other two and repeated the process. She may have taken a little longer tasting them this time. But this time, the other tiny had made it all the way to his waste before she closed her mouth. The other hung from her lips, forgetting or not trusting that she woulf catch him now that he won. She put her hand under the man and opened again, but only to protrude her tongue under the other man and tilt back so he was sliding into her mouth. The other man lost his grip and fell into her palm. He watched close up as she played with the other man then swallowed him as well. For the first time she looked in a way that you could see her eyes. They contrasted her hair beautifully with a very vibrant green. Unlike before, her ears were twitching happily and you knew that this was the person you wanted to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now time to take you all out.\" she said, considerably more chipper than before as she held her hand out for the other two to join the one recovering in her hand. They did so, be it reluctantly, she then stood and went to leave. \"Remeber, you can come back IF you want me to eat you. Otherwise, this is your one free pass.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she was out and you leapt over to the window. You saw her exit the building, bend over, and release the tinies into a hidden place behind some bushes. She seamed to talk with them a little then came back inside. You hid as she came back. You watched as she cheerily grabbed the broom and cleaned the mess that had previously added to her apparently horrible day. You would have to wait till she went to bed or left again to start your work. But you looked forward to making her this happy again. She would never know it was you, but that didn't matter, Backbreakers weren't meant to be seen for what they do anyway.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What the...\" Kelly said. Through the night, after she went to sleep, you had cleaned what she hadn't on the surface anyway. From this you were able to see a few documents that held her name, Kelly. You only had enough time to deep clean all the surfaces and organize things that were just lying around. You hid on the shelf again. You thought she saw you as she came over to the shelf. But it seamed like she was just checking out where all the books were. She walked around, shook her head, then proceeded to check all the things she normally did when looking for things to clean. \"Maybe I did more last night than I remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she got ready for work and took off. You had to admit, watching her get ready wasn't the worst part of your day. She was rather attractive. But when she left in a decent mood, you felt pretty good and got to work. It didn't bother you that she took the credit for what you did. Backbreakers weren't more than a myth around normal people, anthro or not. You started on a few things. Patching the vandalized furniture and restoring tinted walls were first. You then went to work on fortifying a tunnel system in the walls. Unlike most Tinies, you had to make sure the tunnels were unnoticed, even if someone tore open the walls to look. But you also had to make sure they were clear so you could disappear no matter what room you were in. Closing up noticeable entrances and making ones that normal sized people could never find, save for one. It was crucial for one entrance. It was rare, but to have NO infestation was more damaging than having a large one, especially for your line of work. If they started wondering who was doing the work, having no entrances would only prove that some powered tiny was responsible. Which would bring attention to your kind. So, you needed to keep that door open sort of speak. It also helped so that the owner could thank who they thought was doing the work... if the owner was that type of person. You hadn't done any of the heavy visible work yet, just the clean and background work by the time you heard the key turn and you dove into a entrance, looking out a newly made one way window. Much better than looking from the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, hopefully this will last a while without any tinies here to steal it.\" She said as she put down her bags of food and started putting them away. You took care to watch her, so you would know where each of the food choices went. She didn't even notice what better shape some of the things were in. Which meant you were doing your job right. If she noticed something was up, she would be looking for you. That wasn't suppose to happen, yet. Eventually she would finds something odd about the whole thing and assume some interesting Tinies were responsible. \"Wish I could have another tiny for dinner. Those little guys always taste amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate a can of tuna then reclined on the couch. She shifted a little then got up and put her hand on the couch with a questioning face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is weird, I specifically remember this couch being a piece of junk with a knot that dug into my side when I laid on it. There is nothing here...???\" She wondered out loud. You almost cursed. You knew you shouldn't have fixed that part yet. But how were you suppose to know that she would notice a simple knot in the furniture? \"Whatever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid back down to read a light book from the shelf. When she was done she put if back and went to bed and off to work you went. This was your first instance where you could catch some sleep as well, but not before you cleaned for an hour and got a little bit to eat. With that done, you took your rest. It wasn't much of one though. Like most tinies, you had more to give you nightmares than the normal sized people had. After all, there was not only monsters in your life, but giant ones. A simple house spider could be a death sentence for you. That being said, you were woken by the light scratching of a spider crawling in the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get lost you little creeper.\" You commanded. But when it remained you used some fire to burn it to a crisp. You had mastered fire for this reason. If you had frozen it, you would still have to clean it up. If the thing turns to ash, there was less mess. You just had to be careful of not starting fires to the apartment. \"Well, now that I'm up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your body full awake from the spider you set to work. It was early morning and you only had barely an hour if you wanted to do something substantial. You went to the bathroom and fixed the leak pipes, cleaned the shower head, and fixed the water pressure problem. That was when she got up. You were glad you put in the secret entrances already. Cause you would've been in trouble in the spare bathroom. You jumped in and climbed to this room's peeping window. But for her partial privacy you didn't put it in the shower. No that it made much difference. You took a glace to make sure she didn't see you, then left the room through the wall tunnels. You hoped things would work well from then on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the first week, you had set in a schedule of cleaning and repairing that didn't raise so many internal alarms for Kelly. You were slightly lucky that she never brought anyone over, usually. But either way, you continued to do your job in a slow but still a steady escalating progress type of way. She seemed to get used to it as well. She would walk around with a rag or something to find things to clean. When she didn't find any, she would dust things anyway, just to be thorough. She was a FEMALE neko after all. Both her instincts as a female and a neko were magnifying each other to keep her home relatively clean. It was much easier to do cleaning in a guy's place. They barely cleaned at all, so they don't notice that they don't have to anymore. Then again, having a hygienically inclined host wasn't the worst thing. Even with you doing minimal amount of cleaning, the place still smelled nice. Every once in a while, you would stop a tiny from coming into the apartment. You simply told them that they could go in ANY of the other ones, just not that one. Most of them were understanding about the whole thing. A few you had to feed to either Kelly, using the tiny trap method again, or to a passing cat or something. In any case, it had been a few months and a high majority of all the problems were done. Now, for the first time, you had an additional person in the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is my place!\" Kelly said as she invited a dragon looking anthro woman in. They were both still in their 20s... well you assumed the other one, as Kelly was 22 and the other looked similar in age. Perhaps it was the new state of her apartment, or maybe her lack of a tiny infestation, but she seemed more keen on having someone over. You weren't sure if she had many friends and you didn't hear much about her family since you started there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is a nice place!\" the Dragoness said as she came in, her eyes darting to places until they finally fell on your 'tiny entrance'. \"Oh, well at least you have a spare meal every once in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is great actually!\" Kelly answered back as she shut the door and saw the Dragoness's sight line. \"Somehow they always get caught in the Tiny trap before they do any damage. I've seriously haven't had a tiny problem, where they mess things up and steal from me, for months now. That and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" The Dragoness asked as they sat on the couch. The general intrigue and the way they were talking made it seem like they were both old and very good friends. Kelly leaned forward as if to tell her a secret. It was actually kind of cute to see both of them act like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy...\" Kelly started and you took a mental note to the Dragoness's name. \"... have you heard about those Backbreaker Tinies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious? You think that actually exist?\" Stacy asked back. She was an overall black dragoness. No wings or anything, then again not many had those and even then, they didn't work for long flight. Her red eyes almost glowed in contrast with her dark color and her mouth was a rich red color. Kind of like a cartoon picture of a mouth. Overly healthy and bright. It was actually rather fascinating to see her mouth move to speak and those dragon teeth come together. However, regardless how good it looked, you had been in a Dragoness's mouth before... and had no desire to repeat the process of being half chewed and slowly digested... again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, but after these past months... I don't know... I am starting to,\" she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do mean?\" Stacy asked, confused. She even cocked her head to the side, very cute the way she did it. You also noticed that she didn't have any hair, just a beautifully assortment of horns. You didn't expect her to have any hair, but it was just something you noticed. Must've been easier to maintain in the morning... then again, going over every one of those horns could be a difficult process too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it all started a few months ago. Things started to just fix themselves. My place use to be such a dump because of tinies raiding the place. Nothing of mine was safe from them. Then, things just got better. I never have to clean, all the bad stuff has been fixed, and I haven't had to buy food for a month now. It is all just... done. On top of that, my rent is always paid, and I'm not the one that did it.\" She explained. Usually this would bother you. But since you were more or less finished with all the big stuff at this point, it was only natural that she notice. But, as you wanted, she only suspected the truth, she hadn't actually seen you or you doing anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're crazy, girl. You probably just have a creepy stalker that comes and does things for you, or your apartment manager has finally gotten off his ass to do something for a change.\" Stacy replied back, trying to think as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you sure know how to make a girl feel great. Creepy stalker, great mental image, thanks Stacy\" Kelly said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, girl. All I'm saying is, if they are real, and you have one... then you shouldn't push it. You know that it would cause a panic if any powered tinies were discovered. Not only that, but anyone would do anything for one of those little helpers. Heck, I would. They say that if you make them feel unwanted, mainly by killing/eating them, they would leave. How they could leave after they are already digested is beyond me. But if you think there is one around, and I'm not saying there is, then you should just let the little guy do its work and not offend it. Heck, I would be so lucky if I had your 'problem'.\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't really feel happy about being referred to as an 'it'. As if you weren't a person. Then again, to them, you weren't. You were thrilled that they were both accepting it and not at the same time... making your job easier. They also seamed to know the rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, you're right. No sense making more out of this than it is.\" Kelly agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Now on the subject of tinies, I got a present for you!\" Stacy said as she got up and almost sprinted to a small box she had brought over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't...!\" Kelly said with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I did! I spent all last week hunting these little things. Gave them a little food and water to keep them healthy... so they can make us healthy.\" Stacy said with a wink as she put the box on their laps so they could be next to each other, yet still get some of their desired treats. She slowly opened the box and their eyes sparkled as they looked inside. It didn't take a rocket scientist to know what they had inside... especially when they started to yell and beg for their lives. They had an entire box of tinies. Probably more than 2 dozen of them... and they wouldn't be going free...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You looked on as they were basically drooling over them, but not so much as to be unsightly. They were ladies after all, and probably didn\u2019t like to be caught drooling at anything. You saw Kelly look over at your hole as she realized what she was doing, then at Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould it bother the little guy if we ate them here of all places?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean would it bother a make believe tiny, with superpowers that probably throws those tinies into your little trap for you to eat?\u201d Stacy asked back in a sarcastic tone. The way she said it made it seem absurd and/or idiotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I guess not\u2026\u201d She said, a bit unsure, but then shrugged it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou liked it that at least part of her didn\u2019t want to make you feel bad in any way that would make you leave, like Stacy had suggested you might do. You weren\u2019t thrilled that they were taking so much pleasure in eating possibly innocent tinies, but, in the end, it made them and specifically Kelly, happy. That, and it was widely accepted that if a tiny was caught, then it was at the mercy of whatever caught it, hungry or not. As long as they weren\u2019t being purposefully sadistic about it and it wasn\u2019t him or any he cared about, then he was ok with it. As it stood, he had freed more than a few tinies from other normal sized people. This was not one of those \u2018bad\u2019 moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now, open wide!\u201d Said Stacy as she grabbed hold of a little tiny and held him above Kelly\u2019s head by his foot as he squirmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly\u2019s head followed him, her cat eyes locked on eagerly and as soon as she could her mouth went from a slow and cute smile to a gaping and waiting mouth, ready for her little treat. With that, Stacy let go of the little guy, sending him falling straight into Kelly\u2019s mouth. She playfully snapped her mouth closed then began tasting him, rolling him around with a gin on her face that you had begun to cherish about her. It wasn\u2019t an evil grin, more like a content and blissful smile. Her little cute cat like features made her look even more enticing, as if she was in heaven at that very moment. At the peak of this, she swallowed, sending a lump of a tiny down her throat. She licked her lips a little then smiled sweetly at Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was a good one\u2026\u201d She said, then picked one up and held the older looking male tiny in front of Stacy\u2019s face/jaws. Like a proper dragoness, she didn\u2019t just have a mouth, she had a set of jaws with only sharp fangs in her mouth. Just like any other person though, the upkeep of her mouth/jaws were up to her and her family. Her jaws were perfectly balanced and her teeth were just as pearly white as Kelly\u2019s. \u201c\u2026 your turn!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, give me the old fat one\u2026\u201d Stacy said, then opened her jaws and rolled out her tongue a little bit. With a bit of giggle and a bit of begging from the tiny, Kelly put the man on the outstretched appendage, which quickly retreated into Stacy\u2019s jaws. She first was humming with his flavor, then frowned. \u201c\u2026 what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHesh no wiggawin and no at asdy\u2026 (He\u2019s not wiggling and not that tasty)\u201d she complained around her mouthful, then smirked a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Stacy, do you have to find reasons to do that at every meal?\u201d Kelly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmhmmhmm\u2026\u201d Stacy replied as she moved the tiny around then bit down a few times. That followed by moving what was left around with her own blissful face, then swallowed. She licked her jaws a bit and took a drink of some water from a cup through a straw. She somehow daintily swished her mouth full of water and sent the slightly bloodied water down her throat to join the dismembered and slightly chewed tiny in her stomach. \u201cWhat? If they aren\u2019t tasty enough or aren\u2019t going to be good wiggling around, might as well get some extra flavor out of them. Sometimes they forget, while we all love to swallow them down, nice and easy, we can just as easily get some blood flowing, which I actually like the taste of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do, I think it\u2019s gross. I can\u2019t stand the taste of tiny blood!\u201d Kelly said, shaking her head cutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you even tried it girl?\u201d Stacy sighed as she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, once, and I think I was sick for a week.\u201d She answered back defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, just saying, sometimes there are other ways to eat the little things. Don\u2019t you want to experiment a little bit? You know, live a little?\u201d Stacy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, just not with their blood going everywhere. Do you not realize that one drop of their blood on my fur will be in there for weeks? They splatter all over the place when you chew them!\u201d She expressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so it\u2019s the mess you don\u2019t like. You were making me think it was the taste!\u201d Stacy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a Neko, of course I like the taste of blood. I just like the taste of them without the gushing blood even better! What I DON\u2019T like is smelling like decaying Tiny for a few weeks!\u201d She explained with a shutter and a gag expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, fine. Just eat the little guys the way you want.\u201d Stacy said as she picked up another and stuffed the younger male into her mouth. This one she moved around and lightly growled at his flavor, sending HIM down whole and very alive. \u201cI like them both ways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I noticed.\u201d Kelly replied as she sucked in an older woman tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued until all 2 dozen were gone. Stacy teased Kelly a few times by biting a few in half, letting blood drip down on her, getting a drop on the couch at one point. But it was all light hearted banter and nothing openly disrespectful or serious\u2026 not for them at least. The Tinies that were meeting their end to these 2 appetites, it was rather serious for them. They hung out for a bit, laughed, watched TV, then Stacy went home. The only thing that caught your eye as you watched them, not liking their meal choices but otherwise happy to observe, was that both of them kept glancing around every so often as if looking for him. Both Nekos and Dragonesses could see relatively well in the dark, so he was glad he was not in the open or somewhere they could find him. Eventually, Kelly bid farewell to her friend and took her leave to bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was complicated, as they all had gotten rather good at getting everywhere they needed/wanted to go. However, You were able to do it and therefore limit the amount of tinies pushed too hard and ended up on the sticky mat, and then shortly after that in Kelly\u2019s stomach. Kelly was happy, and had gotten really used to you, sort of speak. She still glanced at your \u2018tiny hole\u2019 every once in a while, but just decided on a, don\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell policy when it came to all the things around her apartment that just randomly got done. However, one night, curiosity got the better of her and decided that she just had to meet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid there on the couch with a small glass of white wine that she had decided she would splurge on while watching a random reality show. Her show was now over and the streaming program was now at the main menu, allowing a glow into the room, slightly illuminating the area. You had been watching the show with her, from your observation window, while also keeping an eye out for things to clean that she either dropped or finished. The bottle needed to be corked and the plate from dinner needed to be cleaned, along with the utensils, crumbs on the floor, used napkin, and utensils. As soon as you figured she had drifted off into a slightly deep sleep, you moved to clean up the mess before she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou worked quickly, not even bothering to stab her with sleeping toxin or seeing if she woke up. If she followed her normal way of doing things, she would wake up in about 3 hours, drearily make her way to bed, then continue in there. The whole while you could be right in front of her face and she wouldn\u2019t notice. You completed everything except the glass that still had a sip of wine in it whenyou heard something that made your blood freeze in your veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother with that, I\u2019ll finish it.\u201d Came Kelly\u2019s voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were frozen in your tracks, a rookie mistake, as was it to not keep your eye on Kelly while she was \u2018sleeping\u2019. In this instance, your inactivity allowed her to pick you up gently and hold you in front of her face. She then placed you on an upturned palm at a little higher than chest height so she could see you in high detail. Technically, she would already be able to do that from the ground with her Neko senses, but this just made it more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, little Tiny. So you are the one that has been helping me out all this time! My name is Kelly, what\u2019s your name cutie?\u201d Kelly introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCaleb\u2026\u201d You almost whimper out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are many reasons you were more than a little bit scared at the moment. Sure, you\u2019ve been helping Kelly out for a few months, but you had also seen her indulging in your kind, that being tinies, in sometimes mass quantities. Along with that, you had gotten used to her and liked her a bit more than he should as a backbreaker. However, you knew that even though you could survive digestion, you would still be so physiologically scared that you would need to leave her, as your heart wouldn\u2019t be in it and it would effect his ability to do what you needed to do. There was a slight possibility that he wouldn\u2019t feel that way, as you was quite fond of her, but you didn\u2019t want to risk it. Your eyes drifted to her beautiful mouth, then back up to her intense and yet still cute eyes as you had a strange attraction to being eaten, but by no means wanted to experience it\u2026 again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that is a very nice name, Caleb.\u201d She complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Ma\u2019am\u201d you replied with a quiver in your voice. You were on an emotional roller coaster and didn\u2019t really know what to act on, but survival was a safe bet, for the moment. But, would she take offense if you ran at the earliest opportunity, you didn\u2019t want to disappoint her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at you! There is no need to be so scared of me!\u201d She cooed at him. You were about 80% sure she was actually comforting you, but that other 20% concerned you. You had seen her toy with her prey before, and she was a very good actress in that regard. She stroked you with one of her fingers, feeling how tense you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 You\u2026 aren\u2019t going to eat me?\u201d You asked rather bluntly, but still with a quiver in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood heavens no!!!\u201d She exclaimed. She thrust her head forward, making you flinch, but only sniffed your scent in, then backed off. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, you smell absolutely delicious, mouth watering even. But, you have been taking care of me for all this time with such heart and effort. For a little guy like you to take care of all you have for me\u2026 It would be unbelievably heartless for me to just eat you like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d You asked, still not sure if she meant it, or was just playing with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes really. I know you\u2019ve seen me eat many other tinies, and you do smell wonderful, and I bet you taste beyond delicious. But I would never eat a friend!\u201d She assured with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFriend???\u201d You asked, with both hope and confusion, half expecting her to just break out laughing and shove you into that beautiful mouth of hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what would you call a handsome little guy that does everything for me and lives under the same roof. I certainly would like a friend like you, Caleb. I assume that you like me a bit if you are doing all these things for me. So, we are friends, as far as I am concerned, that puts you on the no eat list\u2026 Keep in mind, you are the only one on that list.\u201d She reasoned at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I would like to be your friend, very much so.\u201d You said, a bit more happiness in your voice but still a bit reserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now. I don\u2019t suppose you would like to talk with me without me assuming you are going to run away at the earliest opportunity?\u201d She asked with a cute eyebrow raise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I would like that.\u201d You responded honestly. You wanted nothing more than to be in the open with her. Sure, you loved making her happy, regardless if she saw you or not. But actually talking with her was another level you never thought you\u2019d would be on with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then, first things first, I have been wanting to know this for a while now.\u201d She said, comically looking away in embarrassment, then back at you. Her mannerisms were still adorable and cute to you and even though that would\u2019ve been the best opportunity to escape, you now had no intension of doing so. \u201cAre you\u2026 are you one of those Back breakers that people talk about? You know, the ones with the powers and stuff?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 Yes, I am.\u201d  You answered, not sure if it was the wisest thing to say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is\u2026 so cool!!!\u201d She exclaimed, making you wince a little from the volume of her speech. \u201cOh, sorry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite alright. I\u2019m glad you approve.\u201d You said back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApprove? I think it is like the best thing ever! Not only do I get someone as awesome as you around, helping me out, but you have powers! What can you do! How do you clean all that stuff I mess up all the time! Not to mention, how do you have money to pay for my rent and get me food?\u201d She rattled off, obviously having more than a few questions, seemingly ignorant that she was a bit frightening for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I can do\u2026 magic\u2026 I guess.\u201d You stammered out, still more than a bit nervous. Not only because of the tiny eating neko in front of you, but also not sure how much of your secret life you should reveal. That, and if you didn\u2019t tell her, would she get bored and eat you anyway? Would she blab to her friends or whatever and put the spotlight on him for the authorities to find you? You had more than a little bit to be nervous about it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? And it can\u2019t be all magic, I just saw you lift some of that stuff that is like 10 times your size. It can\u2019t all be magic, right?\u201d She asked, getting a bit closer as she continued her questioning, getting you step back, but only to run into some of her fingers that were keeping you in her hand. But the reaction wasn\u2019t lost on her, making her look at you with a partly confused and partly concerned. \u201cAre you still scared of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 maybe a little bit.\u201d You answered, obviously meaning more than a little bit, but not wanting to upset her. She seemed to understand this, more or less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I told you that I wouldn\u2019t eat you. Don\u2019t you believe me?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I want to.\u201d You stammered out. You didn\u2019t want to just blab out that you more knew her as a tiny eating neko that loved to play with her food like this. It would be completely justified and accurate for you to think that she was just messing with you and would pop you into her mouth in an instant. However, you also knew her to be more than a bit fair when it came to tinies. So, it was at best 50/50 chance that she was just playing with her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what would get you to believe me?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like put you down?\u201d Kelly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 just can\u2019t help but think that you are just playing with me\u2026 and will just pop me in as a snack when you get bored.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I said I wouldn\u2019t, if you lived here at all and watched me in the slightest, you know that when I say something, I mean it.\u201d She justified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but you also like to play\u2026 with your food.\u201d You said back, nervous as you just basically called yourself her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll let you down, but don\u2019t just run and stuff. I really want to talk to you, ok?\u201d She offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d You agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly went to pick you up with her fingers, then thought better of it and just dropped her hand with you in so it was laying on the couch with her. You hesitantly moved on her palm, then hopped off her hand. She slowly retracted her hand and then moved a bit to get comfortable to talk with you. It was clear that you both were out of your element here. She wasn\u2019t used to talking comfortably with a tiny with intent to just get to know them, or you in this instance. You obviously weren\u2019t in the habit of drawing attention from normal sized people. So, this was an interesting scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 what you been up to?\u201d She asked. It was more of a habit question and one that had come out before she thought up a better ice breaker question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 well I fixed a few pipes and washed the sheets\u2026 and partially cleaned up some dishes, I guess.\u201d You answered, looking over at the newly cleaned off table you were in the middle of cleaning before she caught you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, sorry, stupid question. Wait, how do you clean the sheets if you don\u2019t take them off the bed?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d You answered, then looked around and saw a little stain from her wine that was on the couch. You did a combination of a spell and your materialization ability then touched the spot, instantly cleaned the surface. \u201cLike that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can clean stuff, with that magic, just like that?\u201d She asked with a bit of wonder, leaning down to see the newly clean area. It looked like nothing had happened and marveled at what he did without much thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore or less\u2026 I, get tired after a little bit, but it is possible.\u201d You answered, not wanting her to think that you were just a source of endless magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m jealous. You can actually do magic and all I got is\u2026 this.\u201d She said, grabbing her tail, then dropping it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you are an amazing person, and being a Neko rather than a normal human must have its perks.\u201d You replied, trying to put a positive spin on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe agree on that. I have some normal human friends and I honestly don\u2019t understand how they survive sometimes.\u201d She agreed light heartedly. She then seemed to catch herself and looked down at you with a smile. \u201cI appreciate the vote of appreciation. I suppose you chose me to help out for many reason, one of which I assume has something to do with my Neko looks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I guess that was part of it, but not the majority.\u201d You agreed and revealed, getting a bit embarrassed. From the look on her face, it looked like she thought it was cute or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was the majority... and when was it?\u201d She asked, the second question after thinking about the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 remember when your food was raided by tinies and then a bit later they were stuck in your trap?\u201d You asked. Normally it would\u2019ve been a horrible point of reference. But since you hadn\u2019t allowed any more tinies to enter and do anything bad to the place, it should\u2019ve stood out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 yeah, I think so. Now that you mention it, I remember being so irritated and sad that I just left everything and took a nap\u2026 then woke up to a few tinies in my trap\u2026 Wait, you put them there???\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 I asked them to leave and not return, but they tried to put me in there instead, fully intending to stick around here for a while, so I threw them in.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, you didn\u2019t and don\u2019t have a problem with me eating other tinies?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m not overly fond of it, being a tiny myself. But you are at least nice about it\u2026 most of the time. However, if a group of tinies refuse to listen to reason and persist, I leave them for you to find.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a bit weird. Not that I\u2019m complaining!\u201d She said then quickly corrected. It was becoming clear to her that you were the only reason that she had the occasional treat in the trap. As scarce as it has been lately, she didn\u2019t want to end that supply if she could help it. \u201cSo, you were explaining what drew you to help me out, or all people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 yeah. So, I saw you walking in the street earlier that day. You were\u2026 more than a bit sad and seemed to have given up on things all together. I\u2026 just couldn\u2019t stand by while someone as beautiful and cute as you was so miserable. So I followed you home and snuck in, then got to work.\u201d You explained, realizing a bit too late that you had just shamelessly commented her, which she obviously caught as she smiled at it\u2026 and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I think you are cute as well!\u201d She complimented back. Slowly bringing a finger forward and giving you a stroke, like petting a newly acquired pet. You were still more than a bit nervous when she approached, which she noticed. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it is like for you, being that small, and in front of someone who likes to eat your kind. But I promise, I\u2019m not going to eat you, ever. You never have to worry about that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou appreciated her repetition in saying this. You did know her as someone that would keep her word, and definitely a promise. She was a rather loyal person, to her friends at least. True, she ate tinies like you, but you had never heard her break a promise, or promise a tiny anything for that matter. Sure, you still had to be careful, but it was at least a good place to start. It went against almost everything your training and upbringing told you, but you hoped beyond hope that this Neko, Kelly, would be just what she offered to you\u2026 a friend.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCaleb!?!\u201d Kelly called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had only been a week since you had made contact with the large, to you, Neko. It was a great help that you didn\u2019t have to hide from her anymore. Although, you had expressed that even though you were beginning to trust her, others at her size were still a great threat to you. Not to mention the government if they found out a powered Tiny was living with her. So, she agreed to keep you a secret and you hid whenever she had guests. However, now you could be called on to help or just hang out, when needed or available. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d You asked as you quickly entered her bathroom and climbed up to the sink, where she was having an issue\u2026 apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook!!!\u201d She exclaimed, bending down and almost scaring the crap out of you as she barred her teeth at you. But it wasn\u2019t a feral or aggressive move. She was simply showing you something. You quickly assessed the impressive teeth, framed by a cute and alluring lips to identify the problem. You quickly saw the problem. \u201cWell, how did you manage to do that to yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d She said as her head shot back up and she looked in the mirror to find a cut on her gums that went from the front to the back and, judging on the way she was moving her tongue, probably on the roof of her mouth as well. \u201cProbably this thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put a tool she used on her teeth beside you. It was a form of toothbrush/flossing tool with some hard edges on each end. The tool was mainly used for predator class people like her or any that made a habit out of eating tinies. With all the types out there, Neko, Naga, Wolf, and Dragon to name a few, it wasn\u2019t very efficient to have only toothbrushes that would shred against the fangs of most of the population. This one was specifically designed to clean predator\u2019s teeth as well as repair them if needed\u2026 if the user was using it correctly. Kelly seemed to have been in a hurry, neglecting some of the safety features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy must you use that every day? It looks more like a torture device than a hygienic tool.\u201d You commented as you gave the thing a weird look, then back up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you like when my mouth is all clean, shiny, and not smelling like death?\u201d She asked at you, knowing the answer. It hadn\u2019t taken long for her to notice and comment on your fascination with her mouth and her eating tinies, despite your fears. As was her nature, she flaunted this a little bit to playfully tease you, but never took it far enough to scare you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so, but I don\u2019t like the idea of you hurting yourself to make it that way. I\u2019d rather have you dirty and healthy than clean and hurt.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwe\u2026 What a sweaty.\u201d She said, leaning down to you again and puckered to give you a quick and teasing kiss on the head, then winced and shot back up. \u201cOW, OW, OW,\u2026 OW!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked on as she raised her lip and gingerly touched the lightly bleeding scratch. It was obviously paining her and she could barely talk because of it, never mind eating or any other function she had planned for tonight with her friends. A small tear came out of her eye from the pain as she touched it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh jeepers, come down here before you lose a tooth\u2026\u201d You sighed out loud enough for her to hear. She obviously called you in to the bathroom to help with this problem and didn\u2019t want to see her in any more pain than she had to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thank you Caleb! You\u2019re the best! Can I pick you up?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d You answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe, very carefully picked you up with her two fingers and placed you on her upturned palm and brought it up to her face. She had been practicing with you the last week to make her picking you up easier on both sides. Most times she just let you climb onto her hand by yourself. However, she also liked picking you up like that, and you didn\u2019t mind\u2026 as long as she asked. Sure, sometimes she teased, but she was very serious about not actually frightening you. As of yet, her teasing hadn\u2019t crossed any lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow remember\u2026\u201d You started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know. It will sting a little bit.\u201d She rehearsed, more for herself than to let you know she knew the drill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an unfortunate consequence of your \u2018ability\u2019 to heal people. It was because it wasn\u2019t a traditional healing spell. It was the same thing you did to fabric or furniture, materialization. Because it was this, unless you stabbed her with a sleeping or numbing agent, it stung a bit\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but this time I\u2019ll be in your mouth. Please remember that I am around you fangs and teeth when the sensation starts. You have a very attractive mouth, but I would prefer not to be added to the severing count.\u201d You both advised and compliment. On the surface it seemed like a slight jab at her, but she knew it wasn\u2019t. You both had a rather blunt relationship with each other. No need to beat around the bush, at her request. She was serious about not scaring you, and wanted to know any concerns, as they formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I would never chew my favorite little sweet thing!\u201d She replied with a smile, then winced again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, then open up so I can see.\u201d You stated, not wanting her suffering to last any longer. Her smile was something you liked very much about her. For her to hurt from just smiling wasn\u2019t acceptable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded lightly then slowly opened her mouth, but also used her other hand to raise her upper lip so you could see the front part of the cut. It was on the outside edge or her left top canine tooth\u2026 or at least that is where it looked to start. She protruded her very plush, soft, and moist tongue to guard you against her bottom teeth. You looked at the surface, her teeth, then up to where her eyes were looking down at you. You knew what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you stripped your clothes off so not to give her a taste of the many things you had been working with and on that day. You then gently stepped onto her tongue and lip. As soon as she could feel you were secure, she retracted her hand to under her chin, just in case you fell. Huge gusts of wind came out as she breathed around you. The chill and warmth made you excited a bit, but not enough to forget why you were here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really hoped this went ok. She had teased you before with her kisses and very light licks. But you had never been inside her mouth before, or in any capacity like you were now. It was both exciting and frightening at the same time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a final sigh, you get to work as you reached up between her teeth and the lip that she was holding. She slowly and carefully readjusted to so she was in front of the mirror, tracking your progress a bit. You get used to her breathing and reach the beginning of the cut, that was bleeding enough to drip a little on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I\u2019m going to start healing it now. Brace yourself.\u201d You advised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you had felt you gave enough time for her to prepare, you touched the beginning and started \u2018healing\u2019 it. You almost lost balance as her mouth and jaw shuttered at the stinging sensation as you worked. You moved as quick as possible but didn\u2019t want to have to do it again to her, so you made sure it was slow enough to not need a return trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue twitched as you moved your bare foot against it as you ducked underneath her fang and continued to track the cut beside her mighty tooth that looked even more deadly from within her mouth. The point of the thing, regardless its size to you, was as piercingly sharp as a needle at your size. How she didn\u2019t gouge her own mouth full of holes every time she shut her mouth was beyond you. The teeth shuttered again, almost as if they were going to come down and sever your leg that was now passing into her mouth. However, it held and you were able to pull it free and inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m inside now. If it makes it easier to bare, you can shut your mouth, I\u2019ll be able to see just fine.\u201d You offered, knowing that her current position couldn\u2019t have been an easy on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked out, past her teeth and lips to the mirror for her response. She let go of her lip and gave you a thumbs up, that you returned. With that, she quickly shut her quivering jaws, after pulling her tongue in to join you. There wasn\u2019t as much room in here as when her mouth was open, but enough for you to readjust yourself on her tongue and return to work. You felt her mouth quiver again as you continued your healing, the tongue almost throwing you into the roof of her mouth at one point. Finally you were able to finish and retract your hand from the newly healed cut from that predator\u2019s toothbrush thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself looking around, rather than telling her that you were done, as if she couldn\u2019t feel it. The tongue squelched as you moved on it and took a look around. You don\u2019t know what possessed you, but you moved closer to the throat and looked partially down the tunnel that you knew would lead to a painful end if taken. Through both the fantasy or pleasure and the fear of being digested again, you shivered then moved away from the abyss of her throat. However, as you reached the teeth, you noticed she hadn\u2019t opened up yet. She had to feel the lack of pain and stinging. So why was she not opening up for you to exit, then again you hadn\u2019t said for her that you was ready to come out yet. For all she knew, you still had things to do in here. You glanced back again at the throat and tongue that had been accumulating more saliva, do doubt do to your presence inside and on her tongue. Being naked probably only helped with your taste on her plush and soft appendage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I\u2019m all done in here. You can let me out now\u2026\u201d You informed to her. This brought a response that you were hoping was a joke. The tongue reared back and lightly pinned you to the roof of the mouth, to which the tongue pulled back to rake him against as many of the taste buds as possible, then dropped to let you fall on a new part of the tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMMMmmmmm\u2026.\u201d Came a delighted noise of taste based pleasure from around you had been in this position before. You found yourself both dreading and excited about what was about to happen. There was no doubt about it, she was tasting you. All you could hope was that she was teasing you and getting some flavor out of the deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery funny Kelly, but I think it would be best if\u2026\u201d You started, kicking yourself for putting the kibosh on this experience, but didn\u2019t want it to go too far. However, you were cut off by the tongue tossing you around again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears popped a little as she sucked on you like a piece of candy, then let you rest, then tasted you again. You saw the teeth open a little and light pour in as she opened her lips. You thought she was about to pop you out and giggle in her teasing tone. However, as you saw her reflection in the mirror, her eyes were closed and was in the position you had seen her in when savoring a tiny. To be fair, she hadn\u2019t had one in a few weeks, so she was probably lost in your taste a bit more than she should. You also knew that not many things could shake her from this state until\u2026 well the tiny was no longer in her mouth. Usually after that, she traced the morsel down her throat and took great pleasure as they fought in her stomach. Usually you enjoyed seeing her so happy, but this wasn\u2019t a usual time, as YOU were the tiny she was savoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth closed as she let out another moan as she tasted you. It didn\u2019t take long to be covered in her saliva in more of a fashion than just teasing. You knew the drill. First layered with saliva, then rubbing or sucking it off and swallowing the sweet saliva down, then repeat until no flavor was left. At that point, it would either be out or down. You really hoped it was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Kelly, let me out!\u201d You begged at a rare moment that she opened her mouth again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to have the mouth shut and the tasting to continue. You thought about trying to get out yourself and made it to the teeth. However, when they opened, you found yourself maneuvered onto them and barely made it back INTO the mouth and onto the safety of the tongue before they came down. However, you didn\u2019t make it completely unscathed, as the teeth did end up getting one of your feet. Your delicate flesh didn\u2019t stand a chance as the teeth tore through the appendage and left you footless for a few minutes, until it reformed. However, by that time, your blood had already been tasted and you didn\u2019t have to be a genius to understand that it didn\u2019t help matters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe might\u2019ve hated the idea of chewing and blood, but in this state of bliss, it only solidified a point, that he was food. Besides that, the blood was minimal as his body healed almost faster than blood could be pumped out. There was just enough to hit the tongue to drive her over the edge. You saw in horror, that made any sense of this as a pleasurable experience, as your severed foot was swept away by the saliva, past the tongue, and down the abyss of her throat to be digested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKelly! Stop! Please! This is\u2026\u201d You started, but was now mercilessly throne to the back of the mouth. You felt gravity change as she must\u2019ve been tilting her head back. You looked at the throat, open and ready to accept you. You had just enough time to say one more thing. \u201c\u2026Scaring me\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you finishing that, you were thrown head first into the throat, where it hugged you rather lovingly actually, and started guiding you down to where you knew a vat of digestive acid awaited you. If it wasn\u2019t there already, then it would soon be after you plopped inside. You heard something like speech as you traveled by her neck but couldn\u2019t make it out. You were not in a fear based crying state. You had been here before, not in Kelly but in other people and animals. This part and the mouth was the part he fantasized about, the stomach was also not so bad. But the acids inside that awaited to start a war with his body to break it down as it healed, a war that her body would eventually win\u2026 THAT part scared the crap out of him. She had hoped that Kelly would be a friend, but she was eating him, like he was told from day one of his life. ALL bigger people, nice or not, just want to eat you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something happened that was new to you. Your downward decent was stopped and violently reversed. You were forced up the fleshy tube at a higher rate of speed than what you were going down with. Eventually you saw light as you arrived in the mouth, flew past it, missing the teeth by a few of your inches and landing in her hands. She barely diverted you before more bile came up and she puked it into the toilet. When she was done, she spit any residual bile that lingered in and around her mouth into the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, I\u2019m so sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to take it that far!\u201d She said as she looked up again from her puking with tears in her eyes. If you had to guess, it was from both the vomiting and what she just did. That told you she didn\u2019t mean to swallow you or lose her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn\u2019t known her for very long, but you knew she never really got out of her bliss filled feeding until it was done. For her to stop midway and choose to vomit to bring you back up was very unlike her. So, she must\u2019ve really not meant it. But, you were very traumatized by the whole thing. At first it was more than a little bit hot. But not after his foot was bitten off and sent down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, please Caleb, Say something. Yell at me or something! Just be ok!!!\u201d She begged as she ran from the bathroom and into the living room. If you needed to be away from her, than she needed a better place to put you down other than the counter next to the toilet full of vomit. She sat on the couch and awaited your answer as you just laid there shivering in the same fear that you were feeling when going down her throat. But did you actually believe she was sorry? Was it enough? What made her stop?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You waited for about a minute as she returned with a wet rag. \"Oh, Caleb, please, PLEASE, be ok! I didn't mean for this to happen!\" You heard her stammer as she dabbed your face with the cloth. It felt nice, and you started to regain consciousness. \"K-- Kelly? Wh- why on EARTH would you do that?!?\" You screamed, frightening her. \"Hey hey, it was an accident, I haven't had a tiny in weeks. You'd understand if it was a meatball.\" Kelly picked you up, more gentle than ever, and brought you to her bedroom. She placed you down on her bed as she grabbed a small pillowcase, some cotton balls, and a piece of fabric. You saw her, hazily, putting something together. She then picked you up and put you on a small bed. \"Shh... shh... just rest... I know that experience must have been awful, and I am truthfully sorry about what happened. How about this: You won't have to work on anything related to my mouth from now on. Ok?\" She asked, almost crying, and putting the warm fabric over you. \"Sure... As long as the teasing stops...\" you said. \"Ok, I'll keep the teasing to a minimum. You should probably stay here, as I have a couple friends over tonight. We'll stay out of your room, and I won't mention you, Caleb. Just stay out of sight.\" She then exited the room, and you were now alone. You took this time to rest on the makeshift bed, and it was actually quite comfy. You let all thought drift away as you fell to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up to the sound of a door opening, the bedroom door to be exact. Kelly entered, and shut the door behind her. \"Hey Caleb, how you feeling?\" She asked with a soothing voice. \"Fine, I guess. Is your night going well?\" You said, checking up on her. Fine, I guess. My human friend, Alice,is over, but she gets all nauseous when we mention tinies. I don't really know why, but I just hope you're ok.\" Kelly said as she left the room again. This time, you decided to help tidy up her room a little bit. First, you cleaned the bed sheets, as they were covered with tears. Next, the curtains. You started cleaning them when you heard the door open, AGAIN. Luckily, one of your secret holes was just behind the curtains. As you peeked around, you saw someone walk into the bedroom. You gasped when it was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a quite day at the office and you nearly slept over the paperwork as there was no job coming in today. You lazily dangle your high heels under the table as you type in the forms of the latest jobs into the computer. Your name is Gwendolyn Parker but you where just called Gwen most of the times. Lame, I know but thats how it is. You yawn, stretch yourself and support your heavy head on one of your arms as you browsed through a file filled with pages of numbers searching for the one matching on the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone rang and a little too quick you picked it up, happy that something actually happened at this day. \"Gwendolyn Parker at Parkers\" Please no false connection, you thought. \"Marie Jeanette here, Ms Parker, please come quick... This is urgent. I think there are a lot of these pests here. Please\" \"Calm down Marie. have they got any powers? Have you seen them?\" \"Please come quick. I don't know. I just heard them and then I left the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe adress was about a mile away from the office and you could not get rid of the smile, happy to actually do something. As you came around the corner you saw the women standing there in front of the house. She was obviously frightened and walked towards you with a fast pace. \"they are in there\", she sayed throught your open window and pointed out a cute red house. \"Please be careful\", she called after you but you just turned around and winked. \"I am the best in my job Marie. Don't worry\" You patted your bag and walked into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked in you had to notice how tidy the whole house was. You became a bit jealous because this is something you always wanted but you where chaotic. Sayed mildly. There was no dust nowhere and even the magazines on the table where stacked in a neat pile as if someone had filled them in a form and took it away afterwards. But that was not the reason you where here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that your heels would give you away immediatly on the hard floor as you made your way too the kitchen and that was good. Either they would run or they would stay. Two options but number one would be the best for all involved. As you came around the corner you knew that they would stay. Not too easy this time. On the floor stood one single man with his arms across his chest. The fridge was open and you could see four others trying to get food out of it. They looked at you but a reassuring look to the man on the floor made them turn their backs to you again. There had to be more... One was on the counter, one in an open cupboard. Seven but surly not all of them. You avoided entering the room but stood in front of it. There where three options for you to finish this job now. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You set your bag on the floor and stood there watching the guy in the middle of the place get more unsure with every second you stared at him. There was no visible tripline in the doorframe. So the trap would have been set up somewhere else. The kitchen was too big for a burster but you could never be sure. This always was the most dangerous part of the show. Entering the infested room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you searched your bag for something... there it was. A simple outdoorhandbrush. At least it looked so at first sight but you decided to let it deactivated and not set the brush under electricity. Just in case. You pulled out the handleteleskope and klicked into an 90 degree angle. You saw the man losing his fearlessness completly now that he knew he stood in front of a pro, not just a pretty giant chick. The second thing you got out was a long stick that you could enlarge also. Your trustworthy taserspear. Now it was your turn to smile at the tiny guy. It was a cute smile. A flirting smile that was even more dreadful to him. he looked up, not to you but to the doorframe. You just waited for that opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it had to go quick. Just to make sure. You jumped a step forward and still outside of the room you used it to brush along the doorframe above you with a screaming reward. One guy and a women fell to the floor. You heard their tiny bodies impact. It was possible that they died but often enough they survive. In any case they where no harm for you at this second. With a quick step into the room you made sure that the women never will be as she crunched beneath your shoe. The guy on the floor turned and tried to run but a steady kick smashed him into the counter. It definatly was a tank from the sound he made. And he was still alive. Closing the fridge first and using the brush again to sweep down the man on the counter. With a swift move your sole smashed his body completly and brought you into the position to strike the still dizzy tank with your spear at nearly the same moment. He twitched for his last time. With lots of force you slammed close the cupboard and opened it immediatly again. Stunned from the sound you brushed out the young girl to the counter. She was still alive but you held your brush right behind her in case she made any hasty moves. \"More?\", you asked with stern voice and look. All the cuteness fallen away within the five seconds you disabled their group. \"Answer me\", you commanded. The tiny women was still not completly aware of her surroundings and looked around confused and in shock. There was no help for her she knew that too good. And You also knew that now. In a fluid move you turned your brush and slammed it onto the tiny person killing her instantly in a minor mess. You turned around and looked for the guy on the frame. He tried to crawl away on his butt only using one arm. The rest seemed to be broke. Slowly you walked over to him and watched his agony for a second. Not because you where cruel. To you it was just like watching a wounded bug trying to crawl away. You could hear and understand his pleas but you had only one answer. \"Tss\" as you placed your on the ground and slowly lowered your sole onto him. You did it slowly enough to feel the resistance of his body and of every of his breaking bones until your weight settled and your heel left the ground for a slow twist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was time to take a breath and plan the assault of the fridge</span></div></div>",

Swiftly you opened it and your other hand, armed with the electrocuted broom was ready to strike at the first piece of metal you saw. But instead you where greeted by a leash of water slashing towards you. With an insane reflex you turned away but still it cut you in your arm letting the broom fall on the floor. A waterist, you thought as the leash turned in midair and aimed for your belly but again it just cut you lightly after you dodged it. Rolling away from the fridge you noticed a man gesturing with his hands. The other where not visible to you at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a striking pain but did not know where it came from but your dress was bloodsoaked within seconds and then your legs gave away. Before everything faded black you saw a second leash, turned red from your blood and the pain coming from your throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever open a fridge without a plan.</span></div></div>",
