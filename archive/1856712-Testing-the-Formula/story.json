An elated, almost manic smile spread across his face, and he started to laugh, soft at first but quickly becoming louder. After all, this flask, along with the four others that were in the cold storage freezer close by, represented the last six years of his research and twenty million dollars of his personal fortune. He had every reason to be happy, joyous even. Hell, compared to how a \u201dnormal\u201d person would respond to something like this, his reaction was restrained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhase 1 of the master plan was complete. Dr. Quantrain couldn't quite remember how many phases there were left, exactly, but he still had a long way to go before he would be finished. The next step, though, might be his favorite. Sure, science and logic may dictate how these formulas were \"supposed\" to alter the DNA structure of a human in order to cause massive and sustained growth, but any good scientist knows that these kind of things don\u2019t always pan out the way that they're \u201dsupposed\u201d to. That\u2019s why Phase 2, the experiment phase, was necessary. Of course, any philistine could try to test out the formulas with lab rats or monkeys, but for this type of experiment, that just wouldn't work. No, the formula would only work on human DNA, and thus humans had to be used as the test subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Dr. Quantrain had a wide variety of test subjects and locations to choose from for his first experiment. After all, with all the companies and assets that he owned\u00c2\u00a0(either secretly or overtly), he basically ruled over the population of a small company. He just had to choose one of these locations that would be the best, most interesting, place. Shuffling through a stack of folders, he finally saw something that caught his eye.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201dAh, yes,\u201d Quantrain said aloud to an empty laboratory, \u201dMy favorite investment!\u201d St. Gerstman's Academy for Gifted And Talented Boys was one of the first things Quantrain had built after he had amassed his millions. Since 1993, the smartest, most talented, most athletic, and (most importantly) sexiest teenage boys from all across the world were hand-picked by Quatrain himself and invited to attend St. Gerstman's, all expenses paid. Not only was the school lavish and the education top-notch, but Quantrain had used his powerful connections along with a little assistance (read: lots and lots of bribes) to make sure that a diploma from there would get you into any college in the country. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSt. Gerstmam's was built on an island a mile and a half off the coast of San Francisco (Yes, yes, I can hear you asking \"Is it Alcatraz?\" while a bemused grin fills your stupid face. Well, it's not Alcatraz. There's plenty of room in the bay for other islands, got it?). The building looked more like a luxury resort than a school, with lots of red brick buildings, fountains, a pool with both indoor and outdoor sections, and even a mini-golf course, with a driving rage on the cliff side (of course, the hundreds of golf balls hit into the bay inevitably hit and killed at least three or four fish per year). Only a hundred students maximum attended the school, all between the ages of thirteen and eighteen, and they each had their own fully-furnished studio apartment to live in, services by a well-trained wait staff. Any boy would kill to be able to go to this school (And in fact, at least one or two who got in did. That\u2019s not really important now, but, who knows, maybe it\u2019ll come up later). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuatrain loved St. Gerstman's. He would often like to walk the grounds, reveling in the cool breeze blowing in off the bay and watching the boys pass him by, not having a clue that the only reason that their lives had brought them to such an amazing place was because that strange-looking man had a whole lot of money and thought they looked cute. Even when he couldn\u2019t be there (like during most of the past six years of Phase 1 of the experiment), Dr. Quatrain would watch the school and the boys on the hundreds of cameras that he had concealed around the island. When things looked bleak, when failures started to pile up, it was the one thing that got him through the ordeal (well, actually, there were two things, but... uh... Just, don't worry about that). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in short, the decision was obvious, and Quatrain quickly packed his bags for the trip. A short while later, he was in a private jet headed for San Francisco. While there, he went over the details of Phase 2 and how he would apply the formula, as well as what to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had brought with him six flasks full of the different variations of the formula, colored each color of the rainbow (except for indigo... what a stupid color. Am I right?), hoping to test them out on six different boys. Looking through his notes, he quickly reviewed the colors and what effect each of them had, trying to decide which one he wanted to do first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first effect he wrote down, for the red formula, was exponential growth. This meant that the growth would start out small, much less noticeable than with the other formulas. But over time, the rate of growth would keep increasing until ... Well, he wasn't quite sure when it would slow down. Maybe never! That could be a problem, but... Well, he decided to wait until when and if it happened to try and figure out a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect for the orange formula was for a more steady pace of the growth, but in addition to height growth, there would also be a noticeable difference in the muscle mass of the subject. Basically, he would hulk out, turning from a scrawny teenager into a towering colossus with the physique of a bodybuilder. Quantrain licked his lips just thinking about the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs opposed to a steady or increasing growth, the effect for the yellow formula would cause the subject\u2019s growth to come in spurts, though the amount of those spurts would increase as time went on. The first day, he could grow to seven feet tall, but the next day, he could grow to be nine, and so on. What\u2019s more, the subject also would shrink back to his original height each day... as long as (and at exactly the same time as) he experienced an orgasm in some way. Theoretically, that would mean that if the subject never came, he would keep his height and add on the next day\u2019s spurt on top of that. But somehow, the doctor didn't think that would be a problem, teenage boys being the way they are and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis led to the green formula, which was probably his favorite. It was basically a reverse of the previous effect, where the subject wouldn't grow at all, but get more and more horny until he got off in some way, which would immediately cause him to grow. In addition, the more times the subject would grow and get off, the more frequently he would become horny again, a vicious cycle that Quantrain just now realized could lead to some small problems, but... Oh well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue formula was definitely an interesting one. As the boy grew, he would start turning into some sort of anthropomorphic animal. Once he got off, he would turn human again (though keep the increased size), but would soon start transforming again, each time into a different furry creature. That one could definitely get weird, but Quantrain liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he came to the last formula, which was colored  purple. With this one he had a hard time making out any of his scribbles, but only saw the words \"power\" and \"limits\". Shrugging, the doctor decided to wait until all the other formulas had been used at least once, and then use this one and see where it would lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he had gotten all of this straightened out, his plane had landed in San Francisco, and a short helicopter ride took him to St. Gerstman\u2019s. Looking over the list, he carefully considered which formula he should try first, having great difficulty making up his mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they flew over the academy, Quantrain spotted the football team playing, probably preparing for a game. Like any other school, St. Gerstman's Academy for Gifted And Talented Boys had various sporting teams that competed against other schools. As he looked at them tackle each other, he came to a realization. <i>Of course, why didn\u2019t I think of it before?</i> Since this is an athletic school, we might as well put some meat on them for their big games, and with his orange formula, they were soon to be <i>really</i> big  games! The boys would tower and dominate all of their opponents and seize victory effortlessly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the helicopter to land at the helipad, and after the usual warm welcome from the students Quantrain made his way to his office. Once he was there in private, he began to search for a candidate for his orange formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then, who do I select as the first subject?\u201d Quantrain said. Opening his laptop, he pulled up a list of students enrolled in the athletics program and began a quick search through the roster. It would have been too easy to select someone who was already genetically gifted, so instead he searched for the minor players, the ones who would have been more or less been designated as bench warmers. Finally he had a hit. \u201cGary Beckett, you\u2019re lucky subject number one.\u201d He grinned broadly. According to the profile, Gary was a 16 year old Caucasian male with dark hair and eyes with looks good enough to grace any cover of a magazine. Besides his looks, he appeared to be normal enough, average height and build at 5\u201910\u201d and 155 lbs. of athletic muscle, just like all of the other boys, but that build would have been suited more for a swimmer or a track team. Instead, Gary was a member of the football team. He was easily one of the smallest of his team, and although he was fast, he just didn\u2019t have the muscle to keep up with the others. Gary apparently attempted to change all that by going to the gym and working out every day, but it seems like his genetics refused to give him what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to change real soon.\u201d Quantrain chuckled. It didn\u2019t take long for Gary to come to his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou called for me Mr. Q?\u201d Gary asked, his breathing just a little bit heavy. Anyone who got a summons from Mr. Q would immediately drop whatever they were doing and rush to answer his call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I just wanted to speak with you a bit, sit down.\u201d He waved towards the comfortable chair in front of his desk.  \u201cSo I hear you\u2019re on the football team, quite the rough sport.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, my dad used to play when he was my age.\u201d He nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough, don\u2019t be offended, but you don\u2019t seem to be as big as the other players.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being told not to, Gary still flashed a look of upset. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, I work out every day and eat like a linebacker, but I can\u2019t seem to build any bulk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot for long Quantrain thought. \u201cWell, going with your last health report, I have discovered that you have a hormone imbalance that is restricting your growth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Gary said. \u201cIs there anything I can do about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, there is something I can do about it.\u201d Quantrain opened his case and withdrew a vial of the orange formula. \u201cJust drink this and before you know it you\u2019ll be shooting up like a weed.\u201d The mad scientist couldn\u2019t help but grin at that last remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost eagerly Gary accepted the potion and downed it right there. \u201cWow, I thought it would taste nasty but it\u2019s just like orange soda!\u201d Well of course it did, why make something that looked like orange soda without making it taste the same? \u201cThanks a bunch Mr. Q!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome Gary.\u201d Quantrain replied, already eager to see the formula in action.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gary headed out of the office, jogging with a much livelier step than he had come in with. Practice was over for the day, but Quantrain knew that Gary would go straight to the gym right afterward in hopes of making some headway into his muscle development. Well, if the formula was half as good as the doctor was anticipating it to be, then he'd see much more than he'd ever dreamed of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gym at the school was large and luxurious, with fancy and very new equipment, much like everything else at St. Gerstman's. Quantrain didn't want to waste too much time, so soon after Gary left, he quickly left his office, heading down a half-hidden stairwell at the back, and out the building, across the lawn and to the athletic building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room where the free weights were had a ceiling-to-floor mirror running across the back wall, but what most, if not all, of the boys didn't know was that the mirror was actually a two-way mirror, with a small secret hallway running behind it. It was this hallway that Quantrain made a beeline for in order to observe the effects that the formula had on the boy. As he arrived, Gary was one of only two boys working out, the other being a burly senior who Quantrain recognized as one of the tight ends from the football team. Gary had just finished stretching out and was beginning to start doing squats. A small amount of sweat had formed on his brow, but Gary still appeared to be energetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he started lifting, Gary soon realized that he was able to do rep after rep with much less effort than before. He blew through the first set of ten, and as he placed the bar back on the stand, he scratched his head, looking down at the weights with a puzzled look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I put on the wrong plates?\" he said aloud. The senior barely turned his head, and let out nothing more than a grunt in response, but Gary wasn't really wanting a response anyways. He stretched out his arms again, went over and grabbed some plates from the rack and slid them on the bar, and then turned to face the bar, lifting it and starting to do some curls as a test. These were also much easier than he was anticipating, and he set the bar back down and flexed one of his biceps, looking at it closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Gary muttered under his breath, as a hint of a smile started to form, and for good reason. Quantrain noticed that the sixteen-year-old already was starting to look much more muscular than he had before, and was inching up in height as well, though the boy hadn't noticed this yet. However, the short sleeves on the t-shirt he was wearing were starting to hug his forearms a bit tighter, and his mesh shorts were being filled by significantly thicker thigh muscles. Gary just shook his head in delight. \"Finally, after all this time, some results!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gary turned back to the weights, Dr. Q. just chuckled to himself. \"Results? You've barely begun to see results, Gary.\"</span></div></div>",

Getting under the bench press he began his first attempt at beching one hundred. He lifted it with ease, not noticing that as he lifted he grew as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, not way!\" He exclaimed to himself. He could barely bench ninety before. This was amazing to him. At this point, the senior left, leaving Gary alone in the gym. Dr. Q watched excitedly. These were better results than he was expecting to see!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary went back to adding weights and benching bigger and bigger amounts. One fiftey, Two hundred, Two twenty five, all withh as much ease as the first lift had been. Gary was in a state of sheer euphoria, much to excited to notice that he was pushing seven feet tall and was probaby already larger than the world's strongest bodybuilder. He was a total giant muscle hunk! But he wasn't done yet, he just kept pressing on. Three hundred, Three fifty, Four hundred pounds! As he lifted he grew and grew, Dr. Q laughing with glee. It worked! The formula worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter benching Five hundred pounds with ease, Gary decided it was time to stop for the day. It was then he finally noticed how big he truly became. He was now fourteen feet tall without  a single gram of fat onn his body. He had possibly the largest, sexiest and most muscular body in the world. He was the description of physical perfection, with beautifull pecs and arms, a deep eight pack, and legs like oak trees. Dr. Q was more than pleased with his results. He was almost attracted to them. Regardless, it was time to decide what to do next.</span></div></div>",

The green fields and trees that garnished the beautiful island made the answer easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreen!\u201d he exclaimed, almost jumping out his seat, making the pilot swerve the helicopter in surprise.  Why not start off with his favourite? After all this day calls for a celebration! He closed the carefully padded box with his numerous samples of potions, and now prepared for his next dilemma \u2013 whom to try it on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrival of the helicopter was not unusual to the boys at the school, since the doctor had often toured the grounds. He was always kind and giving towards the boys there, and wildly cherished by all; this was no different! A myriad of young boys rushed towards him as the helicopter landed, the strong winds from the rotary blades brushed their clothing tight against their bodies, showing off their impressive physique.  \u201cOh this was definitely the right place to begin.\u201d The doctor agreed with himself quietly, with a wide smile spreading across his lips. He held his arms wide as he was surrounded by 20-something teenagers, jumping up and down against him, almost giving him a bad chafe all around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA choir of young voices greeted him with cheers and whoo\u2019s and a steady chant of: \u201cMister Q! Mister Q! Mister Q!\u201d their affectionate name for him, which always made him feel loved and important \u2013 not to mention a bit like James Bond\u2019s gadgets expert! \u201cHello, boys!\u201d He shouted back to the group surrounding him, trying to overpower the loud \u2018chop chop chop\u2019 of the engine behind him, \u201cI brought all of you some special gifts this time! And I will need a subje.. Umm, recipient! To receive my gift first. Any volunteers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA forest of hands rose before him with incredible speed, followed by the best impressions of doggy-eyes he had ever seen on any human. He smiled softly to himself at the eager boys and picked from them, a 5 foot 15 year old tanned boy with beautiful mid-length dark hair by the name Luke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting his arm around the shoulders of his selected \u2018recipient\u2019, the doctor started to part the group of kids to a collected groan of disappointment. However, the promise of more gifts getting handed out later did keep their spirits up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo.. What is this gift you spoke of, Mister Q?\u201d The young boy in Quantrain\u2019s arms asked with childish curiosity \u201cIs it what you have in that case there? Can I have it now? Can I.. Can I?\u201d He bounced up and down in front of the doctor, who could only smile back at the adorable display of enthusiasm. \u201cPlease, you\u2019ll have to wait till we get inside. But I promise you that it\u2019ll be worth it! And one thing you\u2019ll have to promise me, is that you let the gift be a secret for as long as you can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And I know what you think, the old guy luring in the small boy to his office with the promise of a gift when he gets there, and telling the boy to keep it a secret.. Let me tell you, these boys are treasured to me, I would never bring them to any harm. And growth and pleasure for the teenage boy is NOT harm. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy wondered for a moment what the doctor had meant by \u2018keeping it a secret as long as he could\u2019 but simply shrugged his shoulders and followed Quantrain into his office. After all, what was the worst that could happen, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his door, the doctor took out a large bottle of his selected potion of green liquid from which he carefully measured a dose fit for the small boy, and poured it into a small fizzy drink. \u201cThis is my gift to you, Luke.\u201d He handed the glass to the confused boy, who took it and smelled it curiously \u201cOh, it may not seem like a big deal to you now, but just trust me you will find this quite an experience\u2026 Oh, and don\u2019t worry, Luke, there are no side effects to this.\u201d The boys lips stretched into a smile and he gladly finished the entire glass in a few seconds, letting off a resounding burb, which only made both of them laugh heartily. Luke couldn\u2019t help feel that the doctor was holding information back, but he also trusted the older man like all the kids did at school. Plus, what kind of a surprise involved being told everything? Now he was just excited to see what this wonderful experience was that he\u2019d been promised, and sat there looking around the room while trying extra hard to feel any difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm.. Mister Q, will it take long to \u2026 do what it\u2019s supposed to do?\u201d The doctor simply smiled and got down on his knees in front of Luke\u2019s chair while the boy started to squirm a bit uncomfortably, shivering and panting softly as he ground his butt against the chair. \u201cHmm, it would seem that it already is, Luke. Don\u2019t worry, the weird feeling will vanish soon. The fluid is fusing with your DNA, which will allow the effects to take hold.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Quantrain had finished his explanation, the boy stopped moving and simply sat there with a relaxed and happy - no blissful - expression plastered across his face. \u201cThat was WILD!\u201d Luke shouted, and Quantrain noticed much to his delight that the front of the boys pants were starting to bulge and tent as the drugs worked their magic. \u201cOh, but Luke, that is nothing compared to what is to come..\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What kind of irresponsible hack of a scientist would I be, Quantrain thought, if I participated or in any way interfered with my own experiments? A sexually satisfied one, maybe, but that probably wouldn't be a problem any longer. In any case, it would be better to see how Luke would interact with others his own age. And, even better, it let the doctor indulge his voyeuristic side!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and head back to your room,\" Quantrain said as he patted Luke on the shoulder. \"Don't want to be, erm, up too late tonight, now do we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Luke waved goodbye to Quantrain, turning around as he reached the door and flashing a wide, almost euphoric smile. \u201dThanks again, Mr. Q!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dBelieve me, Luke,\u201d replied the grinning scientist, \u201dthe  pleasure is mine.\u201d He waved in a slightly eccentric, almost childish, manner as the grinning and very excited fifteen year old left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dNow,\u201d he said aloud after making sure his office was once again empty, \u201dwhat\u2019s the best way for me to keep an eye on our little test case? Oh yes!\" Grabbing the case with the rest of the samples, he quickly hurried to the back of the office, where he opened the door to what looked like a small coat closet. But when he pressed a small button hidden inside the lapel of one of the coats hung there, the back of the closet slid away, revealing a tunnel, sort of a secret passageway, if you will. It was something that Quantrain had specially built into the buildings of the school when it originally was being constructed - a series of passageways that stood in between some of the walls of each of the buildings, and could lead to a secret view of each of the rooms. What's more, these tunnels were all connected underground, so he could get to any interior room on the island without being detected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building where the boys all slept was the next one over from the administration building, and it took Quantrain a few minutes to navigate his way to the third floor, where his records told him Luke lived. Sure enough, when he got there, the fifteen year old dark-haired boy was sitting on a chair in front of his computer. Looking closer at the monitor, the doctor was slightly disappointed to see that Luke was doing a school assignment and not looking at something a bit more\u2026 arousing, but after a few moments, he noticed that Luke had removed his school pants and shirt and was sitting at the desk wearing only his boxers and a white T-shirt. The bulge that had been clearly evident in the office was even more pronounced here, and Luke appeared as if he had to constantly fight not to touch it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a knock came from the bedroom door. Spinning around, in his chair, Luke had a sort of shocked look on his face. \"W-who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, Collin,\" the voice called out. Dr. Quantrain pulled out his tablet, quickly looking up the file of any boys named Collin. The only one that appeared to be a likely match was a boy who lived in the room directly across the hall from Luke, and was a year younger. Scanning the information that had been collected on the boy, Quantrain saw that Collin was one of the quieter students, not speaking up or participating much in class, but his test scores were usually at the top of the charts. The other, more interesting part of Collin's records was the long internet history of him visiting gay porn sites from the computer in his bedroom. This, Quantrain thought, could be an interesting matchup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke appeared to be just as interested in the visitor, and as he swung open the door, he smiled at the younger boy on the other side. Collin returned the smile, albeit in a much shier, more reserved manner, as he brushed his long red bangs out of his face to reveal sparkling green eyes, which soon went wide in shock when he saw the pronounced bulge in Luke's underwear. \"I-it's good to see you, Luke,\" he finally stammered. \"I hope this isn't a bad time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding?!\" Luke threw his arms around Collin and embraced him, pulling him into the room and slamming shut the door behind him. \"I can't imagine anyone I'd rather see right now!\" Without another word, he brought his mouth to Collin's and passionately kissed the fourteen year-old. Collin seemed to be taken aback at this, but he soon closed his eyes and gave into the kiss, even wrapping his arms around Luke in return and moving his hands up and down his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Dr. Quantrain thought to himself, \"I guess these two must be boyfriends. I wonder why my surveillance hasn't picked up on that any sooner.\" He shrugged, and turned his attention back to the action in front of him. Both boys had removed their shirts, leaving Collin in a pair of khaki pants and Luke in just his boxers. What's more, Luke's erection had sneaked out of the fly of his boxers, causing the head to be visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so fucking horny right now,\" Luke whispered into Collin's ear, which seemed to send a shiver down the redhead's spine. He gently moved his fingertips down Luke's chest and lean, firm stomach, eventually resting his hand on the lump in his boxers. He gave Luke's cock a firm squeeze, which caused the older boy to moan loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, be careful,\" Collin said in a soft but firm voice. \"Do you want everyone to be able to hear us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Luke nearly screamed. \"I don't care! I just need to get off right now!\" Dr. Quantrain adjusted himself as he watched this scene, loving where it was headed. He almost wished he could get some version of the formula to Collin, just to see what would happen if both boys underwent a transformative experience. But, unfortunately, there wasn't anything--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait! Of course! The formula didn't have to be swallowed; simply getting pricked with a needle or something similar would cause it to have the same effect. And, naturally, Dr. Quantrain always carried around his trusty blow dart gun in his back pocket, like any good scientist. He had never really needed them for any other recent situation, but they seemed perfect for this kind of task, almost as if someone had written them into his life out of convenience. Whatever the reason, though, he would use one of them to get Collin some exposure to one of the formulas. But that brought forth an even more important question: should he keep testing the green version or try a different one with this boy? Oh, decisions, decisions.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I can't just hit Collin with the same color,\" Quantrain muttered to himself, low enough so not as to be heard by the two horny boys. \"After all, the whole point of this experiment is to see the differences between the versions, and what better way to see those differences in action than to apply two of them to a pair of boys that were already involved with each other?\" He chuckled lightly as he dipped the tip of one of the darts, coating it in the yellow formula. \"Because,\" he explained aloud to his nonexistent audience, \"yellow is the most logical choice, since it compliments green, and also since with both versions, the affected boy will experience a significant change when he orgasms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuantrain looked out again, noticing that Collin and Luke were now making out fairly vigorously, both still shirtless and wearing their pants and boxers, respectively. Loading the dart into the tip of the gun, the doctor brought the opposite end to his mouth, carefully threading the long slender gun through one of the cracks in the air vent through which he was watching the scene unfold before him. Blowing hard, the dart flew from the wall straight at Collin, hitting him on the side of his stomach. The young teen was far too involved with his boyfriend to even notice the prick, and after resting in his side for a few seconds, the dart fell to the ground. But the deed had been done; the formula, yellow version, was in his bloodstream, and since that was a more direct application than Luke's had been, Quantrain reasoned that the effects should manifest themselves much more quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was right. Collin instantly started inching upwards, not noticing, at least initially, that his khakis were becoming ever so tighter. Of course, it's hard to notice those things when you have your hands wrapped around a pulsating cock oozing with pre-cum, as the redhead currently found himself doing. \"Holy shit,\" Collin exclaimed as he felt the girth of Luke's meat. \"Since when have you been so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-- I don't know!\" Luke responded. As the two boys turned slightly, Quantrain finally got a sight of the massive member to which they were referring. It was indeed a sight, over a foot long and with the thickness of the wide end of a baseball bat. Collin could barely just fit one hand around its girth, and he began to move it up and down the shaft, his other hand now traveling inside his own pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Quantrain murmured, repressing a moan that was welling up inside him from seeing this incredible specimen of boyhood. \"I suppose that probably is a new development. After all, I don't think that he'd ever leave his bedroom if he had a cock that big. I suppose there are some side effects of the various versions of the formulas that I have yet to discover. How exciting!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed his small notepad out of his pocket and jotted this down. As he turned back up to look at the boys, he was slightly surprised to see that Collin was now a full foot taller than before. His pants were now much too tight, starting to split at the seams, and the fourteen year old was starting to feel uncomfortable due to this, though it didn't keep him from continuing to jack off his now smaller-but-older boyfriend. His hand fit comfortably now around Luke's cock, and was now nearly soaked with the torrents of pre streaming from the tip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhh, what's happening to us?\" Collin moaned, a nervousness evident in his face but an intense horniness beating it out. Fed up with how constricted he was feeling, he grabbed his pants and boxers with his free hand and pulled at them hard, yanking them clean off with one smooth motion, then ripped off Luke's boxers immediately afterwards, leaving both boys completely nude and rock-hard. Collin's own cock was clearly hard, and large due to his overall growth, but it didn't look as out-of-place as Luke's did, fitting in nicely with his frame, now approaching seven feet tall. Also, unlike his boyfriend, he didn't seem to be releasing any pre at all, though Quantrain figured that was more due to his own biology, since he seemed to be as intensely aroused as Luke did. Luke seemed to jump at the chance to grab hold of Collin's cock, and he stroked the growing member, quickly graining speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys now were jerking each other off with more passion and intensity than Quantrain had ever seen. Collin seemed to be getting the worse deal of the two, as due to his now two-foot height advantage, he had to stretch his arm out completely and bend down to keep Luke's cock in hand, and wasn't able to get quite the range of motion that Luke could get. Still, Luke didn't seem to mind, as his body seemed to be tensing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" Luke exclaimed, and Quantrain braced himself for what he was about to see. \"I'm-- I'm about to--\" Before he could finish his sentence, his cock erupted with a huge rope-like shot of cum, shooting straight up and hitting Collin in the chin and ear. As he continued to cum, his body suddenly began to get bigger, with surges of growth occurring in rhythm with his cum shots. He leaned against the wall, banging his hip against his desk and knocking his lamp to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter four, five, six shots, his cock finally ended its production, and he fell back against the bed, not even noticing that his head had hit against the nine-foot-tall ceiling and dented it slightly. \"Oh well, I suppose I should alert the maintenance department,\" Quantrain chuckled to himself. \"But first, let's see how Collin does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing soaked with Luke's seed seemed to only add fuel to Collin's already blazing fire, and he too seemed to be close to orgasm, as close as his head was to the ceiling (that is, pretty damn close). Both boys were now close to the same size, and Collin had taken his own cock back in his hand, stroking it fiercely as he wrapped his thighs around Luke's stomach and his ass brushed against Luke's still-hard and dripping-wet cock, causing his toes to curl. Without warning, Collin thrusted his hips forward and he began to cum as well, but unlike Luke, he started to shrink as he shot his load up Luke's chest, hitting him in the face and soaking his hair. As he shrunk, the loads got smaller, until finally he was back to his own normal height, sitting on the stomach of Luke, who now towered over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys were panting, still lost in the afterglow of the most intense orgasms of their young lives (at least, so far). \"Shit,\" Luke finally said in between breaths, \"that was incredible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollin seemed to be just as amazed but also slightly worried. \"How-- why-- ?\" He couldn't say more than one word at a time, and just shook his head, trying to comprehend what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Quantrain said, \"I'd say that the first stage of the experiment is a rousing success.\" He thought about staying around and seeing how the boys handled the aftermath, but he needed to get back to his office and get prepared for tomorrow. \"And besides,\" he thought to himself, \"I've got the footage from the security camera in their room to, um, peruse.\"</span></div></div>",

The feeling was rather pleasant, but another, less comfortable feeling was coming upon him: that of his clothes starting to feel tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" he wondered as he looked down at his body. His shirt was starting to ride up and reveal a sliver of skin around his stomach, his shorts were squeezing against his thighs, and his toes were pressed up against the ends of his shoes. \"Am I-- Am I grow--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got cut off as a huge growth spurt suddenly overtook him. Within seconds, his height jumped from just around five feet tall to well over eight. His clothes ripped to shreds and his feet burst out of his shoes, and he was still growing, starting to rise above the heads of the adults around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this certainly is interesting,\" Quantrain chuckled as he watched from a short distance away. A few screams could be heard as some in the crowd started to panic and run away, while others just stood and watched in amazement as this young boy continued to grow bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy couldn't believe what was happening. As he neared ten feet, he looked down at the table where his half-finished smoothie was sitting. \"Could it have somehow made me grow like this?\" An idea started to form in Andy's head, and his grin started to widen.</span></div></div>",

Of course he\u2019ll want to use it to try and take over the world, right? Hold on, not so fast. He's gonna need to test it first, run an experiment of sorts. After all, he's a scientist, there are rules and procedures to be followed. Of course, there\u2019s no point in testing the formula if you\u2019re not going to use human subjects, right? How will that end up, you ask? Well, I guess we\u2019re about to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple things to note for this story:<br>\r\nA) The first chapter says that the doc has more than one  version of the formula. You can decide whether or not he tests them all out, and if they have different side effects, or if he just sticks to one.<br>\r\nB) There\u2019s no age or gender limit for the growing ones, but I do ask that if a chapter is leaning a particular directions as far as all that is concerned, try to keep it heading that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks!
