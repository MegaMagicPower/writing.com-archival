Since six months to the day, he's worked his butt off to prove he belonged in Beacon. He's trained heavily with his partner Pyrrha everyday, he's studied as hard as he could, and even saved his former tormentor Cardin from an Ursa!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he's recently hit a wall. The past week, he's averaged C's and B's in Grimm Studies and Dust Mixing. He even won a match against one of the lower tier members of teams in Combat Class. But he's still called a dunce, dealing with the whispers of dragging his prodigal partner Pyrrha and other teammates Ren and Nora down with him. Even if Cardin stopped bullying him, the others jeer at him for being weak. Saying he'll never amount to anything more than a warm body on the field, a mediocre hunter at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune slammed a fist into a hard wall in frustration ... only to shake his hand as the pain reached his brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! OW! OW! Man that hurts...\" he said while cradling his bruised wrist, his Aura slow to heal it due to Combat Class having eaten away most of it earlier in the day. \"I wish there was a way for me to get stronger faster. I don't care what it takes, but I need to be the leader my team needs me to be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his resolve tighten, Jaune went to the ______ to look for ways to get stronger.</span></div></div>",

A cute bubble butt cropped up, pushing and straining his pants. His nipples grew out, becoming pink and puffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune then looked into a window. And staring back was Ruby! \u201cW-what the hell! My voice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune\u2019s voice became squeakier, hitting a high pitch. He backed up into a window, then felt a bang fall over his eye. It was black with red tips!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!!!\u201d A pair of tight lacy panties formed around his groin, crushing it into oblivion. A matching bra began to form. Slowly, his chest began to grow. A D-cup pushes the cups of the bra to Yang level jiggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow! These are not supposed to be this big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA black combat skirt formed from his pants, while a black corset formed a tight hourglass figure.

Saying nothing, she swapped his remaining underwear. A loud sluuuurp was heard, as a tight pussy hugged the thong slipped up her ass. The rest of the outfit was quickly placed on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune tried to glare, but a somewhat playful tone slipped out as she spoke. \u201cGuess the cat\u2019s out of the bag!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping up last, Ruby had two bracelets identical to the ones Yang wore.

I know I never said this, but you always looked kinda hot ... wanna bang-a-Yang?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune then felt a lock of hair fall into his face, opening the floodgates for a slew of facial changes. A curtain of golden looks grew out and volumed, styling itself into Yang\u2019s well maintained hairstyle. Blue eyes gave way to lilac, being framed by longer lashes and a cuter nose. The lips would plump up as his face shifted to match RWBY\u2019s resident bombshell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear overtook the beauty\u2019s face that now reflects her own. \u201cI have to get out of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as Raven phases through another portal. \u201cOh Yaang!

Before he could say anything, a tight yellow bra was latched onto his new girls by Raven. Digging in as the bra began to support the globe\u2019s of flesh, his spine reshaped to better accommodate for the new weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then, time for some bush clearing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune nearly jumped back. \u201cW-wait! Y-you don\u2019t want to do that!\u201d Eyes bulged out in panic as Raven studied him for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d The bubbly woman was gone, and the bandit queen reasserted herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... w-well ... ya see,\u201d he started, unable to focus from the cold look he was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven was unimpressed. \u201cUh huh.

A patch of bright yellow hair stylized into a flame greeted her cold gaze. \u201cJust when I think I can\u2019t be surprised any more-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune stood frozen in place, her reaction muted by the burning sensation of her insides being rearranged in a flash<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-you make me even prouder. Stylized pubic hair? Me and Summer used to the same thing to tease the boys!\u201d A huge smile graced her face, reminded of good times.

The large cups jutted out, waiting to be filled. He wanted to run, but could only step. And his left nipple darkened and poked out. With another step, the same happened to his right. The boots then moved on it\u2019s own, swaying his new hips as new breasts slowly grew with every movement. A large pair of DD\u2019s strained against the the bustier, showing of a valley of deep cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down where the boots took him, the nearly Pyrrhized Jayne stood at a bench with two items: a lacy black thong, or a spear and shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one does he grab?</span></div></div>",
