Finally your cabin trip was here and you were more than ready to just have a week of freedom. Slowly plodding along through the rush hour traffic you began running over a checklist in your head of everything you needed <i>check, check, shit I guess I can stop for that on the way.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving home you were, like always, too drained to do anything extravagant and just made a frozen dinner while watching some mindless T.V. with a dumb smile on your face, knowing that tomorrow was your release from the regular stressful prison of life. Finishing dinner and tossing the silverware in the sink to sit for a week, already slipping to relaxation mode, you made your way to your room to quickly pack, you grabbed some comfortable clothes, an extra charger, and whatever bric a brac you felt like bringing along, then deciding you had packed enough you moved to the bathroom to gather toiletries and shower before bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stripped before entering the shower even your reflection couldn't get you down. You weren't exactly unattractive you were just plain with your brown hair and eyes, your body was plain, not really weak but not particularly strong while developing a small pouch, your dick was a soft four inches and hard 6, not small but definitely not big, and you weren't short or tall at five feet and ten inches. But none of that mattered because tomorrow began your week, the week of Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter showering you returned to your room and climbed into bed when...</span></div></div>",

Finally the week had come, your week, no one to answer to and no rules to follow. You gathered your bag and headed out the door with a dopey smile on your face. Tossing the bag in the passenger seat you now only needed to make a quick stop for groceries and you were set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up to the grocery store on the way out of town you were pleased to see that there were few other people at the store so hopefully you'd be able to go in and out in no time. Making your way into the store you grabbed a cart and made your way through the aisles, but before long you accidentally bumped into one of the few other shoppers with your cart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God I'm sorry! Are you alright? I shouldn't have let my cart get away from me!\" you gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey calm down it's all good,\" the guy said completely unfazed \"I'm a bit to solid for that to really hurt anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting your first proper look at the guy you saw what he meant. He was huge through and through, towering over you at what looked to be 6'6 and sporting the most dense and muscled figure you'd ever seen. As you continued staring, noting the thick light blonde hair on his arms and legs, you vaguely heard someone say \"Josh!?\" wait how did he know your name? As you looked to the man's face you were briefly confused, staring at his rugged stubble that was somehow perfectly offsetting a charming puppy dog face you finally realized who this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God Jake! It's been years how are you?\" you asked the huge man you hadn't seen in at <i>least</i> 10 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing alright,\" he said \"just running some errands.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, but I mean, like, you must work out like non-stop!\" you said eliciting a blush \"You're so huge too! Remember you used to be way shorter than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was younger by a year, I mean I guess I still am haha,\" he clumsily said, totally flustered by the flattery \"but I do work out some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing him blush was starting to stir something in you. You couldn't quite explain it, but Jake's gentle nature and enormous figure was quite alluring for whatever reason. \"Well it must be more than some, you're built like a tank!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh thanks man, but enough about me what are you up to?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well actually I was just about to go on vacation.\" you told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit man! I'm actually on vacation too!\" Jake said excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...</span></div></div>",

The both of you then awkwardly split to continue your respective rounds, leaving you to feel like an enormous wad who couldn't even talk to a guy you thought was cute \"...wait was I crushing on him?\" you pondered. After twenty minutes or so you both found yourselves meeting again in the parking lot, the both of you sheepishly keeping your heads down while you loaded your groceries until with a weak wave and half-assed goodbye you departed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the highway now, cabin bound, you couldn't help but <i>hate</i> yourself for being so chickenshit. Turning the radio on full blast to try and drown out your thoughts you noticed that a familiar car was in your rear view mirror. \"Could that be...\" you wondered, taking note that the driver looked to be an awfully large man. For a moment your heart stopped as you remembered Jake had said that he himself was on vacation, and there <i>was</i> a cabin next door to yours that, in all the times you'd gone, never seemed to be occupied. \"No. No way!' you said to yourself, almost giddy, \"That's so unlikely it's stupid to even consider it!\" For several minutes more the car followed you until, to your displeasure, it turned off on a completely different exit. \"Whatever...like I said it wasn't even possible...\" you tried to rationalize, as your mood soured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the cabin now your mood did begin to improve, in-spite of yourself, as you finished unpacking your things and putting away the groceries, no matter what happened this was still you well-earned and much needed week of rest and relaxation. Sitting down with a novel you'd been meaning to finish for what felt like a lifetime you began peacefully reading. After half an hour though you were startled from your story as you heard a car engine outside \"...that's weird,\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to open the door you began dreading the fact it was probably those same annoying fishermen that bothered you every damn year insisting that, despite never renting either cabin, they were somehow due your access to the lakefront. When you opened the door your heart practically leapt out your mouth as you saw the car from earlier with Jake, somewhat ungraciously, attempting to untie a suitcase from the roof of his car. Making your way outside you couldn't help but stare at his tremendous bulk, his biceps heaving with effort as his raised arms lifted his shirt granting the view of a stomach utterly packed with mass, as faint the outline of abdominal muscles lingered over a muscle gut that, like the rest of him, had a light coating of blonde hair. Your gaze falling lower you saw at the base of his stomach a fairly dense \"happy trail\" for which you assumed all other's must be named as it lead to the top of a <i>thick</i> bush of pubes that shamelessly peaked out the waist of his pants \"...yo Josh, Earth to Josh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping out of your daze you realized just how hard you'd been staring as your cheeks went red \"Fuck,\" you said internally, before noticing Jake's face was equally red \"Double fuck,\" hopefully he was just red with frustration of the pesky not and didn't see just how hard you were staring. \"Uh...sorry, what'd you say?\" you asked trying desperately not to trip over every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked if you'd give me a hand with this bastard of a knot. My hands are a bit too reminiscent of oven mitts,\" Jake said, showing his large hands and wiggling some fairly sausage-esque fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure no problem,\" you said before unraveling the tight knot. \"So...if you don't mind my asking...if you were coming here why did you turn where you did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that,\" he said before producing a strange looking remote from his bag \"I had to go home and get this when I realized we were going the same way. It was a bit of a fool's errand seeing as I've never even tried it, hell you also could have just kept on going but something told me it was worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So what is <i>it</i>?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A surprise,\" Jake grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd apparently that was all you were going to get as Jake started to gather his things. Before he could make it inside his own cabin though you frantically worked up the nerve to propose \"You know...um...if you want...uh...you can come over for dinner...if you're not busy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...uh yeah! Sounds fun!\" he nervously accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night you were just finishing putting the finishing touches on dinner, butterflies making mincemeat of your stomach, when...</span></div></div>",

A cacophony of twisting metals and splitting woods all paired with various ungodly groaning of any number of materials before with a deafening explosion the cabin across the way, Jake's cabin, burst, giving way to an enormous and growing wall of recognizable flesh. Running out the door, momentarily questioning your sanity as you ran to such a scene rather than away from, you only made it a few steps before blushing hotly and freezing in place when you saw firsthand what had become of Jake. The man seated atop the wreckage of his former lodging was beyond comprehension, he loomed massively over everything with heaving muscle and mass all coated with a generous amount of light blonde hair, and before you sat two gargantuan testicles, each easily double your size if not more, between his colossal splayed legs topped by a throbbing monolith of sex that would periodically rain the massive drop of pre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that far below his groin had garnered your attention Jake cleared his throat and joked \"I hope I'm not too under dressed for dinner,\" with an intense blush of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I don't think you'd fit,\" you joked equally lamely, trying to not get immediately get sucked back into the black hole that was the giant man's huge genitalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that could be arranged,\" he said fishing amongst the rubble until he found the remote from before, which promptly resized itself to fit his hand, \"I just didn't think my first time trying this thing would be so...so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sexy?\" you offered, then immediately wished you'd dropped dead instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, well that wasn't <i>quite</i> the word I was looking for,\" Jake laughed a bit nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry, sorry,\" you repeated, considering burying your head like an ostrich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis blush growing deeper the giant confessed, \"Well don't be sorry Josh, it is...<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">pretty hot</font>,\" he attempted to squeak in a futile attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis stark contrast between his godly size and intense bashfulness sent a genuine shiver up your spine. Desperate to see where you could wind up with Jake tonight you proposed \"Well if you really can change back with that remote, dinner is basically ready...and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well...\"</span></div></div>",

Truth be told you didn't dislike the guy, but the whole point of this week was supposed to be to answer to no one. Whatever she'd already twisted your arm so you might as well make the best of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you were stopping by Jared's apartment to pick him up when you saw he was already outside raring to go. Pulling up you couldn't help but envy the 20 year old as he very much had to duck to sit into you're car with his 6'4 height with his well toned arms on display and his pecs peaking out from his sleeveless tank top. \"Hope you don't mind starting so early but it's a bit of a hike\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all good man,\" he said fishing through his bag and pulling a pillow out \"If you don't mind I'll just crash on the way up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\" you said and within five minutes the guy was already asleep. As you drove up to the cabin you couldn't help but steal the occasional glance at the odd traffic light, Jared had light chestnut hair and a small stubble beard that was somehow both charming and devilish, but the thing that really floored you is when you dared to look down you saw this dude had an enormous tent in his shorts. \"Damn!\" you said without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-huh?\" Jared said waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry,\" you said \"but we're almost there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh cool.\" Jared said, either unaware or unconcerned with his boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pulled up to the cabin shortly after you saw Jared's face light up when he saw the place which admittedly lessen your suppressed bitterness. The cabin itself wasn't very big as it had a bedroom, a bathroom, and a modest general living area, but the true sight to behold was the serene small lake behind it. Grabbing your bags from the car you heard Jared say \"Fucking sweet man I didn't realize there was a lake here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I forgot to mention\" you said \"I've never done much swimming, or fishing, or anything other than enjoy the view really. Maybe we can drive to somewhere nearby and grab some swim trunks and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" Jared said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning towards him to ask a question you instead saw a pile of the guys clothes and then looked to the lake and saw his shapely, shameless bare naked ass running toward the water. \"Jesus Christ\" you said to yourself as he jumped in while you started putting things in the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 15 minutes or so Jared had had his fill and walked back to the cabin. When you heard him you went to get the door to be met with a, still nude, 20 year old hunk holding his clothes instead of wearing them. \"This place looks pretty comfy\" Jared said casually walking around the place nude and dripping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, right,\" you managed, your brain furiously trying to make sense of all this \"So why didn't you, uh, get dressed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry dude,\" Jared said as he started slipping some boxers on \"I wasn't thinking, just we're both guys and all so I didn't think you'd mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No biggie, it's just that I was ready for it.\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh cool,\" Jared said, taking that as reason to stop with boxers \"So we got any food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I was about to see if you wanted to come with me to make a trip into the small town a few miles away and just pick up whatever sounded good.\"</span></div></div>",

First he made his way down the single hall opening the various doors finding a small bathroom, a closet and finally a single bedroom where he deposited his things before faintly smirking to himself in the mirror. After braking away from his own visage he did notice the cabin only had the single bed \"That lucky duck.\" Jared said to himself, brimming with not unfounded confidence. Having now seen the cabin's other rooms Jared returned to the living/dining room, with it's modest couch, a somewhat outdated television, and two recliners, and again took residence on the couch switching on the television. Before long though Jared switched the television back off finding nothing particularly gripping and growing antsy once more then he remembered the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than a minute Jared had, again, shucked his boxers and was sprinting back to the waters, this time he'd get in a proper swim. He splashed away in the waters for nearly an hour, creating games to play with himself and preforming laps in the small lake, before he swam back to shore and laid out on the beach to tan. Finding lying still to be yet another boring task he decided to take a small nap in earnest this time, however his body and mind were in disagreement with his levels of exhaustion. His muscles ached after the exercise, but his mind was still raring to go, but Jared had just the trick for such things as he decided to take matters into his own hands and took himself in hand. It had yet to fail, if the energetic young man found himself in need of a way to unwind all he would have to do was rub one out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning his head back Jared began pumping his impressive shaft unfettered by his exposure, safe in the knowledge of his solitude, and allowed himself to begin shamelessly moaning. As his right hand attended his 10 inch prick his left began teasing his nipple, eliciting yet more moans. Jared's thought then began to dwell on the single bed and how, with a little legwork, he'd almost certainly be able to achieve an entire weeks worth of sexual gratification. These thoughts tipped the man over in to orgasm as he loudly exclaimed \"FUCK!' and began spraying himself with a volley of his own seed. Pleasantly spent he then began to drift to sleep, needing not bother with the sand or sperm as he could simply rinse off when he awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to either Josh or Jared though this small lake, hidden away from the world, had been the site of strange illegal chemical dumping long ago and...well...the act had largely gone without consequence until now, there was the slightest chance that if the right person with the right genes, and an abundance of hormones were to be exposed there'd be no predicting the possible mutations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning from your trek to the nearest market you were shocked to see...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you arrived back at the cabin you were surprised to see Jared was once more naked, this time blissfully napping on the beach. First making sure to bring in all the temperamental groceries before they could as much as threaten to spoil, you decided it'd be for the best to wake your guest up. True enough there wasn't really anything like bears or cougars in these parts that put him in any immediate danger, it was just...interesting...how he apparently wasn't the least bit bothered to take a nap outside completely sprawled out and exposed. Approaching him your sense were assaulted by a <i>powerful</i> smell though you didn't find it unpleasant so much as strong, frankly you kind of liked it, and when you stood above him you saw exactly that this particular fragrance was lake water, dirt, and jizz, lots and lots of jizz. Ignoring the red flag that was your attraction to such a smell you finally piped up and said \"Yo, Jared, wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stirring for a moment Jared did just that before standing and saying \"Welcome back Josh,\" with a smile, completely unfazed by his current state. The two of you then went back to the cabin under the pretense of dinner, which, unsurprisingly, seemed to be one of the few sure fire ways to get the young hunks attention, and based on his chest and abs you could safely guess another. While you made for the kitchenette to start cooking Jared appeared to be heading towards the bathroom, presumably to wash off, when he abruptly turned right into the common area instead of left to the bathroom. With the most apparent air of casualness about him Jared sat his bare, slightly hairy and more than a little sandy, ass dead in the center of the couch with arms stretched along the back of the sofa and spread his legs wide in a display that filled the room with even more of his musky scent than his cum stained self already had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you continued ignoring the flags and alarm bells in your head and just let yourself stare dumbfounded at his perfectly sculpted physique that was the very definition of cut as you enjoyed the smell emanating from his body and that crotch. As the smell reached your brain though you finally heeded its warnings, realizing letting yourself get so worked up over his smell was probably a road best left untraveled. Ready to break the scene you said \"I'm gonna start on dinner if you wanna go wash up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" Jared said accepting the suggestion with a smile that you couldn't read, was he just being friendly or...maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later the meal was ready, Jared had since finished his shower and emerged wearing a t-shirt and boxers, well it was more then literal nothing. You both seated yourselves at the small table and for a few minutes you both just ate in relative silence making idle chitchat, but before long idle chitchat was becoming genuine conversation as you discovered just how many interests you had truly shared. Instinctively you were a bit dubious as you even began confessing some of your nerdier interests, but to your surprise this strapping jock of a young man shared even those, knowing details only someone who was actually invested would know, clearly this nerdy little boy was dying to burst out of Jared's chest. The conservation continued long beyond the dinner's lifetime as you both sat with empty plates, too engrossed in what the other was saying to move, and before long you noticed the sun had even set on the day at some point while you'd been talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God,\" you exclaimed, \"It's already so late? I've gotta get to sleep soon if I don't want to miss half of tomorrow,\" you said gathering the plates and giving them a quick rinse in the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ok...\" Jared said a bit upset to have the discussion end, before heading to your bedroom. You were a bit surprised at that having taken it for granted that he'd just sleep on the couch, but apparently he'd taken equally for granted that he'd have the bed. As you walked over to the couch and began considering how to clean the sand out of the cushions before it became your new bed Jared called for you saying \"C'mon Josh, I thought you were tired?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...uh...there's only the one bed in there,\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? It's a big bed,\" he countered \"Besides it's only gay if you get a boner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, right...\" you said, realizing he didn't know you were gay even <i>without</i> a boner, straight dudes I guess. Surrendering you just went ahead and joined him in the bedroom, casting aside your jeans before climbing into bed in a comfy shirt and boxers. Then Jared, now stood in front of you, began peeling of his shirt \"Please, please, please, stop there,\" you mentally pleaded, Jared however had not heard your cry and bent forward sliding of his boxers, revealing a plump bubble butt positioned right in front of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mind, right man?\" Jared less asked and moreso just did before walking around to the other side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, calm down,\" you told yourself, \"He probably will just face the wall and that will be that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared though clearly had other plans as when he entered the bed it took him a grand total of three seconds to latch on to you \"Hope you don't mind bro, but I'm a bit of a cuddler,\" he said as he just casually started to assume the roll of big spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was screaming at you to tell him off, being apparently allergic to clothes was one thing, but this was just too much! When you opened your mouth though all that came out was \"...ok...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" he said nestling against you, arms wrapping around you as his dick obviously and shamelessly pressed into and climbed up the small of your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Why did I say that?\" you wondered, but you knew the answer. You felt safe and comfortable in such strong arms and as wrong as it was you wanted it.</span></div></div>",

However, when you looked down expecting to still be wrapped up in Jared's strong arms you found yourself letting out a loud gasp while your eyes widen in shock upon seeing you still wrapped up in strong arms while being pressed up against two large pectorals. But that wasn't what caused your eyes widen in disbelief, that was due to the fact that the arms that were holding you were covered in dark brown fur. And when you turned your gaze to behind you you saw that two huge pecs that your head were against were covered in a tan-ish cream colored fur. This caused you to start to struggle a bit as you weren't who was holding you, but you were certain it wasn't Jared. Or at the very least maybe you were still asleep and this was all a dream?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least that's what you thought to be the case. But upon hearing the huge creature yawn you noticed how it sounded just like Jared. This was even made more clear when the anthropomorphic creature muttered, \"Mmm, good morning, Josh. I hope you slept well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>N-No way, don't tell me that this huge thing holding me is......Jared..</i>\" You mentally thought to yourself, to which you swallowed a lump in your throat and came to the realization that you were quite awake. And after doing this you turned your head and looked up at the face of the creature and saw that what was holding you was in fact a anthro otter. However, you knew that it was Jared due to the anthro having the same eyes him along with the same voice too. But you did you did your best not to be too nervous as you let out, \"Uh, yeah I did. And um g-good morning, Jared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why are you being so nervous all of a sudden, buddy?\" The huge otter asked, before you heard his tail hit against the mattress. Once this happened though you heard him let out a surprised gasp of his own to which you felt him let go of you. This prompted you to turn around and see Jared was now holding onto his long tail as he continued with, \"Dude, do you see this? I-I've got a tail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, you do...\" You replied, before you found yourself trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was due to seeing that Jared's new otter self entire body was covered in that dark brown fur like his arms were. And that the tan-ish cream colored fur went all the way down from his lower jaw to his inner thighs. Even his balls and cock had that same tan-ish cream color, expect for the head which was pink in color. And when you saw him let go of his tail and turn around you saw that his tail was dark brown on the top and tan-ish cream on the underside part of it. You then found yourself blushing when you saw that this was the same case for his plump bubble butt as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you were quickly broken away form your staring when you saw Jared get up out of the bed and then stretch before he turned his head and looked back at you from over one his shoulder when he said, \"Well I don't know about you, Josh. But after waking up and seeing how awesome I look now I feel like...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I feel like taking a shower, if you catch my drift,\" Jared said childishly helicoptering around his prominent morning wood, \"Care to join me?\" he pointed at your own burgeoning sunrise special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to \"it's not gay if you don't get a boner?\" you asked, trying to seem disinterested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh, that's just for when you go to sleep,\" he explained as if it were the simplest thing in the world, \"Everyone wakes up boned and nothings weird about two dudes spending some <i>quality time</i> together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's more than a little contradictory, besides shouldn't we figure out what hap-\" but before you could finish he simply grabbed your hand and dragged you along, apparently deciding for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so fussy Josh, it's a wonder you can have any fun at all,\" Jared said, opening the bathroom door and accidentally knocking the door frame with his thick tail, \"Shit, I gotta get used to this thing.\" With that Jared went to turn on the shower, idly feeling his fur and shamelessly teasing his boner while he waited for the water to warm. You on the other hand had froze like a deer in headlights by the door, your brain still perplexed by the whole situation while your body was very much craving this otter-man that casually played with himself. \"You know, you can't shower with your clothes on,\" Jared said, snapping you back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...uh...right...\" you said peeling your shirt off, and very much wondering if Jared had noticed your staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, come on,\" he said tapping his foot impatiently before deciding to just take your boxers off himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jared what the fuck, no!\" you exclaimed in surprise as his hands entered your waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared though completely ignored you and pulled your boxers down, revealing your moderately sized erection. \"Hey buddy,\" he playfully said to your dick, \"You wanna have a little fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit it,\" you told the giant otter talking to your dick, something you could never have imagined having to do in your entire life, \"Frankly I'm not sure this is such a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense!\" Jared exclaimed before pushing you into the shower stall and following after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully it was a reasonably large stall so you both fit with ease and you, deciding you'd try to calm down, sat on the tiled floor. This however proved to be a fatal mistake as Jared began audaciously grunting and jacking his throbbing member with such candor you wondered if he'd ever been human and was really an animal after all right above your face, eyes closed and head thrown back in ecstasy. Simply watching was getting you close to climax without ever touching yourself once, and when Jared's tail, flitting about with pleasure, made contact with you you could hold back no longer as the tip of his tail brushed the head of your member. Suddenly overcome with orgasmic pleasure you let out a yelp and shot several large wads onto Jared's legs and tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus dude...phew...you must have been...ahh...awfully pent up,\" he panted, continuing to masturbate without missing a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha...yeah I guess so...\" you lied, knowing damn well you'd jerked it yesterday before you left, suspecting it was probably the thick member and heavy nuts only inches from your face that were the real culprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could dwell any longer on the subject Jared simply said \"Heads up,\" and with a grunt he unleashed what could only be classified as a torrent upon you, utterly covering your face in seed and applying smaller random coatings at his dick's discretion. Now that Jared had made what was one of the bigger releases of your life look like a \"casual Tuesday\" he began to regain his breath and said, \"Sorry about that man,\" with a smile that told you he wasn't the least bit sorry, as his cock continued to quietly drip spunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'll bet, now I really do need to shower,\" you said standing back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne shower later, a considerably longer time spent trying to get clean spent for yourself because of Jared, you wrapped a towel around your waist and left the bathroom. Walking back to the bedroom to get dressed you saw Jared was reclining on the couch watching television, predictably, still entirely nude. Closing the bedroom door behind you you wondered aloud, \"How am I going to survive all this...\" as you dressed for the day, still clueless as to why your sister's dude-bro, albeit only slightly, boyfriend was an otter, why despite all his \"it's not gay\"-ness he wanted to jack off with you, and most of all why on Earth such a thing had to happen to you. Emerging again, stubbornly refusing to let anything impede your vacation, now fully dressed and determined to face the day you saw that...</span></div></div>",

And when you asked him if he wanted to wear any more clothes he just shook his head and told you that he liked the feeling of the fur on his changed body. And he also felt that a lot of clothes would make him feel uncomfortable in the heat outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough after you gave it some thought you found yourself agreeing with him as it made sense. But you did have him promise to at least put on some sort of underwear and shorts and some kind of shirt if the two of you would go anywhere. After you had suggest this the huge otter let out a sigh and agreed to doing this. But along with this he asked, \"So what did you want to do today anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused you place a hand underneath your hcin as you replied, \"Well I'm not sure honestly I more so just thinking of going and renting some movies or something for the next few days. But other then that I hadn't planned anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, okay. Well I'll wait for you here then.\" Jared said, before he got up and walked into one of the rooms. Once he got out he then handed you his wallet and added, \"But here take my wallet along with you just in case you need more money or want to get more food for us while you're out.\" You then found yourself blushing when he winked at you and ended with, \"Just think of it as me helping you out, buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um thanks, Jared...\" You let out, before you stood and grabbed your things and then left the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour or so later you pulled back up to the cabin. And after you had turned off your car, grabbed your haul of movies of the passenger seat, and opened your trunk to get th 2 liters that you had gotten for both yourself and Jared you heard the front door open along with some footsteps heading towards you. But you knew it was Jared as he aske,d \"Hey, bud, need some help with anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that'd be great.....\" You answered back handing him the soft drinks, before you turned aorund found yourself trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason for this was because the anthro otter who was now staying with you was wearing.......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following day you gathered your things and made tracks for your cabin. When you arrived however there was a bizarre tattered package on the stoop. Getting out of your car and walking through the splendor of nature, a small clearing alive with the chirping of birds and dotted with wildflowers with a petite lake beside the cabin, you made your way to retrieve the package. Examining the cardboard remains you found the top removed and a staggering amount of different languages among the box's labels, Japanese, Russian, French, was that Cantonese, and many more. It didn't even appear the package was even addressed to you...or anyone, \"Weird...\" you thought before hearing a voice coming from the cabin. Abruptly dropping the box you cautiously opened the front door and were stunned silent to see two very strange looking and very nude men \"Hello\" the smaller one said with a wave and...a tail swish? The next thing you knew your head hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later your eyes fluttered open to see a large raccoon...man...and an even larger skunk...person sitting over you. Sitting up, realizing the two had moved you to your bed, you asked \"Who the hell are you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...um...how do I even answer that?\" the raccoon asked back, the skunk nodding in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>mean</i> what are your names?\" you clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two exchanged a look before the raccoon said \"I guess we don't have any...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking first to the raccoon, taking note of the athletic build of the raccoon, his well developed arms covered in a light brown fur that progressively darkened further down to his hands. Hefty pectorals seated above a practically chiseled six pack all draped in a cream white fur that lead up to a similarly colored face barring a signature black mask-like pattern around his amber eyes, accompanied by two black pointed ears and a few small brown spikes of hair atop his head. A bushy brown tail casually flicked behind him, ringed with black stripes, just above a thick pair of tan well muscled legs, between which sat an enormous cream sheath above two heavy cream colored testicles. Becoming aware of just how long you'd been staring you offered, \"Hmm, what do you think of the name Roger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger? Roger...Roger!\" he said \"I like it! I'll be Roger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving to the skunk you found a behemoth of a man absolutely bathed in black fur, muscles positively heaving from his monstrous arms coming to form tremendous peaks. The bone white fur on his massive jutting pectorals and phenomenal eight pack offsetting the black. A kind black furred head sat above the massive torso, housing soft green eyes and two black rounded ears with white interiors all beneath a mop of black hair with a single shock of white. Behind him was a long white stripe leading to massive, nigh heart shaped, tail on which the stripe split apart then curled together adding to the heart aesthetic. Beneath the tail was two tree trunk like black thighs that were either side of a preposterously enormous black sheath above two orange size white balls. Again realizing the duration of your leer you suggested, after an admittedly childish thought crossed your mind, \"What about Pete?\" The skunk quietly pondered than name for a moment before returning an apprehensive look. \"Alright, what about Peter?\" After considering the addendum for a moment the skunk opened his eyes and nodded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...now forgive my bluntness, but What. The. Hell?!\" you demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you, come on,\" Roger said, grabbing your arm and pulling you out of your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow standing beside the two of them you realized Roger was several inches taller than you, probably around 6 foot 2 inches, while Peter loomed over the both of you at what you guessed was 8 feet tall. Making your way into the common area of the cabin Roger began fishing between the couch cushions before producing a green entirely label-less bottle. \"We both drank whatever this stuff was,\" Roger explained \"It was in the box outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...ok...I guess, but how come Peter is so much bigger?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple,\" Roger said, matter of factly, \"the damn pig drank nearly all of it himself.\" Peter though seemed rather unfazed by the provocation as he simply turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Riiiight</i>\" you said, somewhat dissatisfied with the answer you'd gotten, \"Well since you guys are here would you...</span></div></div>",

But could you guys put some clothes on or something?\" But upon realizing what you were asking of them you quickly remembered that both anthros wouldn't have any clothes. And you had doubts that anyone who had used the cabin before he left any clothes behind. So you quickly start to walk towards the front door when you added on with, \"After I bring in my things of course since I'm sure I have something that both of you guys could wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I don't see any issues with that.\" Roger happily replied, before you saw him look over at the huge skunk. Once he had done this he continued, \"What do you think Peter, does that sound fine to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question caused you to look over at the skunk who just looked at you for a moment before he quickly looked with a blush of embarrassment on his face as he let out, \"Yeah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Then I'll be right back.\" You told the two, to which you then went outside and unpacked your things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh of content after you had spent about ten minutes to unpacked your clothes form your suitcase and then putting them away in various dressers or hanging them up in the closet. After that you then put the food and drinks that you had brought into the kitchen as well. And thankfully neither of these things took that long to do thanks to both Roger and Peter helping you out every now and again. And speaking the two anthro guys you began to wonder how they were doing getting some of your underwear and pants on after you had cut out a hole for their tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as if on cue you saw the two enter the living room again both wearing only clothes to cover up the lower parts of their bodies while keeping the upper parts of their bodies bare. Although considering how much muscle both of them had you figured that they would do that to begin with. And upon looking over at Roger first you saw that he was wearing a pair of your shorts, but they were pretty skin tight on him. In fact they seemed to be showing off both the outlines of his large bulge and backside very well. You were pretty sure that you could even see the outline of the pair of underwear that he was wearing underneath the shorts as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when you turned your attention over to Peter, you found your blush growing an even darker shade of red. The reason for this was because the anthro skunk seemed to only be wearing a pair of your underwear that looked tighter on him then what your clothes looked to be on Roger. And when Peter turned to readjust himself you saw that the back of underwear was pretty wedged in-between both of his large and muscled cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once you looked away and had calmed down you found yourself asking the two if they were....</span></div></div>",

Admittedly you were no master chef or grand connoisseur of life's finer pursuits so you began to fry some burgers, but at least you <i>could</i> cook. Toiling away in the kitchenette you conversed with Roger about what his and Peter's life's were like before today as Peter sagely nodded along. For the most part you'd stayed grounded in the conversation, but once or twice, almost burning lunch in the process, you got a little to fixated on just how skimpy your shorts looked on Roger, on you they'd be considered somewhat lose fitting, but clamped tightly around the raccoon's buttocks and crotch they looked more like short shorts. The situation with Peter was far and away more...<i>exaggerated</i>, as all he'd dared to put on was a single pair of your briefs, but considering how tightly they'd fit it may be more apropos to think the briefs a thong, like trying to jam a full salami into a coin purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally moving to once more brush aside such lewd observations, you began to serve lunch to your new companions. In the final account both you and Roger had enjoyed two burgers each, but Peter hand positively wolfed down the remaining four, and something told you that he probably could have kept going. \"Told you he was a pig,\" Roger remarked, with Peter repaying the comment by silently flipping him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to lean back and think, you pondered just how you found yourself here. After all this wasn't actually remotely possible, yet there they sat, a gabby jock of a raccoon and a stoic monolith of skunk. Well if this was what you received in exchange for your solace it wasn't exactly a bad trade. The two soon stood with contented sighs and made their ways to the common area, Peter heading for the couch and Roger landing in a recliner. Deciding it prudent to join them you first gathered the plates and deposited them in the sink before you made your way over. However as you walked, mind elsewhere, your foot got caught on a lip in the carpet and you began to tumble forwards. Both Roger and Peter immediately sprang to try and catch you, but as fate would have it you gracelessly flew at Peter. Blindly flailing forwards you tried to grab at any number of things before you heard a tear and with a gentle thud you fell on to the skunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You ok?\" Peter asked briefly, sounding a little flustered himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all right I just feel stupid as hell,\" you confessed lifting your head to find yourself feeling dumber yet as you realized, having clumsily torn the fabric away in your fumbling, you'd just fallen face first into the skunk's groin, excellent!</span></div></div>",

And upon reaching the living area of the cabin you found yourself blushing once again when you saw that both Roger and Peter were wearing speedos. However, the raccoon's was a red one that fit him perfectly. While Peter on the other hand was wearing a hot pink speedo that seemed to fit him, but to where the back seemed to be wedged in-between the skunk large and muscled cheeks. But as to not stare for that long of time you and the three headed out the door and walked towards the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the lake though you found yourself spending time with...</span></div></div>",

Walking along the weather beaten planks you couldn't help but admire that Roger's rather form fitting speedo left <i>just enough</i> to the imagination as he was suddenly air bound. All of the raccoon's tight muscles convulsed in a splendorous display and the more than hefty bulge at his crotch bounced wildly while your mind seemed to slow down time simply to enjoy the sight before an inevitable splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cannonball!\" you shouted out before jumping in yourself, secretly hoping more stolen glances were in your future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Roger said as you splashed beside him \"Watch out...uh...wait do we name you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh! No, no, no, my parents beat you to the punch, I guess I forgot to say my name is Josh,\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh huh?\" the raccoon considered. \"Yeah that sounds good.\" he said treading water beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad it meets with your approval,\" you said with a chuckle before taking a breath and diving beneath the water's surface. When you opened your eyes you nearly lost the breath you'd previously found as you again witnessed the beautifully sculpted form of Roger all offset by his short brown and cream fur swaying in the water's ebb and flow, in an unexpectedly beautiful dance. With a sudden sputter you realized you'd spent your whole allotment of air simply ogling your fellow swimmer and promptly surfaced to be met with a knowing glance from Roger, whom you suspected knew exactly what you'd been doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I need to burn some energy,\" Roger said and abruptly took off like a shot to preform laps around the small lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft to tread water in the proverbial dust you just got conformation that, as if you didn't know, if Roger hadn't been a normal raccoon before he'd likely have been a jock, and an ADHD one at that. For a while you allowed yourself to frolic without a care in the world as if the weirdest thing to ever happen hadn't happened to you today, but before long a shadowy figure silently sliced through the water, obscured by the lake's shimmering veneer. You didn't realize until far too late that such a being was in direct pursuit of yourself right up until with a swift jerking movement you felt your trunks slide away \"Jesus Christ!\" you yelled in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger then surfaced in front of you holding your stolen swimsuit, whilst you desperately tried to cover yourself, and innocently asked \"So why are yours so different?\" genuinely curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be-be-because they are! Now give them back!\" you stammered, not the least bit in the mood to explain fashion to the former animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? All right...\" Roger said casually tossing the trunks to you, unfazed by and unconcerned by your need for modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter slipping the bathing suit back on you noticed the hue of the light outside as the world was swiftly becoming bathed in orange light. Deciding sunset marked as good a time as any you decided to call it a day and swam back out to shore, gesturing for Roger to follow. When you retrieved your towel you were stunned silent to see Peter comfortably napping, but it wasn't the napping so much as the...monolith...of barely contained skunk that surprised you. Roger then caught up to you and, with an undignified little kick, woke Peter up explaining you were going to be heading back inside. When back in the cabin you bolted for your room, not only to change but to try and catch your breath as Roger's kick had done absolutely nothing to affect the skunk's...mood...considering Peter was now walking around shamelessly erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking your time to compose yourself before stepping out of your room you coincidentally stepped out at the same moment as Roger, who'd apparently decided to change of his own volition. Letting the raccoon pass before you you couldn't help but again appreciate how your normally unfortunate, as regards fashion, jean shorts hugged Roger like a pair of Daisy Dukes that was one size too small. All attention though was swiftly placed on Peter as he, still hard as ever, asked \"Dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Sure thing big guy,\" you said, grappling to distract yourself with the task at hand, apparently their \"having been common animals only hours ago\" also meant they didn't give a rat's ass about concealing boners either. Twenty odd minutes later you served...something...truth be told it was all a haze and for all you knew you just cooked a box of detergent. Grateful that the final barrier between you and your sanctuary was removed you feigned a yawn and said \"While I think I'm ready for bed,\" before making your way to the bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way the Peter stood up and clasped your hand and sheepishly asked, \"Can I come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlabbergasted you didn't quite know what to say, but as you looked into the Skunk's soft eyes you gave a nod and said \"...Alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Peter?\" Roger chided from the couch, \"What's the point of being so big if you still need someone to hold your hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly ignoring the raccoon Peter, now leading you, opened up your room and sat on the bed. Doing your damnedest to ignore the aroused hunk in your bed you prepared for the night, slipping on a pair of pajama bottoms and discarding your t-shirt. Laying down on the bed yourself you caught the briefest glimpse of Peter's pitch-black length straining against it's pink prison, his obscenely thick and absurdly long shaft was actually exposed at the base as his erection was so massive it actually held the speedo an inch or so out from his body. Quickly though you were wrapped in two comforting warm arms as Peter rolled on his side and held you close. It was long before the sensation soothed you to the brink of sleep, but right before your brain ceased function for the day you felt an additional body join the bed. You didn't even need to open your eyes to know who it was, not that you could, as another set of burly arms enveloped you, Roger's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a night of bliss, held close by two dreamboats...</span></div></div>",

This was made even more clear when you opened your eyes and saw his two huge white furred pecs in the entire line of sight. But while you and Peter still laid in bed together you thought you heard some clanking noises like that of weights being lifted up and down. This prompted you to noticed right away that Roger wasn't in the bed anymore, which mean that he must be up. Not only that, but he must have been inside of the small workout room that the cabin had. Although from what you remembered there wasn't a huge amount of weigh equipment in there. But from the sounds of it didn't seem like that was a problem for the heavily muscled raccoon, whom you could hear let out a grunt every now and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you gently removed yourself from Peter's hold, which wasn't all that hard considering he was in a pretty deep sleep. After doing this you got dressed and decided to head towards the workout room, but not before gently closing the bedroom door so the huge skunk could continue to sleep. You then made your way to the room the workout equipment was in and not to your surprise the door was wide open.

Roger's fresh pump was clearly getting to the both of you as your heart was fluttering absurdly fast and the raccoon was out and out erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Roger was standing in front of you with only an inch between you, if that, cock standing rigid against his six pack and he offered \"You know, you can feel if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly you were shocked your head didn't simply fall off at the proposal \"Umm...I...are you...\" you blubbered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing your hand in one of his strong confident paws, Roger placed your hand on his chest and said, \"Trust me, I want this.\" With that the raccoon let your hand go free as you brought up your other hand and began to massage his pectoral muscles. Enthralled in the feeling Roger began moaning softly as you felt his body tremble slightly, overtaken by pleasure. You began to move your hands elsewhere, in seek of more muscles to grope, but Roger gave you pause when he put his hand beneath your chin and tilted your head upwards before planting a deep impassioned kiss on your lips. For a moment you just stared like deer in headlights, lost in those deep amber eyes, before closing your eyes and returning your masked partner's kiss and letting your hands dance along his firm sculpted back. Roger's moans became more fervored as your tongues grappled with each other until finally your hands found their way to a sculpted behind and, in a moment of daring, grabbed hold. With that Roger let out and undignified \"eep\" into your mouth before you felt the kiss break and the raccoon released a guttural moan as his member relieved itself all over your nightshirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...sorry...phew,\" Roger said with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" you said, pulling the shirt off ,eager to get your own relief, however what you saw when the shirt no longer obscured your view was Roger abruptly fall back onto the floor. \"Are you okay?!\" you asked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger though, seated on his ample behind, simply let his eyes roll back and with a moan more intense than any that preceded it affirmed, \"Absolutely, this feels <i>incredible</i>...\" and with that his body began expanding. The raccoon's muscles grew slightly more dense and his penis seemed to engorge rather than deflate as his head rose higher and his body became thicker while his bushy tail swished behind him. When Roger finally stood you immediately felt the changes yourself as he now stood around 6 foot 9 inches, and though he still was nowhere close to Peter's monstrous bulk you couldn't help but feel a similar intimidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world was that...\" you trailed of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea,\" Roger admitted chipperly, \"But it was awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you just stared as the raccoon flexed and admired his new bulk, but as if suddenly hit by a truck a thought rang out in your head \"What if he grew because he came?\" \"Hey Roger,\" you started to say, as your subconscious screamed that it may be to dangerous a secret to share, \"What if you grew because...well...\" you embarrassedly pointed to your discarded shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I came on you?\" he asked quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I doubt it has anything to do with the \"on me\" part, but what if that bottle did this?\" you posited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait I thought it change me and Peter into <i>this</i>,\" Roger said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if it's also causing this,\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...</span></div></div>",

Growing concerned both you and Roger decided to go and see if Peter was alright, however as soon as you opened the door you were greeted with a loud snap and something slapping you in the face. When you peeled the mystery assailant from your eyes you discovered it was the skunk's pink speedo. You were going to inquire as to why Peter had literally tore off and thrown his only piece of semi-fitting attire, but you got your answer when you saw the skunk very much had something else he was interested in, the biggest erection you'd seen in your life. Apparently Peter had decided absolutely nothing would get between him and his large black monument to masculinity as he gripped his length with both hands and began masturbating with a ludicrous fervor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter...?\" you said, a bit lost for words when the skunk just continued fapping with increasing gusto not even realizing you'd spoken let alone entered the room with Roger, who was content to just watch the show. The skunk had fully entered what could only be described as a frenzy as he moaned, grunted, and roared with pleasure, now jerking so hard the he was literally bouncing up off of the bed at times. It didn't take long before such...<i>impassioned</i>...efforts yielded results as Peter's hips began to buck, wildly muscles flexing and contracting with effort, and toes curling as his cock began violently erupting with such force he was actually hitting the ceiling with some of his seed. Both you and Roger just stood in awe, hard as all get out, staring at the behemoth that just did...<i>that</i>... covered now in his own juices when a sudden rumbling sound began emanating from Peter and you suddenly remembered what had happened with Roger. \"Oh fuck!\" you said, before rushing to Peter's side and trying to help him stand up so you could lead him outside. \"Roger quick come help me,\" you asked trying, with limited success, to help brace the wobbly legged skunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help what?\" Roger asked confused, Peter looking to the both of you all the more confused as to why he was being denied his afterglow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember what happen when you...yah know,\" you tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure,\" the raccoon replied, \"but that was only a few inches. I don't see what the big deal is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was definitely more that \"a few\" inches, but there wasn't time for that so you just pointed out, \"Yeah, but you didn't freaking rumble and I've got a feeling this is gonna be big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright,\" Roger said, finally lifting Peter's other side and helping you get him outside. Mercifully you made it out of the bedroom without incident, but as you approached the front door Peter stopped trembling and began growing. By the time you and Roger tried squeezing him through he was already 10 feet tall and, after considerable effort, when he was out he had grown to 12 feet and was continuing to rise. Now free to grow uninhibited you and Roger let the skunk sit down on the ground where he continued to grow until he was 16 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I told you this was gonna be big,\" you told the raccoon, unable to resist an I told you so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh believe me, I see,\" Roger said with a mix of lust and jealousy in his voice, eyes firmly glued on Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter, for all his trouble, seemed to still be in a bit of a daze as he decided to lay down for now and try to clear his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a bit bad about pestering the confused giant so soon you decided it would be best to try and figure out what to do now instead of letting the problem fester. \"So Peter, I don't you'll fit in the cabin anymore so what to you want to do?\"</span></div></div>",

But while you did this both of you were unaware that Roger had taken off into the forest. And once the huge raccoon was far enough away he removed his make shift Daisy Dukes and underwear and then sat underneath tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then reached out to his member with a shaking hand.

This caused you to become a bit concerned as you hoped he wouldn't get himself into any type of trouble. However, before you could bring this up you felt yourself being gently picked up by one of Peter's huge hands. You then saw nothing but white as you were gently pressed up against the right pec of the heavily muscled anthro skunk. Once this happened you heard him let out another sigh before he softly let out, \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, big guy. Besides on the upside Roger and I were able to get you out of the cabin before you outgrow it.\" You replied, in a attempt to calm his nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess that's true....\" Peter softly told you, to which you then felt one of his fingers gently rub the back of your head. You then heard him sigh again when he added, \"I'm just sad since now we can't share a bed together anymore..... It was nice being able to hold someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this prompted you to blush as you stuttered out, \"O-Oh, well if you need company then I'm more then happy to sleep outside with you, big guy. I mean I might get cold, but that's a small price to pay to make you more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise you felt a bit of pressure form the skunk's huge hand as he pressed up against his massive pec. And while he did he told you, \"don't worry, I'd make sure you kept warm all throughout the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you found yourself blushing upon hearing Peter's words. And so you attempted to hug the skunk's pec as best as you could before you said, \"Thanks, Peter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after you had said this to him though the sweet moment between the two of abruptly stopped when you heard some approaching footsteps. And once you had turned around to where your back was up against Peter's pec instead you saw Roger walking back towards the two of you. however, after getting a closer look at the raccoon you soon saw that he had grown....</span></div></div>",

Besides it's not exactly a basket of roses for Peter you know, he can't even fit inside anymore,\" you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not like we ever lived indoors before now anyway,\" the raccoon grumbled. \"Some dudes just get all the luck,\" but this thought was kept to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way I think it's a good idea if from now on you guys kept your...uh...<i>activity</i> to a minimum, preferably nothing at all,\" you put forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, whaaatever,\" the raccoon unconvincingly agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Peter nodded, betraying the faintest bit of concern that his ferocious libido may make such a task easier said than done.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the crisis passed your day was free to start in earnest, hopefully today you could still manage to actually relax...some. Thankfully neither Roger nor Peter seemed keen to stand in your way which actually allowed you to make some fair headway in one of the many novels on the back burner, your armchair however was moved outside, with the help of Roger, to keep Peter from feeling left out. The raccoon had mostly just puttered about and occasionally went inside to use the small weight room, Peter though was all but refusing to leave your side, damn near curled at your feet like a dog. When lunch rolled around you were pleasantly surprised to find that neither of they guys seemed to require any more food then they had previously, that was good considering you'd been dwelling more and more on the potential appetite of a sixteen foot behemoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards you were going to return to your book, but the sudden disappearance of Roger put a stop to that. For a few minutes you a Peter looked about for him until the undeniable sound and scent of \"jacking it\" hit you like a truck. Having successfully found the greedy raccoon and stopping his lust for a size he didn't have you were feeling like playing nanny was going to be more than just a chore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe encounter though had had an enormous effect on Peter as once the smell had permeated his nose the skunk couldn't help but get hard. He assured you nothing would come of it, he'd do his best to resist, and truthfully he did, but him walking around with a monstrous pitch black erection was more than a sight to behold. By the time dusk rolled around you were heading back outside after fetching some blankets to bring outside for the night, when you saw the skunk's throbbing member, that simply refused to die down, had created a puddle of pre beneath it. Trying to control yourself, for both your sake and their's, you did your best to ignore it before cuddling up to Peter's massive bulk. The camp out literally underway you wished both a goodnight and tried to bury your head in the skunk's pecs without sending him over the edge.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake slowly to the sound of a deep and throaty moan followed by a quaking shiver running through the makeshift bed you had made of Peter's torso. Shifting your body slightly and pushing against the skunk's soft yet immensely strong furry pecs you look up at his face. Eyes closed and lightly snoring, though his brow furrowed and he slightly bit his plush lower lip as yet another needy moan formed in his throat, clearly whatever he was dreaming was not helping him control his libido one bit! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's worse is that he seems even bigger than how you remember him! Granted your perspective of body sizes has been challenged lately, but you definitely remember being able to hug halfway across his chest. Now as you stretch out your arms you find your wrists reaching just past the skunk's shelf-like pecs! So, did he cum during your sleep?? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Mmmmmmhh...* Peter groaned in his sleep and flexed his abs against you, massaging your own stiffening dick in a way you never even imagined possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith how horny he still seems could he have... Well yes, you quickly realize, knowing the skunk's insatiable libido he would definitely be horny no matter how hard he came during the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut having seen the intensity of Peter's orgasm 8 whole feet ago it's impossible that you could have slept through such an event. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit up with your legs across his waist, you let out a quiet yelp as your naked feet splash into something wet and viscous, squelching between your toes. Looking down at the culprit you notice a stream of pre flowing thickly across the tiles of your patio as, from the corner of your eye, you notice the source. Drawn by the movement of a thick dollop of semitransparent pre that splashed audibly into the pool below, you look up and up till you find the tip of Peter's huge ebony dick. The taut skin glistening in the morning sun as it trembles and drools another handful of preseed down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy... shit...\" you sit in quiet awe as you realize just how big the skunk has gotten since yesterday. Sure, you had sent it plenty of glances at every opportunity most of yesterday evening but out of courtesy never stared as you did now. And stare you did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meaty cylinder that rose from his strained sheath had more girth than your torso and supplied with blood by veins wider than a garden hose. From the thick base, it stretched and somehow grew even wider before narrowing slightly towards the glans nearly three feet above your head. You realized if you were to stand on Peter rather than sit as you were now, you would only just reach it! It shone beautifully in the light and bathed the area in an intensely arousing musk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely registered your own lust as your own throbbing cock could stand it no longer and shot an impressive, for you, load right into Peter's chin! You gasped and tried to suppress your own moan as a second rope launched slightly higher and as if in slow motion tumbled straight onto the skunk's lips. You whimpered as you finally managed to turn your dick away, proceeding to add your load to the growing pool of preseed below, like a drop would be added to the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... nonono..\" you stared as a large pink tongue swept up your cum from those full lips. Peter's eyes finally opened. The skunk blinked and seemed to roll something around in his mouth before swallowing audibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh? ... What happened, did you just...\" The skunk's eyes peered intently at you along the cleavage in his own pecs. You were afraid of where this sentence might go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really had hoped you'd like me back! And now I see you do!\" He beamed a large smile as you heard and felt an exceptionally large splash of pre crash into the tiles next to him. \"Hrrf.. and you taste so goooood...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter.\" you started. \"It was an accident, please. If you cum now who knows what might happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?!\" You heard from behind you and peered over your shoulder, and then sideways to glance behind the tower of virility that was blocking your view. It was Roger. The raccoon was thankfully no larger than yesterday, but that seemed to be the main reason he was upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. Wait. You tell me that I can't cum because I'll grow, like that would be a bad thing, and then you two go at it out here without me? And look at you Peter, you're at least 20 feet now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait, Roger that's not what happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, two can play at that game\" Roger smirked and ripped off the hugely tented speedo that Peter had outgrown yesterday before wrapping both his hands around his dick and jerk off as his life depended on it. You were mesmerized watching his thick muscles pump and flex as he kneaded and stroked along his foot and a half of rigid throbbing raccoonhood. It took nearly no time before he clenched all his muscles at once and his grapefruit-sized balls squeezed up against his taint. You just manage to wonder if Rogers balls were that big yesterday before a volley of creamy cum splattered loudly against Peter's hips. There was some force behind each cumshot, as you felt when the raccoon's lack of aim sent a fat stream against you, pelting your side and drenching you in his warm cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Peter stared in awe as Roger painted you both in his seed. Only snapping out of it as he panted and dripped what remained in his fat balls onto the ground at his feet. \"Oh man... This is gonna be good!\" He giggled and struck a pose for you as his body started to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of groaning filled the air as the raccoon's legs packed on another 20 pounds of pure muscle. Thick cords of muscle rolled across his thighs, pushing his slightly deflated balls further forward before his thighs lengthened to fit and pushed Rogers head up another few inches. The same happened all across his body, pushing him wider, taller, bigger in little spurts all while Roger's moaning let you know just how pleasurable it was to grow. As it ended the raccoon stood at nearly 11 feet tall, panting and still fully boned with a dick that reached halfway up his own chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow what a ride!\" Roger huffed as he traced a finger down his new and improved cock. \"And I really grew this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right, his previous attempts had been nothing compared to what you just witnessed. Maybe the longer you go without cumming the bigger the result? The thought sent a shiver down your spine because what would that mean for when Peter could no longer fight his mounting urges...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The direness of the situation could not be understated as you were slowly realized just how aroused Peter was becoming. Between Roger's display and your...lapse in judgement...you could easily understand why the skunk was becoming increasingly worked up, but if your theory held true his growth could be anywhere from monumental to cataclysmic. \"P-Peter, I know it's hard, but you've got to try and hold back,\" you desperately coached, with the grim realization his eyes had all but rolled back in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph, <i>Jooosshh</i>,\" he breathily moaned, \"I'm trying, b-but I don't know how long I can last, <i>aaahh</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Peter, I know you can fight it,\" you tried to encourage, but your heart began to sink when you saw he was progressively inching taller, packing on more and more mass, at an increasing speed just from the fountain of pre emanating from his aggravated member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ah, Josh, ha, I'm <i>sooooorrrryyyy</i>,\" he bellowed before placing he meaty hands on his length and succumbing to endless waves of pleasure. In only moments he'd begun spurting torrential amounts of spunk, the first volley of which rocketed out with such speed and force it hit Roger smack dab in the chest and nearly forced the raccoon to his knees. After only the first spurt the ground trembled as the skunk rose to double his size in mere moments before unleashing yet more creamy devastation on the shrinking forest. His next blast had not the speed and utter urgency of the first, but purely in terms of volume it dwarfed it's predecessor as a wall of seed was loosed from the cock he so eagerly pumped. Peter's ascension was so quick this time, so utterly desperate to explode with size, that the seconds he'd taken to double before now seemed like an eternity as his monstrous body crashed through anything and everything with the only things being spared, ironically, being that which was between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate for it to be over you looked to Roger for something, anything, but all the raccoon could do, and had done several times, was climax himself. He now stood an otherwise imposing fifteen feet tall, but with a wall of black fur on either side of you it was difficult to find anything else intimidating. \"Wh-What should we do?\" you nervously stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy it,\" Roger said plainly with his eyes glued skyward as he began to fap yet again, wanting to squeeze out every ounce of enjoyment he could, \"He sure is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar overhead the mayhem continued as the skunk roared wildly again and again as he unleashed his tsunami of sperm that never seemed to end. Growing with seldom a pause he gained tremendous amounts of muscle and his erection lengthened as well now reaching as high as his head and making him all the more lustful. Completely lost to his libido the colossus next, while still pumping, plunged his mouth on the virile head of his ebony monstrosity, with explosive results. In no time at all cum was flooding from his lips, raining down below, as he greedily swallowed as much of it as he could manage without drowning himself. It was no longer practical to even attempt to keep track of his size, because whatever it had been he was sure to eclipse it in another moment. While he grew his testicles, now each far larger than the gigantic size he'd been a minute ago, seemed to provide an unending amount of product as he painted more and more of the woodlands white. The skunks own package was now growing so large it was fighting its was out of his mouth with increasing success, until it was again free to mercilessly unleash on the rest of the world. Peter's dimensions now were, like the entirety of the situation, unfathomable as he lay back, causing tremendous earthquakes, and let his unending orgasm rain down upon him from a tool now so massive it was his equal in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrayer seemed the only thing left in your arsenal as Peter was easily many hundreds of feet tall, if not thousands. It somehow seemed wrong to beg for any beings appeasement other than this godly skunk's, so you did just that and by some miracle of miracles, or far more likely a coincidence of Brobdingnagian proportions, his escapades finally came to a stop. Both you and Roger, now looming over you at a spent twenty feet tall, were utterly dripping with potent skunk juices, as was the rest of the landscape, while the gargantuan beast himself remained on his back and panted with a ferocious cadence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no telling what might come of a situation so otherworldy, so beyond impossible, but even if you had been capable of cogent thought you'd have stopped dead in your tracks when a ungodly shadow enveloped you. Mustering every ounce of your will you forced yourself to look up and were met with...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You took a deep breath as the world seemed to be spinning. Your perspective of these events and your feeling of control was challenged so much so rapidly that you felt like just fainting on the spot and waking up in your warm bed, realizing it was just the most vivid and hot wet dream in history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of wet dream you had definitely orgasmed again while watching Peter's incredible ascension... At least once. Looking down at yourself, however, there was no way to tell because you were absolutely covered in a thick layer of musky skunk cum that had washed away anything you might have produced, and you hadn't even been in the line of fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking toward the forest you saw that Peter's torso now stretched far in between the trees, felling them like dominoes around the skunk's broad torso, more falling even as the giant's heavy breathing expanded his chest massively, as he slowly came down from the ordeal. Beyond the resting hill of black and white fur, was the natural hill of the that you'd often hiked across back when coming out to the cabin actually meant peace and quiet, but that hill was no longer it's natural green. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong thick ropes of off-white seed glistened on the treetops. On the few trees sturdy enough to withstand the absolute torrent of the skunk's godlike orgasm. Most of the trees had broken from the sheer power of the seed getting shot out of Peter's dick and now floated, broken, in the flowing stream of white that covered the forest floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE HOUSE!\" The logical part of your mind screamed at you, slowly becoming more audible as if coming out of a shock. You turned and saw that while Peter had thankfully moved his legs above the house, a sight you admittedly admired for a little while, his fat balls had crushed the outer wall with their incredible weight and pushed their way into the living room. The round fuzzy orbs spanned the entire height of the cabin and nearly one and a half times that wide as they condensed against the patio. A true testament to their weight that they easily tore through the heavy wooden planks and held the roof aloft and the tightness of the balls that they hadn't sagged more than they did. You heard a loud gurgle as Peter's nuts grew a couple of inches bigger in all directions, breaking apart more of the walls as they started loading up the horny skunk for another round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the sounds of your slowly crumbling house you could hear the wet fapping of a certain raccoon behind you. He was moaning and blushing furiously as he gazed at his gigantic friend and came once more, wheezing as his abused cock fired blanks, clearly overused and this time, though over 25 feet tall, Roger barely grew at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! How does he do that?!\" The raccoon panted and sat down in the puddles of cum, still looming over you as you stood there. \"He's cum twice now and I can barely even look above his hips... While he's lying down!\" Roger whined and pouted his lips almost adorably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can... Explain..\" You started as you felt the ground rumble and crack beneath your feet. You feared the worst as a shadow rose to blot out the sun entirely across the cabin. Looking back you noticed that Peter had sat up, rivers of seed ran down his matted fur and spilled across the contours of his abs like a literal waterfall. If anything it made the overgrown skunk looked more like a living mountain than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger? ... And Josh?! Thank goodness you're okay!\" the giant spoke, his voice was scarily deep but still felt young and innocent. \"I really grew this much?\" Peter said in shock, as you looked up at his face rising nearly 100 feet straight up in the air. His blue eyes were wide with fear, not for himself but for his friend and secret crush down below, and you felt your heart leap in your chest as you gazed back into his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the destruction his balls were causing to the cabin the titanic skunk apologized and lifted himself up, muscle shifting and tensing across his body as thousands of tons of masculine brawn lifted itself up. As the cement truck-sized balls pulled out from the wall it caused part of the roof that had been resting on them to come crashing down, making the giant blush and apologize even more profusely. It was odd to see such a god of a man being so bashful, but also very endearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of the demolished wall, the patio was in a similarly bad state, as two wide round indents several feet deep showed Peter's round bubble butt as a permanent new landscaping feature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter leaned knelt down some distance away and leaned over, bringing his face down closer to you. You nearly forgot to breathe. He had seemed huge yesterday, then gigantic as he rested along the ground, but now, looking up at a couple of eyes each bigger than your whole body, he was something else - something beyond words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter leaned in closer and closer, his lush lips pursed as he planted a kiss across your whole body, pushing you deep into his unbelievably soft and pliable lips. You felt amazing as without thinking you kissed back against the giant skunk that wrapped your body in his love. After the most intimate moment in your entire life, Peter pulled back, slowly releasing you from his kiss \"Mmmh...\"I wanted to do that ever since I first saw you...\" He blushed even more and continued \"I guess I had to do it... While I still can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at Roger who, for a moment, seemed to have forgotten about his desires for growth and wiped a tear from his eyes as he smiled down at you. A smile you quickly returned. Was it not for the chaos and the promise of more growth soon to come this would be the happiest day of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter's face changed from one of pure bliss of the moment to scared as he realized he might actually be a danger to Josh and Roger. \"I'm so sorry Josh, what should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh...\" Roger started, rubbing the back of his head \"you said you might be able to explain why Peter grows so much more than me? Maybe we can start there?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well...uh...as far as I can tell...\" you stammer started, as a though crossed your mind <i>what would Roger do with this information?</i> Surely he wouldn't do anything crazy right...right? Honestly you didn't know what to believe after all of this, seeing how greedily the raccoon lusted for size had unsettled you for sure and what would happen if he found his way to a size comparable to Peter's...or worse...<i>bigger</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour anxious pondering on what would be the right call here was interrupted when Roger asked \"Um, Yo Josh? You okay?\" confused by your abrupt stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" you started again, still unsure of what to do thanks to the gargantuan cum puddle you were standing in and the gargantuan beast that'd made it. One look up however, and one possible neck sprain from having to crane your neck so far back, made your decision for you when you realized how upset Peter was. The poor sweet skunk titan was so distraught at the though of possibly hurting those he cared for that he looked to be on the verge of tears. \"Okay, so basically what I think happens,\" you paused for a breath, praying you weren't opening Pandora's Box, \"Is when you two, you know, <i>hold back</i> for a while you grow a lot more...<i>like a lot</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so you mean if I just do whack it for a while I'll be as big as Peter?\" the raccoon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no...er kinda...I don't really know, it's just a guess, but if Peter really was...uh...<i>boned</i> since practically yesterday night it would make sense, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? This happened because I'm so freakishly horny?\" the skunk chimed in, or rather involuntarily boomed, voice laden with self-loathing as he eyed the cock that easily matched his size, if not surpassed it a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm not gonna hear that for a second,\" you sharply interjected, \"You are <b>not</b> a freak Peter, you understand me?\" With a wistful chuckle the skunk finally smiled again, however faint, and nodded in affirmation. \"Besides there's nothing to worry about I know you're not a monster so if we're all just extra careful there's no way me and Roger will get hurt,\" you smiled, not betraying that you were trying to convince yourself as well, \"Plus we were already staying outside, so nothing's changed in that respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, right,\" Roger laughed a little, though not cruelly. \"What are we gonna do about <i>alllll</i> of <i>this</i> though,\" he exaggeratedly twirled, gesturing to the \"not-quite-winter\" wonderland state of your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of it,\" Peter answered before looming massively as he leaned down. The massive behemoth, now on his hands and knees, loosed the giant dwarfing tongue from his lips and began lapping at the semen coated terrain. Frankly you had absolutely no idea how he was managing such a task, not the least of which because even at his size there was a beyond copious amount, without orgasming again. Best you could guess it was something along the lines of instinctively associating his actions with grooming, but personally you had to bite your tongue hard enough to damn near pierce it to keep from blowing your wad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everything was more or less cleaned, the odd patch of spunk still persisting, you recalled the tatters of the strange package that had very likely caused all of this. \"Hey Peter, would you mind moving the roof off of the cabin?\" you requested, the ceiling having caved in once the skunk had moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" and with that he flicked it aside like it were no more than a napkin, maybe there'd be some benefits to this after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe structure now cleared you were free to sweep through the ruins for either the box or bottle, desperate for something, anything, to go on no matter how unlikely. Sifting through the wreckage was going to prove somewhat laborious though, and with a flash of realization it occurred to you that that which you seek could have been washed away in Peter's climax, or even licked up in the landscape tongue bath. \"Hey Roger, well I look in here would you mind checking around to see if the box or the bottle you showed me got washed away, you can cover a lot more ground than I can at your size,\" you made sure to stroke his ego, you didn't doubt he'd help but a little insurance never hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get it Josh,\" the raccoon puffed his chest out proudly, \"But what if Peter, ya know, swallowed it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was my next point actually. Hey big guy!\" you shouted up, \"This is gonna sound weird, like super weird, but do you think you could work up a hairball for me?\" Peter just looked at you with bewilderment for a moment before you added, \"It's really important, we may be able to figure this whole situation out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....okay then.....\" he replied before starting to wildly hack and cough, bemused all the same. Roger then took his leave, which left you to sift through the debris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or so of sifting, searching, and sputtering was proving agonizingly fruitless as not a one of you were much better off the when you'd started. Technically Peter hadn't actually coughed anything up yet so you supposed there was still hope on that front as well as the fact Roger could return any minute with the spoils of his trek, but the fact you'd looked nearly everywhere by now was leaving you downcast all the same. In the same instant as you spotted the glint of green glass, sending your heart aflutter, Peter, with a deafening fit of wheezing, finally produced what you'd asked for, though it was significantly less so a \"hair\" ball and more \"soggy mass of dirt, hair, and trees drenched in a musky stench\" ball. First you made for the desired mark of presumed bottle, not exactly eager to sift through the enormous <i>thing</i> Peter had made, even if it was at your request. Your head all but fell of your shoulders when you saw you were destined for the stink pile apparently, because the glass was just the remains of an ordinary beer bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, dusting yourself off, and taking some deep breaths, you made your way out of the cabin, skin crawling at the enormity of the coming task. At least Roger could help when he got back, but the damn thing was even considerably bigger then the raccoon. Mustering all your gumption you plunged your hands in and began to root about. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An hour or so had passed since Peter coughed up that huge hairball of his. And you were quite surprised that Roger hadn't returned yet. And after a few seconds more had passed you soon came to realize that the raccoon had been gone the entire time after this happened. This caused you to worry a little as the anthro racoon could be doing anything. However, after a fre more minutes of silence had passed both you and Peter soon got your answer as you felt the ground underneath you shake for a little bit. This caused the truly massive skunk to react as he quickly grabbed you and held you up against his right pec before he asked out loud to himself, \"What was that??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know...\" You replied, before you felt some more shaking albeit much lighter. This prompted the skunk to slowly stand up and onto his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once he had done this both of you found yourself letting out gasps of pure shock as a truly massive Roger was heading towards the two of you. This prompted your eyes to widen and your mouth to fly open when you saw that the raccoon wasn't just huge like Peter, but he seemed ot be even bigger then he was as he was standing at 150 feet. You then slowly brought your gaze up to the raccoon's face which had a huge grin on it. You then bring up and htne flex one of his massive arms before he asked, \"Hey, guys. So what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger? Why would you do this?...\" Peter asked, as he took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce this happened though you then saw Roger take anotehr forward before you saw him look down at you.And upon doing so you were then gently picked up by two of the raccoon's huge fingers from between Peter's own hand and pec while he remarked back with, \"Is't it obvious Peter? I want to show Josh here what a truly massive stud of a racccon I am. And honestly I couldn't do that back at my early size. But even getting close to your size wasn't enough for me. So I figured why not try and get even bigger then you. And as you can see it worked.\" But as he said this you were placed down into the raccoon's other hand before he turned and began to walk away to whic he then added, \"So if you'll excuse us Peter, Josh and I got some \"fun\" to get to. See in a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that said you then found yourself staring at the raccoon's truly massive body as he headed away form the cabin where Peter just stood now wide eyed again and taken aback in shock again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke up the next morning feeling supriringly quite well rested despite the fact that you used one of Peter's huge pecs as a pillow last night to rest your head on. Although that might of been due to the fact that the muscle was super firm, but the fur was very soft. And as so as you sat up and began to lift your arms and stretch you turned around looked up at the huge skunk when you said, \"Good morning, Peter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had uttered these words you both felt and saw the skunk begin to sit up and also stretch as well as he replied, \"Morning.\" And once he was looking down at you he added, \"I hope you slept okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did.\" You reassured the huge skunk with a big smile on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Peter let out, before you felt one of his huge fingers move over to you and then gently rub the top of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis cuased you to blush and upon looking at the skunk he was blushing too. Sadly this moment of yours was quickly broken when you noticed that a certain raccoon was missing. This caused you to look around as he thought out loud, \"Huh, I wonder where Roger is?....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough a sudden shake of the ground not only caused you to trail off but to somewhat lose your balance. Thankfully Peter quickly took a hold of you to make sure you didn't fall. You then saw him look off in the distance as he placed you on his right shoulder once he had stood up onto his feet and pointed out, \"It seems to be coming form over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then held onto the skunk's neck when he started to carefully walk towards where the shaking was coming from. Although in the back of your mind you feared that you knew what or rather who was causing the ground to shake. Thankfully though it didn't take Peter long to get to where the shaking was coming from as it was in a clearing in the woods. And upon sqinting your eyes a bit you saw that it was Roger like you had assumed it was. However, upon a closer lok the heavily muscled raccoon looked big, like really big. But once Peter had walked up to him you saw that Roger was....</span></div></div>",
