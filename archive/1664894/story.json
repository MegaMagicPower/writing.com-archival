You then see the surface of it glow, then revealing a strange doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA female voice then calls out to you, \"Reeeeeid...\" it says in a singsong tone. You find it way too weird, but you're too curious not to want to go in, as you're rather bored anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon find yourself in what looks strangely like an oriental palace, and there's a real-live Ninetales standing before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, Reid,\" she says with a smile. It sounds like the same voice that called you a minute ago. You're a little freaked out. Not only is there a Pokemon standing in front of you, but she's talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please follow me,\" she then asks. Thinking that you must be dreaming you decide to follow her. You always did like Ninetales, and you figure that if this is your dream then she's likely to be nice to you anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then find yourself in a grandiose throne room, the throne itself having a very large nine-tailed pattern behind it. The Ninetales approaches the throne, then begins faintly glowing as her body begins morphing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst she starts standing upright, then you watch as her forms shifts gently to something more fitting a biped, turning her forelegs into furry arms with hands, giving her a torso more like that of a humans complete with breasts, and finally, a beautiful and elegant cream colored kimono magically appears on her body. The transformation is not yet finished, however. Soon her muzzle flattens down into a simple face and nose, her remaining paws become feet, and all her fur fades into skin, save for the fur on her ears and tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow sitting before you in the throne is a beautiful woman, presumably in her mid-twenties with long light blonde hair and the ears and tails of a Ninetales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be alarmed, Reid. Please, do sit with me and I shall explain everything to you.\" Not being able to turn down a request from one so beautiful, you sit right next to her on her throne. She curls her tails around your back, making for a very comfy cushion as she gives you a light hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know my name?\" you ask her. \"Well, this is a world created from your subconscious. Everything here is likely something you've dreamt about at one point or another, be it daydream, sleeping dream, etc. I am the empress of this little world of ours. I think right now it's best to let you explore things from here on out. Feel free to go wherever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, I would also like to tell you a few other things about this place. This is a land made up entirely of female beings like me. We can switch between any of the three forms you just witnessed at will and we can also change our size to whatever we wish, though most of us stay at normal sizes for whatever current species or form we're in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And before you go...\" she pulls out a map to what appears to be the whole land. \"Take this map, it identifies hotspots and places of interest all over the kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, your highness,\" you then say as you decide to</span></div></div>",

Much like the empress' palace, this place seem to have an oriental flair to it, much like a large city in old Japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the things you notice most about the place are all the people inhabiting it. Everyone is either some sort of talking Pokemon, an anthropomorphic Pokemon, or a girl with the features of a Pokemon, and all the bipeds seem to be wearing kimonos. You see things like girls with Eevee ears talking to female anthro Pikachu and Gardevoirs conversing girls that have ears like an Arcanine and other oddities.

Seems the long walk from the palace is has burned you out some, and luckily there appears to be a sushi bar marked down on the map. You liked sushi; raw fish really tasted good despite what most folk seemed to believe. Even if it could get a little pricey, it was awfully filling when done right, and fresh. As you approach the establishment you see that it's a rather small place overall. Barely twice as big as the door leading in, it stretched down from there in a rectangular shape with a tiny bar built beside the kitchen, and several two to four person booth filling the front half of the bar. Opening the door, you walk in and see that there's only a few girls seated inside at all. Two at the bar, one at a table, and of course the waitress and chef for staff. The chef, an Octillery girl in anthromorph form, waves her a spare hand while the other five work on chopping and preparing dishes. The waitress, in human form and no distinct markings, walks over and bows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome Reid-san. Would you like to dine today with us?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely. I love sushi.\" You reply, smiling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful! Would you like to sit at the bar, or perhaps at a booth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" Looking over the tables again, you note the few patrons again. The lone girl at a table is very thick and obviously bored by the look on her face. There's a big grey spiral horn in the middle of her forehead, which you guess to mean she's either a Rhyhorn or Rhydon. Over at the bar, a Gyarados in anthro form is eating rapidly from a large plate of sushi and a mug as big as her, ahem, big lips. A few stools down from her is a Vaporeon, fully Pokemon, sitting atop a barstool eating a fish slow and carefully. She looks to be the most at peace between the three, with her eyes closed in contentment. \"Do you think they would mind me joining them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, the waitress giggles and gives him a look that says he's silly. \"Of course not!\"</span></div></div>",

As you approach she looks up from her plate of teriyaki beef and blinks in surprise. You smile back, but get the feeling she's not going to say anything. \"Mind if I sit with you?\" She shakes her head and then turns back to her meal. Not taking offense is hard, since you'd sworn all the women in the land were excited to meet you. But then again it wasn't like you wanted them swarming to talk and be with you either. As you sit you're handed a menu, and you quickly put in a few orders before turning to the girl across from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Reid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you.\" She replies. Her voice is deep, and perhaps a bit slow to enunciate her words. Your first guess is that she's not very smart, but her eyes when they finally lift up don't show confusion or hesitation. You guess instead that perhaps she doesn't care to hurry. \"I'm Terra. It's nice of you to come over and spend some time with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look a little bored so I thought I'd try to make things interesting.\" You remark. \"This world is so amazing to see. I can't believe I'm going to be living here from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all are too.\" Terra smiles. \"Amazed, that is. We've been waiting so long for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whole world of girls, just waiting for you. Not to mention they could change appearance and size. Looking over Terra some more now up close, you notice further details about her build. She was a very thick girl; not chubby or fat, but rather built with width in mind over height. She had very broad shoulders only outmatched by outrageously wide hips. Her rump had to be pushing her up nearly half a foot or more from the seat, and he could feel the tremendous thighs and legs scooting around his own like walls. Her bust spilled slightly onto the table over the edge of the shirt she wore, easily bigger than her head apiece, and there were several dark freckles dotting the top of her cleavage. Her face was round yet chiseled on the cheeks and jaw, making her a bit more masculine save for the big, red eyes and button-like nose, framed by a long ponytail that trailed around one shoulder and dropped around her sideboob, almost as thick as your arm. Her own limbs were like the rest of her: thick, wide and strong, with big hands that made anything she held look small. Going by how the two of you sat, she must have easily been nearly a foot taller than you if standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and maybe if you'd like we could...call this a date?\" You hear her finish, snapping you out of your inspection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\" You stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I understand if you're not ready for that.\" She says slowly. \"But if you're willing to sit with me you must like me, if only by how I look. Why not call this a date and spend some more time afterwards together? You could come back to my place...and I could...show you a nice time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't get to answer immediately before your sushi arrives. Thanking the server, you take a bite of one roll and carefully chew over it. Terra, on the other side of the table, takes a long piece of beef and pops it into her mouth to do the same. One of her legs pushes in-between yours and thumps against the bottom of your seat. She was definitely straightforward!</span></div></div>",

In the immediate area are several low farm houses and other important buildings for agriculture. You can even see a few Pokegirls tending to the fields, if not walking down the path at various sizes carrying parts or huge bundles of food. One even approaches with big, thooming steps, and you quickly step aside to let her into the city proper. Judging by her appearance she was a Miltank girl, and the very buxom giantess winks down at you before giving a very notable saunter to her steps as she leaves. Your eyes follow her until she passes out of sight. Looking down at the map again, you follow the little lines until you notice that beyond the farmlands lies a big forest. Many trails and little segments are laid out as parks and nature preserves. You could perhaps take a hike there and see what this world has to offer with its more...natural, beauties. Perhaps meet the more reclusive Pokemon who spend their time out there instead of in the city or working here on the fields. But then beyond even that were the mountains. Towering peaks with snow covering their tops, you could see them from here quite clearly due to the cloudless skies, and like on the map you could just about make out several lodges and other buildings dotting the closest. Obviously they were there to offer more wintry escapes and services, and you couldn't image a less breathtaking sight than to climb to the top of one and gaze down at the new world you were on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith so many choices before you it's hard to decide! So you fold up the map some, leaving only the Southern District facing up, and close your eyes.

Along the way you pass several girls who all call out or wave to you. You wave back, sometimes stopping for a few seconds to talk, but always decline on sticking around. You were determined to stick to your sudden plan. They all seemed sad to watch you leave however, so you noted to come back and revisit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach the first mountain along the path, the few trees dotting it begin to rise higher in the air, their great branches reaching over one another and creating a roof effect over your head. Soon the sunlight even began to get blotted out, leaving you in false dusk to trek in. It was almost spooky really, with how the atmosphere grew a bit chillier the closer you came to the base of the mountain. As minutes pass even a tiny fog began to fill the air, but luckily not so much that you couldn't read the signs along the path or see where you're going.

You couldn't help but think a cruise ship could even fit through this opening, as the corners were nearly out of sight and the top was lost in the now thicker fog. Shaking your head, you wish that you had grabbed a flashlight before coming here, but carry on in the hopes that there were lights deeper inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the cave, you feel the natural ambience dampen as the walls blot out the forest outside. Tiny dripping pings of water fill the air, your footsteps echoing around inside with each step you take. A chill runs down your spine as the temperature begins to drop. Or was that the feeling of something watching you? It was hard to tell, and you didn't want to sound paranoid. But this cave <i>was</i> very, very creepy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes stretch on as you plunge deeper, the cave now totally dark as the last of the light from outside vanishes around a corner. Despite your hopes there were no lights within the cave to see by, and when you tried to turn back you must have taken a wrong turn because now you're lost. Calling out for help, you only hear your voice in reply, and that scares you. Who knows if anyone would find you in here?! But you couldn't just rush forward, not when there was no telling what might be lying ahead of you, or just around a corner. However as you keep walking you suddenly feel something hit your left foot, and wouldn't you know it, you trip. Arms flailing, you shout in alarm before falling forward toward the ground. Except the ground never comes. As you flip 180 and continue to tumble down, you realize to your horror that you must have accidentally stumbled across a hole of some kind! A very big, very deep one...since seconds pass and you don't stop falling. You scream out, louder, in fear that this might end your journey short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear something very loud echo all around you. A deep thump, the rush of wind, and then - oof! Something incredibly soft has caught you and is bouncing you atop of it. You flop around for several long seconds before coming to a halt, gasping for air. More deep thumps and galeforces winds buffet you, but you're stationary this time. In fact, the wind is quite warm compared to what you've been feeling, and the ground is...fuzzy, almost. Rubbing over it, you can't quite tell what's covering it, but you can feel that thumping rumbling through it very faintly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"Hello.\"</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze, that deep, scratchy and loud voice breaking from the darkness. \"H-Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly from above, two giant orbs appear, glowing unnaturally with 'dark' light. They begin to lower down, those gusts of air growing heavier and louder against your body, until they stop almost level with you. It takes you several seconds to realize what they are - eyes! Two enormous eyes with black sclera that glow, and white dots that expand and contract as they focus in on you, obviously acting as the pupils. You can't get the scale of this creature by the eyes alone, but surely they were several hundred feet tall! <b><i>\"Who are you? What are you doing in my hole?\"</i></b> They ask, voice even louder and more powerful from this close. It's easy to tell it's a womans voice even at the volume she booms it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I fell.\" You admit quickly. \"W-Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mouth of jagged lines suddenly lights up below, glowing a faint purple and showing off a mouth of big teeth and a tongue longer and thicker than his entire body. <b><i>\"I'm Whisper, a Haunter!\"</i></b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whisper, obviously, was very big. The hole you'd fallen down was very deep, very wide, and apparently where she lived. Going by the sheer size of her glowing bits of anatomy she must have been several hundred feet tall, with the hand you were in probably as big as the average house. As she leaned in more, the ambient glow allowed you to make out a few more details of her appearance. Towering pillars were behind and to the side of you, their sharp points looking ominous in the dim lighthing. Her face filled the air above and before you, chin and cheeks suggesting she was angelic in looks, even while covered in purple 'fur', with a hair-do styled to match her species headshape. Nothing could be seen of her body besides her hand, and you suspected it might have something to with her kinds free-floating anatomy. Aside from scaring and looming over you, she actually seemed quite nice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"You look strange for a Pokemon.\"</i></b> Scratch that; add on taxing your eardrums. She obviously didn't know to tone down her volume for something as small as you. <b><i>\"Where's your wings or armor?\"</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't have those.\" You stutter, wincing as she blinks. Her thick eyelashes buffeted you with wind. \"I'm Reid, a human. Didn't the empress tell you about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"Empress? What's that?\"</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Perhaps this was a literal case of living under a rock. Just with a mountain. \"Uh, nevermind then. I'm Reid.\" You hold your hand out by reflex but stop once you remember you're sitting on <i>her</i> hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"You're cute.\"</i></b> She giggles thunderously. It's almost as high as a cackle, further sending chills down your spine. <b><i>\"I think I'll keep you. Would you like to see my hole little Reid?\"</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a reply, a cluster of blue flames begin to puff into existance around you. Each of them are around the same size as you are, but aside from giving light doesn't seem to heat up the air or you much at all. Slowly the hole, or rather Whisper's hole, becomes visible. The far walls are still almost out of sight, but now you can make her out in more details. Purple skin and fur blend together all over her hand and face, making her look even more haunting in the odd light. Her large, wide eyes gaze down at you with that ever-present grin making the ridged lips of her mouth look like a jack-o-lantern with the backlight coming from her throat. Her hand is indeed floating free of any wrist, but you can see an arm jutting out from her shoulders, and her neck is still attatched to her head. Without prompting she tilts her palm some to give you a better view of herself. Not that it helps much; a massive pair of breasts, more than a handful for <i>her</i> large hand, blocks everything past her slim waist, and bounce prominently free of any stitch of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, you try to keep your eyes up on her face, but her eyes unnerve you too as she giggles giddily. What should you do?</span></div></div>",

She has on a yellow- orange shirt and a pair of hoop earrings. On her cheeks, two yellow circles can be seen.

Don't worry, I'll teach you somehow.\"<br>\r\n\"Hold on! Don't I get any say in this?\"<br>\r\n\"None whatsoever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny maneuvered you to the center of the floor despite your half- hearted objections. You weren't angry, just surprised and nervous at how quickly this was going. Penny waved towards a Chatot girl bobbing her head behind the DJ table and gestured. The DJ gave a thumbs up and switched to a song with a fast dance beat.<br>\r\n\"Okay, just watch me for a few seconds and join in when you think you've got it.\"<br>\r\nShe began to slide and dance in tune with the music. She moved very quickly, and you could barely keep up. You spent more time recovering from tripping over your own feet than actually dancing. <br>\r\n\"Penny, could you slow down? I can't go that fast!\"<br>\r\nPenny grabbed your arms and pulled you close to her body. \"You need to keep in time with the music. You can't just slow down! Let's try a more hands-on approach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head slowly started to rise. When she was about seven feet tall, she turned you around and placed your heels on her feet. She held your wrists and positioned your elbows and knees to match up against her own. \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter what I answer, does it?\"<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you're catching on!\"<br>\r\nPenny began to dance again, but this time she moved your body in unison with her own. She pressed herself against you as she gyrated and moved with the beat. This was much better. After only a few minutes, you felt like you had a decent grasp of what to do.<br>\r\n\"Great! Excellent! You're getting the hang of this!\"<br>\r\n\"This dance isn't too bad once you know how to move...\" Penny cleared her throat, prompting you to add, \"Er, and you're a really good teacher.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, thanks, Reid!

She pushed her body against you so tightly, you could feel her heartbeat. Her long, thin zig-zag-tipped tail wrapped around one of your legs and one of hers, binding you together while her palms pressed against your own, her fingertips clutched tightly against the back of your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself blushing. Her lower body was grinding hard against your own, and she was shaking it in a way that left little to the imagination. Her upper chest was squished against your neck and chin, the soft mounds gently deforming against your body under the pressure. Her face was tilted downward and her nose and lips were smushed against your own...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you even trying?\" She teased. You snapped out of your embarrassment at her position.

And stop blushing! Your cheeks are even more off-color than mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did your best to copy her motions, but it was very hard. The song was extremely quick, and Penny was holding you tighter than ever. \"Penny, this isn't working! I can't move this fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you can! The problem is that you're not working with me here! Stop trying to watch what I'm doing, and just do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-mmph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very instant you opened your jaw to object, Penny's lips locked around your open mouth. One of her hands released yours and wrapped around your back, pressing your head into hers. Her free leg swung out and looped around your own, and her eyelashes tickled against your face. Somehow, she pressed even closer against you. It felt like she was almost a part of your body. Realizing that she didn't intend to let go any time soon, you started breathing through your nose as she slid the tip of her tongue into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized suddenly that you were dancing. You had just allowed Penny to make the moves while you were busy being absolutely shocked by how intimate the Raichu girl had gotten. Once you had stopped focusing on mimicking her movements exactly, you had been able to keep up just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow though, you had a beautiful Pok\u00e9girl kissing you, the feeling of Penny's lips against yours unlike anything else you had ever experienced.</span></div></div>",

You broke the kiss and leaned close to her. \"Hey, you wanna go somewhere a little more private?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushes and nods. \"I know just the place.\" She flashes a smile and leads you to the back of the club. She takes you up a flight of stairs, and enters a small lobby. A full-grown Pok\u00e9girl was lazing at the front desk. She was balancing the chair with her legs crossed on the desk. She had a nice figure, flat chest, and had wings sticking from her back. They were dark, signifying she must be a Murkrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny steps up to the counter and orders a room. \"So, found someone to fuck I see...\" the Murkrow bluntly states. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hex, there is no reason to be jealous that I got the only male in the world and you didn't.\" Hex straightened back up and started to fume quietly.

The room is coated in hearts, and had a comfy looking bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny sat on the edge, and began luring you closer with her eyes. You sat next to her, and she leaned on your shoulder. \"Hey Reid, what do you think of me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question took you by surprise, and you tried to think of the best words to describe your feelings. \"You're the nicest Pok\u00e9mon I ever met, and you're probably the most important person in my life right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww...\" She looks at you adoringly and hugs you lovingly. \"That's so sweet.\" As you hugged, her breasts began to fill your line of vision. Your dick was now at full attention, waiting to be allowed out of it's imprisonment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly unlocked the embrace, and you quickly buried your face into her tits. She moans softly, soothing your ears. Your pants can't take the stress anymore, and your dick goes through the zipper. Your dick locks up, aiming at Penny's face. \"I see your cock can't wait,\" she says teasingly. You're only able to nod your head yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removes your face from her chest and positions your face allowing you to see her vagina glistening with love juices. I smile. \"I see you also can't wait.\" She blushed slightly, and raises herself. She than impales herself onto your erected cock. She takes it hard in her pussy, but is able to hold out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sweet fragrance fills your nose, and you suck it in welcoming. \"I love your scent, Penny.\" You sigh. Penny moans lustfully as you thrust yourself deeper into her hold. She orgasms while you're inside, not letting a drop escape her cunt. She begins to pant more, and you feel the ecstasy run through you body. You don't know where to cum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab her back to support her. You look into her eyes and give her another kiss. When your lips connect, You let your dick's fluids invade her. You had to hold her up so she didn't slide off. She than falls onto you, and you both fall back onto the bed. Her moans of pleasure did not cease after you started pulling your still erected dick out. \"That was the best sex I ever had...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you liked it.\" You pant. \"It was my first time too.\" Both of you lay there for awhile, panting from your sweaty sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide closer to Penny 'till your lips are almost connected. \"I think I wanna stay with you for a while longer, Reid.\" She giggles and takes your hands to her breasts. She lets out a moan, and reaches in for a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lips connect, sending eletric volts through you. It's slightly painful, but pleasurable as well. You tease her nipples as she lets out a scream of pleasure and breaks the kiss. She than reaches down and strokes your still erect dick. You can feel pre-cum juices flowing out. \"I think I'm in love with you,\" she utters in a soft moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lower yourself to her breast height, and start playing with her E cup breasts. She strokes much faster on your dick, pushing you further to climax. You suckle lightly on one of her nipples, making milk come out. You're surprised, but it's not enough to stop you. You fondle her next breast, making her love juices overflow from her pussy. You then remove her hand from your pre-cum soaked cock. \"How bout we move it inside.\" She nods and raises herself on top of you. You lay your body on the bed, as she hovers over your cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going in...\" She moans, pushing herself into your erection. You explode with pleasure as soon as her head folds reach your dick. Her cunt contracts around your cock, and gives you a powerful, but pleasurable shock. You can feel an orgasm closing on you. She starts to move out and in, while you reach up and play with her sweater puppies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can hold out any longer, I'm going to cum!\" You warn her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please do! I want all of it in me!\" Penny pleads as you then match your tempo with her bobbing up and me thrusting. With one set, you unload all into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny lets out a small scream of pleasure as she pulls you in for one last kiss before you pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you wake up...</span></div></div>",

Grey fur with black hands and highlights... a muzzle... claws... she wasn't a fighting type, she was a Mightyena! With an emphasis on the 'mighty,' it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't rippling with bulky muscle, but she was solidly well-built- you could easily see her being able to smash the bag hard enough to send it flying like that. A little on the lean side, but not enough to contrast with her defined legs and upper body. You're hard-pressed to imagine a way her body could appear to be more healthy, fit, and in shape than it was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight-wise, she was a little more than a head taller than you. Chest-wise... it was hard to tell. It was obvious she was wearing a sports bra designed to keep her as flat as possible while working out, but it was equally obvious that there was a massive pair of melons underneath struggling for release.<br>\r\nBesides her bra and some hand wraps, the only clothing she wore was a pair of loose shorts that left a clear view of her strong legs below and everything from the waist up above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, this Amazonian Pokegirl had plenty to show off, and didn't hesitate to do so, given the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Reid didn't put you in a coma or anything, right?\"<br>\r\nYou snap back to reality.<br>\r\n\"N-no, I'm fine.

I probably wouldn't have been killed by it anyway...\" You certainly wouldn't be conscious right now either, but you don't mention that part.<br>\r\nShe held out a muscular paw.

The room was fairly large, and there were rows of lockers and benches between the entrance and the open-air showerheads. About half a dozen Pokegirls of various shapes, sizes, and forms were scattered about, but all of them turned to look at you right away.<br>\r\n\"Hey Amy, Rhonda. How're you doing?\" Irene addressed a slender but defined female Lucario and a huge Kangaskhan morph, both apparently just starting to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was in full Lucario form, but her curves and manner left no doubt as to gender. She was smaller than both Irene and Rhonda, but was still at least your own height, probably a little more, and certainly had to be much stronger than you. Her piercing green-gold eyes were surrounded on top and bottom with a set of thick black eyelashes that fluttered as she looked you up and down.<br>\r\nRhonda was easily the largest of the three at nearly double your height. She wasn't fat, but she was wide, tall, and deep. A thick brown head of hair reached down to her broad shoulders. Her powerful legs and firm rump easily supported her impressive build, and her tree-like stomach and chest boasted a pair of large E-cups, looking quite full and heavy even on her massive form. Rhonda was just a really big girl all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irene, is that who I think it is?\" the Kangaskhan asked. She sounded surprised to see you, but pleasantly so.<br>\r\nIrene grinned back at you. \"Yeah, it is. I saw him wandering around alone and invited him out for a date.\" She folded her muscular arms over her chest. \"It was hard, but I managed to talk him into it eventually.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you did,\" Amy giggled. She curled her paw around the tip of her muzzle thoughtfully and smiled at you. She batted her eyes.<br>\r\nIrene noticed the look, and quickly said...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon entering, you are completely caught off by how dark it was in the arcade. When your eyes adjusted, you could plainly see the large collection of games here. The cabinets went on for what seemed like miles containing different size versions of the same games like: Pac-Man, Tempest, Black Dragon, Joust, Street Fighter, and many more. There were dozens of different pokemorphs and prokegirls sitting and standing at arcade cabinets, too engrossed in their current games to be bothered with someone coming in the door. You walk up to the counter and pull five dollars out of your wallet and lay it on the counter to be turned into quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Umbreon pokemorph was manning the counter and as far as her body goes, it wasn't one to complain about. Since she was in her pokemorph form, she didn't seem to have any head hair, only fur. Her fur was jet black with neon turquoise rings where the yellow ones should be. From the angle you are looking at her from, it looks like she is wearing jeans that were made to be tight around the thighs and loose below the knees. Speaking of her lower body, she has a very voluptuous pair of buttocks. Her upper body consists of a thin primarily neon turquoise jacket with a white secondary and a maximum of a C cup bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um, excuse me miss?\" You say, trying to get the counter lady's attention. \"Hm? Oh hi! You must be Reid! That guy that everyone is talking about... Oh! Where are my manners? My name is Angela.\" She finishes. \"Nice to meet you Angela. I would introduce myself but it seems that everyone in this universe already knows who I am sooooooooooooo. Mph.\" You say, mind going blank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven through your awkward silence, Angela waited patiently for you to pull your mind together. \"Uhhhhh, can I please get some quarters?\" You finally muster. \"Oh yeah! Sure thing. You know what? I'll play you.\" Angela said, a look of confidence coming across her face. \"Wait, don't you have to work?\" You ask. \"Nah. I loaded everyone in here up with quarters not long ago. The only person I have to look out for right now is Lena over there.\" Angela said as she pointed to the ginormous Absol pokemorph in the corner. \"She sucks at videogames but she plays anyway. I just loaded her up with just over a hundred quarters but she burns through em pretty fast. Anyway. What game you wanna play?\" \"Oh shit. er. Darn. Almost forgot one thing.\" Angela said as she hurried into a back room and came back out a few moments later with a pair of black leather, fingerless gloves. \"These are my gaming gloves by the way. What game did you say you wanted to play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhhhmmmm. Let's play __________.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Authors Note: Just to clear it up. For those didn't already get it.The title relates to the classic arcade game: Pac-Man. Ok. Got it? No? Well too bad I'm not explaining it in any further depth.)</span></div></div>",

Can you give me a run down on how you play.\" You reply sheepishly. \"I still don't believe you but either way, Joust is exactly what it sounds like but with a few twists. If I remember correctly, Player 1 rides on a stork and Player 2 rides on an ostrich. You uses this button to flap and this button to raise your lance, the player with the higher lance upon collision wins and the loser loses a life. There are CPUs that ride on buzzards and a peterodactyl that shows up to wreak some havoc every once and a while. *long inhale*\" Angela said all in one breath. \"Are you okay?\" You ask. \"Yeah *gasp* I'm fine *gasp* just too much word *gasp* not enough oxygen.\" Angela replied. After a little while of catching her breathe, Angela said. \"So, anyway. Are we gonna play or what?</span></div></div>",

You find that it's more of a bathhouse, really. You also remember how sexy the empress was. You feel the reaction of your \"thoughts\" and immediately try to hide it in case someone comes in. But you suddenly feel a grasp on your penis as the empress comes above water!<br>\r\n\"Mhm, I thought this would be the best way to um-wind\" she said. She starts to stroke you up and down and gets your cock in her mouth. It wasn't long before you came. \"Mmmmm, that was good.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You are Reid, a 20-year-old who is about to get transported to a strange world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we continue on, I should probably clarify a few things that the story will adhere to:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty much every character in this story barring Reid himself is female. Also, they can all switch between three forms:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPokemon: Yes, I'm sure you know what these are, but also know that within the world Reid will be transported to these Pokemon will be able to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPokemorph: For the purposes of this story this refers to all anthropomorphic Pokemon that lean more toward their Pokemon form that towards a human form. Example: A Ninetales Pokemorph would have fur all over her body, a muzzle, and paws at the end of her legs (But not necessarily her arms).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPokegirl: A not-quite-human girl possessing the features of the Pokemon she's based off of. Example: A Ninetales Pokegirl would have long hair the color of a Ninetales' fur, along with the ears and tails of a Ninetales, but would be human in every other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make things even more interesting, they can all change their size at will. And just to make sure you didn't miss it they can switch between the three aforementioned forms at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo vore (Though eating of random mundane fish and already dead/cooked animals is perfectly fine).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo killing (At least, not of Red and any Pokes/morphs/girls anyway).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStomping's OK, though I'd prefer Reid didn't actually get hit with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on and lying on are not only OK, they're encouraged. Just remember that neither those or stomping should hurt Reid too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd obviously things are gonna get a little weird, but don't let it get TOO wild, if you catch my drift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, I don't wanna see any underaged stuff. &gt;&lt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd also i want to make the chapters long so i would have to copy and edit the guy stroy. fwll free to add people</td>",
