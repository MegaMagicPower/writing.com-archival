            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Four years ago, a young lad called Jason Constansa dreamt of being amongst the stars. But what he did not want to make his dream come true fighting in a war.  Jason always wanted to fly a space craft of his own. When he was old enough, he joined the Space Academy as a space pilot. He thought that the Space Academy was like a flight training college, but he did not realise that the Space Academy was actually for recruits who wanted to bring peace to the Synopia system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason joined the Academy anyway. Some of his old school friends were in the Academy as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his first few weeks in the Academy, Jason tried to drop out at least 7 times. But his friends tried to make him think otherwise. In the end, Jason decided to continue on with his training and eventually graduated from the Space Academy as a Space Pilot. His first assignment was to fly a Phoenix star jet to collect prometium, a red ore that is found in space. However, Jason needed to make multiple runs as the cargo bay of the Phoenix was limited. After a few months of flying the little starjet, he decided to buy himself a new ship. The new ship was the Leonov. This starjet had the capability of increasing its cargo bay from 360 tonnes to 380 tonnes. As well as having increased shielding and damage, it could also outrun some of the smaller starjets. Jason\u2019s CO, Lieutenant Commander Ian Stantham hailed him over flight suit comms. Lt Stantham gave Jason a new mission. Instead of collecting ore, Jason was to join his fellow pilots on the battlefield. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few days of fighting were spent fighting an alien species called the Streuners. Their craft were similar to the EIC\u2019s Yamato starjet, but the engines were placed on the other way, compared to the Yamato. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkirmishes between the alien starjets and the EIC broke out. Eventually, Jason uses his lasers and Eco-10 rockets to shoot down the last of the Streuners. For every 10 Streuners shot down, the EIC had 2 ships return to the home base for repairs because of damage to the hull of the ships. Eventually, Jason flew back to the base where the pilots of the damaged ships thanked Jason for dealing with the Streuners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the alarms blared with a deafening screech, Jason rushed back to his Leonov and flew out to meet the incoming threat. Managing to shoot down the first few waves, Jason started to notice that his LF-1 lasers were not firing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried firing the cannon again. Nothing happened. The next wave came into view and the LF-2 Laser Auto-turret started firing away. Next thing, two Goliath K2 battle cruisers flew past him to fight the third wave of attackers with a landing party in the third wave. The Goliaths proved ineffective against the landing party and the last ship was Jason\u2019s Leonov. Firing away, two of the landing craft exploded in a ball of green fire, while the third retreated, badly damaged. To prevent it returning back to its home base, Jason pursued the landing craft and shot it down with a volley of rockets and laser fire. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next few days were spent relaxing with the pilots. Some of them were even talking to Jason about the events that had happened over the past couple of days. Some of them even became friends with Jason. However, most of the EIC clan were elsewhere, doing what they usually do during battles or missions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour, one of the senior officers came over to where Jason was sitting and informed him that the Lt. Com. Stantham wanted him immediately. One of Jason\u2019s new acquaintances shot a glance towards him, wondering what he had done for the Lt. Commander to call him into his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, Jason followed the senior officer to the Lt Commander\u2019s office. After a ten minute walk from the mess hall to the office, Jason was invited into the office. Lt. Stantham sat forward with Jason\u2019s performance record. He thoroughly looked it over and sat back into his seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then Mr Constansa, it seems that your record in the Academy\u2019s flight combat simulator was exceptional. And from what I have heard, you have handled yourself well out on the battlefield well. It says here on the combat report that you shot down 25 Streuners and 3 landing craft during two sorties. Not even our skilled pilots could manage that, especially shooting down three heavily armoured landing craft. What craft did you have when this happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell sir, I had a lightly armed Yamato. I suffered a laser malfunction on the crafts\u2019 LF-1 laser cannons. Eventually, I managed to take the landing craft down with nothing more than my LF-2 laser cannons, Eco-10 rockets and PLD- 08 rockets which disabled their automatic targeting system. Two Goliath K2 battle cruisers flashed past me and dealt with the first two waves. After a while, they returned, but they were flying back. I then saw all of the landing craft and went straight for them. After spending about 20 minutes dodging shots from their auto turrets, I managed to get a lock on the lead craft. 10 rockets later, the first one went down in a ball of green fire. The second one then appeared and shot that down as well. The third craft was difficult to shoot down, but after hit and run tactics, the third one went down as well\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLt. Stantham was impressed by Jason\u2019s performance on the battlefield. For his bravery and courage to stand face to face with three heavily defended landing craft in a Leonov starjet, Jason was promoted to the next rank, and even the Goliath pilots thanked him for his support. Everyday, Jason got to know more and more of the pilots and also earned their respect. This made him feel welcome and glad that he did join the Space Academy after all. Day after day, he would fly out to join his fellow comrades, and everyday, he would return more confident and mentally stronger. One day, he went down to the hanger bay and saw something amazing. His comrades had decided to buy him a new ship.  It was one of the sleekest starfighters that the EIC owned. Heavily armed with 8 lasers and 650 rockets, this starfighter could penetrate even the strongest armour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason thanked the guys for his gift with a round at the bar. They had bought him the Piranha. Heavily armed and heavily defended with armour that was strong enough to survive any laser attack and even the alien weapons. It was even equipped with an MTD (Multiple target detection) unit which could detect 20 threats at once and shoot down 8 of the potentially dangerous threats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason now had 2 ships, although the Leonov was now a cargo vessel, rather than a starjet. This was because the Leonov had a greater cargo hold than the Piranha had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying out on a new mission was the sort of thing that Jason had been looking forward to. This meant that he could now test his Piranha in battle situations. Flying to the jump gate, Jason noticed a pilot whose Nostromo starfighter was badly damaged and drifting in the endless void of space. Jason flew over to retrieve the pilot with his Yamato in tow, who later thanked him for picking him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranded pilot flew Jason\u2019s Yamato back and left his Nostromo for a rescue team to come and retrieve it. Meanwhile, Jason corrected his course for the jump gate. By the time he had reached the next gate, there were skirmishes breaking out between the EIC and the Streuners. Jason also noticed that a new alien species, the Lordakians had craft of their own 0heading to join in the fight. Jason decided to leave his comrades to deal with the Streuners while he took on the Lordakians. There were 2 waves of Lordakians followed by a single Streuner. One of the Lordakian ships broke formation to meet Jason. Jason shot down the ship with out the alien craft being able to fire a shot. The rest of the Lordakian craft then followed to where Jason was located. Within minutes, the first wave and half of the second wave had been eliminated from battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lordakians opened fire on Jason, but with no effect. Jason then said to himself, \u201cright, my turn\u201d and opened fire on the last of the Lordakians. After the firefight, all that was left was debris and one Streuner was lost in a hail of gunfire. He then rejoined his comrades to take on the threat from the Saimon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Saimon are an aggressive race, always warring between clans and even between families. Their craft on the other hand, do not match their mentality. Their craft are very basic with a unique design, like the craft of the Lordakians. However, the Saimon craft are very streamlined, thus being able to outrun most other spacecraft, including the fastest ships that mankind has to offer. However, this information did not frighten Jason, he knew of the Saimon ships weakness, its armour. It was so lightly armed, but the armour wasn\u2019t as strong as it was on the Piranha.<br>\r\nThis meant that Jason could go for hit and run manoeuvres on the Saimon, while remaining cloaked. Despite this, the Saimon could always detect where their enemy was and take them down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, Jason could easily out gun the Saimon as his Piranha was equipped with the new LF-3 laser cannons. With the equipment from his Yamato now on the Piranha, Jason engaged the Saimon. At first, there was only one Saimon, and then there were swarms of them, Lordakians and Streuners surrounding him. The Saimon and Lordakians opened fire on Jason while the Streuners remained where they were, not firing at Jason. For the fun of it, Jason fled. This was a clever tactic, as it then allowed him to get behind the Saimon and take them down in a hail of cannon fire. The Lordakians followed him. Jason then decided to go on a strafing run. During this manoeuvre, he shot down \u00be of the Lordakian ships before encountering a Mordon vessel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mordon vessels are extremely unique, as they are basically a series of contra rotating, bladed disks. However, despite the design, these vessels were technologically advanced. They were equipped with the latest weapons and shielding capabilities. Their only weakness was the exposed plasma reactor in the centre. If Jason could fire a couple of Eco-10/ PLT- 2026 long range rockets into it, then the ship would be disabled, but it could also knock out the weapons array of any vessel close to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Mordon vessels closed in on Jason. Before anybody could come to his assistance, the Mordon vessel was floating in space, lifeless. The escape pod had detached from the hull of the ship and was hurtling towards him at a rapid rate. Jason knew what the Piranha could do, so he engaged forward shields and waited until the pod came. A few minutes later and the Piranha shook due to the impact of the pod colliding with the shields. The HUD in the ship came online and showed the damage that the shield has sustained in the impact. There was hardly any damage to the shields. The alien life form in the pod ceased to exist as it had been obliterated in the explosion of the pod when it came into contact the Piranhas\u2019 shielding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the current area, Jason flew around the rest of the environment looking for any other alien craft to fight. But there simply were no other ships at all. This being the case, Jason flew back to the jump gate and back through the rift back to the home environment. He then flew back to the station for debriefing. A few of his comrades formed up in a wing. Either side of the Piranha were 3 Goliath K2 battle cruisers with Bigboy battle cruiser escorts and a Solace Goliath K2 at either end of the formation. When they reached the base, they split into their different areas where the pilots would later meet in the mess hall and talk about their combat engagements in the day. After having refreshments, all of the pilots hit their beds without Jason, who went to see the armourer. Jason explained what had happened to the armoury clerk. He explained the problem with the rockets needed for the Piranha. The reason that the Piranha had used most of its PLT- 2026 Long Range Rockets against the Mordon vessel was because the further that the rocket travelled, the less damage it would do because of the way that the warhead reacted with the vacuum of space. Instead, the manager advised him to use the long range rockets at close range, as they would do more damage to the enemy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A week went by without any fighting. Jason and the rest of his wing decided to fly out of the base and look for fights. They returned 10 minutes later, without any kills to their names or tally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they returned, they got mission orders through from the Lt. The mission was to retrieve a missing probe, which they believed had been picked up by the Lordakians. Jason decided to go on the mission alone, without backup from his wing. He jumped into his fighter and released the launching mechanisms that held his craft in place. Hitting subsonic speeds, he reached the jump gate in less than 20 minutes. Meanwhile, mission control was watching every move that he made on the large mission screens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was well aware of the mission. Instead of thinking about the mission, he checked his HUD for any possible upgrades. Before he knew it, there were swarms of Lordakian vessels surrounding him. Immediately, alarm bells rang in his head and he engaged them, picking them off one by one. After the battle, Jason was informed by mission control that the probe had been taken to the Lordakian home world. He thought it a good idea to go down to the planet for a scouting mission. The Piranha had started to feel the strain of the planet\u2019s atmosphere as it rushed down to the surface. By now, the engines were giving off massive amounts of heat. This meant that the Lordakians could see him coming even though his actual craft was still cloaked. As he reached the surface, the Lordakians had opened fire on him. Staying low to avoid any fire, Jason strafed the gun positions. He touched down on the planet floor, where he continued his mission on foot. With his small firearm strapped to his belt and a few grenades, he run silently through the fauna of the planet, before he reached what appeared to be a temple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reaching the temple, Jason silently crept inside. It wasn\u2019t long before he was noticed by one of the lower ranking aliens who were on guard at the time. Firefights were taking place across the temple flaw. Snipers even opened fire, narrowly missing Jason\u2019s head. Jason fired his firearm at the snipers, killing two of them in the process. Then he started shooting the ground troops, killing them as well. Jason ran for cover in a darkened room. The only light that came through in the room was the light from the floor. In this room was a stand. On the stand was the missing probe. Jason rushed across the floor to retrieve the probe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarms started going off, so Jason had to make a quick escape. Meanwhile, back at mission control, one of the pilots saw what was happening and decided that it would be a good idea to help his comrade out. The pilot reached his battle cruiser and jumped in the cockpit. Launching the battle cruiser from the hangar was easy; it was just getting it up to subsonic speeds that would be difficult because of its design. In the end, the cruiser had reached subsonic speed and headed straight for the jump gate. A few minutes later, a Diminisher Goliath cruiser joined the Bigboy cruiser. Both of the cruisers jumped through the gate to the other world. The map showed the planet, and a distress beacon appeared on the map.<br>\r\nJumping to subsonic speeds again, both craft reached the planet within a few minutes. Remaining cloaked, both vessels stealthily reached the planet\u2019s surface when they noticed Jason\u2019s Piranha. Touching down on the planet floor, both pilots armed themselves with rifles, grenades and pistols and rushed to the temple. Under the cover of darkness, they silently infiltrated the temple and within 10 minutes, they found Jason and the probe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the room, both pilots saw that there were dead bodies everywhere. They rushed over to help Jason, when all of a sudden; there was an explosion behind them. The building was collapsing all around them. They did not have time to talk; instead they ran back to their ships as fast as they could. The building them collapsed into a pile of rubble as the group had ran back through the forest, killing any alien that got in their way. Eventually, they reached their respective craft and started up the engines. They managed to lift off of the floor and headed to the atmosphere when all of a sudden, they encountered trouble. The collapsing building sent up a high intensity energy beam. This meant that there was no escape for them. The only way to escape was to destroy the beam\u2019s firing mechanism. If not destroy it, then disable it for long enough so that they could escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason said to the pilots that he would do it, but the pilot of the Bigboy told him to leave and join the Diminisher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bigboy pilot changed its course and headed straight for the beam mechanism. Firing EMP bursts at the mechanism did not work. All of a sudden, a Lordakian vessel came into view and headed straight for the battlecruiser. Manoeuvring out of the way, the alien ship collided with the beam, destroying it and the vessel itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot then formed up with the Diminisher and the Piranha. They all went supersonic to get break through the atmosphere. Naturally, there was some resistance and turbulence, but eventually, all three of the vessels escaped the atmosphere and the planet. As they were flying back to the gate, they noticed that the planet was exploding. All of a sudden, a brilliant green light flashed, temporarily knocking out the ships communications arrays. This meant that the ships could not communicate with the base. They could only communicate with each other over a low frequency band radio. The Diminisher pilot realised that the energy beam was the planet\u2019s core. When the alien vessel had slammed into the device, it caused the core to shut down and implode. This sent similar explosions pulsing through the planets surface, where eventually, the energy from the surface explosions was so great, that it caused the built up energy to release in one go, destroying the planet in the process. Reaching the gate, each pilot flew through the hole, where they went supersonic to make it through the hole. Of course, by the time that they all reached the end of the rift, their engines were overheating. In order to preserve the engines, they either had to drop out of supersonic drive or use their reserve engines. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time that they reached the base, their reserve engines had been damaged by the strain put on them. Each of the ships returned to their respective docking bays. The ships were left and Jason retrieved the probe from his ship, taking it back through to the engineering department. On the way, he noticed that the Lt. had left him a mission bonus notice on his door. Even though he wanted to pick the notice from the door, he knew he had to return the probe. On the way back from engineering, he picked the notice off the door and took it into his room to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Jason went to his tool box to repair the reserve engines and fix his main engines. He noticed that one of his subsonic reactors had malfunctioned. This took some time to repair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started working on his reserve engines. Jason spent 10 hours repairing all 4 of his engines. He knew that he had time to start on the main subsonic reactor. 6 hours later, the reactor was back online, but it was not functioning at 100% yet. The computer screen showed that the reactor was still at 45% capacity. It needed another day to repair. Thankfully, Jason eventually got to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Jason was expecting mission control to come through with another assignment, but there wasn\u2019t one. Relieved with the news, Jason went straight to the mess hall to join his fellow comrades. All they were talking about was the events that had happened two days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason headed over to the table where his fellow wing pilots were sitting and sat down beside them. He thanked them for helping him and told them that he would not have escaped if it wasn\u2019t for their daring rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilots appreciated the compliments and as a thank you; Jason was treated to a cold beer in the ship\u2019s bar. After a few hours, the three pilots decided to head back to bed to recover. After about 12 hours, Jason and his comrades headed down to the docking bay to finish the repairs on their ships. Eventually, the ships were repaired and the communications array was repaired on all three ships<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ships were taken on a test flight around the base, with the permission of the Lieutenant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the test flight, they returned and went straight to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, fighting broke out between craft from both EIC and VRU. Small ships from both companies were fighting each other, while battle cruisers launched attacks on the other base. Jason flew out into the battlefield where he was met by a ship from VRU. Both craft were suspended in flight. Eventually, more ships from VRU came into view. This time, they were battle cruisers. One of the pilots from Jason\u2019s wing noticed and immediately flew to his comrades\u2019 aid. The battle cruisers opened fire on Jason with all guns blazing. In the smoke of the gunfire, Jason emerged without a scratch. They knew he was in the vicinity, but they had no clue as to where he actually was. Next minute, Jason and his comrade flanked the lead cruiser and shot it down. The cruisers\u2019 fighter escort broke formation and engaged Jason in one-on-one combat. The VRU Vengeance star fighter was easily out manoeuvred by the Piranha, but it could easily outgun it. The Vengeance and the Piranha moved towards each other as though it was one of the old mid western stand offs. The stand off lasted half an hour, before Jason dived under the automatic laser cannons of the Vengeance and destroyed two of its four engines. Meanwhile, explosions rang out from the main battle zone. Returning to the battle zone, Jason saw his comrade limping back home after the main engine was hit by shrapnel from a stray rocket. Knowing that there were still foes in the area, Jason flew alongside the cruiser to the repair bay. Next minute, a group of EIC Bigboy battle cruisers joined Jason in the fighting. The Bigboy\u2019s were equipped with EMP devices, ACM-1 (MK1 Anti-craft) mines and the latest lab technology such as the precision targeter (a device that allows any ships equipped with this technology to accurately destroy any ship moving in any direction) and a device known as the ECDT-03 (an electronically control detonation trigger) which will remote detonate mines within a 5 mile radius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bigboy cruisers could take on virtually any craft (with the exception of the Goliath K2 and the different upgraded versions of it) and destroy it. Other Piranhas from different squadrons were told to form up alongside Jason for a massive escort mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wing consisted of 10 Piranha star fighter escorts, 5 Bigboy battle cruisers, 3 Goliath K2 battle cruisers and one Diminisher Goliath, a Solace Goliath, a Venom Goliath, a Spectrum Goliath and a Sentinel Goliath. Two of the upgraded Goliath cruisers were carrying an array of EMP-1 devices and SRADM (short range anti defence missiles). VRU ships were sent to engage the oncoming assault, but were no match for the Bigboy cruisers and the Piranhas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the assault got underway, one of the Yamato pilots appeared out of nowhere as a defending ship. He was either defending the base or he was defending the attack group. Nonetheless, cannon rounds emerged out of the sky and headed towards the anti-air defences. Two of the automatic turrets exploded, followed by another one. Then, specialised Goliath K5 bombers approached the base and dropped their highly explosive cargo. The VRU base (an Etralothian class frigate) exploded in a ball of blue flames as the ultrasonic engines erupted, releasing the plasma gas that drove the engines. The frigate spiralled out of control towards a desolate, uninhabitable G-class planet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the crew of the frigate had escaped in transporter shuttles and the rest of the pilots were already evacuating the frigate. The pilots that had bailed had headed back to the home base, 2,500,000 km away. The VRU ships returned to the designated base. Although, a couple decided that they would try and be brave by taking on 10 Piranha fighters, a Bigboy cruiser and Goliath K2 cruisers. With all of the ships weapons set on maximum, the remaining VRU pilots darted towards the wing. The lead pilot knew that they would not have a chance against the EIC ships, but instead of giving up, he was going to fight to the death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiring his LF-2 cannons and LF-3 cannons, he [the VRU pilot] knew that it would be now or never. He charged towards the oncoming fighters. It was now a stand off between him in a Vengeance fighter against 10 Piranha fighters. Well aware of the oncoming threat, the Piranhas split formation and flew off in different directions. This may seem like a stupid idea, but in fact, this was a strategic move by the EIC to draw the Vengeance close enough for Jason to launch his assault on the ships\u2019 engines from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling behind the fighter, Jason unleashed a hail of cannon fire against the engines, but they had been shielded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason thought to himself, \u201cThere must be a way to destroy the shields so that I can disable those engines\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving himself in position for another attack, Jason followed the fighter for a short while without the pilot even knowing that Jason was about. The automatic cannons on the fighter started firing at the Piranha, but without any damage. Firing a couple of rounds of SAB-50 (Shield Absorbing Battery) ammunition at the mechanism, the shields on the Vengeance had been taken offline. This meant that the engines were exposed. Launching one ECO-10 rocket at close range (not too close, about 2km apart), the engines of the fighter had been disabled. The Vengeance pilot tried repairing the engines from in the cockpit, nothing. He then tried to fire his weapons. Again. Nothing. The explosion had not only disabled the engines, but also knocked out all of the electronics in the ship. This meant that the stricken pilot had to wait to be rescued. On the way back, a Sibleonion craft and a Devolorian craft appeared in the vicinity. The Sibleons and the Devolorians are two separate species of aliens that shared technology and ammunition. While half of the wing went to fight the Sibleon vessel, the other half, along with Jason, headed off to fight the Devolorian vessel. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There are no life forms on the planet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood luck pilots.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot that was given the message, Sergeant Zachary Jordan and his fellow pilots took the assignment brief to the mess hall and sat down with Jason and showed him the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at the note, looked at Zach and said to him, \u201cYou must be kidding, this is the mission that we have. What a joke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach then turned to Jason and quietly whispered, \u201cYeah. But the best bit is that you will be able to test your skills against a real enemy. VRU pilots don\u2019t seem to have any skill, and we have an ace up our sleeve which MMO don\u2019t know about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending some time going over tactics, Jason and his crew went down to the hangar where their ships were waiting. Jumping in the cockpit, Jason engaged the engines. With a mighty roar, the engines filled the room with smoke as well as deafening the weapons technicians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA computer inside the cockpit burst into life. The voice inside the computer said \u201call systems are online\u201d and then shut itself off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and his fellow pilots flew out of their respective hangar doors and into the vast void of space. Once everybody was out, each squadron formed up to form the wing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wing then headed to the jump gate where they would jump to the other world and then on to the planet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way, a couple of Lordakian vessels appeared and started firing at the wing. Without any scratches on any of the ships, they opened fire and the Lordakian vessels exploded in a ball of flames. With the \u2018threat\u2019 neutralised, the wing headed for the planet. They then spotted ships from both MMO and VRU around the planet\u2019s atmosphere. The ships were stationary over the atmosphere while an away team from both companies beamed down to the surface of the planet to retrieve the valuable prometium (red ore), terbium (yellow ore), endurium (blue ore) and other ores such as xenomit (white ore that is used to produce prometid). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff of a sudden, one of the MMO ships pilots spotted Jason and his wing and started to open fire. Retaliating, the Piranha and a couple of Goliaths returned fire. The away teams were kept up to date of the situation above them and decided to take what ore they had recovered back to their ships. However, they were slowed down by the weight of the ores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe navigator of the ships beamed the teams back aboard their vessels and the pilots engaged the wing. The battle cruisers shot at each other while the fighters were engaged in battles in the planet\u2019s atmosphere. Eventually, the MMO and VRU fighters retreated back into space to deal with the Bigboy\u2019s. Of course, the battle cruisers could easily outgun the fighters as they had 12 cannons on them, compared to the fighters, who only had 5 cannons. The cruisers only had to fire their LF-3 cannons to disable the fighters. Meanwhile, Jason and the other fighter pilots landed on the surface of the planet. One of the pilots decided to scout the planet for any threats while Jason and his team went to retrieve the rest of the ores that were left by the MMO away team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocating these valuable ores would not be easy as they were buried deep underground. Not even the strongest detection devices could pick them up properly. Finding some of the ores, a couple of pilots decided to retrieve the ore and beam back to their respective ships. Meanwhile, back in the air, the scout locates a building and decides to investigate it. Flying low but fast, the pilot flies into this structure. After a couple of minutes, he sees what appears to be an invasion party. The party leader hails the pilot for identification. It turns out that a group of EIC miners working in the EIC Skylab had been on the planet when MMO task forces arrived and started pushing them deeper into the structure. Touching his fighter down, he hails Jason and some of the surface party over the long range radios. Jason sends a couple of people back to their ships to join the scout in the monument. An old marine drop ship was called in to retrieve the workers. All of a sudden, two huge drop ships appeared from the clouds and flew over Jason\u2019s head with two fighter wings as support. The first wing of fighters broke formation and patrolled the skies above the planet for any possible MMO attack. Meanwhile, the huge drop ships hovered just above the planet\u2019s surface for the team to come out of the building before the bombers come in and take it out. The trapped workers appeared out of the darkness and ran over to the drop ships when all of a sudden, gunfire rang out from the skies as a small group of MMO fighters  opened fire on the patrolling Defcom and Liberator fighters, who in retaliation, opened fire on their MMO counterparts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long fought battle, the EIC fighters had managed to repel the MMO fighters from taking shots at the drop ships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last of the party boarded the black drop ship and then left the planet\u2019s surface. Meanwhile, Jason and the rest of his team finished retrieving the ores and were on their way back to their ships to join the drop ships and their escorts when the planet started shaking. Could this be the same thing that happened to the Lordakian home world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning as fast they could with the ore strapped to their backs, the team arrived at their ships and immediately jumped into the cockpits. Firing up their engines, the ships left the planet\u2019s surface and joined the rest of the team and the drop ships. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the planet started erupting as the gaseous compounds in the core started to trigger huge explosive discharges and finally the planet split into two before discharging the remaining energy into a huge supernova style explosion. This shook the ships as superheated debris flew past them. The bombers had not caused triggered the destruction of the planet, but they did hit certain areas of the planet\u2019s core when they released their payloads.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActivating their jump engines, the ships disappeared into a rift that they had created. Half an hour later, they arrived back at their home gate. They eventually re-engaged their normal engines for the flight home. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After returning the ores to the Skylab, the party disembarked the ships and headed back to their respective work zones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the fighters, cruisers and the bombers returned back to the hangar where they would be re-armed and refuelled for the next combat mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in their rooms, a message came over the communications system. Lt. Stantham had requested Jason and his team for debriefing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while, Jason and his team went to see Lt Stantham in his office. The Lt offered them a seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow pilots, I understand that you were sent on a mission to intercept and prevent MMO ships taking the ores from that planet. Am I correct?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilots all in unison replied Yes, Sir. Lt Stantham leaned back in his chair and whispered loudly so that the pilots could hear him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were on your way to the planet, you encountered groups of MMO and VRU ships. Did you not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Sir rang out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also seems that there was some fighting above the planet and in the atmosphere. However, a coded radio message also came through saying that a group of workers from Skylab had been located by MMO and were forced to retreat into some sort of edifice. It wasn\u2019t until one of you flew into this edifice and noticed them waiting there. Which one of you found them and radioed for the drop ships?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot responsible stepped forward and coolly replied I found them and radioed for the drop ships. I then waited for the drop ships before escorting them to the ships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLt Stantham then requested the rest of the pilots over and congratulated them for going above and beyond the call of duty. He then called Jason over shook his hand. After the congratulations were given, Lt Stantham promoted the all of the pilots from Chief Space Pilots to Basic Sergeants.  He then gave them all of the money that they had earned from the mission and the missions before then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newly promoted Basic Sergeants headed to the bar for a well earned drink. The most senior pilot in the group bought each round of drinks for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few drinks later, the pilots headed to their rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while (about 11 hours or so), the pilots received a call over the communication\u2019s array to form up in the hangar for mission briefing. Grabbing whatever food they could, the pilots knew that they would not have enough time for their early meal, so they ate on the way down to the hangar. They arrived just before the Basic Lt started the mission briefing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new mission was to take command of an outpost on the D-class planet of Madeena 2. Madeena 2 is a smallish planet, about the same size as Earth, which could sustain life if the inhabitants could adapt to the conditions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, there was only a small group of Liberator fighters that headed into the battle zone to clear the path for the rest of the fighters and the cruisers. Grabbing whatever weapons from pistols to rifles and shotguns to grenades and mines that they could, they jumped into their cockpits and launched from the hangar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoining the small squadron of Liberators, they jumped to the next world. This time, they would have to fly to another jump gate where it would take them to the world where Madeena 2 was located. Activating their jump engines (new engines specially built into the ships when jumping through gates at high velocities rather than using their main engines), they reached the world. Madeena 2 was about 369,000 km away. This would take them about 20 minutes with main engines to reach the planet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n20 minutes later, they reached Madeena 2 and flew down into the planet\u2019s lower atmosphere. When they arrived in the atmosphere, they saw that MMO and EIC ground troops were fighting each to gain control of the radio beacon. Fierce fighting meant that the ground troops were starting to tire. Meanwhile, back in the sky, MMO fighters and bombers were strafing and bombing enemy positions. There was one small outpost left before the beacon. The EIC pilots knew that they were the soldiers\u2019 only hope of survival and possibly victory. There were bodies from both companies strewn all over the ground. There were no medical personnel or ships in close proximity to the fighting. Instead, the ground troops had to rely on their ships for backup and/ or medical supplies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and a few of his fellow Piranha pilots flew over the blood shed and started attacking the MMO ships. Goliaths then arrived from both sides and then fire fights started breaking out. The EIC had shot down 15-20 ships for every one EIC ship that was damaged. Eventually, medical ships arrived on the scene and took all of their respective ground troops back to the hospital ships. <br>\r\nWave after wave of MMO ground troops emerged over the extremely rugged and boggy terrain of Madeena 2. EIC Goliath K5 bombers flew in to bomb the MMO F.O.B (forward operating base) under the support of Goliath K4 super cruisers and 3 Bigboy cruisers. Strafing the main operations base, the K4 super cruisers destroyed all of the communication equipment as well as taking out the ammunition dump. Balls of red, blue and white light filled the battlefield with a mixed sense of emotions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a 2 hour phase of continuous strafing and bombing, the main outpost on Madeena 2 was closer to being in the hands of EIC. MMO vessels were no match for the EIC fighters and super cruisers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Instead of being the planet being full of beauty and lush fauna, it was now a blood stained and desolate waste land. Nobody could possibly live on the planet now. Nobody dared. That was what made it so valuable for all three companies. In spite of this, the last EIC ground troops captured the outpost with minimal resistance from anybody. A few brief fire fights broke out. They only lasted for about 2 minutes. Fighters from both companies took their battles to the skies to avoid any stray shrapnel showering the troops. Jason noticed the fighting and got drawn in to the fighting. Taking on battle cruisers from MMO, Jason knew that nothing could stop him once he actually got into a combat frame of mind. Leading two of the MMO Goliaths to Jason were 2 Liberator fighting craft.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last remaining MMO ships retreated from the field and headed for home. The EIC cruisers followed the MMO ships out of the upper atmosphere of Madeena 2 to warn them off. This tactic worked as the MMO ships fled back to where they came from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the fighters escorted the drop ships in to retrieve the ground troops and escorting them back out again. They made sure that the area was clear before rejoining the formation and flying back to base. After jumping through the gate from Madeena 2 to the second world, a swarm of Lordakian and Saimon vessels were waiting for them. Engaging the aliens, the super cruisers fought them yet did not sustain any damage to their ships in the fighting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, a Sibleon ship appeared in front of them. The only way to destroy it was to destroy the middle of the ship, as the engine was situated there. In a flash of brilliant white light, the Sibleon vessel was destroyed and the debris from the ship had floated everywhere. Instead of it being a straight flight from one gate to another, it now became a case of avoiding the debris. After dealing with the Lordakian/ Saimon threat, the super cruisers reformed with the wing and all flew towards the gate at subsonic speeds. However, before they could jump, they had to deal with a new threat. A Binary Bot had appeared and was wreaking havoc in the world. This threat could not shoot back, but it had the ability to destroy anything it desires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only way to stop it was to aim for its head. The only downside with it was that the main power plants were in its pinhole slats on the main bodywork of the Bot. However, there was no alien species in the machine. It was being controlled from a distant place. But where is this place? Nobody really knows where the signals are coming from.<br>\r\nHowever, since this thing was heavily shielded, the only was to disable it was to use the ships' SAB-50 to eliminate the shields. Once the shields were eliminated, then the ships had a clean shot at the engines. With their laser cannons on full strength, blue streaks flashed past the ships and on their way to the Bot. Explosions rang out, but the engines were still in tact. Then all of a sudden, green, blue, red and white streaks flew into the engines of the Bot and in a huge pulsating and dazzling explosion, the ships flew through the cloud and vapour trails that had been left when the laser rounds went off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying through the home gate, the pilots started to slow down so that they could get some sleep. Even it was only for about half an hour, sleep was the only thing that they needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drop ships had already made it home. As they disengaged their jump engines and returned to main engines, a couple of huge A-class frigates were waiting on the other side of the gate to collect the ships. Alongside these frigates were shuttles to return the pilots back to base. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frigates picked the ships up in their tractor beams and they were taken into the holding bay of the frigates. Also, the shuttles flew into their designated zones to collect the pilots. As soon as they were on the shuttles, they found somewhere to sit and went to sleep. The shuttle journey would take about 2 1/2 hours to complete. Meanwhile, the ships were being returned to their respective hangars at a much quicker pace. Within 1/2 hour, the ships were waiting in the hangars for their next mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 1/2 hours later, the pilots disembarked from the shuttles and immediately headed for their rooms. </span></div></div>",

They were just about to get a quick bite to eat when a request from Lt Stantham came through over the system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe senior pilot stood up followed by Jason. They both went to see Lt. Stantham. In his office Lt. Stantham was awaiting the arrival of the guys. When Jason and his fellow yet senior pilot arrived at Stantham's door Mr Stantham invited them in to his office for a talk about the mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear the mission on Madeena 2 went well then Lt Stantham asked Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason replied Yes sir the mission was a huge success. However, when we arrived, there was fighting between our soldiers and soldiers from MMO. It seems that both of us took heavy casualties. Be that as it may it seems that the outpost on Madeena 2 is ours after the ground troops hailed us for reinforcements as well as supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery well. I will see to it that you two and the rest of your wing get what it deserves for going beyond the call of duty to help fellow comrades in their hour of need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaluting the Lt. both pilots were dismissed from the office and free to wonder around the base if they wanted to. The rest of the wing including Zach left the hall to meet up with Jason and the other pilot. They asked why Mr Stantham had wanted to see them. So Jason explained the conversation to them and the possible reward that they might receive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilots looked at each other and shrugged their shoulders. They were just going to have to wait for their reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, a new mission came through. This time, there was nothing difficult about it. The mission was to prevent a group of Lordakians and Saimon destroying a few big super cruisers with vital supplies on board. Only a couple of people were needed for the mission but all of the pilots decided to go just to make sure that there was no other potential threats that could possibly take out the cruisers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason flew out with a couple of other fighters to intercept the alien ships. The ships flanked the aliens and shot them down. All of a sudden, a message came through the communications unit in the ships. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message was crackling all of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there are any flyboys out there who are hearing this, we need assistance immediately as we are under heavy fire from what appears to be battle cruisers. We have already lost two of our engines. Send reinforcements as well if possible. Then the radio just went dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the pilots received the message and flew to the aid of the ships immediately. When they arrived they noticed that a small group of VRU battle cruisers in the area and engaged the cruisers immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFierce fighting raged and when the smoke had cleared the VRU cruisers that were left had retreated. Another victory it seems goes to the heroes of the EIC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the radio kicked back into life again, Thanks for your help. We thought that we were goners for a few minutes then. I really appreciate all of the help you gave us. Once we return home I am going to see your superior officer and get him to praise you for the work that you have done, not just for your officer but for EIC and the war. I hope I will see you guys in the bar tonight. I will buy you lot a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the radio went silent again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ships headed home, they noticed small explosions in the vicinity. Were they demolition mines that had not exploded or were they fireworks. After all, it was carnival time in space. It turned out that the explosions that were seen were in fact fireworks being set off from CFW-01 boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden a Mordon vessel came into view and started firing upon the ships. The cruisers were damaged beyond repair but pilots flying the ships managed to escape the ships by means of a small escape pod on the undercarriage of the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no backup to help the stranded pilots so the remaining fighters and bombers engaged their load compaction generators so that the pods could fit inside the cargo hold of the ships while Jason and a few other fighter pilots attacked the Mordon vessel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Small balls of blue fire erupted from the side of the vessel as the ship slowly disintegrated into smaller fragments. Flying back, an upgraded VRU Vengeance fighter came up from behind the ships and shot down 5 of the EIC Nostromo fighters. Turning round, Jason saw the pilot\u2019s face; it was one of his old school friends. Both fighters were locked in a bitter fight, eventually, Jason came out on top. Instead of killing him when he destroyed the Vengeance, he had picked up his school friend and took him back to the EIC base. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way back, a small formation of about 5-6 Streuners came into view, surrounding Jason. Firing his HST-02 5 way rocket launcher, one of the Streuners was destroyed, another two were damaged by flying debris while the other ships were shot down by the lone Liberator fighter amongst the heavier fighters of the 63rd Lowers wing, led by the most senior member of the EIC, Sgt James Easton along with the newest member to the EIC, Charlie Carlile, the school friend that Jason picked up after shooting down his ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning back to the base, they noticed that a hospital ship was in the hangar with casualties from the fighting elsewhere in the galaxy. Some of them were pilots and others were soldiers from the 91st orbital drop regiment. The base communications system rang out again saying that the pilots in the 63rd wing were to see the Lt. Com. Immediately, they went to down to the office of Lt. Com. Stantham. Still in their flight suits, they entered the office and in unison, saluted him. Lt. Stantham returned the salute and sat back down in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell lads, another fine mission today.\u201d Turning to Jason, Lt. Stantham asked him \u201cIs it true that there is a former member of VRU now in our ranks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir. There is. The person in question is one of my old school friends. I didn\u2019t want to kill him. Despite shooting down his fighter, I spared his life. To be honest sir, I think he wanted to be picked up by us as he was glad to see us when I picked him up from the escape pod\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLt. Stantham leant forward in his chair and asked to see the pilot. When Charlie stood forward, Lt. Stantham was amazed at the sheer height of him. Charlie stood at 6\u2019 1\u201d, 5\u201d inches taller than the Lt. himself. Charlie then stepped forward and saluted Lt. Stantham. At first, his saluted was not returned, then after a while, Lt. Stantham returned the salute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be the pilot that my boys rescued. Am I correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir\u201d was the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is your name then son?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarlile sir. Charlie Carlile\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then Mr Carlile, I\u2019m sure that you have met Mr Constansa\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir. We were school friends. After leaving the Space Academy, we sadly went our separate ways; I headed for VRU, while Jason headed for EIC\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lt. Com. later requested to see Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Mr Carlile, I would just like to say, welcome to EIC. You will be in the 63rd Lowers wing alongside Mr Constansa\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you sir\u201d. Charlie threw his hand up to salute his new Lt. Com. Then he walked out of the room to where Jason was standing and they both headed for Jason\u2019s rest quarters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCharlie, I know this may sound stupid, but what craft would you want to fly out on missions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI liked the Vengeance because it was easy to fly and well equipped. The only problem with it was its lack of speed. I need something better in terms of speed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have an idea, how about I buy you your ship and everything that you need to join the fight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Charlie liked the idea of letting Jason buy his ship. The alarms blared and the fighter pilots headed down towards the hangar. Charlie followed Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell? Why did you get a Vengeance? I told you that it lacked speed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you did. That\u2019s why I bought speed generators for it. Not just any old speed generators, but the best money can buy. I also fitted them and equipped the ship as well with new weapons and the ammo to go with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Jason\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome Charlie. Enough chat, we\u2019ve got a fight on our hands\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting up the ships engines shook the hull of both ships and with a mighty blast of heat; both fighters were now in the battlefield. Joining up with the rest of the 63rd Lowers wing to take the fight to the enemy. The smaller fighters were under attack from VRU and MMO fighters. The EIC fighters were severely damaged in the fight. While the fighters were fighting each other, landing parties from VRU and MMO were on their way to the EIC base. Moving to intercept them, both Jason and Charlie engaged their subsonic engines. Reaching the landing parties in almost no time at all, Charlie and Jason split and decided which party to fight. Charlie chose the MMO landing party while Jason fought the VRU party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth sets of landing craft were firing their defensive weapons against the fighters. But they dodged the fire and retaliated by firing volley after volley of laser fire. Next minute, a group of alien fighters joined the fight. It was now a 7-1 situation. Jason was clearly outnumbered, but can never be outgunned. Firing on the landing craft, they both spiralled out of control and were flying towards a deserted planet on the edge of the battle ground. The fighters started firing at Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they had finished, Jason emerged out of the smoke and ruins of the VRU landing party and rained destruction on the alien fighters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fighters exploded in a ball of white hot fire. Bigboy cruisers flew past Jason and joined up with the rest of the 63rd Lowers wing. Goliaths then flew past the Piranha and flew back to base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Charlie had lost Jason amongst the fierce fighting. Jason started to get worried. He sent a beacon that would hopefully alert Charlie of his position. Meanwhile, in his cockpit, Charlie watched out for the beacon and then checked his radar. There was nothing. Charlie started to worry about Jason. Had he been shot down by the landing craft?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, a small blip appeared on Charlie\u2019s eye piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould it be Jason?\u201d he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, it was. Charlie flew to the co-ordinates of the blip. As he got closer, he saw something stationary on the horizon. It was Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Charlie got closer, the small object got bigger and bigger until he could see the blue silhouette of the Piranha against the black expanse of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that Jason. You had me bloody worrying about you. I thought you had been shot down. There was no beacon to suggest that you were still flying\u201d Charlie shouted down the communication link in his ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know Charlie, I\u2019m sorry. I tried radioing through to base, nothing. I then tried to send a marker out, but the release mechanism malfunctioned. I tried sending out another beacon for you, but it just exploded as soon as it came into contact with the sky. Eventually the third one worked\u201d Jason replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying back to base, a new mission objective came through. It was to escort some Goliath bombers to destroy a major strategic outpost on Aeries 6, a small F-class planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying to the jump gate to rendezvous with the bombers, they saw a few drop ships as well. Inside each drop ship was machinery that had to be assembled on the surface to collect the ores that were to come to the surface once the ground troops had landed and had the bombers pummel the hell out of the outpost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they did not know was that Aeries 6 was inhabited by an alien race. This race had no name; they were just referred to as \u201cbugs\u201d. These aliens were ferocious fighters; they could kill a small unit. Their weak spot was their armour in their abdomen.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason heard one of the soldiers shout \u201cAlright lads, this is what we have prepared so long for. Let\u2019s show this alien scum what the elite space commandos are made of\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troops jeered. Another message came through on the craft communication link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll pilots in the area will be required to help us take down the main alien outposts before the bombers launch an assault on the main outpost on this godforsaken planet\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe radio went dead for a few seconds and then Sergeant Kaczynski hailed the fighters over a secure channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChief space pilot Constansa, how many fighters are in the area?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are only two heavily armed fighters. A Piranha and a Vengeance\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere about the cruisers? Well the hell are they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey had to fall back sir, we are the only ships left in the vicinity\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergeant Kaczynski sighed, and then said \u201cOK. Will you be able to help us out before the bombers get here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir. We could take half of the bug cities out. They will not know what the hell hit them\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Mr Constansa. Your CO will hear about this. Believe me; I will personally put in a good word about you. Sergeant Kaczynski over and out\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe radio went silent. The signal to mobilise then came through once the first wave of troops had landed on the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troops advanced and the fighters strafed the main cities. Once the advance had finished, the major cities had been obliterated. This meant that the bugs in the cities had all been killed, allowing the troops to push on without having to worry about a counter offensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fighters patrolled the area for any signs of life. There was a small city on the outskirts of what was once the biggest city. Moving in, the fighters strafed the area, killing anything that was not human. Once the area was clear, the troops could again move towards the outpost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 1 \u00bd hours, the troops were at the base of the trench where the outpost could be seen. Using a special laser guiding system to call in the bombers and supply the co-ordinates for them, the troops could move to safety of their drop site and watch the fireworks as the outpost burst into flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, to make sure that the bombers and the drop ships were safe from enemy craft, the bombers bought in reinforcements in the form of a Diminisher Goliath, a Solace Goliath and a Spectrum Goliath as well as a few Bigboy cruisers to support them if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you made it guys, but what\u2019s with the assistance? The two fighters helped us out taking out the major bug cities\u201d, Sergeant Kaczynski told the lead bomber pilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You mean that two of our fighters took on a whole armada of those things and annihilated them all?\u201d the pilot asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes they did. I\u2019m glad that they were in the vicinity at the time. They really helped us ground troops out\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the technicians got to work on building the robots that would collect the ore from the disturbed surface. The bombers came in and struck the outpost with everything that they had. Once the bombing was over, all that was left of the position was debris, even that was melting and disintegrating under the sheer heat of the fire. Meanwhile, on the other side of the battle ground, the operator took control of the robot and sent it on its way. Passing through the twisted metal and debris, the robot came to a sudden halt when the operator saw the ore on the ground, picking up as much of the ore as it could possibly hold in its cargo hold. The remaining ore was collected by Charlie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverhead, the drop ships were lining themselves up to retrieve the troops from on the ground. Small troop ships came through the sky. The robot\u2019s operator quickly turned the robot around and bought it back to the FDP Forward Drop Position) where it could be strapped into the cargo hold of the ship. Once all of the troops had boarded the ships, they set off towards the huge drop ships that were in orbit over the planet\u2019s atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaunching into orbit, Charlie and Jason punched through the planet\u2019s atmosphere with the troop ships behind them and the bombers bringing up the rear of the train. The bomber reinforcements took off to clear a path for the rest of the ships to fly home. One of the bombers stayed below the atmosphere. To make sure that there was no trace of any fighting, the bomber would find the exact location so that he could release his ordnance and it would lead straight to the planet\u2019s core, obliterating the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bomber knew that he was coming up to his target as the infrared camera on board the ship showed heat coming from a blacked out dome inside the middle of what used to be the second biggest city on Aeries 6 before it was raised to the ground. When he got close to his target, his ordnance dropped exactly into the shaft and kept going down. Just before the ordnance exploded, the last bomber flew to safety and met up with the rest of the team, excluding Charlie and Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This was because Charlie and Jason joined the soldiers on the deck of the marine\u2019s flagship, the UNSMC Independence with both of their fighters secured in the hangar bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason excused himself and hailed Lt. Stantham<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, Carlile and I are aboard the UNSMC Independence, awaiting the arrival of the bomber fleet. Once they have arrived, we are coming home\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK then Constansa. Take care and give my thanks to Mr Carlile as well for me\u201d Lt. Stantham replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will sir\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour or so, the bomber fleet arrived at the rendezvous point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry guys, we\u2019ve got to go. Our bomber fleet has arrived and we have to escort them home. Hope to see you guys soon\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergeant Kaczynski stood up and shook hands of both Jason and Charlie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for all of your help today pilots; we would not have been about to carry out our mission if it wasn\u2019t for your support. Remember Mr Constansa, I will be talking with your CO about what happened today\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Sergeant. Wish your boys the best of luck in the future. Take care of yourself as well\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. All of the boys wish you two flyboys the best of luck for the future, and just remember, you were the true heroes today. Make sure that you take care guys. Hope to see you soon\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Charlie shook Kaczynski\u2019s hand and left. All of the soldiers in the bar applauded their bravery as they headed towards the hangar bay to collect their ships and fly home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting up their engines, they left the hangar slowly and in single file to avoid colliding with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bombers were waiting on the opposite side of the UNSMC Independence for their escorts. The bombers saw the fighters and met up with them. As soon as they reached the gate, they switched from main engines to their jump engines for that massive jump home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they reached the home gate, a welcoming committee greeted their arrival with fireworks and cheers. They knew that there would be celebrations aboard the base. Flying in close formation, they reached the hangar door of the base. The shields were lowered which allowed the ships to enter the bay. Jumping out of the fighter cockpits, both pilots leaped on to the ground of the hangar and walked casually out of the hangar and into the corridor that led to the mess hall.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the pilots reached the mess hall, they went to get food before chatting about the events that happened earlier in the day. Zach walked up to Jason and Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations. I hear you two helped the Marines decimate a whole planet. Charlie, what was it like being in your first mission for EIC? Did you enjoy it? How did it feel to be alongside Jason?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, Charlie could not speak. Eventually, he plucked up the courage to turn round and say \u201cIt felt different, more enjoyable. This was not something that I did when I was in VRU. Our only mission was to collect ore from planets and shot down ships. I quite enjoyed raining death and destruction down onto an unsuspecting race\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason walked in and alerted Zach and Charlie of a new mission that he had just received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new mission was to destroy a small scout ship, possibly an enemy ship. Could it have been from MMO, VRU or possibly an alien ship? Nobody knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach and Charlie jumped up out of their seats and followed Jason down towards the hangar where their ships were waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach had problems with his ship, so he thought it good to stay while Jason and Charlie destroyed the scout ship. Battle cruisers and super cruisers supported them as Charlie and Jason were the \u2018bombers\u2019, carrying delayed detonation plasma bombs (DDPB) and rockets to make sure that the ship was unrecognisable after the mission had finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth pilots split and went for different ends of the scout ship. Jason would attack the hangar while Charlie would attack the weapons and then assist Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were flames funnelling from all sides of the ship as the weapon batteries were destroyed. Charlie now flew inside to help Jason destroy the hangar. All of a sudden, the ship started shaking, knocking both fighter/bombers about a bit before stabilising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d was the cry over the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit, it seems that MMO fighters have arrived to protect the ship from us\u201d was the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod I hate those MMO bastards. OK, the bombs have been dropped and we are getting out of here. We will rendezvous with you guys in 3 minutes on the port side of the ship. Thanks for the backup guys\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK Jason, message received\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCharlie, you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no response. Something must be up with Charlie\u2019s ship. Flying back into the hangar, Jason noticed that Charlie was injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSergeant, call for a medic ship NOW. Tell them that we have one injury. <br>\r\nDon\u2019t know how bad it is at the moment\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK Jason. The ship is on its way. One of the Goliath co-pilots took control of Charlie\u2019s Vengeance while Jason took the unconscious Charlie aboard his ship as he waited for the medical ship to arrive. Within minutes, the medical ship had arrived to take Charlie back to base. The scout ship erupted a few minutes later. The sonic wave shook every single ship in the area. The EIC ships were well protected against any EMP blast, where as the MMO fighters were not as well protected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMMO cruisers followed the wing. Shouting came over the radio. It was now time for the MMO to take revenge against the EIC ships. The occasional lucky shot would rock Jason\u2019s ship. All of a sudden, 2 MMO Goliath battle cruisers were now facing the cockpit of the Piranha. Jason knew that there was no way that his small fighter could take on 2 heavily armoured and well equipped battle cruisers. Little did they know that Jason cloaked and got behind one of them. The lead Goliath shook violently, causing the pilot to knock himself unconscious. This meant that the other Goliath was now in trouble if he could not find or even hit Jason. The huge centre cannon of the Goliath fired volley after volley of RSB-50 ammunition towards nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for the Goliath pilot, one of the shots had hit Jason, uncloaking him. Jason knew that the only way to take the Goliath down was to shoot it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, it was easier said than done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goliath put up one hell of a fight. After about 2 hours of fierce fighting, the Piranha emerged from the smoke and joined the other ships. The pilot of the stranded Goliath regained consciousness and followed them to the gate. Was it a sign of desperation or yet another betrayal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA message came through over the radio. It was from the MMO pilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell happened back there? I can not remember\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot tried again; still, there was no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain and again, the pilot tried to communicate with the EIC guys, but there was no reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, he just gave up trying to communicate and followed the EIC pilots back to their base. Jason happened to stop for a moment. He saw the pilot fly past and intercepted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiring a couple of warning shots, Jason had caught the attention of the lone Goliath pilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot then turned his ship around. He was now facing possibly one of the best EIC pilots that had ever existed. Charlie saw that Jason was no longer with the wing and turned round to find him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot of the Goliath called over the radio, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWarning you off any possible attack on my wing is what I\u2019m doing. Now if you would be so kind, just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Jason could finish his sentence, Charlie arrived and started talking to the Goliath pilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out that the Goliath pilot used to be one of Charlie\u2019s old gaming partners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, Charlie, you know this guy?\u201d Jason enquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJason, don\u2019t you remember Rob? We were gaming partners in school\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJason? Is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it is. What are you doing in MMO?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter graduation, they put me straight into the MMO pilot scheme. I don\u2019t really want to stay there. They treated me like shit\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason now felt sympathetic towards Rob. \u201cI tell you what, you follow Charlie and me and we will make sure that nothing like this happens again alright.\u201d<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Zach was still at the jump gate, waiting for Jason and Charlie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know that they would be bringing along a friend of theirs. As soon as they got within sight of the jump gate, Zach immediately saw the Goliath and armed his weapons. Balls of energy lit up the nose of his ship.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is it because I have a Goliath behind me?\u201d Jason questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it is\u201d was the response that Jason got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Zach know was that Rob was a \u201cprisoner\u201d that was \u201cintercepted\u201d before he could \u201cattack\u201d the wing. It was all a cover up for what was really going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach then questioned Jason about where they found him and what they intend to do with him after they had \u2018interrogated\u2019 him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould they throw him in jail or would they speak to their CO about making Rob part of their wing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZach, do you mind turning off your radio, as it seems to be interfering with the jump mechanism\u201d Charlie requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u201d was the last word said before Jason, Charlie, Zach and Rob jumped back through the gate on their way back to the EIC base.<br>\r\nThey then headed home when a small group of Streuners arrived. No worries, Jason and Charlie shot every single last one down in less than 3 minutes before re joining Rob and Zach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that guys, we had to shoot down those motherfucking Streuners. They are nothing more than pests\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they reached the base, Jason and Charlie left Zach to take Rob to see their CO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Charlie then joined the \u2018interrogation\u2019. As soon as a decision was reached, Jason, Charlie and Rob were dismissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie asked Rob what it felt like being a Goliath pilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated to begin with, but when you get used to it, everything becomes much easier\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason heard footsteps behind him. It was Zach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, we have a new mission. It\u2019s top secret. I\u2019m the only one that knows about it. I will brief you when we reach the hangar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach joins Jason, Charlie and Rob and they head down to the hangar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Zach, are you gonna tell what our fucking mission is then or not?\u201d Charlie verbalized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach disclosed the mission to them and told them to get ready for a potentially dangerous mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey prepared their ships for launch, followed by a couple of cruisers. Their mission was to disable the main Streuner carrier base and then launch as assault on the VRU\u2019s D-class Light Corvette ship without being spotted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a tall order. Could they handle the pressure of attacking two bases in the same sortie? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping through the main gate, they arrived at the next world before flying to another gate, where they would arrive at yet another world in which the Streuner carrier base could be found. They jumped through the gate and headed straight for the ship. Each pilot cloaked their ship before reaching the carrier. There was no defence as the cloaked ships strafed and bombarded the alien carrier with as little ammo as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the Streuner carrier had been destroyed, the small squadron headed for Beta Centurion 9 where they would find the VRU Corvette. The main focus was to disable its defences and its shields before launching a full scale assault. The only person that really knew the ship well was Charlie. He decided that he would be the one to take revenge on the VRU once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the other pilots tried to convince him that taking out the Corvette on his own would be totally suicidal, Charlie was determined to rid himself of all of the morbid memories of his time in VRU.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Charlie admitted that he would be stupid to do it alone. The pilots helped him while the cruisers acted as fighters (despite their enormous size and weight) if trouble was to crop up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was really no need for the cruisers to be their as the fighters got to work annihilating the ship from the inside out. Just after the pilots had finished their mission and had launched to safety, a huge sub-atomic explosion filled the sky in a brilliant white light. Shrapnel flew everywhere and small chunks of this shrapnel hit the fighters. None of the fighters were damaged by it. They just flew off back to the gate when the Diminisher pilot spotted some activity from Beta Centurion 9. It turns out that the Corvette was a decoy to cover up a huge construction site above the planet\u2019s surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying down to investigate, Rob found dockyards as well as ship building facilities. There were control stations watching the manufacturing process of the ships as well as overseeing that the workers were OK. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely undetected, Rob delivers an almighty blow to the VRU ship building facilities. Meanwhile, above the planet, VRU ships had been sent to intercept the attacking forces. Before they got anywhere near the planet, they had been shot down by Zach, Jason and Charlie. Anti-ship batteries started firing, but by the time that the gunners had got fired the tracers, Rob was long gone. Unfortunately, a VRU Corvette had arrived carrying ships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the Corvette, Zach, Jason and Charlie swung into combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh for fuck sake. How the fuck am I gonna destroy that bastard?\u201d Rob shouted over the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna, we are. Just get your fucking backside home NOW!\u201d Zach replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying to safety, Rob had shot down a few dozen alien ships and a few VRU fighters as they prevented him from getting to the gate. After destroying the Corvette, Zach, Jason and Charlie flew back to meet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was yet another surprise in store for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out that one of the ships from the construction yard had escaped, but it was pretty damaged. This made it easy prey for the fighters. But shooting it down with cannon fire would prove to be highly impossible. The only way to destroy it was to fire volley after volley of multi-angle broadside rockets. The fighters attracted the fighter to the vicinity before disappearing again. This meant that the cruisers could launch their attacks against the ship. After a long fought battle, the enemy ship had been shot down. It headed straight for the planet\u2019s surface. All of a sudden, the pilots could see a huge sub-atomic cloud from the resulting explosion when the ship had touched the ground. The cloud was now clearly visible when the dust had cleared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cruiser that Rob was flying was under attack from both alien ships and enemy fighters. Jumping to intercept them, Charlie and Jason split to draw the fighters away from Rob\u2019s Goliath. The aliens went after Charlie while the more experienced fighter pilots went after Jason. The fighters launched an almighty barrage of cannon fire against Jason. Most of the shots missed. The few that had actually hit him scraped the body work without causing any major damage. In fact, there was no damage at all. Jason now engaged his cannons before raining hell on the enemy fighters. A few of the fighters went down, many of them were damaged beyond repair so the pilots just left them and the survivors of the battle retreated back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Charlie was having fun shooting down alien fighters and heavy ships. Jason later joined the rest of the smallish squadron before bolting towards the jump portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob radioed through to Charlie and Jason \u201cThanks guys, I thought I was a goner, if you two hadn\u2019t shown up in the nick of time, you would have to take me bag in a coffin. Thanks\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Charlie then answered Rob. They split formation for one more skirmish of the day. None of the other pilots notice a Devolarium vessel in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Devolarium vessel was heavily defended. This meant that shooting it down would take a long time. In fact, from Jason\u2019s previous experience of shooting down Devo\u2019s, fighting would still be going on after 4 hours. As it was, there were three ships to fight the Devo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would hopefully make the fight shorter. And it did make it shorter. In fact, instead of the fight lasting over 4 hours, because there were three ships, the fight took 2 hours. They were battering the hell of the Devolarium ship with rockets, cannon/ battery fire and mines. The Devo eventually went down.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After taking down the Devo, the pilots headed back to the gate where they would meet up with Zach and a couple of the cruiser pilots and head back to base. As soon as they reached the other side of the portal, two Sibleon ships and a small armada of Saimon ships were waiting for them. The Saimon ships were easily dispatched before the real test got underway. The cruisers fought the leading Sibleon ship while the fighters fought the second, weaker Sibleon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth alien vessels went down in a massive cloud of red smoke and flames. When they reached the planet\u2019s surface below, there was an almighty explosion which could be heard many miles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank fuck for that. I\u2019m glad that\u2019s over\u201d Rob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know how you feel\u201d replied Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the group reformed, they headed home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got home, they were met by nobody. Nobody else knew about the mission apart from the mission commanders and Lt. Stantham. Zach led the fighter group to their respective hangar, while Rob followed the cruisers to their respective hangar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving their ships, they all headed down to the bar for a drink. As they were heading to the bar, Lt. Stantham called them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of you lot. You have shown the enemy what the EIC is made of. For your courage, I am promoting you all from Chief Space Pilots to Basic Sergeants. You all deserve remunerations for your hard and valuable work that you are doing to help keep us on top in this war. Dismissed\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the newly promoted Basic Sergeants left Lt. Stantham\u2019s office, they headed down to the bar. Meanwhile, in his office, Lt. Stantham was wondering what remuneration the pilots deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pondering on the idea, Lt. Stantham decided that the pilots needed rest as well as new equipment. Unsure of what to get, Lt. Stantham decided to forget about that for now. His main duty was to keep command of EIC and its entire population.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe that as it may, it was now the turn of the pilots to celebrate their resounding victory. Jason casually walked over to the bar and ordered the first round of drinks. Paying for the drinks, he walked back to the table where the rest of the guys were and handed out their respective drinks. There was nobody else in the bar except themselves. After about 20 minutes, Lt. Stantham walked into the bar and ordered his drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then sat down with the pilots and discussed his plans with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight gentlemen, for your hard work, I am allowing you to take a few days rest to do what you want, as well as having new equipment\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing their drinks, Lt. Stantham bought the next round of drinks for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I understand Mr Constansa that you were looking for something within your ship. What was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell sir, it was the computer\u2019s reserve power unit. I wonder if I lost it when we [the fighters] took out the dud VRU Corvette. I had it before the mission, but after taking the Corvette down, it had gone missing\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had not been able to find it when he jumped out of the cockpit. As it was, there was valuable tactical and ship information on the reserve thankfully could not be accessed without the power unit. As it was, a replacement part had been located. All Jason had to do was to hook up the unit to the computer and hope it works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 3-4 hours in the bar, the pilots and Lt. Stantham left. As the rest of the pilots headed for their rooms, Jason had visited the armoury and picked up the replacement. He then headed to his Piranha. Activating the reserve computer would require the help of power from the reserve engines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEngaging the reserve engines, Jason placed the new part into the computer unit. All of a sudden, the reserve computer had finished configuring and calibrating the new part and now it could now reboot. After a few seconds, the computer sprung into life. Jason could now shut off the reserve engines. The computer still functioned properly, despite there not being any power from the engines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning off the computer, Jason quickly jumped out of the cockpit and headed towards his quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night went by slowly. As it progressed, Jason started to become restless, so to prevent himself getting bored, he decided to listen to his favourite music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Jason and the rest of the pilots headed down to the mess hall for their early meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours were spent relaxing and chilling.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two weeks went by without any fighting. All of the pilots needed something to do so they found something to entertain themselves for a while. They decided to turn themselves into sportsmen for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main sport that all of the pilots used to watch during their childhood was motorsport. As it was, they all wondered what it was like to be in the shoes of a racing drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, they pursued that theory and placed themselves in the footsteps of their idols. Being of English heritage, Jason decided to be a British racing driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis idol was none other than Jenson Button (2009 F1 world Champion). All of the other pilots decided that they would be their respected drivers from the same sport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all voted on where to have the race. They all chose that the race would take place at Silverstone racing circuit in England (although the pilots were in another part of space, they could recreate the race that they had watched many years ago).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe race lasted about 2 hours, by that time; the pilots were having too much fun to notice that one of the Goliath pilots had been given a notice. After 2 hours, the result of the race was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\tRob- as Mark Webber <br>\r\n2.\tCharlie- as Bruno Senna <br>\r\n3.\tJason- as Jenson Button <br>\r\n4.\tZach- as Lewis Hamilton <br>\r\n5.\tChris- as Sebastian Vettel <br>\r\n6.\tJames- as Fernando Alonso <br>\r\n7.\tMichael- as Felipe Massa <br>\r\n8.\tJanick- as Kimi Raikkonen <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining drivers did not bother about their race position. They just had fun, which to them, was the best way to think in events like this. They did not care who won and who lost; they just wanted to have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian, the Goliath pilot walked in with the notice. It was another mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole of the 63rd Lowers Wing were to infiltrate and destroy Allesan 3 (pronounced All-I-Sarn), a pirate base well known for harbouring an elite group of space pirates. These pirates were ruthless. They had no respect for anybody else. They would annihilate anybody that tried to stop them. They simply decimated the entire Uppers quadrant before making their way to the Lowers quadrant. They would stop at nothing until they had reclaimed everything that they had lost when they were being repelled many centuries ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only way to attack the base was to launch a nuclear assault against it as the pirates wanted revenge for what had happened to their forefathers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe base had allsorts of various ships, from fighters to bombers (also used as kamikaze ships) and heavy battalion cruisers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were protected by a group of aliens known as Vagrants. The Vagrants had basic weapons, but they packed one hell of a punch. If anybody strayed into their territory, they would seek down that ship and obliterate it before it could retreat. Like the pirates, the Vagrants were a ruthless race who had no respect for anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould nothing stop the Vagrants or the pirates? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at base, the pilots found their respective ships and engaged the engines. Each pilot had no idea what Lt. Stantham had done to their ships. They called up their schematics for their own ships and found out what upgrades had been installed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goliaths had a new design to them, while the fighters had highly advanced weaponry to show their aggression against the Vagrants. Could anybody stop the EIC when they got going? To help them with their mission, Lt. Stantham also installed advanced computers so that the pilots could feel at home with their favourite music playing. As it was, Lt. Stantham had checked through the bio for each pilot and decided that they would have whatever they liked played through the computer. Most of pilots listened to rock music, while Jason, Charlie, Rob and Zach listened to bands such as Pendulum, (particularly songs from all of their albums; Hold Your Colour, In Silico and Immersion). However, to help them focus on their mission, they had bands from different metal/ rock genres and post-hardcore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the 63rd Lowers had reached the invasion gate, Lt. Stantham had joined them in a heavily armed \u2018almost flying tank-like\u2019 Diminisher super cruiser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all activated their jump engines for the jump to the pirate world. By the time they reached the battlefield, there were swarms of Vagrants in the vicinity ready to destroy them. These alien drones fired their primary weaponry, but the EIC ships retaliated in a violent way. The battle with the first wave was long and hard. But that was only part of the obstacle. The Vagrants turned their attention to Lt. Stantham\u2019s Diminisher. They opened fire with everything that they had. The ship was taking hits, but they were only against the shields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Diminisher shook under the vibrations. More Vagrant vessels arrived and opened fire. The Diminisher fought back. Firing its defensive cannons, Vagrants were falling left right and centre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, more Vagrant ships arrived and the Diminisher had no other defence against the armada of ships. Hailing Jason and the Goliath pilots, they turned round ready to defend the Diminisher from the Vagrants. Giving the Vagrants hell was easier said than done. Those ships were well armoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goliath pilots led the Vagrants away, right into the path of Jason. Firing everything that they had, the Vagrants failed to even hit Jason\u2019s shielding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 35 minutes of continuous fire, the Vagrant ships had run out of ammo. It was now Jason\u2019s turn to strike fear into the Vagrant ranks. While all of this was going on, the pirates were preparing for a massive combat mission in order to protect their home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pirates prepared, Jason and his fellow Goliath pilots struck fear into the drones and placed the pirates under pressure as their defence had been knocked out. The Diminisher was still in the fight, but it had lost some of its defensive armament. This did not worry Lt. Stantham. He knew that his pilots would be the ones to finally stop the pirates from expanding their territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 30 minutes flying, the ships reached the pirates\u2019 base. They noticed that the base was shielded. There was no shielding on the mast of the base. This would the prime target for an assault. Some of the fighters flew up with the bombers for their attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping their payloads, the bombers retreated as the fighters fired nuclear warheads into the centre shaft to cause the explosion to become greater than it would have been on its own if it was just the bombs that detonated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllesan 3 shook violently and then erupted. It was now starting to implode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe implosions caused pressure to build up within the main sector. This pressure eventually became so great; it caused the implosions to shift outwards. The base was now nothing more than one huge fireball in space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other way back, the pilots had to resort to their advanced jump CPU units to get them back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter jumping back home having destroyed Allesan 3, the pilots now enjoyed time to reflect on the mission and look forward to missions in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys headed down to the bar along with Lt. Stantham who thanked Jason, Rob and the other Goliath pilots for defending him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent most of the night drinking, chatting and joking. This was the first time that Lt. Stantham had been on a mission with his pilots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw first hand how accurate the bombers were and how accurate the fighters were when they released their nuclear warheads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also saw how Jason and his fellow pilots came to the rescue of their CO when he was in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small conversation about the mission soon started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you do that often?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo what sir?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp out a fellow pilot who is in trouble?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir, we do\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed with your teamwork, as well as how accurate the bombers and the fighters were when releasing their payloads\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilots did not know what to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all of a sudden, Zach was asked how they could become so accurate. The reply that Lt. Stantham got pleased him even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach had told Lt. Stantham that the reason that the fighters and bombers were so accurate was because they had been working on their accuracy in both firing and bombing ranges.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another week went by without any fighting. The 63rd Lowers Wing pilots were getting extremely restless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the week had gone by, Jason received a new mission notice. He was to join two other pilots who had volunteered their services to shut down a drill that had been used to mine valuable resources.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, to shut the drill down, Jason and his fellow pilots would have to drop from a small dropship above the planet\u2019s surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they prepared their suits for the jump, Lt. Stantham arrives in the hangar \u201cGood luck men. Whatever happens out there, I would like to say that you three are the bravest and best fighting men that ever stepped in to an EIC uniform\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaluting the pilots, Lt. Stantham left the hangar while Jason and his fellow soldiers put the final touches to their suits. One of the most senior pilots was responsible for the explosive charges. Mission control on the base was aware of the mission; however, the only way to stay in touch with them was through in suit communication links.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dropship prepared itself for the mission, the weapons were being loaded with ammunition just in case it was to encounter any hostile alien ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot\u2019s jumpsuits were equipped with extra compartments for the charges as well as any other equipment as well as one weapon compartment for any enemies that were required for the mission. The suits also contained self-retracting and self-packing parachutes. These parachutes would be used when the pilots were 4,500ft above the drill platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dropship arrived over the target, the pilots donned their helmets for the jump. After the pilots were ready, they were dropped into the planet\u2019s atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pilots descended, the dropship left the upper atmosphere. Once they were within 4,500ft of the platform, the parachutes deployed. Slowing down at a rapid rate caused a bit of pain for everybody, but the pain was only the initial shock of the rapid deceleration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the pain subsided after a few minutes. The pilots then shook the pain off and continued with their mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding on the platform, Jason had a perfect opportunity to call the others in. However, the parachute on Ulrichsson\u2019s suit had not deployed properly until it was too late. Although he had managed to land on the platform, the velocity at which he was travelling was enough to cause Ulrichsson to fall off the edge and smash against the base of the platform, face first. Glass from his helmet flew everywhere. Some of the smaller shards hit him in the face. He was now hurtling towards the ground, FAST.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis only chance of surviving the incident was Olan. Olan was the other pilot that volunteered for this mission. He had called for emergency assistance for Ulrichsson. The dropship arrived back over the planet\u2019s surface and locked onto Ulrichsson and bought him back aboard, where a medical ship was waiting in the cargo bay ready to take Ulrichsson back to base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter receiving Ulrichsson, the medical ship jumped back to where the base was located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back on the drill platform, Olan and Jason had to deal with enemy soldiers. As Jason was fighting one of the soldiers, another one opened fire on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slug narrowly missed his head. However, the round hit the shooter\u2019s comrade in the chest. This caused the soldier to fall off the platform and the soldier hurtled to the ground. After dispatching the soldier that Olan was fighting, a fire fight broke out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBullets zipped across the platform until the soldier was killed with a single laser round to the head. Slumping to the ground, the alien was pushed off of the platform. Picking up the rifle that the alien had dropped, Olan took a shot at the mechanism that was driving the drill. However, nothing happened. The only way to destroy the mechanism and the drill was with explosives. Ulrichsson was responsible for the explosives, but as he had been taken to hospital, there was no way to destroy the mechanism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr was there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out that the suits had small charges in them as well. This gave Jason an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Olan, check your suit\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Olan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just remembered something. These suits also have small explosive charges in them\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the charges, Olan and Jason knew that to stop the drill, they would need to consider the location of the explosives relative to that of the mechanism and the fuel line that was driving the drill (basically placing the charges close to the mechanism).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing the exact location of the fuel line and the mechanism allowed easy access for the explosives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling in the dropship once more, Olan and Jason beamed back aboard and then detonated the charges. Explosions ripped apart the drill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the dropship got clear of the atmosphere, ships surrounded it and started firing. Within minutes, EIC fighters arrived on the scene. One of them was Charlie in his Vengeance Lightning (sometimes known as the Tempest, the Vengeance Lightning is an upgraded version of the standard Vengeance that allows a pilot to activate the \u2018afterburner\u2019 capability that allows them to get involved in combat quicker). Charlie quickly destroyed the alien ships while the other fighters dealt with the other alien ships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d the dropship pilot shouted. The drill was connected to a huge alien cargo ship, escorted by alien fighters and corvettes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestroying the cargo ship was too hard for the fighters to do on their own, so they called in their cruisers and bombers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corvettes were easy enough to destroy for the fighters to destroy. The cruisers and bombers (armed with sub-atomic rockets and nuclear missiles instead of bombs) arrived quickly and launched hit-and-run attacks on the cargo ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 90 minutes of constant attacks, the cargo ship was severely damaged and the ships had run out of ammo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dropship put the final nail in the coffin as it launched 2 plasma torpedoes and 2 volleys of RSB-50 ammo into the heart of the cargo ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship erupted and the shockwave rocked the dropship. Turning round to the pilot, Olan asks, \u201cDo you think we will be able to take much more of this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot replied \u201cAt this rate, these shockwaves could rip us apart. Even with shields up, we would not stand a chance\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dropship accelerated from its current speed to speeds exceeding hypersonic. It disappeared in a flash of light. Still the shockwaves occurred, but the dropship was well away from the waves.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the ship dropped out of hypersonic, they were greeted by a small squadron of VRU fighters. The fighters started shooting at the huge dropship, only to have PLD-3 (PLD stands for Plasma Laser Discharge) rockets fired back at them from the dropship. Some of the fighters had been destroyed and some of them had been damaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 rockets were fired from a broadside rocket launcher on a VRU Nostromo fighter. The rockets hit the dropship\u2019s shields. However, the dropship did not even wobble slightly. Arming its 5 Hellstorm launchers with ECO-10 and HSTRM-02 rockets, the dropship locked onto two hidden ships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explosions from the detonating rockets had un-cloaked the hidden fighters. All of a sudden, a small battalion of the EIC\u2019s new Hellfire cruisers obliterated the fighters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the fight, the Hellfire cruisers disappeared and the dropship flew back to the jump gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck were those things?\u201d Olan asked Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason replied, \u201cTo be honest, I have no idea. Whatever the hell they are, they were ours\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlan looked puzzled. The pilot turned to Jason and Olan and said, \u201cThose ships you saw are our new Hellfire heavy mega cruisers\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what they were then\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the EIC\u2019s base planet of Estriola 8, the dropship released Olan and Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the transporter room of the EIC main base, the chief engineer locked onto Olan and Jason. Within seconds, they were back on the EIC base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLt. Stantham was also in the transporter room when Jason and Olan emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations gentlemen, you\u2019ve done it again. You\u2019ve once again shown that EIC are the best in this war. Keep it up\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you sir\u201d Jason and Olan responded and saluted him as Lt Stantham left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading straight for the medical wing, Jason and Olan were keen to know how Ulrichsson was after his accident on the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the nurses came to the doorway as Jason and Olan arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse kindly asked \u201cMay I help you two gentlemen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlan replied \u201cYes ma\u2019am. We are keen to know how our comrade is. Are we allowed to see him ma\u2019am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe pilot who arrived here arrived here with bad injuries from glass shattering in his face whilst on a mission?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am\u201d Olan replied. \u201cIs he alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse replied, \u201cI\u2019ve got good news and I\u2019ve got bad news. The good news is that your comrade is alive and in a stable condition. The bad news is that he will not be able to join you on missions as one of his facial nerves was badly damaged. We won\u2019t know the full extent of the damage until he comes out of surgery. Had he been bought in later, he probably would not have survived. If he did survive, he would probably be permanently paralyzed\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you ma\u2019am\u201d Jason said to the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll let him know that you two wanted to talk to him when he comes around from the anaesthetic\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the ward, Olan could breathe a sigh of relief knowing that Ulrichsson had survived from his horrific ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two hours, Ulrichsson had returned from surgery. One of the nurses let Jason and Olan know that their comrade was back from surgery. They went down to see him. He was still under anaesthetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Ulrichsson came round. He smiled at Jason and Ulrichsson and in his native language whispered, \u201cHur \u00e4r ni? Hur gick uppdraget v\u00e4gen? Gick det bra? (How are you guys? How did the mission go? Did it go well?)\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason replied in Swedish \u201cDet \u00e4r bra att h\u00f6ra dig. Vi \u00e4r glad att du \u00e4r vid liv. Uppdraget var en stor framg\u00e5ng. Vi hade en grov skjuts hem \u00e4nd\u00e5\u201d. In English, that translates to \u201cIt's good to hear you. We're glad you're alive. The mission was a huge success. We had a rough ride home though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small chuckle from Ulrichsson made Jason and Olan glad that they saved his life. To hear that the mission had been accomplished made Ulrichsson smile with joy. However, deep down, he was full of despair as he felt that he had let the side down after his accident. He felt like he had hampered the mission by not finishing the job off with his comrades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat else could he do when he was unconscious and hurtling towards the ground at a rapid pace?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for letting you guys down\u201d Ulrichsson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck have you got to be sorry about? It was an accident. Accidents happen all of the time. We\u2019re just lucky that Olan was around to call for backup when he did\u201d Jason replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse came back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr Ulrichsson, it seems that the damage to your facial nerve was not as bad as we first thought when you first came here. Your nerve should be more efficient if not perfect within a few months. For now, just rest and get stronger.\u201d</span></div></div>",
