You start to get a little terrified. What if no one finds you? That's when you realize that you are standing near the house that some guy recently just moved into. He seemd like, 20-25 years old, and seemed nice enough. Maybe you should go to his house?</span></div></div>",

He sure keeps clean in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your right you see a telephone cord, this may be the ticket to reach the top. An athlete in gym class, you always showed your skills on the rope climb. You charged up the telephone cord at a breakneck speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reach the counter top and collapse in relief. From here he will surely be able to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------<br>\r\nAfter about an hour, a deafening crack rips through the silence as the giant opens his door. He stands there in his tight grey shirt and tiny dark blue shorts. Sweat is dripping off him in torrents. His armpits have a thick, dark film of sweat stains, his gorgeous dark skin glistens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walks over to the counter, he gives his enormous groin a scratch, completely unaware of the tiny visitor. He towers above you, you could swear he was looking right at you...alas he was reaching for his mail behind you. As he stands above you, reading it,he towers at such a height that his mammoth, sweaty groin is at eye level with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe checks the oven to make sure his dinner is cooking, without taking his eyes off the wad of letters that had been sent to him. You edge closer to the giant, the smell of his groin is strong through the tiny shorts. His legs burst from the openings like dark monoliths. As you reach him however he turns around, resting his firm yet plump ass on the counter. The smell of 22 year old ass is intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run your hands along the firm ass, bound tightly behind the sweaty workout shorts. The fat and muscle react, twitching to your touch. His massive hand comes around. You are lucky enough to spot it from the corner of your eye. You jump back as the fingers dig into the sweaty crack. The nails scratch along the material as the mass behind it move fluidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant man is unable to satisfy his itch, so the massive hand descends under the fabric of the shorts. As he scratches, the smell that wafts out is of sweat, shit and man. An intoxicating scent for your tiny nostrils. As the hand retreats from the glutes, the tiny shorts now ride low, revealing to you this giant has no tan line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giant bends over to check his meal, he catches a waft of his body odour through his underarms. He raises his right arm up, displaying his massive bicep, inhaling the sweaty scent. Both arms return to the bottom of the shirt, as if like a calvin klein ad, he peels the wet shirt off his body, revealing his massive torso. It is his kitchen, why not be comfortable. Now he is facing you, you watch as a bead of sweat drops from his hair. It runs down the slight stubble and onto the firm,broad chest. it passes the massive nipple as it descends off the amazing pectoral. The pace of it quickens as it rushes along his abs, across the V-line of his hips and into the tiny patch of pubic forest that pokes above his now-low riding shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rests one hand ontop of the table. You crawl upon the fingertip unnoticed. The detail of the skin is amazing at the size and the smell is indicative that this is the hand he used to scratch himself. With a breakneck speed the hand begins to move.</span></div></div>",

The sweat continues to pump out of the giant man, creating a slick surface on which you try to maintain footing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel the giant moving about beneath you. You journey through his hair undetected. His scent is now familar to you as you breath it in constantly in this humid environment. After a long period of time, a pool-sized drop of water crashes down onto you. Sure enough another follows at incredible speed. The ground beneath becomes harder to grip on to. You reach out for any holding, but find yourself slipping around. Finally one hair provides a grip for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arch your neck to see a moon-sized silver object as the source of the water. The giant is taking a shower. A tidal wave of cold, pink liquid flows over you. Two mammoth hands come into view. As the hands massage the pink ocean,tossing you about, your landscape begins to foam up. Torrents of water return as the hands continue their massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are pushed by the dirty fingers off the scalp. With a sickening thud you land on a hard surface. Looking around, you see the giant is still unaware of you and you have indeed landed on </span></div></div>",

The other hand joins, and they slowly peel off the giant silver and white Nike Shox. You enjoy the excellent view from your position on the man's wrist. You are so tiny that he doesn't feel your presence there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lets his shoe dangle, fall off, then hit the floor. His hands move in and begin to massage his foot, and you still stand on his wrist. At your size, you enjoy a very detailed point of view. You can see all the teeny, tiny square patterns covering the whole white, sweaty sock that his foot lay inside, colored dark in some places by sweat. You can smell the odor of a very tired and sweat-loaded foot as the massive hands move all over his sole and toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand then travels toward the edge of the sock, just above his ankle, he gradually removed the sock from his foot, and tossed it to the ground. His gargantuan bare foot is now revealed. A bare sole a little brighter than the rest of his skin is wrinkled greatly by all the running he did previously. The sweaty scent is stronger now; the moisture of his sole is visible. He wiggles his huge toes, letting free more odor. He repeats with his right foot, and you enjoy another foot experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter massaging both feet, he </span></div></div>",
