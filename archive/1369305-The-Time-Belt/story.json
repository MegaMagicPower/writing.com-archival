There's the usual assortment of knick knacks and musty old clothes, along with a few mildly amusing items that you both briefly play with. Like the WWII era helmet and the nurse hat, the hula hoop, the chair that immediately breaks. You quickly look back and forth before quietly walking away from it, as Denise looks on with a smirk. <br>\r\nDenise is ready to go, holding a large red wig over her long brown hair, when you notice a funky looking belt. It looks like something out of Star Wars, and think you're buddy Aj would love it, as hes a huge star wars fan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pay the old man sitting out front, he smiles, and says \"Thats a quality belt there, treat it well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, sure man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Denise walk off, and she asks, \"Do you wanna go give that belt to Aj now, or you wanna keep walking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say...</span></div></div>",

A latch releases and a velcro strap comes out. \"It even comes with some special bracelets! Here, don't say I never got you nothing.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh whoopie, just what I always wanted! A bracelet to match your wierd belt,\" replies Denise sarcastically. Though she still puts on the bracelet. <br>\r\nYou've checked out the belt, and fiddled with everything except the red button on the center...</span></div></div>",

You insert the battery and put the belt back on. \"Ok, here goes!\" You press down the button again...and there's a bright flash of light! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you remember before you pass out is Denise yelping as she's startled by the light...</span></div></div>",

Just like she said, you're in a sparse forest. Suddenly you both hear a trumpet sounding a military trumpet call a ways off to your left. \"Well,\" you say, \"at least there's people that way. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both start walking and after a minute arrive at the edge of the forest and are the top of a hill. Looking down you see what looks like a column of men in old military dress open fire on several people on horses. As you watch you realize the people falling off the horses aren't doing some war reenactment, they really are dieing! Denise realizes it at the same time and clutches your arm in horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last remaining Indians ride off on the horses, you look down at the belt and notice the year is set on 1875. You time traveled to 1875!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize you've been spotted by the soldiers as they start moving in your direction, and you decide it might be better to get out of here.

You look at each other and then take off at a dead run for the purse. Katie is still talking on the phone so she must not have noticed the both of you, and you sigh in relief. Katie finishes her phone call and picks up her purse, dropping her phone into it. It barely misses Denise, and she gives you a worried look. You can tell shes having second thoughts, seeing as you're both so small and helpless, and that phone could have easily injured her. You bring your finger to your lips to signal her to stay quiet and she nods. The swaying of the purse has stopped as Katie sets it down on the counter, and suddenly little sample bottles of liquor drop all around the both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both huddle within the purse in silence for a while longer, staring at the giant sample bottles, lipstick, and phone, among other feminine items. Suddenly a horn honks and you hear Katie yell \"I'm coming.\" You quickly brace yourself against the nearest inner pocket of the purse, and with a lurch your ride takes off. After some jostling, the purse settles down and all you hear is Katie and Jamie singing along to Velvet Revolver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to leverage yourself up to look out when Denise suddenly pulls you back down. \"What are you doing!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm taking a look out.\" you reply. \"That is the point of this whole thing.\" You pop your head out and look upon Katie's giant legs swaying to the music above you. You're amazed and mesmerized at the leg muscles effortless movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Denise pops her head up too and quietly says \"Wow. This is such a different perspective. She used to perform ballet ya know. Hey, check it out over there,\" she suddenly says pointing. You nod with appreciation at the towers of muscle before looking where Denise is pointing, and see its Jamie's purse. \"We should get in that one instead. I already know Katie pretty well, but almost nothing of Jamie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat could be interesting you think. Jamie is really damn hot, and could have a more organized purse that wouldn't be such a handful. Plus she's got a huge rack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again those legs of Katie's look so powerful, and it might not be such a good idea to wander off with strangers, at least not till you have a better handle on how you can move around at this size.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, one of the mini bottles of alcohol falls and conks you on the head.

Creases had formed around the sides of her mouth, crows feet deepened, she wore elegant older woman's squared glasses on a wooden beaded chain, her breasts had lowered a touch and her neck had started to get wobbly. Slight jowls were showing, and she noted her voice was a bit raspier, deeper in tone. Her eyes had gotten slight bags, and she wore a girdle as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, honey.

As for what you do as time agents, just keep going and you'll be where you need to be when we need you there, and in the condition we need you--whether young or old, male or female, fat or skinny,\" she said as a large sized girl in her late teens came up to their table with a middle aged business man in tow, as they watched Tanya visibly get younger and younger until a baby in diapers sat there before them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's time for her diaper change,\" laughed Jason, as Jayne found herself leaning on a cane, wearing bifocals, her hair now completely white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we best be a goin, eh dearie?\" she said as the belt went off, and she and Denise vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It seems that the earth warms up slightly right before an ice age. It was a normal cycle, but the scientists of the time misinterpreted it, and blamed it on man-made emissions.

There's so many options, and all are so appealing its hard to make a choice. There's bear DNA, which would undoubtedly make you stronger. Snake, which has obviously made Stephan quite flexible, as you look over and he seems to be doing some feats with his body that would be impossible with a regular spine. And quite frankly looks a little gross. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the next page there's Bat ears, which would increase your hearing, and shark gills that could allow you to breath under water.

I am the current leader of this group of ruffians. he said smirking at the female commando who glares at him whith an intensity that could freeze suns. \"Ahem, in any case I see you've met my second-in-command Joana or Jo as we here at the union call her by the way you looked at her when you came in. She's the leader of our best platoon called Sirius Platoon. You'll be seeing alot of her around from now on.\" he explained.<br>\r\n\"What's going on? We just want to go home. We don't want to in this union of yours.\" you say and Denise nods in agreement. \"I'm sorry to tell you both, but you are a renegade time traveler forever now that you're wanted by the time cops. Even if you went back home, you'll be hunted down. We also can't allow you to get caught by the time cops alive because you are here now and they can trace where you've been if you're caught for too long. We can't allow for our base to be compromised, I'm sorry.\" John saids sadly shaking his head. \"You'll have to stay at this facility from now on, but whether you choose to help us in our cause is up to you entirely. Before you make any decisions, allow me to explain the situation and what we are fight for first.\"<br>\r\n\" The Renegade Time Traveler Union or RTTU is an organization comprised of time travelers who have had encounters with the time cops. Initally it was just a group that despised the time cops and it was more like a terrorist group than anything. Recently though, upon coming across a certain file we managed to steal from the Time Cop main computer, we found out about a plan from the Temporal council to raise a vast army and sweep across all possible time lines which of course over the length of time the universe has been around is countless universes branching off from different time lines. They will not be able to target them individually as this will take way too much time and manpower to do so they are planning to go for the main time branches and more importantly the main time line in the past which we have located is this one we're in. We have the past tightly guarded though so we'll know when they attack. Therefore, this version of the RTTU is under the heaviest stress because the main Time cop HQ is also in this time line. We are trying to prevent this plan from succeeeding, but we need all the people we've got in every single timeline we can muster to battle the Time Cops when the plan is enacted.  What we have to do to prepare for this is contact as many agents we can in as many timelines as we can while all the while we are also attempting to finish the Time Cops off here in this timeline hopfully so the plan isn't activated because this version of their HQ is responsible for setting off the plan. If their plan starts though, the time lines may be severly changed and disrupted so we are trying to stop it as much as possible on our end. Any questions?\" John finishes shuts up after his very long speech. Your head and Denise's is still spinning <br>\r\nWhen you regain your senses you ask\" What about their future main HQ? Can't they start the plan?\" \"No, we designed a blocker that stops the tme cops in the future fromgetting to the past. Only the current and past are open to them now. That being said, we have to protect the time disrupter at all cost or the plan will immediately enact more or less. Now, decide if you want to help us or not. We will not force you but any help is appreciated. If you choose to help us, basic training will be two days from After that, you and Denise followed Jo down the hall  now just down the hall from the rooms that Jo will show you to. \" he said and walked off into another room.      <br>\r\nAfter he was gone, Joana walked down the hall to the left and Denise and you followed. After a couple turns, you came upon a heavy metal door.\" This will be your room John. Please try not to wreck the place. Changes of clothes are provided and a training suit in case you decide to show for training. Communicate to me with the communicator on the wall when you've reached your decision.\" She said and moved off with Denise to her room further down the hall. You walked up to the door and it scanned you and somehow knew you were and it unlocked. Once you got inside, you notice the communicator on the wall next to the door and otherwise, the place looks like an average one person apartment  You lay on the bed and carefully consider what John had said and what has haoppened since you got the time belt. Should you help them save the time lines and attend basic training or should you just let them figure it out themselves and you live on without risking killing yourself(though you may die if they get attacked). Finally you come to a decisioon after much debate. </span></div></div>",

The one that spoke before leans forward on his board, putting it at a 45 degree angle toward the ground, and leans down close to you. \"What do you think you're doing, getting in the way of our flow riding, you punk yepero. This is Peroxide turf here. Everyone knows to get out of our way when we ride. Or we show them why they should!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis can't be good.

Finally though, two officers made their way in.  The first a woman, who Jay would assume was Latina if not for the single white horn that grew out of her the center of her for head, the second was a large man who inspite of looking to be no more then 30 had completely white hair and instead of his left arm had a robotic replacement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Mr. Dunkle, I trust you know why your here\" the man said in a nutral voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ISwearIDidntDoAnythingThisGuyJustAttackedMeAndMyFriend\" Jay better out in one breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax\" the woman said holding a manila folder, she went to drop it and a coffee table manifested itself for the folder to land on \"We know what happened, we had agents go back and watch the incident.

Strangest of all she starts rubbing herself all over in a way that drove Jay wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJay completely confused lookes to the male agent who proceeds to also be replaced with a beutiful woman.

This is your reward.\" The ginger girl says in a monotone \"we transformed for your pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJay stood up and the couch vanished as he did. \"Transformed?

Could I transform to? \" Jay asks curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In this room you could be whatever you want, just concentrate\" the bottomless ginger girl explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can even change your mind, though it will all go back when you leave. It's holograms like in the show Star Trek from your time, of course the show Star Trek in our time is a documentary show about the journey to different stars, this season is Betelgeuse\" the perky pink one rambled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'm going to try this\" Jay said concentrating. In a flash where Jay once stood was now a resplendid purple haired woman who wore a bra, puffy princess sleeves and a long flowing skirt that  exposes her hips all in purple with light blue accents and belt. \"Ok I want to get my metaphorical money's worth out of this body while I have it.\"</span></div></div>",

He's wearing a futuristic uniform, and even though he's from another time it just screams law enforcement. He has a bracelet on his wrist, and when you touch it a hologram of a badge pops out in the air in front of you. It says Time Cop Charlie, 31415926535. Wow, how many time cops are there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turn your attention to his belt. It's obviously a more advanced version of the belt you have on. There's also a holster attached to the belt, and it has a ray gun of some sort in it. You deftly pull it out, thinking it may help you during your experiments with your time belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over Charlie some more, you find he doesn't have anything more that could help you, except for a crystal on the other side of his belt. It's labeled Temporal Displacement Field. That could be handy, or it could be annoying, if it really does disrupt time travel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do with it?</span></div></div>",

Everyone breaks out into a nervous giggle at this ironic statement, though the girls are quickly recovering. Ashley grabs you around the waist and picks you up, bringing you closer to her face. Looking down you can see the huge mounds below you, and forward is her huge face. That cute little mole she has on her cheek seems huge now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you changed size with that belt, and also traveled through time with it earlier?\" Boy, being this close you can sure smell the salsa on her breath now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrinkling your nose a little from the smell, you respond with a quick \"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And can you change other people's sizes and bring them through time with you?\" chimes in Laura, recovering from her initial shock and now standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, I havn't fully checked out this belt yet. Only bought it an hour ago.\" The clock on the wall suddenly chimes 11 o'clock. \"Make that 14 hours from now.\" you amend. The ladies are all standing around staring at you now, and another nervous giggle escapes them all. \"If you set me down, I can check out the belt some more and see if it can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley gets very excited by this and does a few quick little small jumps, nearly squeeling in anticipation. \"Yes, yes, please!\" She turns around and sits down on the right end of the couch, placing you on the center cushion. Changing the settings back to normal, you press the red button and grow again. You take the belt off and they all stand or sit around you looking at the belt. Turning it over to the back, you find three pieces that detach. And underneath each piece is velcro straps, making the item a bracelet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These things might link the wearer to the belt, otherwise why would they come off?\" You set them down on the table in front of you and say \"Since there's only three, who's sitting out?\" While you put the belt back on, the ladies discuss their options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm his sister, so I deserve a bracelet.\" states Kristine matter of factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really really want to do this now.\" says Ashley. \"Besides, I wasn't so scared that I fell over backwards at a tiny man.\" Here she looks rather pointedly at Laura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, fine.\" Laura looks at Toshiko here, who makes the motion of starting rock paper scissors.

Toshiko echoes with a \"Jeez man, my table!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a moment but you're able to get up.

Before you can look she reaches out and grabs one off. Did she just grope your ass a little bit too? \"It looks like a bracelet of some sort. Maybe it links others to the belt wearer!\" That would be nice, you wouldn't have to give up control of the belt, but could still increase the size of this hot Asian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly reduce your height back to original, so you don't have to stoop so low, and the bracelet shrinks right in her palm. \"Ok Tosh, put it on and I'll make you bigger with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" She doesn't hesitate and slips it right on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the rest of us, make us bigger too!\" says Kristine.

Maybe this will help you get them out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou click on the first one, but its just a dossier of some muscly black dude with what looks like a mechanical arm. Age, name, date born, blah blah blah. Maybe you can get some information on that blond guy from this. Finding a back button in the bottom left corner, you press it and your back at the folder menu. The next file is the same, except for a woman with bright pink hair, and what looks like blades coming out of her shoulders. Next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEwww, this is some sort of squid creature, and it doesn't look that nice. Next<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow we're talkin! It shows a picture of him, says his name is Jax, age and date born, unknown. Actually, more than half the file is unknown. Guess there's not much to find out about him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back to the main screen you click on another file. just pictures in here of Charlie and his friends and family. Yawn. The next folder you check though, has outlines of 2 figures in it. Pressing one, it pulls up what looks like a picture of Jax, but no details.

The belt has controls that can easily let you choose whenever you want to go, and on the other side has controls that depend on the story line.<br>\r\nIt also has bracelets that link the bracelet wearer to the belt wearer, so others can travel with you. Where it goes from there is up to everyone who reads and hopefully adds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease add, but a few rules. <br>\r\n1- Don't kill off any main characters, though abandoning, or losing a limb are fine, because someone else can always write a re-entrance. <br>\r\n2- Nothing that would be illegal, like underage sex<br>\r\n3- More than 2 sentences if you add<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd remember, HAVE FUN with this. =D<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. If you do find a story line you want to continue, but neither of the choices are appealing, just add what you want and send me a message about changing the choice that you chose to continue<br>\r\n</td>",
