A two liter of Pepsi seemed a fitting end to a meal of three large pizzas. Jason's belly was larger than they had it seen before. It threatened to burst open his skin tight cargo pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was a beefy guy, but he wasn't particularly fat. But he would eat just as much as his friends dared him too. Seeing his gut grow with each bite seemed to mesmerize them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, once they were done being amused by his gorging antics, they all dispersed to head out for the night. Jason was left behind, too stuffed to move. He just rubbed his round belly under his tight shirt, belching loudly as the vast amount of food settled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling he got from his heavy belly was a mixture of pain and an erotic manliness. He loved feeling so big, bigger than all his friends. And man could he let em' rip. His belches could practically shake the house. But in the few weeks since he arrived at college, his weight had been soaring - all his clothes were now too tight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason undid his pants and burped several times in succession. He sighed with relief. It always seemed to happen. Once he was overstuffed, he'd end up alone with his gut, too full to move, his friends all gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat thinking for some time, absent-mindedly rubbing his swollen belly.

Nothing pleased them more than to see Jason growing a lot. Jason loved his gut, the tightness, and even the aching, but tonight had been a night that stretched his limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt impossibly full and heavy. He belched even louder as he gesticulated to stop Ryan from bringing over more food. Unwaveringly Ryan approached Jason with another beer and a slice of cake. Ryan was Jason\u2019s best friend, they had each joined the fraternity to gain some respect, but Ryan had since turned into a delivery boy for the fraternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan, as a newcomer, was supposed to also be condemned to Jason\u2019s food-filled fate - but he had managed to get out of the ritual by telling the frat Jason\u2019s favorite foods and drinks - thus pleasing the fraternity, and diverting attention from himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as Ryan set the open beer down next to Jason, he laughed. Jason was angry that he had been sold out by Ryan but he did enjoy the food. But at the time he half-mindedly regretted all the food he had just eaten; after this he would probably never fit into these pants again, but that's a price he has to pay, he figured, for popularity and respect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan smiled, \u201cWow Jason, you sure did eat a lot tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s belly was huge and its tenderness left him practically immobile; he was in no mood to have a chat with Ryan. \u201cYeah (burp) and I don\u2019t need you to get me more food\u2026\u2026(burp)\u2026\u2026\u201d Jason looked at the slice of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on Jason,\u201d Ryan said in a happy but devilish voice. \u201cIt\u2019s merely a congratulatory gift!\u201d He smiled again and cocked his head back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason lifts his shirt up and glances at his stomach, it\u2019s tight and round, it rests on his lap. \u201cJust shut up and go\u2026..(BURP)\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan saw that Jason wasn\u2019t in a good mood and stepped out quietly. He knew when to keep his mouth shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason leaned forward, clutching his stomach, and looked at the beer with unwavering eyes. He took up the bottle and guzzled it down, slowly and surely. He felt every drop hit the bottom of his stomach like a bomb. He continued to finish off the slice of cake, something in his mind told him to shut up and eat it. Something told him, despite his aching belly, just to buckle up and suck up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason ate the cake and finished the beer, alone. He finished it and leaned back dosing off into a deep sleep, letting all the food settle, right into fat.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He finished off the two sources of excess calories, then leaned back and dozed off, letting all the food digest and get processed right into fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of hours, he awakes as somebody - one of the hardbodies probably - disappears down the frat hallway. Jason sits thinking for some time, absent-mindedly rubbing his swollen belly. Finally, all in a rush, he decides to change - to change everything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Frat brothers like to watch him eat?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, he will give them a SHOW!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason will stuff himself ALL the time, not just on Friday nights or when the Fraternity demands it, and he will grow - man, will he grow!  He'll grow HUGE!  His genes had given him a strong, fat body and a love of food - and now that love of food he he will indulge!  And his strong body will bulge!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he pledged, Jason promised to support the Frat, and the Frat pledged to support and look after him?  Very well, he's been supporting the Frat, doing what his Frat brothers want - SO, the part about the Frat looking after HIM begins NOW!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to hell with the frat boys leaving him behind after the Friday stuffing session - he'll expand his food capacity until he's able to eat everything they push at him AND then go out with them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this change begins... \"Right now!\" Jason says out loud to himself. He hauls his stuffed self off the dining room chair, intending to head off to find a buffet to pack on a few more pounds today!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough his stomach feels stuffed, just thinking about being bigger has made him hungry again, too - and he knows that if he walks for a bit, like out to a restaurant, his stomach will stop feeling full and he'll have room for more.  'If the brothers think I'm fat now,' he says under his breath to himself as he hauls his well-padded butt towards the front door, 'they won't believe how big I'll be soon.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walks across frat house hallway he notices that his jeans are tighter than ever - so tight they hurt. He pulls his rugby shirt out of his waistband, in an effort to relieve the pressure a little. It feels slightly better, but Jason realises that he can't go out for a feed wearing these tight jeans.  What he really needs now, in order to have a good feed to 'launch' his new growth is up in his dorm room - <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He pulls the sweat pants out of the drawer and slides them on.  They fit not quite as generously as before... no surprise there.  And soon, he thinks, there\u2019ll be no \u2018generosity\u2019 in their fit at all.  In fact, just thinking about getting fat - plus having no pressure on his waistline -  was making Jason fell hungry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fairly bounced out the door of the frat house and hurried the few blocks to the \u201cGarden View\u201d,  a Chinese buffet that saw more than its fair share of the students from the U.  It wasn\u2019t much to look at on the outside - but for guys and gals like Jason, adventuresome, poor, and liking to eat, it was great - the food was, well, cheap, and good - and there was LOTS of it!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I wonder how long before these sweats don\u2019t fit?\u2019 Jason wondered as he waited to be seated.  He didn\u2019t wear sweat pants very often - he used to think of them as \u2018fat guy clothes\u2019 - but now that he had decided to join the ranks of the fat guys, he suddenly realised just how comfortable they were. Still, though, he\u2019d have to buy new clothes tomorrow, sweat pants are fine for eating, like tonight, but he can\u2019t go everywhere in them. None of his jeans fit, and this rugby shirt, his biggest shirt, was tight.  \u201cBut first, some food!\u201d he remarked out loud.  Clothing, while necessary, could wait until tomorrow - right now his ample belly was going to become more ample, as he started to accomplishing his goal of a most impressive size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTable for one?\u201d asked the pretty Asian server as she greeted Jason with a shy smile..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d he replied positively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis way,\u201d she murmured, and turned towards the steam tables.  \u201cHave nice table here for you...\u201d she added, pulling out a chair and smiling again.  She rubbed one finely-shaped hand across her little stomach warmly.  \u201cEat well!\u201d she gently suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she had hardly left before another server appeared at his table.  Built on a much bigger scale, Jason found himself admiring the new server\u2019s fat figure - perhaps the first time he\u2019d ever appreciated a fat figure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be your server for tonight.

Jason wasted no time in taking up the obese waiter\u2019s advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour heaping plates later, Jason looked up to find the corpulent server in front of him.  \u201cMan, you eat like me!\u201d he said.  \u201cTrying to gain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah!\u201d replied Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, here\u2019s something better than beer to drink,\u201d remarked the server, putting a small teapot and cup down on the table.  \u201cThis\u2019ll help your appetite and your digestion, and it tastes good too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d said Jason.

These are the regular ones, but if you're expecting to grow, then you want the stretch versions... I'd suggest 559 or 569, but if you like to wear them a bit higher up, the 541s.  Then, don't buy them just a size apart - if you're really going to grow, then get 42s and 46s, not 44s. You can wear them a bit tight - especially the stretch versions, which really give you an extra inch or two.  That'll save some dough, which you'll need, if you're planning to get that big. Are you going to keep growing?  Maybe you should get some rugby pants then too - they have elastic waists, and drawstrings to start with, and there's a denim version... here, I'll come show you the stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" replies Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We also have some shirts and t-shirts in the discount rack you might like,\" the clerk continues. \"These smaller sizes don't sell as well as the bigger ones... take a look while I pull out some 559s.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason heads to the dicount rack and picks up a nice blue button-down a size bigger than the flannel shirt, and a couple of t-shirts bigger than the polos, and swaps one of his polos for a discounted one - especially at 70% off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk re-appears with an armload of jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come try these one,\" he commands, and Jason follows. \"Looking at you I tossed in some 44s and 48s - try 'em all on, but don't buy too much ahead - you can always come back for more, when you're bigger.  You might not grow the way you expect.  I know I didn't.

They fit very loosely - lots of room for growth there! In fact, Jason had forgotten how loose fitting these sweats are...then he looks at them again.  They're not his old sweats, they're brand new!  Where did they come from?  Grandma?  She had 'helped' him when he was unpacking....  He patted his belly, which didn't feel so full now that it wasn't constrained by too-tight sweats.  In fact, he felt hungry again - and feeling hungry made Jason think again about getting fat - mmmm - no pressure on his waistline - Jason felt ravenous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fairly bounced out the door of the frat house and hurried the few blocks to the \u201cGarden View\u201d, a Chinese buffet that saw more than its fair share of the students from the U. It wasn\u2019t much to look at on the outside - but for guys and gals like Jason, adventuresome, poor, and liking to eat, it was great - the food was, well, cheap, and good - and there was LOTS of it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I wonder how long it'll take me to fill these sweats?\u2019 Jason wondered as he waited to be seated. He hadn\u2019t worn sweat pants very often - he used to think of them as \u2018fat guy clothes\u2019 - but now that he had decided to join the ranks of the fat guys, he suddenly realised just how comfortable they were. Still, though, he\u2019d have to buy new clothes tomorrow; sweat pants are fine for eating, like tonight, but they don\u2019t go everywhere. Though he could squeeze into them, none of his jeans really fit, and even this rugby shirt, his biggest shirt, was tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut first, some food!\u201d he remarked out loud. Clothing, while necessary, could wait until tomorrow - right now his ample belly was going to become more ample, as he started to accomplishing his goal of a most impressive size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTable for one?\u201d asked the pretty Asian server as she greeted Jason with a shy smile..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d he replied positively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis way,\u201d she murmured, and turned towards the steam tables. \u201cHave nice table here for you...\u201d she added, pulling out a chair and smiling again. She rubbed one finely-shaped hand across her little stomach warmly. \u201cEat well!\u201d she gently suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she had hardly left before another server appeared at his table. Built on a much bigger scale, Jason found himself admiring the new server\u2019s fat figure - perhaps the first time he\u2019d ever appreciated a fat figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be your server for tonight.

The rugby shirt had been an XXL supposedly, but was ridiculously tight - but this 5XL flannel shirt looked vast. Jason slips it on, and it is generous - swimmingly generous. He tries on the shirt and then looks in the mirror, then holds the sides of the mammoth shirt out. \"This has got to be bigger than 5XL,\" he thinks to himself.

He shakes his head and the vision clears, and he regrettably puts the shirt back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not that big - yet,\" Jason says out loud, and backs up a pace, to grab a rugby shirt in broad stripes of green and blue.  \"4XL\" this tag reads, and while it's big, it's not the vastness of the flannel shirt.  He slips it over his head, and the fit is good across the shoulders, and loose and generous across the chest and gut - yes, gut, Jason admits to  himself, and shortly to be more of a gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strides out of the clothing room to find...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, he doesn't feel full anymore!  He gets up and heads to the dessert department, snagging a full-size dinner plate on the way, and proceeds to fill up on the rich, sweet offerings.  As he picks up he also samples - cheesecake, honeycake, chocolate balls, eclairs - all the rich, sweet stuff he craved when he was a kid, and probably the reason he's a fat frosh now.  Returning to his table with a mound of sweets, he looks down at his new little gut and thinks he'll soon be a fatter frosh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the frat will be impressed, and will look after him.  He'll see to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuzzling beer, inhaling sweets, Jason feels like he's in Nirvana.  Part of his brain wonders if he should have taken that flannel shirt - but the rest of his brain is just zoned on sugar bliss, and when his gut reminds him that he really should be full, he calms it with more tea.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what seems only a short time but must have been two hours, the big server comes by to tell him that they're closing the restaurant.

Is he really going for a big gain? Or just to eat enough to 'get back' at the idiots in the frat who stuff him? And is he going to admit to either to this stranger, friendly and attractive as he may be? After a moment's consideration Jason replies, \"I don't know about a gain, but I like to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe server smiles back at him.  \"Well, that's where it usually begins!  I have to say, I'm glad to meet you though.  You should come back here often.  And always ask for the special tea - all the servers will know what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Jason replied, then got up to head to the dessert tables.  With all the beer and food already sloshing about in his gut, his appetite seemed limitless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA plateload of cheesecake, another of apple crumble, and a big bowl of ice cream later, though, Jason was definitely full!  His shirt stretched over his full gut, and he had to maneuvre a bit to get up cleanly from the table.  He headed to the entrance, where the sumo-sized server greeted him at the cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had a great night,\" the server remarked.  \"Make sure you come back soon.  And, if you ever want someone to eat with, or just hang out with, give me a shout,\" he added, and slipped a card into Jason's hand along with the change.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he'd waddled back to the frat, Jason wasn't feeling quite so stuffed.

The server squeezes his huge body into the booth opposite Jason, the bench creaking and groaning under his weight. Half his belly came to rest on the table, causing Jason's empty plates to slide towards the massive gut.  The server then asked, \"What's your name?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, hypnotized by the bulbous belly in front of him, snaps out of a trance and replies \"Uhh..Jason.  My name's Jason.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe server continues. \"Jason, you seem like a nice guy.  And I can see you enjoy stuffing yourself. I can give you tips - I can help you really, really gain. But I don't waste my time on quitters or half-assers.  If you want to get big...REALLY big...it's going to take complete commitment. Are you ready for that?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stares at the mysterious stranger, awed and slightly intimidated by his serious tone. Gazing at the server's massive body before him, barely able to squeeze into the booth and pulsing with power, Jason feels emboldened to do whatever it takes to have that power for himself.  \"Yes. I'm ready.  Whatever I need to do,\" he replies, with determination in his eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe server's face turns back to its jolly round smile as he extends a beefy hand. \"David Chang, and it will be my honor to help you\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shakes David's hand and winces slight at the strength of his meaty grip. David waves to a chubby girl behind the counter and after a few words in Japanese, she approaches the table with a large thermos.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my sister, Hiriko.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl politely bows and gives Jason the thermos, which seems to hold almost a gallon of liquid.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a special nutritional supplement I make for myself,\" David says. \"Take it with you. Drink the entire thermos right before you go to bed tonight. Tomorrow, when you wake up, you'll feel extremely hungry.  You have to eat every two hours, no exceptions. After your classes, I want you to come back here, and your real training will begin.  Understand?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nods, excited by the eating part, but a little unsure of what the \"real training\" is going to entail.  David raises his huge body out of the booth like a whale breaching out of the ocean and says \"Good!  I'll see you tomorrow!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason takes out his wallet to settle his tab, but David politely adds, \"Oh, don't worry...the meal's on the house.\"  He slaps a meaty hand on Jason's shoulder and quickly moves to the kitchen to continue serving his other customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason hefts his swollen belly up out of the booth, takes the thermos and makes his way back to the frat house in the middle of the night.  He deftly sneaks in to avoid waking the brothers and goes to his room.  Remembering David's instructions, he opens the mystery thermos and finds a warm, thick liquid with a strong, spicy smell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the aroma his his nostrils, his belly quakes with hunger.  He had just spent hours stuffing himself at David's buffet and somehow this mystery stew made him feel like he hadn't eaten all day.  He puts his mouth to the thermos, and somewhere between chewing and drinking, he takes the liquid down his gullet a mouthful at a time until he drains the entire container.  The thermos empty, he releases a deep belch, his eyes roll into the back of his head and he falls into a deep, satiated sleep.</span></div></div>",

He hazily gazes out his bedroom window to look for the rain cloud which disturbed his sleep, but a second boom from under his sheets indicates the \"storm\" was brewing in his colon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, his roommate Ryan was not awoken by his unflattering flatulence, so he quietly shoots to the washroom.  After an exhausting session relieving his bowels, he washes up and peers at himself in the large mirror.  He actually looks THINNER than he was before, his sleeping tank top looking too large for him and his baggy shorts almost falling down his waist.  Maybe David at the buffet was playing some joke on him, slipping him a laxative and saying it was some special \"weight gain mix\".  Ryan may have even put David up to it, since he took a sick pleasure in torturing Jason for the frat's amusement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe climbs back into bed to get some more sleep before morning classes, but another noise emanates from his midsection. Not the same thunder from a few minutes ago, this gurgling rumble is soon followed by the most intense hunger pangs ever felt in his life. His entire body starves for sustenance, causing him to shiver and shake in agony.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason climbs out of bed and weakly makes his way through the house, bracing himself against the walls and clutching his groaning gut in pain, until he makes it to the frat's kitchen.  He practically pulls the refrigerator door off it's hinges and desperately searches for something to sate his hunger.  He rips the lid off a serving tray of spaghetti and meatballs.  Even cold, the smell of the sauce and meat makes his mouth water with anticipation.  He grabs handfuls of noodles and stuffs them in his mouth, barely breathing in between swallows.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, the entire serving tray of delicious cold spaghetti is empty, but his hunger still remains.  Another tray of silvery salvation beckons him, this one filled with leftover spare ribs from the latest frat barbecue. A few presses on the microwave and the kitchen fills with the divine aroma of seared meat and juicy fat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason dumps the hot slabs back in the tray, grabs a large bottle of thick barbecue sauce, and takes a seat at the kitchen table.  He devours them with a ferocity to rival a Serengeti lion preying on a fat water buffalo, completing the look with his face covered in mesquite-flavored blood.  The rib meat replaced with a pile of bones, he still feels a need to feed, and reaches into the ice box for dessert.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gallon of cookie dough ice cream waits in the back, but he cannot wait for the concrete-like delight to melt. Putting the whole tub in the microwave, he melts it into a warm, thick cream and guzzles the entire carton. After an hour of desperate stuffing, Jason finally exorcises the hunger demon from his stomach, and he basks in the after-feast glow.  He gazes down his front, seeing his newly-swollen belly cresting out from the bottom of his tank top like a rising sun.  He places his food-stained hands on the sides of his gut, feeling the warmth and hefty firmness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason rubs his belly in circles, moaning in contented bliss as each motion sends wave after wave of intense satiated pleasure through his bloated body.  Just before falling back asleep, he feels an uncomfortable pinch in his normally \"baggy\" shorts, as if they were somehow two sizes smaller...and not just from the stuffing.  From under his swollen belly, another familiar body part has grown swollen and firm.  Jason has pleasured himself several times to thoughts of growing bigger and fatter, but this is the first time he's been brought to full mast by stuffing alone.  He would enjoy seeing where this goes, but he feels exhausted from the stuffing, and the lack of sleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason decides to...</span></div></div>",

It helps, but what he really needs is up in his dorm room - a bigger pair of jeans! He bounces up the stairs, inspired at the idea of being bigger. \"You'll need these,\" his grandma had said, giving them to him when they dropped in at her house on the way to college. \"Mark my words. You are the spitting image of your late grandpa - God bless him - and if you need anything, just ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, grandma,\" he'd said at the time, but when he was unpacking in the dorm and discovered that the new jeans were three sizes bigger than his current, tight ones, he'd just buried them in the back of the closet. Now he remembered them, and the big shirt Grandma had mailed him last week, and pulled out the pair of garments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Jason's astonishment, they fit just right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his hands in the pockets of the jeans and felt a note. In his grandma's handwriting, it read, \"If these aren't big enough, call me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Bless you, grandma,\" Jason thought to himself as he raced downstairs.

Flabbergasted, he stopped dead at the bottom of the stairs.   Wow, he said to himself.  He noticed that the note continued.  \u201cDon\u2019t run up crazy bills, but don\u2019t starve yourself, either.  Call me so we can do lunch someday soon,\u201d the note concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I won\u2019t starve myself,\u201d Jason said quietly to himself.  He thought about Grandma, and about her comment that he looked just like Grandpa.  His grandpa had died before he was born, of a rare disease, and the only picture Jason had ever seen showed a happy, husky man on his wedding day.  He wondered if Grandpa had been as big as him - or even bigger?  He and Grandma had gotten married really young, just after he came back from the war.  He hadn\u2019t gotten married in his military uniform - Grandma had told Jason once that it no longer fit him - but she\u2019d never told him much else about his Grandpa.  Grandma had taken the wholesale business he\u2019d started and made a good thing of it, before selling out to \u2018enjoy her time with her grandchildren\u2019.  He hadn\u2019t ever really thought about how much his Grandma must be worth, but it must be substantial - and she was willing to trust him with a share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling incredibly buoyed by the discovery of the note and the credit card - and the great fit of the new clothes - Jason practically bounded out the door of the frat house.

Guys like Jason, though, adventuresome and liking to eat, went in for its cheap buffet, and came back because the food was, well, good - and there was LOTS of it!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I wonder how long it\u2019ll take to grow out of these jeans?\u2019 Jason wondered as he waited to be seated.  He passed a hand over the waistband of the generous new jeans that were Grandma\u2019s gift. \u2018I really need to buy new clothes,\u2019 he thought, \u2018these jeans are fine, but this rugby shirt is tight - and it\u2019s my biggest shirt.  I\u2019ve outgrown the rest of my clothes already,\u2019 he admitted to himself.  \u201cBut first, some food!\u201d he remarked out loud.  Clothing, while essential, could wait until his capacious belly had started to fulfill his physical aspirations...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the server came to seat him, he realised with a start that his belly was actually rumbling at the though of more food - despite the stuffing it had undergone less than two hours ago! \u2018New jeans - and a new attitude - really do make a difference!\u2019 he thought to himself. \u2018Thanks Grandma,\u2019 he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTable for one?\u201d asked the sinuous Asian server as she greeted Jason with a shy smile..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d he replied positively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis way,\u201d she murmured, and turned towards the steam tables.  \u201cHave nice table here for you...\u201d she added, pulling out a chair and smiling again.

He paid the bill - which was pretty modest considering all the food he'd put away - and the sumo-sized server appeared beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must come again!\" he re-iterated.  \"I am Cheng-do, but call me John - Little John!\" he added.  \"Perhaps by your next visit I will have found a scale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's to 300!\" said Jason, holding up a hand for high-five.  \"Little John\" slapped his hand hard and turned to head back to the kitchen, leading Jason to admire the fat man's backside.

The frat house was mostly quiet - the late night party animals were still out, the rest heading to bed - and Jason decided to hit the sack.  The next morning, though, he awoke fairly early, and looked down at his middle.  It was true, he really had eaten all that the night before, for his stomach still looked bigger.  Getting up he picked up the jeans and shirt on the chair - yes, they really were much bigger than any he had owned before.  He pulled out a pair of underwear and slipped them on, to see that they fit like a second skin at the waist - he'd need new underwear too, he realised, if he was going to follow his dream.  One pair of jeans and one shirt wouldn't cut it - but then - he fished out his wallet from the new jeans.  Yes, there it was, the new Mastercard in his name.  None of it was a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich meant his new plan to get big wasn't a dream either!  He quickly washed and shaved, then pulled on the new jeans and shirt again to head down for breakfast.  He didn't always eat breakfast, let alone on weekends, but now he would never miss a meal - after all, they were already paid for in his frat house residence fees, and he was going to get his money's worth...with a little work, he could eat a lot more than he'd paid for, he figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breakfast was great - once the little Italian lady who staffed the weekend breakfast realised that he wasn't just having a coffee and toast, she cooked him up a feast, which he gladly consumed.  His belly sated again, he caught a bus to the big mall, where he put Grandma's credit card to good use with more jeans, shirts, underwear, even a sweater that caught his eye and was a generous fit on him - for now anyway!  Then, back to the frat for a big lunch, and....</span></div></div>",

Thirty minutes later, he got off the bus in an area known for its box stores and big buffet restaurants.  He had found this place by accident one day when he'd taken the wrong bus.  After the generous selection of buffet places, its greatest attraction to Jason was its anonymity - this area was nowhere near the campus, and had no bars, so it was unlikely he\u2019d run into any of his frat brothers or fellow students here - well, unless they were also coming for a big meal!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason strode along the sidewalk, seeing the Mighty-mart off in the distance, and beside it a warehouse outlet for Big Trends - between those two he figured he\u2019d be able to find more new clothes.  \u2018I wonder how long it\u2019ll take to grow out of these jeans?\u2019 he thought to himself, putting a hand on the comfortable-fitting new jeans Grandma had provided.

A white golf shirt outlined a fat gut riding below a mammoth chest - with pecs and lats so huge that they pushed his thickly padded arms out at an angle.  The waiter\u2019s face was round, above a thick neck and massive shoulders.  As the guy stood in front of Jason, Jason realised that the waiter\u2019s navy pants were straining across a pair of thighs like massive trees.  This guy was huge!  For all that, his warm smile and friendly body language made him instantly attractive.  Jason thought that he must be young - perhaps also a college student, thought squeezing that big body into a lecture hall chair must be a trial.  Suddenly, Jason was sure he had seen this guy somewhere on campus - and in that case, maybe he\u2019d let Jason order a beer without asking for ID.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to test his idea. \u201cI\u2019d like a draft,\u201d he said, mustering confidence, \u201cthen I\u2019ll go hit the buffet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good!\u201d replied the waiter. \u201cI like a beer when I\u2019m out buffet-grazing too, though sometimes I order a pitcher,\u201d he went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, thought Jason, it would take a pitcher to make a guy your size tipsy.  The waiter sauntered away, and passed with the pitcher as Jason headed to the steam tables.  On his way by, the waiter said quietly, \u201cThe lasagna tonight is especially good, and so\u2019s the pork.  Eat up!\u201d  He rubbed his own heavy gut appreciatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason chowed down on a third plateful, the waiter ambled up again.  \u201cWant another of those,\u201d he asked, indicating the beer glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d replied Jason, feeling good.  Relaxed, he continued. \u201cDo you hit the buffet regularly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery evening I\u2019m on, and Saturdays too!\u201d the mountain of a waiter replied, smacking his lips.  \u201cCoach wants me bigger, so I need to eat!  Employees get a great discount on the buffet!\u201d he continued.  \u201cSay, are you trying to get big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason hesitated.

Jason took a deep breath - if he gets much fatter, he thinks, he won\u2019t be able to do that - and replied said, \u201cYeah, I am trying to put on a few pounds.\u201d  Since this guy obviously had put on a lot of weight - and was trying to get bigger - he might have some good ideas.  And a huge, muscular friend to eat with or just hang around wouldn\u2019t go astray on a campus full of mean-natured hardbodies both in his Frat and around the campus!  Maybe this guy would have some weightlifting or strength tips too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWay cool!\u201d replied the server. \u201cWell, my name\u2019s Aaron.  If there\u2019s anything you need that you don\u2019t see on the buffet - or more to drink, or maybe you just want a little encouragement - I\u2019m here for you!\u201d  The huge blond guy move stepped away, responding to a wave from a man at another other table - a man who, Jason could see, had curly black hair, a black goatee, deeply bronzed Greek good looks and shoulders and gut the size of Aaron\u2019s!  From the way they spoke, Jason could see that they knew one another.  As he took another forkful, he realised that the server had just offered him encouragement.  Encouragement for what?  Getting bigger?  At the thought of getting bigger Jason\u2019s stomach growled again and he headed off for a fourth plateful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beer and the encouraging, convivial atmosphere combined to help Jason polish off a lot more food.  As he dug into a sixth plate, he looked up and found the big Greek guy looking at him and smiling.  He grinned back, and the Greek lifted a hand in friendly greeting.  Just at that moment, Aaron sauntered up again, one massive, half-eaten chocolate chip cookie in his hand. \u201cMore beer,\u201d he said, as much a statement as a question, and put a full stein down in front of Jason.  \u201cYou\u2019re doing great!\u201d he continued, \u201cbut don\u2019t forget to leave room for dessert. The chocolate chip cookies are sinful!\u201d he said, gesturing with his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason went and got himself a plateful of assorted sweet things, including a slice of apple pie, and to his surprise quickly polished them off.  He looked up to find Aaron beside him, a massive cookie on one plate, and what appeared to be half a pie on a second.  \u201cYou gotta try these!\u201d he waxed enthusiastically, and to his surprise Jason found the smell of chocolate from the cookie making him hungry again.  He bit into the pie with renewed exuberance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he licked the last few bits of chocolate chip from his lips, Jason sat back and surveyed the table.  Never before had he eaten so much in one sitting!  His gut felt comfortably full, though, not bloated as he would have expected - or as it had felt when he was eating on his frat brothers\u2019 dare.  Thank goodness for the new jeans Grandma had bought him, he thought, and then wondered how she could have known how big he would get.  What would she think of his decision to get even bigger?  But, then, the note with them had said, \u2018If these aren't big enough...\u2019  Grandpa must have been a big guy too.  The thought made Jason feel warm and somehow \u2018right\u2019, as he surveyed his expanded girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason sat confirming to himself his decision to grow, Aaron appeared again at his side, this time with a big cup of coffee.  \u201cAmaretto coffee?\u201d he asked, placing the cup on the table.  Jason could smell the alcohol in it.  \u201cI hope you like it,\u201d Aaron continued, \u201cbut if not, I\u2019ll change it.  It might relax you enough to eat some more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmells great!\u201d Jason replied, the warm sweet smell tickling his nose.  As he picked up the cup, Aaron laid a plate of chocolate pastries and cookies on the table.  \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Jason added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust trying to help,\u201d replied Aaron, sounding casual.  \u201cI enjoyed serving you!

The golf shirt also hugged a pair of fat-filled pecs that wrapped around to the guy\u2019s sides, pushing his fat-filled arms out at an angle.  His cherubic face, with its fat cheeks, rode above a neck that was just a ring of fat, and Jason could see fat pads on the back of his hands as he pulled out an order pad.  This guy was hugely fat!  For all that, his warm smile and friendly body language made him instantly attractive.  Jason thought that he must be young - perhaps also a college student, though squeezing that broadly fat body into a lecture hall chair must be a trial.  Suddenly, Jason was sure he had seen this guy somewhere on campus - and in that case, maybe he\u2019d let Jason order a beer without asking for ID.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to test his idea. \u201cI\u2019d like a draft,\u201d he said, mustering confidence, \u201cthen I\u2019ll go hit the buffet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good!\u201d replied the waiter. \u201cI like a beer when I\u2019m out buffet-grazing too, though sometimes I order a pitcher,\u201d he went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, thought Jason, it would take a pitcher to make a guy your size tipsy.  The waiter bounced away, and was back with the draft practically before Jason could get to the steam tables.  On his way by, the waiter said quietly, \u201cThe lasagna tonight is especially good, and so\u2019s the pork.  Eat up!\u201d  He rubbed his fat gut appreciatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason chowed down on a third plateful, the waiter bounced up again.  \u201cWant another of those,\u201d he asked, indicating the beer glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d replied Jason, feeling good.  Relaxed, he continued. \u201cDo you hit the buffet regularly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery night I work, and Saturdays too!\u201d the waiter replied.  \u201cHow do you think I got so big?  Employees get a great discount on the buffet!\u201d he continued.  \u201cSay, are you trying to get big too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason hesitated.  He knew this guy was in one of his classes, but he hesitated.  Should he tell this growing fat guy about his own wish to gain?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He took a deep breath and said, \u201cYes, I am.\u201d  Since this guy was also trying to gain weight, he might have some good ideas - and, surrounded by all the hardbodies in the Frat as he was, a gaining friend would be a good thing to have!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWay cool!\u201d replied the server. \u201cWell, my name\u2019s Robert, and if there\u2019s anything you need that you don\u2019t see on the buffet - or anything more to drink, or maybe you just want a little encouragement - I\u2019m here for you!\u201d  The fat blond guy bounced off at that point, responding to a wave from a man at another other table - a man who, Jason could see, had black hair, a black goatee, deeply bronzed Italian good looks and a gut at least the size of Robert\u2019s!  Sitting for a moment, Jason realises that the server just offered him encouragement.  Encouragement for what?  Getting fatter?  At the thought of getting bigger Jason\u2019s stomach growled again and he headed off for a fourth plateful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beer and the encouraging, convivial atmosphere combined to help Jason polish off a lot more food.  As he dug into a sixth plate, he looked up and found the Italian-looking fat guy looking at him and smiling.  He grinned back, and the Italian lifted a hand in friendly greeting.  Just at that moment, Robert bounced up again, a massive, half-eaten chocolate chip cookie in his hand. \u201cMore beer,\u201d he said, as much a statement as a question, and put a full stein down in front of Jason.  \u201cYou\u2019re doing great!\u201d he continued, \u201cbut don\u2019t forget to leave room for dessert. The chocolate chip cookies are sinful!\u201d he said, gesturing with his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason went and got himself a plateful of assorted sweet things, including a slice of apple pie, and to his surprise quickly polished them off.  He looked up to find Robert beside him, a massive cookie on one plate, and what appeared to be half a pie on a second.  \u201cYou gotta try these!\u201d Robert waxed enthusiastically, and to his surprise Jason found the smell of chocolate from the cookie making him hungry again.  He launched into the pie with renewed voracity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he licked the last few bits of chocolate chip from his lips, Jason sat back and surveyed the table.  Never before had he eaten so much in one sitting!  His gut felt comfortably full, though, not bloated as he would have expected - or as it had felt when he was eating on his frat brothers\u2019 dare.  Thank goodness for the new jeans Grandma had bought him, he thought, and then wondered how she could have known how big he would get.  What would she think of his decision to get even bigger?  But, then, the note with them had said, \u2018If these aren't big enough...\u2019  Grandpa must have grown this way too, Jason thought.  And he felt warm and somehow \u2018right\u2019 with that idea, as he surveyed his own expanded girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason sat confirming to himself his decision to grow, Robert appeared again at his side, this time with a big cup of coffee.  \u201cMoccacino?\u201d  Robert said, placing the cup on the table.  \u201cI hope you like it,\u201d Robert continued, \u201cbut if not, I\u2019ll change it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, looks great!\u201d Jason replied.  He like mocca coffee, and this cup smelt superb.  \u201cAnd you\u2019ve been great!\u201d he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just trying to help,\u201d replied Robert, in an attempt to sound casual.  \u201cI enjoyed serving you!

I must admit that I thought it was kinda cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After a semester of hanging around with him and acquiring a lot of his eating habits, my clothes really didn't fit at all. I got brave and weighed myself, and low and behold, I had gained 20 pounds!  No wonder my gut was starting to show. My roommate began noticing it, and he encouraged me to eat even more. I started not wearing a shirt much at all, either, and our friends started calling us the \"Gut guys\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I put on almost 40 pounds the second semester, and there was no denying my girth anymore.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool,\" said Jason. \"I think I want to gain a lot more, too.

Robert is already so fat... and he wants to be bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou...don\u2019t find any problems in being so fat ... in gaining so much? I mean, you know, clothes, girlfriend, ...\u201d Jason\u2019s voice trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeck no!\u201d replies Robert. \u201cIf people think I'm too big for something, I either squeeze in, complain, or tell myself I\u2019m just not built to do it! You'll find, though, that it's amazing how much room the world will make for a determined fat guy. And there are real advantages to being this size too. For instance, are you in a frat? I bet the guys try to make you eat, or take bets on how much you can eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, every week I get stuffed by them; it happened tonight,\u201d Jason replied. \u201cThey stuffed me, and then they left me. That\u2019s when I decided it was time to look out for number one, and get really, truly fat, since they think I\u2019m already such a fat guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, getting stuffed by your frat brothers is a good way to begin on the road to girth,\u201d commented Robert. \u201cIt certainly helped me last year. Once you grow a bit, and begin to eat a LOT more, they'll stop pressing you so hard, and you'll begin to enjoy it - I know I did. And as you get bigger and increase your food capacity, you\u2019ll be able to go out with them after your stuffing. After all, it\u2019s not as if they\u2019re going out to do anything strenuous, or anything a fat guy can\u2019t do. Drinking and eating - they're fat guy favs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes your frat still stuff you?\u201d asked Jason, unable to keep the surprise out of his voice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Frosh sleep on the top floor, so Jason\u2019s growing mass has to make three sets of stairs creak before he achieves his bedroom.

Then he will give them a show!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason decides that he will stuff himself even more and grow even bigger - so much bigger that, to cope with the even heavier weight, he will work out in the weight room, building even bigger muscles to carry his even bigger bod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe will buy even bigger cool clothes to cover his soon-to-be-even-bigger frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, most important of all, he will find a girl who would love the new, bigger him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis genes had given him a strong, fat body and a love of food (as the last two months in the Frat had proven - he was well beyond his \u2018freshman 15') - his years of being lonely had left him desperate - and, what would make this new life plan possible, he realised, was that his ever loving grandma (well off, and no skinny chick herself) had given him the key he needed - a college trust fund that would pay for food, new clothes....heck, grandma'd probably be happy to bankroll his new lifestyle! And the Frat - well, the Frat would learn how fat a frat brother could REALLY be! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" And the change begins right now!\" Jason says out loud to himself.

He drops heavily onto a sofa in the frat house den, but after lying down for what seems like only a few minutes, he hears his stomach growling.  Without thinking, he goes into the kitchen for a 'snack'.  The engorged stomach he filled not long ago now seems to have plenty of room for more food, and the hungry frat boy stands with the door of the Frat's 'snack fridge' door open, devouring every edible item in sight - he seems to not even realise that he's eating as he stands there in a stupor, his hands moving automatically from shelf to mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe comes to when his groping hands can no longer find anything on the shelves - he opens his eyes to see that he has eaten everything in the fridge!

He looks down at his body and he's sure its bigger and fatter - and he KNOWS he's hungry, his stomach is growling at him.  He loosens the drawstring waist on the sweat pants a little - the only thing about these new clothes that is at all tight - and practically vaults to his feet.

Going to bed so full means waking up early and hungry and wanting breakfast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weekend cook knows him - it's hard to miss the few Saturday morning 'regulars', mixed as they are between the dedicated athletes and the handful of other frosh brothers, mostly fat, who show up - and the cook knows Jason usually just takes something small, a couple of fried eggs, some toast, some fruit, coffee.  Jason knows the cook is happy to whip up more though - one or two of the other Saturday breakfast regulars are big guys with big appetites - so Jason takes a tray, grabs his usual cup of coffee - 'double double' - and stops in front of the cook to order.  \"Four eggs over easy, half a dozen sausages, two mcmuffins, bacon, six toast - I'll think I'll take a triple fruit salad too, and I might be back for more,\" Jason confidently says, as the cook's jaw drops.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering, the cook says, \"Feeling hungry today?  Or did they skip last night's stuffing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" replies Jason, \"I got stuffed last night, but now I'm hungry again.  I've decided that if the Frat likes me stuffed, I'll going to stay stuffed - all the time!  Load me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you!\" replies the cook, catching Jason't enthusiasm.  \"Let me rustle you up something special then - want to turn those eggs into a Western omelet?  A BIG one?\" asks the cook, turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" says Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!  Well, just load the toaster over there,\" adds the cook, \"here's your fruit to get started, and I'll be back in a jiff with a super-deluxe Western designed to stick to your ribs, if not pad them over completely...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cook smiles broadly, and ....<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He shifts about in the chair, each shift changing the pressure points in his over-stuffed gut, until time and movement ease the pressures a little - and Jason falls more deeply asleep, and begins to dream.   In his dream, he sees the frat house, but it is different - all the frat brothers are bigger, somehow.  His mind drifts through the frat house and into the main dining room, where a coterie of brethren are noshing - not a main meal apparently, just a \u2018snack' somehow, but Jason senses that this snack may just run on through lunch and continue to dinnertime and beyond.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sees around the room, and sees that these frat brethren are not quite the ones he's used to though - while the setting is the same, some of the brethren are different.  He sees Badlands Booker chowing down, and another even bigger guy who looks like Israel Kamaka, and a yet bigger guy who looks like Manny Yarbrough.  He sees a couple of guys who look like sumos - is one of those Konishiki?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the window is an even bigger figure - could it be Walter Hudson?  At another table is crew of guys who look like football linemen - Gilbert Brown and \u2018da Fridge' and Aaron Gibson, and a trio of younger guys who Jason suddenly realises are a college player from Florida who topped 480 pounds, and two high school linemen: 530 pound Reny Nunes and 410 pound \u2018Big Rig'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sitting at the tables with these big guys are Jason's familiar frat brethren, all of whom are bigger - some of them much bigger.  Ryan, who was supposed to be stuffed along with him, is stuffing himself - and looks about 200 pounds heavier than before.  A couple of guys who Jason thinks of as the snobbish jocks are at least a hundred pounds heavier - and one of them is asking Badlands for eating advice!  Sitting over by Walter Hudson is the only other fat guy in the frat, Robby, who was two years ahead of Jason and had been the frat's \u2018stuffing boy' before Jason came along.  But he wasn't the 300, maybe 400 pound Robby that Jason knew - this edition looked like he was well over the quarter ton, and gorging to boost that even higher.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason seemed to float along, seeing the elderly Italian grannies who ran the kitchen cooking up ever bigger quantities of food, and watching his frat brethren and their visitors lapping it all up.  Sitting near the kitchen, bantering with the grannies, was another young guy, somebody Jason didn't recognise, who was nearly the size of Walter Hudson, and who the grannies called \u2018Santiago' whenever they dropped a tray of food in front of him.  Then, Jason finds himself at a table too, food piled high in front of him, and a voracious hunger is suddenly upon him.  He doesn't just eat, he shovels the food in, but as fast as he consumes one trayful the Italian grannies have another in front of him.  His hunger seems endless, and while he is conscious that his gut - and the rest of him - is getting bigger, he is so hungry, he doesn't mind - in fact, after much gorging, it feels good, his fat body seems content and at peace, and he feels warm and lighthearted, proud of with his enhanced girth - but still hungry....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroggily, feeling disoriented, Jason wakes up.  Why does his neck feel so sore?  And where is he?  Opening his eyes, he feels more disoriented, then realises he is not in his bed - or any bed - he's still sitting in the chair in the frat house dining room where he feel asleep after his record-setting stuffing last night.  Looking around, he realises that it must be very early in the morning - it's dark outside, and there's no sounds in the house.  Stretching mightily - which makes his gut hurt, where it pushes against the too-tight waistband of his cargos - Jason decides to go sleep in his own bed for the rest of the night - maybe that will take the kink out of his neck.  After a step or two he pops open the waistband button - the pain from his stuffed gut is incredible - and he slowly heads upstairs.  Frosh frat brothers sleep on the top floor, so Jason has to lift his growing mass up three sets of creaking stairs before he achieves his bed.  Peeling off his too-tight cargo pants and rugby shirt, he falls asleep in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven hours later, Jason awakes again as the light streams in his window.  Jason lies abed cogitating on his situation, absent-mindedly rubbing his now-quiet, bigger belly.  Suddenly, all in a rush, he decides to change himself, and his life.  The Frat likes to watch him eat, to tease him about getting bigger?  Fine then, he will give them a show!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more worrying about weight - well actually no more worrying about losing weight, instead Jason will only 'worry' about GAINING weight.  And he won't 'worry' at all - he will just stuff himself 'to the max' everyday and grow bigger and BIGGER - so much bigger that he'll be the biggest brother in the frat, and onward he'll grow until he's the biggest frat brother ever!  He'll get so BIG that the frat will regret ever having started stuffing him!  He'll get so big, so fat, that he'll be able to eat ANYTHING and EVERYTHING they put in front of him - and so big they'll have to spend money on stronger chairs and bigger doorways, for he, Jason, will become the fraternity's \u2018crusher', a veritable mountain of a man.  The brothers want Jason big?  All right, he'll become the BIGGEST.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jason just knew he could do it - he had a strong frame under his current fat - a strong body that could carry a lot more weight - AND he had the a love of eating that already astounded his frat brothers - why, in his first two months, he'd already packed on much more than his \u2018freshman 15'!   What would make this new life plan possible, he realised, was that he was in the Frat house - he'd seen the way the Italian grannies in the kitchen always had more food ready, were always trying to feed up \u2018their boys' - well, he'd be the one of \u2018their boys' who wants to be FED.  And he had another \u2018weapon', his college trust fund - skipping videogames would easily leave enough money to pay for new clothes, for meals out - though he'd eat most of his meals right here, and try to bankrupt the frat kitchen budget! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be a whole new lifestyle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the Frat would just have to learn how FAT a frat brother COULD be!  Oh, and one more thing occurs to him - frat brethren swear to look out for one another - the frat had funds to help out brothers in trouble, and for \u2018special projects' - well, his gut already seemed to qualify as the frat's \u2018special project'!  Plus, frat alumni were 'on the hook' to help out their brethren with jobs, assistance, whatever they needed - forever. Well, sweet revenge, no matter how big he got, Jason would be looked after, by the very people who'd made him so fat!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that happy set of thoughts in mind, Jason started to roust himself from bed.  \"The change begins right now!\" Jason says out loud to himself. He hauls his overstuffed self into the shower (noticing how the water runs out over his expanded midriff and drips off), pulls on his biggest sweat pants and t-shirt (and they're snug), and heads... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He then goes through the stores, selecting tasteful clothes in sizes anywhere from slightly larger to so huge that they would fall off him if he tried them on.

Jason ends up buying a whole new wardrobe of clothes from the various stores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks back to the food court when he bumps into someone, and some of his purchases spill out of their bags. \"Oh sorry,\" Jason says as he tries to put all his clothes back into the bags before the guy realizes what's happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason is too slow, though, and the man says, \"Oh that's fine, perfectly fine,\" as he hands Jason the size 50 jeans.

He sees his frat brothers are all there five minutes early with the largest table completely covered with trays of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jason knew he was going to have to eat, he wasn't expecting this much - and he suddenly realises that what he should do, to make it easy on him, is to change into bigger clothes, or at least bigger pants.  He tries to duck quietly into the nearby washroom, and succeeds - at least, he hears no hoots or hollers, so he figures the frat brothers didn't see him.  He quickly dons the a polo in the next size up, and a pair of larger rugby pants, then heads out again, trying to look casual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, there he is!  Jason, look what we have for you!\" says one of the taller frat brothers, Matt, who's only a year ahead of Jason. (Jason has noticed that the most enthusiastic of his stuffers and teasers are the sophomores - the juniors and seniors seem a lot more laid back.)  \"You got some new duds?  Good, you're going to 'break' them in by eating ALL of this!\" Matt adds, one thin arm indicating the whole table of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" says Jason, adopting a cocky bravura that he doesn't quite feel inside.  \"Bring it on!\" he adds, slapping his gut with one hand.  The frat brothers crow as he seats himself at one end of the table, and grabs a slice of pizza.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go, fat boy, go!\" several of them jeer, and a female onlooker says to her companion, \"Can he really eat all that?\"  Overhearing her, Matt replies loudly, \"If he doesn't, he has to walk home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason steadily chews his way through the table full of food.  When one of the brothers tries to stuff more into his mouth too quickly, he swats him away with one hefty hand - easy enough to do when you outweigh the guy by 60 pounds, he reflects, which means as his weight increases, it'll get even easier!  Hamburgers follow pizza, french fries follow subs, all washed down with copious amounts of soda pop and coke.  Gradually, the new rugby pants begin to feel tight, and Jason begins to feel full.  He looks at the table, hiding his anxiety about actually finishing well, until it strikes him that, if he doesn't finish all the food, he can still take a bus back to the frat house...  Reassured by this plan B, he ploughs into the remaining food with new vigour.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason eats and eats, slowing gradually, until....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I hated being stuffed last year, though I found out I liked the results - but you looked like you were enjoying last night, the way Stan used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Stan was the stuffee the year before me - he enjoyed it so much that he ragged me last year about not eating enough, then, just when I think we're friends, he ups and changes schools, all for some girl who liked him FAT!\"  Robby barks this last out in a rage, then Jason can see he's close to tears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason just lets Robby storm ahead into the servery, then follows slowly behind.  By the time Jason is back at the table, Robby is tearing through a mountain of food.  Jason sits quietly, then Robby speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, got a bit worked up.  If you'd like to gain together, that would be great. If not, well then, I'll just have to keep ahead of you. Somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This means a lot to you, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, then we should do it together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys ate in silence for a while, then Jason asked, \"How much do you weigh now anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" replied Robby.  \"Oh,..</span></div></div>",

The buffet was definitely in 'brunch' mode, as everything from scrambled eggs and french toast to chili, meat loaf and fish'n'chips was on offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlateful after plateful disappeared into Jason and Robby, as the two new friends recommended items to one another and egged one another on.

We even give you trade-in value!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, 'cause while I'm not hurting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not made of money either - I hear ya. And besides, if you're like me, you'd rather spend money on food than clothes anyway. Here's the pro tip - you don't need much to have a great college fat guy wardrobe. Pair of shorts, two of chinos, four or five tops... that's enough. Gym shorts and t, if you lift or .. cough.. jog. And if a special occasion is coming, then buy something for it - maybe out of the previously loved section - but otherwise, don't buy, don't even look at white shirts or dress pants or anything like that. Only buy everyday stuff, and just enough, and buy it all a bit big, so there's ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...room to grow!\" Robby joined Nate at the end of his spiel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, bemused, took the pile of clothes and tried them all on - and decided to take the lot, as they all fit - generously.  The cargo shorts had a stretch rugby waist, he noticed, and the chinos had a 'hidden waistband adjustment' good for several inches.  The new underwear were a very light, incredibly stretchy stuff that expanded like underarmour - won't need another pair for ages, Jason thought, pulling the waistband out by at least a foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobby, too, had a pile of new clothes, which disappeared into a bag at the cash, and Jason was surprised at how modest the prices were.  \"Now, next time, bring your gently used old stuff,\" Nate reminded them, then added to Jason, \"Robby and I go out to eat sometimes - you gonna join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great!\" Jason replied appreciatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobby's stomach rumbled at that moment, and Jason looked at his watch.  Noon already!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear Robby's lunch bell,\" Nate joked, tapping Robby's gut lightly, \"but it's another hour 'til my break, so I can't join you gentleman for lunch today.  Go and get something to eat!\" Nate finished, sending them off and turning to another customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobby headed towards the food court, and as Jason followed him, his stomach gurgled too, and he was suddenly quite hungry as well. Part of his brain marvelled at this - he had been stuffed last night, gorged through a huge breakfast, and now he's ravenous again? - but that part of his mind couldn't compete with the memory of last night's dream, awakened by the smells of the food court - alluring smells, hunger-making smells, good smells... fattening smells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobby led Jason to the pizza counter, then the Chinese counter, then the hamburger joint, then the Thai outlet, then the doughnut shop... and an extremely generous lunch later, Robby and Jason were sitting with huge banana splits in front of them, plowing through mounds of ice cream and syrup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're making a good start on your growth,\" remarked Robby, as he downed the calorie bomb in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I've ever eaten so much in 24 hours!\" Jason marvelled.  \"I think I can feel myself growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably just your stomach swelling, but by tomorrow you'll be bigger,\" Robby remarked.  \"And if you think this is a lot to eat....</span></div></div>",

He had spent the week learning how to gorge, to overeat, to stuff himself - and to enjoy it. He was growing to fill his new bigger clothes, and how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason lifted the first piece of pizza, downed it quickly, and proceeed to steadily, methodically, throw back all four pizzas in record time. By the time he started the fourth, some of the bros were disgusted, some were in awe, and a few were chanting.  Jason downed the last slice, then finished off the Pepsi, and pushed his chair back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great, bros,\" he remarked, smiling and rubbing one hand across his newly capacious middle. \"Now where to?\"</span></div></div>",

And, most important of all, he will find a girl who would love the new, bigger him! His genes had given him a strong, fat body and a love of food - and his ever loving grandma (well off, and no skinny chick herself) had given him the keys he needed to build his new body and his new life - a sense of confidence in himself, a fast laptop with broadband access, and a college trust fund that would pay for a few new clothes....heck, he was sure she\u2019d be glad to bankroll his  new lifestyle! And then, to hell with the guys who stuffed him and then left, laughing.  He\u2019d eat whatever they put in front of him AND go out with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to change!\" Jason says out loud to himself.

The bus dropped the hefty young man at the edge of a charming farm, and Jason made his way to the large farmhouse. As he got to the front steps, he was huffing and sweating. He started his march up the steps, feeling his belly bounce with each step. The door opened when he got to the top, and a man came out. He looked like a body builder, and surprised Jason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be Jason come on in we have a big meal ready for you! I was told to make sure you get your fill! So come on!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was practically forced in to house and pushed over to a table with a wide worn bench seat. The table had a wide arch cut into the side of it and Jason was pushed into the middle of it by the large muscular man behind him. The food was tantalizingly close to his fingertips. It all looked so good! Jason was licking his lips when a booming voice hollared \u201cEat!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was startled but started eating like he was told. The food tasted weird and made him feel bloated after eating just a bit of it. Then a strong hunger crept upon Jason and he began to eat faster. The more he ate it seemed the hungrier he got. Soon he was eating like a pig and couldn\u2019t bring himself to stop or slow down. A shocking amount of food was going into the fat young man, and he could both feel and see his gut stretch and swell. Jason was getting very worried when the man came back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough food for you pig it\u2019s time for your shake!\u201d He then brought over a beer bong and a large pitcher filled with a creamy liquid. \u201cThis is our special mix, it really helps our pigs grow big and fat! Your gonna get this all down and go to sleep for a while, ok.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, I don\u2019t think\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right \u2018you don\u2019t think\u2019 you just eat.\u201d The man pushed the tube in Jason\u2019s mouth and made him chug the whole shake. Jason was full to bursting and passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Jason came to with the muscular man pushing cake between his lips. \u201cEat!\u201d He screamed. Though he didn\u2019t need to. Jason was unbelievably hungry and began to eat handfuls of cake as fast as he could. \u201cThat\u2019s it pig go on an feed! There\u2019s plenty more where that came from.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached for more and more cake, Jason noticed his hands looked chubbier. His wrists and arms were more plump then before. Jason looked his body over and saw how much weight he had somehow gained overnight. His belly looked wider, rounder and covered more of his lap than before. His moobs were bigger sitting on his belly and prolong his arms up a bit. His thighs were thicker and his hips were wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt shouldn\u2019t be possible to gain that much weight overnight, and yet here Jason was in all his obese glory! Looking all of 350 pounds and eating like a pig. The muscular man kept food at Jason\u2019s fingertips and Jason kept eat and eating. After consuming enough for a large family Jason saw the man bring out the funnel and shake. \u201cIt\u2019s time for your shake pig, gotta keep you growing!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed the tube in but he didn\u2019t have to fight Jason. He wanted the shake. He craved it. Hungered for it. Like a drug. He was scared when he began to gulp it down as fast as he could. He didn\u2019t know how fat he would be when he woke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow fat was he?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The pressure on his stomach had eased enough to make moving around a bit easier, if not quite effortless, so Jason slowly rose and returned to his room, taking each step of the staircase as slowly as a bride walking down the aisle. Once there, he went to his wardrobe to get what might pass as some gym gear. He had a tie-dye t-shirt that had fit a little baggier on him than his other tops did before he got to college, and some sweatpants that were a lot more forgiving than the cargo pants he was currently wearing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTugging the pants down his thicker thighs and struggling to wriggle free of his shirt felt like a workout alone; carrying the extra weight from his stuffed gut certainly added to the challenge. He took a moment to relax and enjoy feeling free of the constraints of clothes; he let out a big sigh and felt his belly relax and expand without being pinched by the waistband of his trousers.  Getting into his new clothes was not without effort but was a little easier.  Thanks to his growing gut, Jason was forced to wear the sweatpants lower than he was used to, and despite his growing size giving him less of the drawstring to work with, he managed to tie them on securely enough. The t-shirt felt tighter all over; his chest, shoulders and arms had clearly added more heft that he hadn't really considered before, but it was particularly tight around his belly. It wasn't exactly skin tight but it skimmed pretty tightly around his gut.  It should be fine as long as he didn't move his arms above his head.  Or off to the sides.  Or let them swing too much when he walked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his clothes sorted, Jason scooped up his keys, wallet and phone before heading out. His head was buzzing with ideas but his first priority was to find a gym. He didn't want to use the one on campus or one too close to the frat house in case he saw any of his brothers there. It was one thing for them to take control of his stuffings but he didn't want them sabotaging his workouts, being a general distraction, or filling his head with any of their 'bro' science while he was working on his goals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he spent a little time walking, Jason realized that he made the right choice. Whilst he wasn't finding it difficult right now, he could feel the different way that his bigger body moved as he walked the streets and could imagine the extra effort it would take as he got bigger. Having some muscle to hold up and help lug around the fat was the smart thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason turned a corner he hit a strip with a few shops on it but there were no signs of any gym. He was so busy back at the frat house deciding to make a change that he didn't even think of doing a search online for nearby gyms or leisure centres.  Pulling out his phone, he did a quick search and found that there was one roughly ten minutes walk away. With the distance that he had already walked and its out of the way location, it seemed far enough away for him to be safe from his peers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ten minutes to get there felt like an age, as Jason kept checking street names and the map on his phone to make sure that he was headed the right way. As he reached the right road, he spotted the gym immediately. Because it seemed so out of the way, Jason assumed that it would be a bit pokey or basic, but the building was glass fronted and was surprisingly big; it looked very well maintained. The automatic doors hissed open as he approached and he could feel a blast of cool dry air hit him as he walked through. There were a couple of men chatting by the reception desk; a receptionist sat tapping on a keyboard as well. He wanted to get a better idea of the place before he talked to anyone, so he went up to a well organised noticeboard and had a read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a lot to take in there as there seemed to be a lot to the gym.  There were a variety of classes, from dance to self-defense, zumba to step aerobics, some of which were gender or age specific.  There were pictures of a decent sized pool and \u2013 what Jason was <i>really</i> interested in \u2013 what seemed to be a pretty well equipped gym.  There were a list of rates that seemed pretty reasonable and although there was nothing listed to say so, he wondered idly if there were any kind of student discount available. He thought it would be as simple as walking in, signing up and lifting weights but perhaps he should consider taking a much more structured approach. He didn't have any swimming trunks with him and he probably would need to buy some new ones that wouldn't cut off his blood supply, he thought as he absent-mindedly rubbed his belly. But other than swimming, most of the other options were open to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst he had to sign up.  He checked the list of prices to see what would work best for him when another thought struck him.  Although he had decided against it earlier, perhaps now would be the right time to call his friend Travis. He lived off campus and wasn't in the frat system so he wouldn't have the opportunity to blab to his frat brothers about Jason's plan, but more than that he was a gym goer and was taking a sports and nutrition course at college. Who better to scope the place out and tell him if it's any good than him? He might be able to help him out with a good workout plan on the cheap too. That said, Jason was feeling pretty impatient. Perhaps he should just talk to the receptionist, get signed up and check out the facilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Travis was a good guy, knew what he was talking about when it came to fitness and more than that, would help him to stay dedicated to his goals.  Although Jason wanted to get started straight away, calling Travis just made too much sense.  He would have to put up with a slight delay in his plans and hit the gym hard tomorrow.  Perhaps tonight he could have a big, pre-workout bulk meal?  In preperation for the next day.  He was pretty sure that some muscleheads must do that.  As it turned out, his plans were premature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's my gym!\" Travis said shortly after Jason had called him and explained where he was.  \"What are the odds of that, huh?  Wait, have you been stalking me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wish.\"  Jason snorted.  \"Do you have any time tomorrow to come down here with me and give me some advice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I head there now?  I was thinking about going tonight anyway.  I can be there in about ten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen of course turned into a little over twenty and when Travis finally did show up, Jason was fairly sure he knew why.  His hair was perfectly styled and it looked like he had a freshly pressed t-shirt and shorts on, not to mention that he had the slow confident walk of someone who did everything at their own pace.  College life had really changed him, but then it had done a number on Jason too he thought, running his hand lightly over his belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Travis said, his face breaking out into a wide grin as he walked up to Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Good to see you.\" Jason replied, realising just how much he meant it as he grinned back.  He was used to the stuffing sessions for the most part and now that he had a plan to build up some muscle he felt like he had re-gained some control, but it had been a few weeks since he had last seen him and being around Travis he felt like he could truly let his guard down and just enjoy his company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to miss you.  That's an interesting shirt and trouser combo you have going on there, buddy,\" Travis said, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme a break.\"  Jason said sighing.  \"These were the only clothes that I had at home that... were suitable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" Travis said, flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, if I wanted advice on my clothes I'd call one of those snobby fashion majors.  I called you because I need your help with working out... reps, sets and all of those... things.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it <i>looks</i> like you've doing three sets of ten reps worth of vists to the vending machine here in the lobby,\" Travis replied, giving the side of Jason's belly a couple of gentle slaps.  \"You've really blown up since I last saw you, bud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You worry about looks too much.\" Jason grumbled.  \"Anyway,\" Jason continued, glancing down at Travis' midesction, \"it <i>looks</i> like <i>you've</i> been focusing more on the nutrition side of your course than the exercise yourself.\"  Jason reached over and gave Travis a poke in the gentle slope of a beginner belly beneath his performance t-shirt.  Travis frowned, took a step back and sucked his little belly in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I've been letting things slide a bit recently,\" he said, running his hand over his stomach.  \"Now I've got someone to go the gym with me, we can work on our goals together!  I can tone up  and I can help you to lose a few pounds and start building some muscle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I don't want to lose any fat.  In fact I'm going to keep getting fatter, I just want some muscle to haul it around with.\"  Travis folded his arms and looked dead in Jason's eyes for a few moments before a grin slowly slipped on to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are a one-off, huh?  OK...\" he said slowly, looking off into the distance, \"I think I can work something out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have a problem with that?\" Jason asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your body, your choice.\" Travis said with a shrug.  \"It's best to be realistic and honest about your goals and you were certainly honest... but as you keep getting bigger you're going to have to keep being honest if you start getting any aches or pains during any exercises, or if your size makes doing certain things difficult.  Communication is important between a personal trainer and his client.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're going to be my personal trainer, huh?\" Jason said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I'll help you out however... <i>unusual</i> your goals.  Just don't be offended if I don't take any before and after photos for a testimonial.\" Travis said, winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Jason said, smiling warmly at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it.  Now, how about we fill out the paperwork and get you enrolled here at the gym?  It won't take too long, I can fill in most of the details for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good!\" Jason said, excited to start hulking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to need a little time to figure out the best workout for your goals, so how about we get you signed up and then we...\"</span></div></div>",

The two top eaters would then meet on Sunday for an 8 hour eating marathon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason decided the contest would be a great opportunity to do some \"damage\" so he decided to \"donate\" the liquid refreshment for the contest - all spiked with the drug of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, the Freshmen elected Jason - and the Juniors - having seen Lester chow down heavily in the last three weeks - chose him. Three more of the guys were about to become part of the revenge as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally,  Jason and Lester won on Saturday. What amazed everyone was how they both were able to down ten Pizzas - the others weren't even close (although Jason knew that was just the beginning for them). By the end of the day, both had huge solid guts pushed out in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunday was just a rush of gluttony for both guys. Jason had the Frats forcing him to eat - while Lester has the drugs making him hungry all the time. The more Lester ate, the hungrier he got. After 4 hours, the count had already reached 30 pizzas each. Two hours later, they both were over 40. Jason was actually struggling to keep up with Lester - even though he had 50+ pounds over him. Lester - by this time, was struggling with his clothes - which were now skin tight and threatening to burst. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Lester has the cumulative effect of three weeks of the gaining drug - which keeps him hungry all the time - he still does not have the total stomach capacity Jason has. In the end, Jason wins the pizza contest.  All that pizza, plus the great feeling of getting some revenge, spurs on Jason's own appetite, so that as well as the Frat's ritual stuffing of Jason on Saturday night Jason goes on a bit of a \"food bender\" of his own - call it a weekend of stuffing.  The end result is that, by Monday morning, he's added another ten pounds to his generous frame - bringing him close to 250 pounds. (At this rate, Jason will gain weight just as fast as the victims of his 'revenge'.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Jason is more interested in Lester and his three new candidates, then in his own growth.  Those three new potential candidates for 'revenge' are: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler - the Trust Fund - is a Wildcard.  Commonly going by Ty, he is head of the Frat, and he's rich the old-fashioned way - he has inherited it. Tall and thin and elegant, Ty has money, and he knows how to spend it. His clothes fit him perfectly. Everyday, he has a special cocktail before dinner - from his PRIVATE stock - and Jason figures on making those cocktails even more special with the addition of the gaining drug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill - the Brick - is a Senior, a big football player.  Unlike some big football linemen, though, he is not only big but Built!  He has huge muscles bulging everywhere. He is even more of a gym rat than Lester and he drinks special 'protein shakes' every day. Those shakes would be a perfect place to add the gaining drug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan, the Casanova, is a Junior, and the hearthrob of the Frat. He is incredibly good looking - and he knows it - and so do all the girls on campus (not to mention some of the guys...). Not a gym rat - instead, he is a runner. Everyday he gets up early in the morning to put in his five miles and he never leaves without his water bottle - which will now be spiked with gainer drug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the various drugs, Lester is already well on his way to getting fat. The day after the contest, he woke up early and groggy - and in the dark went to the bathroom where he bumped into the sink edge with his (gulp) belly. Turning on the light, he saw that his once firm abs were gone, replaced by a starter gut that bowed out from just under his pecs in a perfect arc. He could not pull the gut in, no matter how he tried. Upset, he immediately took off for the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis training buddies had already seen him bulk over over the last couple of weeks - and they were not surprised to see Lester even bigger. Based on the amount of pizza he had consumed over the weekend, how could he not have a gut? Worse yet - Lester always had the tightest, form-fitting clothes - and they were really tight now. Yes, his workouts meant that not all of his gain had been fat - Lester had gained some muscle too - but he was now gaining much too quickly for the gain to be all muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he complained about getting fat, though, most of his gym buddies just welcomed Lester to their (thicker) side, and told him that the bulk looked good on him.  They paid his growing girth no more attention than that....</span></div></div>",

Bill, Lester's training buddy, was a good deal bigger than Lester and while mostly muscle, he had a softness to his skin, and a distinct gut. After the showers, Lester saw himself in the mirror and started to complain about his gain. Bill told Lester that he had always been too skinny anyway, and pointed out the bigger arms and pecs and other growing muscles. Lester actually liked the larger muscles. Bill then said that Lester's gain was inevitable. As he got older, his metabolism would slow down and his hard workouts would just add new muscle growth. He was destined to get bigger, he may as well enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill said that it was now fall, and it was time for him to start his bulk up for winter. Time to get the bigger sweats out and build up a belly. He would add 50-60 pounds and then cut down after New Years for Spring Break. He told Lester to relax and go with the flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLester stepped on the scale in the locker room - which moved all the way up to 198 pounds. But Bill not only convinced Lester that he was OK - but that he really wasn't that big. \"You don't even start getting big until you've made it to 250 pounds,\" said Bill. \"Your hunger will tell you that you need to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Lester felt his strong hunger return. He really needed to eat something - anything.  Maybe Bill was right. Lester decided to allow himself to \"bulk up\" a little more. (Jason would have been proud - and will see the results!). Lester and Bill went out to the cafeteria for a huge breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bill insists on mostly HUGE sweats that Lester is swimming in. \"Remember - these things shrink - and you will be growing so get the big ones\".  Bill adds in some new underwear and off they go to the Nutrition Shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill has Lester stay in the car while he picks up some \"protein shakes\"  and vitamins for Lester.  What he does buy is a special \"weight gainer\" powder and \"weight gain\" supplement from the owners special stock. Bill has done this before. Secretly, he is a feeder who loves to really bulk up a guy like Lester. The supplement is a pill that increases appetite and slows metabolism - just like the one Jason is already feeding Lester (Although Bill doesn't know this) - and the Powder is a special High Calorie formula that is addicting. \"Lester is gonna get a lot more than just Big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill tells Lester that he will need the extra Protein in his diet to feed his growing muscles and the vitamins in the supplement will help also. They go back to the Frat and set up a regular schedule of  Workouts and supplementation - including twice a day Protein Drinks and a couple of the supplement pills each day just for the first week.<br>\r\nJason sees what is happening and can't wait as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe combination of the two appetite stimulants builds up really  quickly the first week. Lester is so hungry, he almost can't stop eating. And no matter how much he eats, the hunger returns with a vengeance.  That plus the addition of 4000 calories from the \"protein\" shakes - and the fact that Lester's metabolism is taking a major hit as well - as Lester really starts to balloon. But no one can see it, from the clothes Lester is wearing. But Bill and Lester can when they hit the showers, although Bill always points out the growing muscles. He also points out that Lester will put on a gut - can't help it - but he could lose it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Frat - everyone can see Lester stuffing himself and complaining how hungry he is. Both Jason and Bill are enjoying watching Jason grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Bill reduces the \"supplement \": to one a day the second week - Lester's appetite is still intense. And the pounds are piling on. At the end of the second week - Lester weighs in at 225  - a 27 pound gain in two weeks. Lester has gained 50 pounds in the last five weeks and the gut is really spreading. His face has filled in and he is getting a double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Bill can say to Lester is - \"Great start\" - it will be harder to gain as the weeks pass. It is already too late for Lester to Disagree - he is too hungry for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bill is clearly focusing on Lester's growth in his chest and arms and legs, but when Lester notices his mid-section and complains, there is always an excuse from Bill, such as, \"after you bulk up - you'll cut down and get your 6-pack back - but the rest of your muscles will be so much bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Lester hits the showers, Jason goes over to Bill, and the two start talking. Bill casually mentions that the last guy he \"bulked up\" now weighs over 350 pounds and will never lose it. Intrigued, Jason asks what is going on. Bill admits he is a feeder and is fattening Lester up. Jason, surprised but happy at this additional boost to Lester's growth, tells Bill that he too has been \"supplementing\" Lester's appetite.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNo wonder Lester can't stop eating - he is being hopelessly overdosed on the appetite stimulants. The warning label on the bottle clearly says that an overdose could lead to a permanently increased appetite and the inability to stop gaining weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking a while, Bill quizs Jason as to why he is getting fat and why he wants Lester to get fat.  Jason admits that the Frat has been forcefeeding him and, because he has gained so much weight, he wants revenge on them. So Jason got the appetite stimulant and was feeding it surreptitiously to Lester, Bill (the football player), Tyler, and Evan. While all were beginning to gain weight, Jason noticed that it was Lester who was really piling it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill (Lester's trainer) said that he knew the other (football) Bill, and would love to fatten him up too. Jason and Bill T decide to split up the the four guys - and Jason will now work on Tyler and Evan, while Bill T will work with Bill and Lester, and they will see how fat they can get them.</span></div></div>",

Anyway, you don't want to gain too fast, new clothes are expensive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the athletic director sent you on your way to the reservoir, but not without adding, \"And if you do it right there might be a little treat in it for you, chubby boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, he really irritated you, but it doesn't matter now, soon enough all the jocks are going to be \"chubby boys\". You make your way to the basement and open the water tank. You see that it really did need filling, so you get to work. You begin filling the tank with the purified nutrient enriched water, and then you add the appetite increasing drug, it is enough for 90 days but the water tank is refilled about every month. You can't wait to see the results. You finish the task and go back upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'm finished,\" you say to the athletic director. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you're good for something,\" he replied and threw a candy bar at you. You take the candy bar and leave, no use wasting a perfectly good candy bar; they'll all be wanting it back soon enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to the gym daily and work out. The jocks still make snide remarks about your big stature, but it doesn't bother you as much any more, and when Mark and Travis say things it even makes you laugh a little bit. After two weeks you notice some slightly heftier gym groups. The spandex gym uniforms are a little tighter and many more loose-fitting sweatsuits have emerged. You also notice that the athletes have been coming in later, taking more snack breaks to \"bulk-up on protein\" they keep saying, and leaving earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have also been continuing your gaining cycle of the frat boys feeding you, but it is not as fast as the jocks whose bodies are not used to the increased calorie intake; in fact your body has gotten used to the high calorie intake and with the work outs you weight gain has leveled off. You notice the full effects one day while in the locker room. You notice that Mark certainly has added to his pudge and has gotten a cute little starter belly and Travis has lost some ab definition and you comment; as you pass the two you poke Mark's flab and say, \"Looks like I've got some competition,\" and to Travis, \"Hey, tubby.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two look at you in disgust and continue changing and Mark pulls his stretch work out shirt over his head and looks at himself in the mirror. He does notice that he has let himself go, but he's been so hungry lately he can't help it. You notice him suck in his belly and then push it out. He rubs his belly and you see a little smile creep across his face, but is quickly wiped off when Travis, having just weighed himself, grabbed him in a furious mood and pulled him to the water fountain to fill up his bottle and begin their work-out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head out to the gym as well and admire your work. The jocks all sporting new flab, but you can't seem to get Mark's smile over his growing belly out of you head.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

When they do sit-ups, their shirts ride up in the back, exposing fleshy lovehandle.  In the front, their bellies hang out onto their laps.

When anyone's arm goes into the air, their shirt exposes soft, hairy guts that jiggle around with movement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     These people defined the word ExJock, and even they noticed they were chubbing out.

He was worried they'd report it to the athletics head and they'd test the water.<br>\r\n\"It's kind of addicting\" the first teen said, holding an empty water bottle in one hand and was filling one with another hand.<br>\r\n\"I'm getting two just for practice.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll do that too\" the other said, grabbed a sip and went to go get a waterbottle to be filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was so happy, the jocks were getting fatter, they barely noticed and they weren't going to stop anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason continued on and passed by another water fountain, lined up with big jocks.

He wasn't offended at first, knowing that the exjock would just get fatter after this, but then he realized he wasn't the big boy of the school anymore. When people picked on Jason and his fat gut, they always told him, never pushed or touched him. They didn't because he was too big to move and bigger than the bullies. Now he was the smaller one, and he loved it. He looked at the tall blonde boy bending over the fountain, he was obviously muscled before. When he stood up he looked about Mike's size, and Jason was only 5'10. The boy was 8 inches taller than him, and would've never pushed him before. Jason smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason passed by the locker room and saw Travis and Mark, now huge, with a waterbottle in one hand a triple cheese burger in another. They were wearing their updated uniforms, and it fit over their belly button but their happy trails remain exposed. All the boys seemed to care less that their bellies showed, everyone was fatter and didn't feel self concious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was passing by the office when the assistant head of athletics, a student, stopped him.<br>\r\nThe boy's name was Joe, and he gained a lot of weight as well, and as he talked his belly jiggled.<br>\r\n\"Jason right? You're the boy that maintains the water right?\" he asked<br>\r\nJason was scared, was he about to get caught?<br>\r\n\"Well the old waterboy transfered schools, and since you already refill the water, do you want to be the waterboy?\" he asked. Again, a close call, and Jason agreed with much enthusiasm. He would be making all the jocks get fat, and they wouldn'f know!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason carried on and he stopped at the burger place in the school as he was extremely hungry from his sip from before. He was both happy and sad to see a huge line of jocks at the place, happy that they'd gain and sad that he'd have to wait in line. He took his place in line and listened in as the boys ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"30 triple cheese burgers\" was what most boys ordered, and for themselves. Then, an unusual order came about. \"75 burgers.\" said a voice that was familiar. Most boys would be able to eat that much, but the football season was about to start and the team didn't want to al be over 400 pounds.

Not only was their a rivalry between the teams, but between the players. Jason was glad his belly sat on his lap, hiding his boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the locker room feast, Mike's shirt ripped as well.

Jason again came back with more burgers, 1000 this time, and again they were gone. This time, however, the majority of the team was full. Those who would still eat more kept their mouths shut.

Jason took similar classes to most of the jocks, and although he had a lot of football players in his class, he only gave them to the others. It was a small moving plan but it was all he had at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason listened in as a football player and a baseball player talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man Nick you're huge!\" Brian said. Nick was tall like the other jocks, brown hair green eyes and tan skin. He was the 4th boy to rip his shirt at football practice the other day.<br>\r\n\"I know\" Nick said. \"I ripped my football jersey, my parents are going to be pissed I'll have to buy another one.\" Nick said.<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't care, you're so big! How much do you weight?\" Brian asked. Brian was a jock, and a fatter one on his team, but the 2 had a major weight difference.<br>\r\n\"586.\" Nick said. Brian gasped.<br>\r\n\"Dude you're almost 100 pounds heavier than me! I weight 502!\" Brian said. The two laughed and they continued talking about other stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"100 pounds...\" Jason thought to himself. \"Thats a big difference.\" Jason thought back when everyone was muscular. Nick had more muscle than Brian but they were only 30 pounds apart. Now 100 was a big difference. \"I need to find a way to get the others bigger.\" Jason decided. Tomorrow was the water refill day, and he had a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at the manual in the room to determine how the water got to each hallway. The football players all went to similar fountains and the fountains were'nt that divided but it was a start. With jason he had a lot of stimulant. With him he had 450 days, over a years worth. He decided earlier that month he double the intake for all hallways, but he wanted to give 30 extra days to the other jocks. Jason moved the dials and switches and did so, hoping the others would gain more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stimulant was expensive, but earning over 2000 dollars a practice was very helpful. </span></div></div>",

The next day was the first football game, and the team wouldn't be able to stop for food whenever they were hungry. Jason pushed his worries aside, knowing that the team would be huge; and the other teams could catch up during their seasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the audience were many stands for burgers, and the other jocks ate fully while the football players were longing for the game to be over so they could eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat on the sidelines providing water, with the nornal 10 day dose. After 2 hours of nonstop working, and NOT eating (the jocks always had food in their mouths; the never went this long before), the team won. The team cheered and celebrated, but above all were hungry. Jason had out 1500 burgers for each player, and they were amazed at how much food was offered. They sat down and dug in, and sat for 2 hours eating nonstop with huge amounts. About an hour into their feast, the boys finished but were still hungry. Jason doubled what they had and they were abiut halfway through their doubled feast and weren't stopping anytime soon. After an hour and a half passed, the team sat only in their underwear, as all their clothes had ripped off and they still had a lot of hunger in them. At the end of two hours they ate 4500 burgers each. This time there was no moaning of wanting more food, they were moaning in pleasure for being full. No one kn the college had been completely full in a while, and it was amazing as a football player. The boys spent 5 minutes trying to get up, as their huge bloated stomached blocked their movements. As the boys tried to leave the locker room, everyone couldn't fit in the door. Vinny got stuck and couldn't move, and the team tried to get him out, but only brought him back into the locker room. The only other exit was the audience exits which were hugs, meant to bring 10 people in at once. The boys dreaded the walk but moved on anyways and left the field. Before they left, however, the weighed themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason listend in, and the team was about 750 pounds on average. In just a night the team gained 120 pounds. This was the first game of 20. At the end of the season they boys wouldn't be able to move. Jason's boner was so hard it lifted up the big belly under him, and he cummed just by thinking about how big they were. Jeff, Nick, Travis, Mike, Mark, the whole team was going to be huge. Jason's thoughts slipped from howing to get the other jocks fatter, they lost their lead 40 pounds behind, and were now 160. </span></div></div>",

The jocks were going to be so fat, and Jason cummed again in his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, the other jocks are shocked. The football players are huge, and their steps shake the ground as they walk. Jason continued on in his classes, and Nick, the football player, sat down at his desk and it broke when he sit. The teacher called the custodians to bring in another desk, and had Nick sit on the floor. Jason walked passed the fountains to have seen more people than ever, taking long sips and going back to the end of the line, with 4 water bottles being drunk while waiting in line for the next sip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jocks weren't the only ones growing as was Jason. He started drinking regularly from the fountains, and like everyone couldn't help his hunger. Jason ate burgers everywhere he went, and he ripped all his clothes with his gain, weight 431 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became regular around the college to go around shirtless, as barely anyone could fit into clothes anymore, even the basketball and baseball players. Jason saw Jimmy back in his class and he too broke the chair, and soon the entire school needed more weight resistant chairs, and the students kept gaining and gaining, football players gaining the most. If Brian thought Nick was huge then, he should look now. 2 weeks later Brian gained 100 and Nick gained 300. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with needing new desks, the school needed new doors. No football player could get into a class and some other jocks couldn't either. Since they couldn't fit into the door, they were excused and they ate together at the burger place. </span></div></div>",

In the meantime you would savor the delight of seeing all the jocks try and work off the results of their new appetites, hard workouts that ironically lead them to drink more of the water that was the original cause of their growing hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbs were fading away, skin-tight shirts were stretching, all in all it was impressive what could happen in a month. Keeping to lighter weights leaves you able to keep an eye on everyone, and enables you to need only a quick clean-up in case you want to leave at only a few moments notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis is doing bench presses, releasing a steady stream of profanity as he does, infuriated by the weight he has gained. You can't help but be impressed, he's gained less than anyone else. Mark on the other hand has taken his weight in stride (pleasure?) - he's wearing a white spandex shirt that used to fit but now clings lightly around a developing belly. The stretchy material leaves nothing about his dark and thickening gut to the imagination. At this very moment he holds it and even rubs it slowly with a distant smile. As close as you are you hear a growl of hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry again?!\" Travis shifts his attention to Mark, \"Better watch it, you're getting pudgy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's smile disappears he seems angry, an emotion he rarely displays. After only a few more reps Travis' stomach grumbles its own discontent. Travis curses and set the bar back in place. Standing, Travis informs Mark that he'll cut the work-out short since Mark is hungry, but that he expects him early for their next session to make up for lost time. Without waiting for a response from Mark, Travis whirls about and sets off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark shrugs unhappily and heads to the locker room. Seeing your chance to speak to him, you replace your own weights and follow suit. Inside the locker room you quickly check to ensure you and Mark are alone. With no one else around you approach Mark who is already changing out of his gym clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile privately, knowing Travis had done a heavy workout while Mark had only done some light weight lifting when he wasn't spotting Travis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Mark, how's everything going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looks up startled, obviously he didn't know you were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right I guess.\" Mark says giving you the cold shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment. Mark has obviously relaxed since everyone started putting on some weight but he may not be entirely happy about it. At least he carries it decently, most of his gain (probably eight pounds) had settled around his stomach giving his body a contrast with his still firm pectorals and toned arms. Then again he was obviously comfortable with it, commonly rubbing and patting his new tummy. He could almost be called affectionate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way you need to decide whether to ask him about further gains subtly or just be direct. Either way you think it's a fifty fifty chance that it is the right course.</span></div></div>",

I'll even pay for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Mark, he had a pretty lucrative job and his parents were pretty rich, so affording the food was no problem for him.

They were illegal, and if he were to get caught or one of the Frat brothers found out and spilled, he could get 25-50 years in prison... maybe more! But Jason wasn't about to let the frat brothers look up the medicine online and get him kicked out of the fraternity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, he went to Google and searched, \"weight gain drugs.\" There, on the screen, was a long list of sites, some legal others... not-so-legal. Jason scanned the page until he found a site that had every illegal drug in the book. He checked the URL, to know where to order in case he ran out... which was bound to happen.<br>\r\n\"Mr.Know-it-all-M.D.com\"** <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing an order was easier than thought. All that was needed was a name, an address, and credit card number.<br>\r\nTotal: $50.99<br>\r\nJason cringed at the total. Way expensive for 90 pills! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs Jason having second thoughts and should switch to legal meds or pay the outrageous amount for outrageous results?</span></div></div>",

His butt was starting to stick out and strain his waistband, and he started to pant from the exertion of shoving the food into his mouth so fast.  His chin wobbled as his mouth chewed on its food, and his arms grew as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Rick, the once lithe sports star, his once defined muscles were slowly disappearing under his new layers of blubber.  His abs were the first to disappear, replaced by a large spherical belly in his middle that continued to grow and grow.  Then, his strong leg muscles were hidden by a growing bubble butt, also complemented with a new pair of fat thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the frat boys in the room were getting fatter.  Even though Jason remained the fattest, he saw that they were slowly but surely catching up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half-hour later, the feeding frenzy ended.  Everyone besides Kyle, who had never insulted Jason, had stuffed their bellies silly, all of them now undeniably fat, bellies covered in stretch marks from overeating.  They all groaned as several went around to find different places to lie down.  Jason saw Rick take the love seat, the once-ripped musclehead now degenerated into a fatass lying on the couch.  Craig just sat in his chair, his legs spread apart to make room for his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell had worked well.  Now the frat boys couldn't complain, nearly all of them overweight, just like Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed contentedly and went upstairs.  Getting back on the spell website, he eventually found a way to cancel the insult spell.

Craig, who had been the king of fat insults in the frat house, or Rick, the once-lithe jock who cared about his physical performance than anything else?

He wasn't sure if it was a part of pledging, some form of punishment or if it had been organised to raise funds for the fraternity as there seemed to be a sizable crowd watching.  All he knew as he sat back in his chair tracing his fingers gently around the sides of his bloated belly in small circles, is that he could squeeze in one or two of those pies that those lightweights in the video were eating.  This was the bitterwsweet part of a stuffing; the moment when the pain subsided and he began to feel a bit more able to stretch out and breathe also reminded him how much he loved the feeling of being stuffed to his full, virile capacity.  His time to be stuffed would come around again soon enough, perhaps even tomorrow if it was a particularly slow day for his brothers.  Now it was time to turn his attention to the stuffing and fattening up of others...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConvincing his brothers to hold the contest would be easy, particularly if they could monetise it to raise some funds for the frat.  He could do with coming up with a way to raise some money anyway, since a couple of his brothers had started 'joking' about making Jason pay for the privilege of being stuffed full of food almost to bursting point and then left groaning where he sat, like an abandoned toy.  The only problem was in a frat that derived some kind of sadistic pleasure from stuffing one of it's own to the point of pain, making him pay for the pleasure of it was just the next logical step.  So in addition to his studies, the stuffings that could happen at any given moment and his plans for revenge, he had to start factoring in the need to generate an income.  Jason sighed to himself, shifting his weight awkwardly in his seat.  That was a problem for another day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the contest was organised, it was going to be hard to stop himself becoming the main attraction.  He was sure that he could appeal to the competitive spirit of the jock brothers to take part, but just like in any other sport if there's a star player the other members of the team tend to fall in line behind them.  He needed to suggest, organise and then <b>not</b> take part in the eating contest to make sure that his brothers fought it out to be top hog.  If he wanted to really start to fatten them up he also had to make sure that there were plenty of practice sessions beforehand or multiple eating contests.  A little bit of pudge wasn't enough for Jason; he had to make sure that at least a few of his brothers, preferably the ones that treated him the worst, gained a sizable belly in just the same way that he had - by being stuffed to their limits and just left where they were to just breathe shallowly and digest.  Who knows?  Maybe one or more of them might find out out that training for an eating contest is more fun than they thought...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course all of this would be a little easier if he had an ally or two helping him foster a sense of rivalry and manipulate their brothers into taking part in the contest and going <b>BIG</b>.  There were a few guys who told their other brothers to cut it out when they acted particularly badly towards Jason and a couple more who he knew had their own beef with his main tormentors.  If he could get them on side, applying pressure in just the right places and lending their voice to his, then it would make it a lot easier to really start to chub up some, or more, of his brothers than he originally thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight was the time to plan, but even if it wasn't the night after a stuffing was no time for him to be pro-active as he was sluggish, unfocused and with his clothes riding up around his bloated belly was taken less seriously than usual.  Tomorrow was the time to get things moving, but what was going to be his priority?</span></div></div>",

He would go join the football team...linemen are big, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Jason got up from the chair, and stumbled off, his belly aching, to the Frat TV lounge.  There, on the big screen, he found a repeat of a football game - some semi-pro league out west - and watched the 'skinny' quarterbacks being protected by linebackers some of whom looked like barrels of fat on thick legs.  Jason reflected that he wasn't that big - yet.  After a couple of hours of viewing, and some channel surfing, he stumbled into bed to dream of 350 pound linebackers, himself among them....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, faced with a still-swollen gut that fit into none of his pants, he pulled on his sweats and headed down for breakfast, and ate heartily - in fact, some of the brethren who had stuffed him last night would have been impressed to see him wolf down so much breakfast, if they hadn't been sleeping off their hangovers!

Come to get rid of that belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Jason sir,\" Jason began, between ragged deep breaths; he had jogged about 200 meters and his stamina was giving out.  (So far at university he had only ever done strength workouts.)  He was beginning to get winded, making it harder to talk because of panting for breath. \"A .. the ... rest, yes ... I think I ... need this.\" And with that he had to stop. As the coach and the team continued their morning jog, Jason bent over and tried to get his breath under control; he was panting so hard he was wheezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team kept going for three more turns around the field before stopping. The coach then gave them some orders for the next part of their workout. As the team spread out to practise the coach walked over to Jason who now was breathing normally again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well kid, you're a great football size but you're really are in terrible shape and I can't use you in the team until you manage to run at least one and half times round the track at that speed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at the field, he had not even made it a third of the way round.

As promised, a bunch of still somewhat hungover frat boys have taken Jason out for a supper time stuffing - not in the frat's dining hall, but a nearby Chinese buffet.  The hungover frats are not eating much but are taking 'the hair of the dog' in Chinese beer, while watching Jason put away what they think is his second stuffing in two days.  They don't know that it's Jason's third stuffing in 24 hours - his <b>second</b> buffet trip of the day - but Jason does, and he's determined to put on a show for the bros, AND make a serious start on being seriously BIG.  To that end, three big plates in, and determined not to slow down, Jason heads to the washroom to text Chad to join him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Chad, Jason. Come by the Lo Fat buffet - the frat is stuffing me again, and I need an eating buddy to pace me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than 20 minutes later, Chad appears, and Jason's frat bros can scarcely believe their eyes, or contain their lubricated mouths. While Jason looks big to them, Chad is 406 (or probably more by now) pounds of enormous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey fatso, are you one of Jason's little football buddies?\" asks the group smartass, who is quite drunk (again).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think 'little' describes me very well,\" Chad replies, and moves in close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about 'fatso' then?\" the guy retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that does describe me, don't you think?\" Chad ripostes, then puts a meaty arm around the drunken frat boy.  \"How's about a quick squeeze?\" he continues, pulling the frat bro in tight against his meaty torso, and then increasing the pressure, nearly lifting the bro off his feet.  \"Feel all that masculine flesh?\" he adds, leaning back so the bro is leaning on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrunkenly and ineffectively, the guy tries to push off Chad's arm.  \"Get off me,\" he says, as his hands flail against Chad's bulk. Chad just keeps up the pressure for a moment, then lets go dramatically, so the guy nearly falls over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a twig!\" Chad says to the guy.  \"Get some meat on those bones!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" the frat bro replies, as Chad goes to get some food himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Chad to alternately push him and pace him, Jason does himself proud at the drunken bros' expense, putting back even more than he did at the noontime with Chad. Stuffed, food coma-ish, Jason sits back while the drunken frat bros grumble but do pay the bill. They then head out for more drinks, while Jason watches Chad demolish a whole lot more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weight room tomorrow?\" Chad asks, when he's finally full too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Jason replies, content in the glow of food and friendship, his new life direction - bigger, stronger, hungrier - clear to him.</span></div></div>",

You want to get big,, like I did, then low reps and heavy is the way.  That's what built these big monsters,\" Chad remarks, flexing a mighty arm, the muscles underneath pushing the fat padding on top into a massive hill, \"and these mighty manboobs,\" he adds, flexing his pecs, which rose like loaves of bread under the thick layer of fat padding across his chest. \"We'll do chest and upper body on alternate days, and then do legs any day there isn't running for practice - just hauling your new weight around will help build your legs too. Don't use elevators - stairs are the way to killer thunder thighs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was a bit shocked at Chad's openness and commitment to getting bigger, and his casual use of terms like 'thunder thighs' and 'mighty hogs' that Jason thought were only derogatory. \"Why do you call yourself a hog?\" he asked Chad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I am!\" Chad replied.  \"And if you keep up with me, you will be too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it sounds so ... insulting, even worse than fat guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I call myself a hog and say I have thunder thighs and manboobs, then it stops anybody else from using them to make fun of me.  Not that many people make fun of me anymore...\" Chad went on. \"Not since I got big enough to take 'em on and flatten 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you used to get picked on?\" Jason asked in wonderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I was a tubby kid, and tubby kids are always picked on,\" Chad replied.  \"But now I'm a hog, a bear, a mighty football warrior god, so they leave me alone.  'Cause if they don't...\" he gestured with two pudgy fists, \"I pound 'em and then I sit on 'em! And nobody wants to be under this big fat ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason admired Chad's self-confidence, almost arrogance, and thought about it while the two of them showered and changed.  Jason was aching in various places, but Chad slipped him a couple of Tylenol before they left the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, USMC candy for aches,\" Chad joked, \"Extra-strength Tylenol.  If it works for the Marines, it'll work for football fatsos like us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'like us,' rung in Jason's ears as they headed from the locker room back to the same Chinese buffet as yesterday.  'us'.  Yes, Jason wanted to be one of 'us'.

Don't know if I'll get much playing time, but as I get bigger, I'll make a better lineman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, is that all the food for tonight?

Through the week, a few of the frat bros had razed Jason about spending more time - a lot more time - in the frat dining room, and others had seen him on the weight deck in the gym with Chad and other linemen, but nobody had made the connection between Jason, football, and his growing size.  Of course, Jason had bought new, bigger clothes, too, so his first week of serious growth wasn't immediately noticeable - no bulging shirts, no bursting seams - but now it's the next Friday night, frat stuffing time again, and Jason is determined to put on a SHOW for the bros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his Friday classes, Jason changed into his biggest new pair of rugby pants -  loose fitting, and a stretch waistband! - and slid into his biggest new T in preparation for the Friday night Frat stuffing. Whereas even last week he had not liked these Friday nights, had even dreaded them a little, this Friday Jason was more than ready, and looking forward to blowing the minds of the frat bros by just how much he was going to eat and chug - and how he was going to make it seem he could eat even more than they'd laid out, if humanly possible. To this end, Jason had made a point of eating lightly at lunch, but drinking a lot of liquids - getting one final stretch into his big new stomach capacity.  After a week of gorging, Jason's stomach had a lot of new capacity, and the water and light lunch made sure it was as empty as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was ready to fill his generous new gut - and to blow the his frat bros' minds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason sat down at the table, he looked at the pizzas and burgers in front of him and launched his psychological warfare on the bros.  \"This doesn't look like all that much,\" Jason remarked, smiling.  \"Are you sure this is more than last week?  A lot more?  I've been eating all week in preparation!\"  He smile again, and rubbed one hand across his belly. \"Really, it looks small.  Maybe you should get something more ready.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, still bet you can't eat all that,\" riposted one of the drunker bros, as another counted Jason in.  At the 'GO', Jason grabbed the plate nearest him and he ate<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd ate<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd ate<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finished the tableful, no sweat.  Jason looked around the table for more, then said, \"Is that all there is? That wasn't much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, how did you hold all that?\" asked a chorus of frat bros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that was a lot of food, you should join me and Chad and the football team at the buffet sometime,\" Jason noted.  \"You want me to be the frat stuffee, and I'm going for it, heart and soul,\" Jason continued happily. \"I'm getting big and hungry for you - in fact, I plan to be HUGE. You think the other guys on the football team are big, well...\" And with that Jason shoved his chair back from the table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Where you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if that was all the food you guys had for me, then I'm going to call up Chad and go really eat. Gotta be big and ready for the first football game on Sunday. Gotta get my playing weight up!  The bigger I get, the better a lineman I'll be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit, man, you're gonna be FAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the general idea!  Anybody coming with me?\"</span></div></div>",

There was a table and a large machine in the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since it was my idea I'll go first\" said Chad, taking his shirt off, revealing his massive fat hairy belly and lying down on the table. \"All you have to do is keep an eye on the needle, don't let it get above fifty.\" Chad put a house in his mouth and indicated the lever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately the machine began humming and a thick goo was forced through the hose and pumped into Chad's waiting belly. Jason smiled as giant jock looked to be in total bliss as he rubbed his belly and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor twenty minutes Chad didn't change, then Jason could being to see the goo pumping Chad's belly up bigger and rounder, but Chad still looked happy enough, another ten minutes passed before suddenly the machine seemed to increase its pressure and Chad's eyes suddenly opened. Jason looked over at the gauge, it read 100%!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried the lever, but nothing happened. Looking at Chad he could see his belly blowing up much faster than before, Chad was waving his arms. Jason tried pressing the buttons but nothing worked, Chad's belly continued to expand at an alarming rate. Jason tried the lever again but nothing happened, he tried to find a off switch but couldn't, he tried to unplug the machine but couldn't, all the while it continued to pump Chad's belly up with more and more of the goo, Chad's belly blowing up like a balloon, his belly now towering over him, then just as Jason was about to yank the hose out of the inflating jock's mouth, the machine ran dry.<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Asked Jason taking the hose from Chad's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo.... Fullll... Gonna ask EXPLODE!\" Chad replies, holding his now-massive hairy balloon belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad was now enormous; his quivering belly was just mesmerizing to Jason. He could not believe that Chad had ballooned into a giant fat hairy blimp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude... Your a BLIMP!\" said Jason, stepping back a bit to take in the full view of the blimped up belly and the jock underneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel it!\" said Chad, trying to lift his belly but couldn't.</span></div></div>",

With the Friday stuffings, an extra fifty will be easy.  If you carry that extra fifty well - and I bet you will, I watched you with Chad - then you'll go for more. And, you'll follow Chad in the weight room - gotta build up your body like Chad does, keep all that new weight in motion. Chad was a great walk-on last year, hopefully you'll be as good. Now, sign this form, and I'll leave this uniform for you in locker 16. Collect it after you shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was elated. The football team! A goal to gain the 'freshman fifty'! A new friend and workout buddy (growth buddy?) in Chad.  And the Coach is one of his Frat brothers, so he'll help look after him!</span></div></div>",

He found nobody on the field at all. Jason walked all around the arena, hoping to find a note of their location. He was up in the press booth when he finally saw someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremiah Burns was the head of Jason's frat. He was one of those guys who never took care of his looks, but somehow always looked nice. He was wearing a pair of ripped khaki shorts, a green t-shirt, and some yellow flip-flops. He was down there with a girl, but soon enough, she rejected his approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason at this point decided to try to talk to Jeremiah. He was rather nervous about directly speaking to the head of the fraternity, but if Jason remembered correctly, he had a few more rights than the average freshmen in the frat house. He waited until he was sure that he could pretend that he did not witness Jeremiah's failure, then ambled down to the field. \"Hey Jeremiah,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there... Jason right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, listen. I really enjoy being in the frat and everything, but these stuffings are becoming a bit costly. I have nothing else that fits me,\" he said, indicating his overstuffed pants and shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" said Jeremiah Burns. \"Well...</span></div></div>",

Listen up, because I'm going to about to drop a truth bomb,\" Jeremiah said, casually putting  his arm around Jason's shoulders and beginning to walk him along the edge of the field.  \"I don't really go in for all of that alpha male shit.  I don't think it matters acting or looking a certain way, dominating with a handshake or 'power moves' or any of that BS...\"  Jason nodded as Jeremiah spoke, amazed at how he was spending so much time to talk to him.  \"But there is something to be said for asserting yourself and being your own man.  I could just pick another freshmen, tell the guys to stuff him instead and they'd do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Jason said, with a strange mix of relief and disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.  But I'm not going to.\"  As Jeremiah replied, Jason's hopes and fears were both dashed.  \"Because you can do it for yourself.  How do you think I became the head of the frat?\"  Jason was slightly taken aback by the question and struggled for an answer under Jeremiah's intense gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be... cause you come from a wealthy family who have connections and have the natural confidence of someone who is born into money and expects to lead?\"  Jason felt Jeremiah's arm retract from around his shoulders and he felt a rising panic in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a pretty smart mouth, don't you kid?\"  Jason looked away under Jeremiah's gaze, feeling his cheeks begin to turn red.  \"Maybe you're right, maybe my parents and their money were a deciding factor, but my confidence, <i>wherever it may come from</i> is nothing without knowing what I want and being fearless in taking it.\"  Jason looked back up, Jeremiah nodded his head forward and Jason fell in line alongside him as they resumed walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell you exactly what those guys who are stuffing you are thinking and going to do.  They're going to keep fattening you up, they'll get you big and stuffed one night then drag you out to a party.  They'll be the ultimate frat brothers to you there, especially if there are girls around.  They'll make out that they're there to help you make new friends, all the while thinking that they look better being  next to someone so fat and getting credit for taking the sad, fat freshman under their wing and trying to make his life a little bit better.  It's textbook stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think that's what they're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I'd do, so if they have any sense that's what they're doing.  Never been my thing though, stuffing freshmen like that.\"  Jeremiah shrugged nonchalantly.  \"Maybe they just enjoy the power dynamics of it, or maybe fattening a man up is something that gets them going.  Takes all sorts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... think some men are just into fattening other men up?\" Jason said as casually as he could.  Jeremiah scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The things I've found around the frat house, walked in on by mistake... some of the things that our brothers have confided in me \u2013 trust me, one guy getting his thrills from fattening another up is low tier stuff.  Just remember...\" Jeremiah said, turning to look at Jason to emphasise his point, \"I'm a leader.  A true leader takes things in his stride, reassures his brothers and looks for solutions and <b>NEVER</b> judges them.\"  Jason and Jeremiah took a few steps forward in silence, as Jason mulled over his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, it can't hurt to have some dirt on people in case they ever fall out of line.\"  Jeremiah's head slowly turned and Jason felt his heart beat a little faster in his chest, until a broad smile broke out across the frat leaders face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  You're learning.  Of course if you can dig up a little dirt on the brothers who are stuffing you, then you can probably find a resolution.  Or you can assert yourself, that's what I meant about finding another freshman to stuff.  Get your tormentors on side, make yourself useful to them or make someone else a more tempting target.\"  Jason wasn't entirely sure if Jeremiah was reading the situation right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if... I just want them to pay for the food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same applies, just maneuver them into a situation where they have to or are willing to pay.\"  Jeremiah was as good as his word and took Jason's question in his stride.  \"You could just stick with joining the football team.  That's why you're here right?\"  Jason nodded.  \"The stuffings probably wouldn't stop, they might actually intensify until you get to a certain size, but you'd get some more respect in the frat.  A few of our brothers are in the team, so they'd look out for you <i>IF</i> you prove yourself to them.\"  Jeremiah suddenly came to a stop and Jason quickly followed suit.  \"I hope I've given you something to think about, Jason.  Go out there and get what you want, whatever it might be.  I'll keep my eye on you.\"  With that, Jeremiah casually strolled off, effortlessly dismissing Jason and leaving him with more than a large breakfast to digest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had come to join the football team, but perhaps there were other things that he could do.  The idea of having someone else stuffed instead, or as well, was appealing \u2013 perhaps he could even join in alongside the brothers who had pushed him to gorge himself and help them to fatten another freshman up?  Or maybe he could find a way to turn the tables on them and assert himself.  The idea of looming over them as they moaned and groaned with their bellies stretched out uncomfortably full and then just leaving them there, like they had done to him so many times felt like a sweet bit of payback, even if it was just a one-off.  He just wasn't sure if he was ready for any of this.  It was all very well to say that he just has to assert himself and fearlessly get what he wanted, but he had no idea how to do that.  Then Jason had a thought \u2013 the debating society was still accepting new members.  What better way to learn how to talk and handle people than with the correct use and application of an argument?  Then another thought came to him.  The sororities!  What better people to talk to than women to learn how to handle men?  As he pondered his options, Jason noticed some of the football team slowly start to disperse out onto the field and the coach trudge along the sidelines toward him.</span></div></div>",

He would enlist his friend Travis's help. Travis and Jason had been friends since grade school, and both of them had decided on the same university - though Travis had family in the city, and wasn't living on campus. Travis had also opted out of the frat system - he claimed he didn't have time for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis decision made, with a grunt Jason picked up his hefty gut and headed back to his room.  He collapsed heavily onto the bed and picked up the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You free this evening?\" Jason asked once Travis answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Travis replied. \"I was hoping we could get together soon, go to a movie or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" replies Jason. \"Where should we meet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can get to your frat in about 20 minutes,\" replies Travis. \"Then we can go from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!

Jason, naturally big and beefy and a touch rumpled because of it, had always admired how Travis\u2019 clothes seemed to hang perfectly on his body, no matter why he did.  Despite their physical differences though, Travis and Jason had a lot in common - not the least of which was a love of food.

He and Travis used to go out to eat after movies, but Travis never suggested food so directly before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, we\u2019re friends, I can be blunt,\u201d replied Travis.  \u201cI can see that you\u2019re eating more than ever before - you\u2019ve gained, what, ten pounds, 15 pounds since the last time I saw you?  Anyway, it looks good on you, except for the pants thing, and knowing you as I do, you probably expect to gain some more.  I know that I\u2019m trying to put on weight - I want to get stronger, go up a weight class for wrestling, but you know me, I can hardly gain an ounce - so I thought if we both went out to eat it\u2019d be a good thing.  Or are you trying to tell me you want to lose weight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo exactly,\u201d said Jason.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo let\u2019s go get you some great jeans and then pig out - there aren\u2019t any good movies on now anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, suddenly making up his mind about being bigger, agreed enthusiastically.  \u201cSounds good!\u201d  As he got up off the frat house porch, the old wooden floor groaned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you really are putting on weight!\u201d remarked Travis affirmatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason dismissed this.  \u201cOh, it does that for everybody.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst to the Blue Jeans outlet,\u201d said Travis as they walk along the sidewalk through the night air, \u201cthen to the Buffet Palace.

Jason, naturally big and beefy, his clothes usually rumpled because of it, had always admired how Travis\u2019 clothes seemed to hang perfectly on his body, no matter what he wore.  Despite their physical differences though, Travis and Jason had a lot in common - not the least of which was a love of food.  Travis, though, never ate quite as much as Jason, and his high metabolism burnt off enough calories to keep him trim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking good as always,\u201d Jason says to Travis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile you, my good friend, are looking fatter than ever!\u201d replies Travis with a note of approval in his voice that surprised Jason.  \u201cFrat life obviously agrees with you - but you need new pants!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess I do,\u201d replied Travis, looking down sheepishly to where his gut spilled out over his jeans.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want a hand with that?\u201d says Travis.  \u201cI know a little bit about buying clothes...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but for fat guys?\u201d replies Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClothes is clothes,\u201d Travis replied.  \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of buying clothes that suit you - that look good on you, and project the image you have in mind for yourself.  I buy my clothes to make me look like a movie star...\u201d Travis grinned broadly, making his statement a joke.  \u201cNow, the question is, do you want to buy clothes to hide your increase in size, or to show it off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d replies Jason, slightly shocked.  He figured he knew Travis pretty well, but his friend had never talked about the difference in their shapes so directly before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, we\u2019re good friends, I can be blunt,\u201d replies Travis.  \u201cIt\u2019s obvious you\u2019re eating more than ever before - you\u2019ve gained, what, ten pounds, 15 pounds since the last time I saw you?  Anyway, it looks good on you, except for the pants thing, and I expect you want to gain some more - freshman 15, maybe more?  Oh, don\u2019t deny it, I know you too well, you\u2019ve always had a \u2018good\u2019 appetite,\u201d Travis continued, \u201cWe used to eat together all the time, don\u2019t forget - those there was always a movie or something as an excuse.  But now that you\u2019re obviously gaining weight...Or are you going to try to tell me you want to lose all this extra pork?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly,\u201d says Jason, and Travis cuts him off before he can say more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you do want to get bigger.  Great!  Let\u2019s go get you some bigger threads and then we should go eat - see how much you can pack away these days. There aren\u2019t any good movies on now anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good!\u201d says Jason, suddenly enthusiastic.  He gets up off the frat house porch and the old wooden floor groans.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, listen to that, you\u2019ve gotten so heavy you make the floor groan!\u201d remarks Travis with a grin.  He ducks to avoid Jason\u2019s friendly jab.  \u201cC\u2019mon, \u2018fat guy\u2019, let\u2019s get you some new jeans!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends walk...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you don\u2019t know what you weigh, the only question is, do you want to know?  Do we find you a scale?  Or, do we just go get you some clothes that fit?  You\u2019re gonna know how big your waist is, anyway, if you\u2019re going to get jeans that fit - unless you want that to be a secret too.  We could do that - I\u2019ll keep track of how big your pants and shirt are, so you don\u2019t need to know or worry about.  You can just eat and eat, keep your frat brothers happy, and I'll keep you in clothes that fit.

All five 'feedees' are rapidly showing the effects of the powerful appetite stimulant (which was designed to combat anorexia, not to be used on healthy, hungry regular guys...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill, the biggest of the five, started out at 290 pounds. Just a month later, he is up to 325.  The strongest weightlifter, Bill was always proud of his huge muscular body. But, even at six foot five, a gain of 35 pounds has seriously softened his body, but it doesn't bother him - yet. He has been bigger than this in the off-season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLester, six foot two, stuck with his weightlifting program too - Bill T saw to that. Yet under those huge clothes he just bought, Lester was seriously expanding. Four weeks into his fattening, he was now 255 pounds. The workouts added muscle, but there was no denying that he was gaining far too quickly to not get really fat as well. The gut that had been just starting to protrude now stuck out a healthy two inches over his shorts, and he had a double chin now forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, though, was gaining mostly fat! While he tried to work out so that some of the weight gain would be muscle, he was not as serious as Bill and Lester and did not always keep to his gym schedule. Travis allowed him no mercy in his \"feedings\" - and his appetite was really getting stronger every day, both from the appetite stimulant that Travis was furtively feeding him, and from the weekend stuffings. He had only ever paid occasional attention to the scales, so when he did climb on, it was a surprise to him to learn that he had already broken 280 pounds. He shouldn't have been surprised, though - his huge gut looked like a balloon under his shirts, with a little bit of the bottom of his gut showing when one of his tighter shirts would ride up as he breathed.  Still, though, he was not paying as much attention to his own swelling body as he was to his two feedees, Evan and Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan and Tyler were thinner than the other three, but were both starting to show as well. Tyler, six feet and starting at a trim 160 pounds, has added about 20 pounds to his frame, while Evan, the runner,  has done abut the same - though at six foot two and 155, he was the thinnest of the group, and the gain hardly showed on him at this point. Jason, delighted with their gain,  knew that by next month that would not be the case.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jason, for his part - is really furious at them - so he decides to go all out. He ups their dosage of the appetite drug - and then sits back to watch the expanding results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long for the drug to really take effect - turning the two into human eating machines. And all this gluttony is taking its toll on their once lithe frames. The first 20 pounds Tyler had already gained had only softened him up a little - now the bulges were getting obvious. The perfectly tailored clothes he wore were now   stretching at the seams. His once flat stomach now had arched out forward and was threatening to pop every shirt button  - as well as making his pants nearly impossible to get on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effects of the gain were still not showing as much on Evan. Tall and lean as runners often are, Evan always dressed in big sweats which hid the gain. He had also started out quite thin at only 155 pounds on his six foot two body - so it was going to take a little while longer for him to show. Still, Travis could see his face starting to pudge up - and the beginning of development of a double chin. Evan was clearly controlling his appetite with his running - going out to the track earlier and for longer runs too. However - Jason knew it was only a matter of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact - Jason was so into the expanding Tyler and Evan that he was not really paying attention to himself. Travis was feeding him the appetite stimulant too - and he was also forcefeeding him on the weekends. As a result, Jason's weigh gain was out of control. He blew right past the 300 pound mark  - and just kept right on gaining. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The fact that he liked to wear oversize clothes made it all but impossible to really see the gain when he was dressed, but the mirror outside the shower told the tale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis once lean muscular body, with veins that showed everywhere, was now covered in an undeniable coating of fat. His face was filling in and there seemed to be a hint of a double chin. However, the problem was his appetite and metabolism. With all the running he did, he had always been able to eat anything he wanted to and never gain weight. Now, not only was he gaining, but he was ravenous all day long. It seemed there was no way to satisfy his hunger, which came back quicker and stronger after every meal. So much so that Evan couldn't resist food, and chowed down with gusto at every possibility.  He was on a \"see food\" diet - he ate whatever he saw. And he couldn't stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also seemed that the fast metabolism that had prevented weight gain before had now failed. The weight was piling on.  And the more \"supplement\" Jason fed him - the worse it got. He used to laugh at how big Jason's belly got after a feeding session with Travis - but now Evan was blowing up his own belly the same way. Once he started eating a meal, he couldn't stop until he was so full he felt like exploding - and his once trim stomach now pooched a couple of inches out in front of his shorts. And after a meal - it looked like he had swallowed a beach ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the third month, Jason had his wish - both Tyler and Evan were now too fat to deny it. Evan packed on 35 pounds - at 230 now, even the big clothes he wore couldn't hide his expanding gut. It started just under his softened pecs, and bowed out in an arch, almost a perfect ball gut in shape. Evan was now having problems running with the added weight bouncing around. But more important to Jason, everyone in the frat was now getting on both Tyler and Evan about their obvious expansion - the guys especially liked to 'pop' Evan in the gut every chance they got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even Jason's excitement about his success in revenge wasn't enough to allow him to forget what was happening to him. He still had not figured out that he was being dosed with the \"supplement\" too, in addition to Travis' constant force feeding. But he did know he was getting pretty big.. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So much so that he did little other exercise - he had naturally tight abs and did no sit -ups or crunches. Now that he was rapidly gaining weight, much of the weight was gathering right at his mid-section. The gut started just below his softened pecs, and bowed out in a long arch in front of him and in all directions - meeting with a now healthy set of love-handles forming at his sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tight jaw line was now gone - replaced with a sagging double chin and cherub-like cheeks. His dimples we now huge indentations. His classic good looks and chiseled features had now been replaced with a  round pudgy look. All of his definition was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan really despised the treatment he was getting from some of the frat guys. They would thump him in his obviously expanding belly every chance they got. Or else they would rub his belly like a Budha. Evan had never been fat in his life. He didn't know how it was happening now, all he knew was that he was unable to stop eating - the hunger was so strong, he just could not resist eating - more and more each day.<br>\r\nAnd.... Every day, he gained more and more weight. By the middle of the month, his weight was making it hard for him to do his running. His legs and feet were sore from the pounding with the extra weight - and his gut bouncing around ruined his form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse yet - at the track, he became the poster boy for the fat guys. He tried to go when no one was there,  but that was nearly impossible.  The comments were hard for him to take. Then, at the end of the month, he twisted his foot by mistakenly running at the edge of the track. It swelled up like a balloon. He had no choice but to go to the infirmary, where they pronounced a bad sprain,  showed him to wrap up the the ankle - and he couldn't run for a while.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse, they weighed him in at 265 pounds!  He couldn't even think about being that big. But the Ball gut he had at the beginning of the month was now starting to sag. As it was, those big clothes he wore were now getting tight.

Bill had always been the biggest guy in the frat - but a lot of that weight was muscle. Bill never missed a workout, and had regularly \"bulked up\" his body over the winter in past years - so he was less upset about his expanding weight. He was gaining more muscle than everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, on the other hand, was nowhere near as muscular as Bill, and although he was now working out too, he was not the accomplished lifter that Bill was. Add to that the fact that he was fatter than Bill - Travis had made sure of that. In the last two months, the eating and the force feeding had added 75 pounds to Jason, making his gut the biggest in the frat. Bill may have been a few pounds heavier, but it sure didn't look like it. The double whammy of the supplement causing extreme hunger, and the force feeding Jason was getting every weekend from Travis was piling on the pounds. He didn't even fit into the Frat's Santa suit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally, Jason had decided to go for 300 pounds, but now he was more than 50 pounds past that. And Travis was not letting him stop there.  With his ballooning weight and huge, expanding appetite, Jason knew that something was wrong and he was determined to find out what.  He suspected Travis, and started watching him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until the end of the month that he learned that Travis was using the \"supplement\" on him. He was furious, but he was also huge - he was fast approaching 400 pounds - though the only thing he knew was that he was over 350 pounds, as that was the max of the scale at the frat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really wanted to see Tyler and Evan pass the 300 pound mark, though, so he knew he couldn't make a big stink about the \"supplement\" . However - Travis was now in his sights. While feeding him, Travis always had a beer in his hand. Now,  the beer would have an additional ingredient.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He figured that he was gaining enough without extra \"help\" and Travis was really forcing him to eat on the weekends. Evan knew that it was too late to stop that - but he was going to take Travis with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis was no lightweight - despite his flabby bulk, he did work out, and could often be seen working out with a newbie - who he always managed to turn into a gainer. But Travis could not escape all this eating untouched. His average height, broad body tended to pack on fat despite his gym workouts, but under the fat he carried a lot of muscle, like a fat football lineman.  Like a lot of college linemen he was also steadily growing - just not at the rate that Jason was. Travis always managed to find great looking clothes that looked good on his expanding bulk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, Jason had grown even bigger than Travis and he was moving in on Bill for the title of \"largest\" in the frat. Jason's problem was that all the guys that were being fattened had a pretty long head start on Travis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason went back to the web page to order more of the \"supplement\" but this time also ordered an 'extra strength' version he would use on Travis. There was a warning included with this version - to follow directions and dosages - too much of the \"supplement\" could cause uncontrollable hunger and reduce metabolic rate enough to cause rapid weight gain that could continue for months after discontinuing the drug. That was just what Jason was looking for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gave Travis a triple dose of the drug each day for the first week. Travis was already complaining about hunger the second day, and by the fourth day he was eating everything in sight. Jason then added in phase two. He decided that he would force Travis to eat like Travis was doing to him. The combination of the hunger and that fact that Jason was now much bigger than him meant Travis was on his way. By the second week, Travis was so hungry that he was too busy eating to force feed Jason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jason was still gaining a little,  without the \"supplement\" and without Travis' constant force feeding, his weight began to level off. Travis didn't even notice - and by the end of the month - it was too late anyway. </span></div></div>",

In a matter of a couple of months, Travis was even bigger than Jason....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after pushing Travis into super obesity Jason had a dream. He dreamt that he was walking up to his fraternity house, but the porch was new and did not groan under his heavy tread at all. The railings were broader, he saw, and the front door was wider. He entered the house and instead of the stairway, which ended on the left of the front door, there was an elevator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned to the right and saw all of his frat brothers, and everyone was huge. There were a lot of newer frat members too -  they must have been freshman, although they all seemed to have gained at least the freshman 50. Most of them were seated at a vast table with extra wide reinforced chairs, having an eating contest of fried chicken. Numerous cooks kept exchanging empty platters for fresh ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason woke up with a wonderful idea. Tomorrow night was going to be a big drinking night for frat members only. This would be his big chance to make his wonderful dream come true. He still had loads of the super-fattening supplement. He slipped down the stairs, realizing the advantages of the frat changing these for an elevator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got down to the basement, where the frat's brews were sitting. He opened the containers and poured two doses of the supplement into each. He then imagined the pleasure of his fellow frat members all drinking the brew, as part of the tradition, and then everyone eating like pigs and fattening up, making his dream coming true. Once they were heavier, it would be easy to convince them to make some renovations to make the frat house 'fat friendly'. Jason then dozed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later he woke up and saw that\u2026</span></div></div>",
