You never thought of getting a proper boyfriend whilst at Hogwarts. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nJust then Lavender walked in. You weren't the BEST of friends but you were pretty close and knew she would help you if you needed help. To be honest, right now you needed help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lavender,\" you say smiling weakly, she returns your fretting and your smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats up Hermionie you look really pissed?\" she said studying you carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and look at you hands \"I don't know, just think that its time that I change, you know?\" Lavender nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if your gonna change your gonna need some help\" she smiled winking at you. \"And to be honest, the first place we should start is your appearance\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up and looked at your self in the full length mirror. Lavender was right. You were plain and simple nothing special. You smiled at Lavender letting her know she was right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lavender, help me, please?\" you said desperately. She grinned and agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wanna be perfect, I'm gonna need a little more help\" she said. Taking out her wand she said \"expecto patronum\" six bunnies, pearly White appeared and then hopped off through the walls. What seemed like two minutes later Ginny, Parvati, Padma, Luna and Cho walked into the room, all with dertermined yet happy faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCho twirled her wandband a chair appeared from no where. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione sit here for us please.\" she said indicating to the straight back chair infront of her. You sit. All six girls stand around you examining you all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay at the moment I think we should sort out her hair\" said Padma taking a section of your hair in her hand. \"We should straighten it and use this thing I got from my mum, it makes your hair stay straight, permanently!\" she said, the others agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all set to work, it took almost four hours to get You absolutely perfect, but when you looked on the mirror it was like looking at a totally different person. You looked amazing. Your hair was straight, sleek and shiny. You had a pair of lowrise hip huggers on, you were so glad of your perfect, natural size 8 figure, your b-cup chest, which looked bigger in your emerald green tight fit plain t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt great you hugged and thanked everyone, but they hadn't quite finished with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay no means to be rude, but are you virgin?\" asked Parvati, you blush slightly and nod. \"Well, I'm gonna be honest with, the first time it kills you, but it releases a lot of stress, trust me, you need a man!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned, you had been thinking about having sex quite slot recently but the thing was that you really were stuck cause you didn't know who you liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another hour of talking about sex and showing how the best way to do your make up was, you were finally ready to face the male population. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou hadva small amount of foundation under eyes to cover the bags, two coats of mascara and your eyelashes looked false, they were so long, you had a small amount of eyeliner on too just to define you eyes, they sparkled against the sun fluttering through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls hugged you and you walked from the dormitory together, you left the empty common room and made your way, with the girls, to the great hall were the evening feast was just begining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were nervous but confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione you look great, now stop playing with you hair\" said Ginny nudging you playfully in the ribs. \"Okay girl knock them dead!\" She encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gave you confident smiles. You breathe deeply. Cho walks through the doors and the rest of the girls follow in a line, you were in front of Ginny and Luna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the hall is tooling into their food, talking loudly to one another, you, Ginny,  Lavender and Parvati sit down next to Ron and Harry who look at you in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you've finished growing, would you to pick up your jaw it appears to be in my lap\" you joke, Ginny winked at you, she was sat across from you next to Harry on her other side Parvati, you were inbetween Ron and Lavender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the feast had done, you met with the girls and you decided that you wanted your first time to be with....</span></div></div>",

That way I won't be so nervous\" \"You know, she has a point\" said Cho.  Lavender and Pavarti started to agree with her, but Ginny was not about to give in.  \"Hermione, you're like turining into a traitor!
