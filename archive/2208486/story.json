She got more dates, topped every class, has more friends, and was everybody's favorite. Even her father, Lord Tamara seemed to like her more. The only person who cared more about Tatiana than Tilly was late Lady Cinniana, the Twins' mother. Tatiana kept complaining about all this to her childhood best friend, Ardex. She felt invisible in her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning, just like any other, Tatiana was ranting and ranting about Tilly to Ardex, when suddenly he said,\"I don't know how you haven't noticed this before, but there is this one person I know who certainly will always prioritize you more than Tilly.\"<br>\r\n\"Not possible. Everyone loves that bitch.\"<br>\r\n\"But you have been to oblivious to notice that I have always loved you. And Tilly, or anybody for that matter, cannot change how I feel about you, Nia.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But we can't just continue on like nothing happened.\"<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do now?\"<br>\r\nTatiana looked at his perplexed hazel eyes. They were so deep, she often imagined herself falling into them. His brown curls stuck out in all directions, framing his gentle face in shabbily. 'It's just Ardex. Stop freaking out. You know him so well. Calm down.', she said to herself, calming down enough to sit beside him again. Color returned to his pale face. <br>\r\n\"Listen, the thing is-\"<br>\r\n\"Ardex! I didn't know you were here!\", squealed Tilly, barging into her sister's room without knocking, as usual.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Tilly. Hi.\"said Ardex. </span></div></div>",

The way you are close to me and that you trust me tells me that you like me too.

Everyone except her stupid, useless twin sister Titiana. No one even cared about Titiania and yet she had the audacity to disrespect Tilly. Tilly felt like Titiana took her for granted simply because they share a room. That ignorant idiot. 'Oh, well', she thought, 'her loss'. Until she realized that the she had a huge crush in Titiania, childhood best friend, Ardex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never understood why Ardex liked to hang out with that moron in comparision to an absolute stunner like her. She tried so hard so constantly to make Ardex look at her, even for a second, but in vain. </span></div></div>",
