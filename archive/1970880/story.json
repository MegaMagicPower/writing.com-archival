When you open the fridge, you notice that it is pretty empty. You haven't bought food in a few days, so it was about time that you head to the shop to stock up. You Grab your wallet and head down to the local shop. It's not far from your house, only about 10 minutes away on foot.<br>\r\nAs you go to cross the road, you don't notice the car flying towards you. You don't hear it coming until the last second because you had headphones in. The sounds of the car's horn eventually drowns out your music and you turn to face the car just as it is about to hit you. Your eyes grow wide in shock. It's too late for you to avoid a collision. As the car reaches you, everything goes dark and there is silence. It stays like this for a long time and you wonder if you are dead.<br>\r\nEventually, your sight returns and you are still standing in the middle of the road. The car is right in front of you, but it's not moving. You look inside and see that the driver is frozen with a shocked expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! Are you okay!?\" You call to him. He doesn't respond. In fact, he doesn't seem to do anything. As you look around, you notice that everything is still and quiet. The are even birds hovering in the sky. You are really confused. You then look down at yourself. Everything seemed normal at first, but then you notice that your arms are missing. You begin to freak out, but then you realise that you can still feel them. You even manage to tug at your shirt, which confirms that they are still there. As you tugged on your shirt, you also notice that the inside of your shirt was empty. Your body appeared to be missing. You are invisible. It freaks you out and you wish that you could see your body again. Just like that, your body reappeared. You seemed to be in one piece. <br>\r\nYou then draw your attention back to the car. If you can make yourself visible again, surely you can unfreeze the car. You step out of the car's path and then will for it to move again. Suddenly, noise returned and everything around you started moving again. The car flew past you with a screech from its tires. After checking that you are okay. The driving leans out of the window and curses before driving away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed unbelievable. Can you really control time? and were you really invisible? You had to find a way to confirm it.</span></div></div>",

She was wearing some plain shorts and a tank top, not a bad look but you felt you could do better.  You watched as she watched the television, thinking about how you wanted to have fun with her.  After a few minutes she got up to get some water.  It was in that moment that you make your move.  You pause time, catching her right as she had just righted herself.  You ran over to the desk in the corner of the room and grabbed a pair of scissors.  You leaned down and began cutting at the back of her cloth belt, trying to make it look more ragged and not cleanly cut.  You work your way through and soon her belt had been sliced in half.  You returned the scissors to the desk before resuming time.<br>\r\nJust as Alice took her first step her shorts, no longer supported by her belt, slid down to her ankles revealing her pink laced panties.  \"Huh?!  What the...\"  Alice said in shock.  She reached down and inspected the tattered belt, trying to piece together what had happened.  \"It WAS six years old, I guess it was just its time.\"  She said.  She then inspected herself, now dressed only in her panties and tank top.  \"Well, I'm the only one home so I guess this is a no pants day!\"  She announced to herself.<br>\r\nThat went better than expected!  Not only did she not suspect a thing, she wasn't going to redress herself!  Huh, if that was her reaction to losing her shorts...  Alice began walking to kitchen, going about getting water as though nothing had happened.  As she passed a drawer you paused time again.  This time you took a hold of her tank top, repositioning the hem so that it was caught on the handle of the cabinet she was passing by.  Satisfied by your handiwork you resumed time.<br>\r\nAlice took another step and her shirt went taught, causing her to topple over and tipping the side of her shirt clean open, reducing her top to a rag.  She rubbed her head as she got up, inspecting damage done to her top.  \"Oh for-  I guess god just HATES my clothes today!\"  She said angrily.  She then did exactly what you thought she would, removing her tattered shirt and tossing it in the trash with her belt.  She had no bra on, making her completely naked from the waist up!  She got her water and returned to the couch, grumbling and cursing as she did.  She continued to watch TV in only her panties, completely oblivious to your active hand.  The TV went mostly black as the credits of the show rolled and she caught a reflection of herself, nearly naked and casually splayed across the couch.  She smiled at herself, her ego taking hold as she admired her own curvaceous form.  She looked down at herself, her perky chest just inches beyond her nose.  \"Heh, you know I do look good today.  Maybe the universe is just giving me signs.\"<br>\r\nOh this was about to get good!</span></div></div>",

Your eyes were instantly glued to the twin, perky mounds bouncing with every step as she strutted without a care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting your knuckles, you couldn't believe that she hadn't dashed to her room for clothes but you were perfectly fine with that and she didn't seem to care either.

She flipped on the tv with her legs spread open and you couldn't take it anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes for a moment, concentrating, then opened them to see the world around you had turned monochrome. It was bizarre sight, seeing the world around you seemingly pause like an old black and white movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to giggle, you couldn't repress the sheer excitement of what your doing. It felt like your were trampling on the efforts of every voyeur with the ease that you obtained with stopping time. Laughing out loud, you thought of all the kinky stuff you could pull while Ashley remained oblivious to your presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...haha...calm down for a moment. I have all the time in the world.\" You steadied your breathing as you thought more carefully about what you could do. \"First things first...haha...I need to know my limits.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Ashley, you carefully touched her shoulder. Your fingers tingled on contact with her soft skin and it returned to its original color where you held it. When you pulled away, her skin changed back to its monochrome color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned invisible then with some concentration, time started moving again as the monochrome world returned to its colorful splendor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley continued watching the tv unaware but twisted her head when she felt somebody touch her shoulder. She jerked her head to the side, expecting her mom or sister be standing but nobody was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange.\" she muttered then went back to watching tv. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze time again as you came up with a theory for your powers. Any sensation felt when time was stopped didn't disappear...but was rather delayed for a set amount of time as Ashley had reacted to your touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This could be very fun.\" A twisted grin appeared as ideas raced through your head. </span></div></div>",

The lamp posts look much newer than the ones that were there before and there are strange looking cars driving past that you have never seen before. Obviously you are in the future, but you aren't sure how far. You wander down a few streets until you reach the town hall. Up high on the wall, you see that a digital display has been installed under the original clock. Apparently the year is 2024, meaning you have jumped 10 years into the future. It takes a while to sink in, but you find it amazing.<br>\r\nYou wonder how things have changed in your personal life in this time, so you head for your house, hoping that you still live there. When you arrive at the front door, you find that your key from the past still works. You see that the house has been redecorated since your time. As you slowly wander up the hallway, a figure walks past, but then stops when it spots. She may look older, but you can tell that the figure is your girlfriend, Fiona. She looks and dresses more mature, but she still looks beautiful. You work out that in this time, she must be 32. She stares at you in disbelief, then utters one word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt?\" You smile at her, confirming your identity. Fiona, then rushes towards you, tears in her eyes. She wraps her arms around you tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand.\" She says. \"I thought I lost you! I thought you were dead!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDead? Why would you be dead? Fiona takes a good look at your face, then gives you a confused expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you look so young? You look just like you did the last time I saw you.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explain to her about your powers and how you were able to not only stop time, but also travel through time. It seems that the result of you actions, you have been missing for the last ten years. Fiona explains how she thought that you had left her, and then later you were pronounced dead, after nobody could find you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I am so sorry, Fiona. I had no idea that this would happen.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. I know it wasn't your fault. There's no way you could have known.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what else has happened in the last 10 years?\" You ask.</span></div></div>",

Say hello.\" The little girl looks at you, shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt, this is Nicola...My daughter.\" Fiona says. So many thoughts run through your head.

I left you alone, with our daughter to raise on your own.\" You plead forgiveness. It's pointless since there was nothing you could have done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter. You're here now. I'm just thinking about how I'm going to tell Nicola that you're her father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it really seems like this future has a lot in store for you.

I have a friend called Alice back in 2014.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice the instructs you to hold onto her tightly. After doing as she says, you see futuristic thrusters sprout out of her back as if from nowhere. Moments later, you and Alice are flying through the streets at high speed. The acceleration is so sudden that you struggle to hold on. After a few minutes, Alice comes to a stop and announces that you have arrived at her place. As you try to regain your bearings Alice enters a building through an automatic door. You follow her inside and she leads you down a narrow hallway and into another room. The room is filled with android body parts of different shapes and sizes. Each part is separated into categories. Arms, legs and torsos are all neatly piled together, and some bodies that have already been put together, minus the head, stand in the middle of the room. At the back of the room are shelves with several rows of heads. Though these heads look human enough, they are in fact android heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Alice across the room until she comes to a stop and turns to face you. Just then, you notice a thin line appear around her neck, a seam. Alice raises her hands and grasps both sides of her head and pulls up. Her head detaches from her body and you can see that her neck stump is covered in a layer of stainless steel. She then tosses her head towards you, causing you to scramble in a panic to catch it. Alice just laughs at your reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think, Mr Time traveller?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! This is incredible!\" Is the first thing that comes out of your mouth. \"So, are all of these body parts yours?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I can completely change my appearance from head to toe, transferring all of my data between them wirelesly. Although, my current appearance is my default appearance. I like to keep my original image as much as possible.\" She tells you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice then takes her head back from your grasp and turns to browse through all of her spare parts, deciding what to do.</span></div></div>",

After a few minutes, she stops in front of one that takes her fancy and examines it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll use this one for now.\" She says. She then walks over to an empty space on one of her shelves and neatly places her current head down. Her body then walks back to the head she had chosen, her current head's eyes following her as she goes. As the new head connects to Alice's neck, her current head's face becomes expressionless, its eyes staring blankly ahead. Moments later, the new head springs to life. Alice has chosen a redhead that is equally beautiful to the head she just took off. Though her other head was cute and had an innocent charm to it, this one has clearly gone full on sexy. The full, red lips, the piercing blue eyes and a look that would make any heart skip a beat. Alice turns to you, placing one hand on her hip as she does so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think, Mr Time Traveller?\" She asks in a new, sexier voice that matches her head's look perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look...Stunning. Wow!\" You tell her. She gives you a light smile, but not quite enough to break her sexy expression. It seems quite strange. Even though only her head has changed, it seems like Alice is a completely different person. As it turns out, Alice explains that though she is the same person, each of her heads has its own personality traits that show through. As you take a quick browse of her head collection, you can't believe how real they look. You decide to ask Alice about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Alice.

First one was Alice, a slightly curly blond haired girl that's the same age as you. The other is Jared, a sly looking head with short hair. Next to him is Rebecca, Jared's girlfriend who is Hispanic and has short brunette hair with the front part covers a bit of her left eye. Next to her is Kimmy, and Asian girl with a braided black ponytail and wears glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd no, I do not want to be racist, these are the character I can think of. And yes, you are friends with a lot of girls. It all because Jared met Rebecca and you ended up meeting with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you guys doing here? And why do you look the same after all of these years?\". you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Science\", Jared screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we thought that this would be a fun and healthy thing to do. We tried looking for you, but you went missing suddenly.\", said Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They just announced this a 1000 years ago and it just has so much benefits. There's immortality, weight loss, eternal youth and beauty, and so much more.\", said Kimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our families were a bit skeptical about this, but they do visit sometimes.\", said Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you guys not get bored or heck live with this?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't stay here often. Sometimes we have someone carry our heads to the outside world and go to places. We could also eat. There's also so many heads to talk to and a lot more.\", said Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can even still eat. Don't ask how it works?\", said Jared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed Alice's head and look at where her neck should be. Its just skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, put me back!\", the disembodied head screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put Alice's head back on the shelf, but her hair is all messy. Alice tries to blow her hair off her face, but you help her brush it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you miss having arms, legs, or a body for that matter?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can used to it. Immortality and stuff like that always has a price. Being a head isn't such a big deal.\", said Kimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what's weird. How is he alive when it was reported that he died of age?\", Rebecca said referring to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ask a lot of questions.\", said Jared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one of my previous nieces told me that you died of age.\", said Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one of your visits in the past told us about now and we know that you can travel through time.\", said Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked shocked. First you got powers to seeing your friend's disembodied heads to them knowing about everything that just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you can change that.

The other head made a disappointed \"Awww!\" almost in unison. The reason you picked that head was because you felt some kind of connection to him. He looked very familiar, like you knew him already. Of course, you reasoned that this was impossible as you were over 1,000 years in the future; everyone you knew was long dead. Still, that familiarity you felt with that head was weird and amazing at the same time. Maybe he was some kind of distant relative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then!\" Patricia smiled brightly as she pressed a few buttons on the projected keyboard in front of her. \"Please have a seat in the chair right in front of you.\"You followed Patricia's instructions and took a sea; the chair slowly pivoted so that you were facing the aisles of heads. A machine, similar to the one that moved your head and neck to the left, hovered over the right side of you body. Simultaneously, the head that you had selected was picked up by a robotic hand. The head was carried over and set on top of the neck moving machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for picking me!\" The head cheered. \"This will be awesome! We're going to make the best conjoined pair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled back, not sure how to respond. \"Yeah... we'll be great together.\" You could feel a pang of doubt swell up in you about whether or not this was a good decision. \"Well, when in Rome...\" you quietly say to yourself, releasing the fear you had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready?\" Patricia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take one more moment to revel in the use of your right hand and leg.

It was hard to explain the feeing, both frightening and exhilarating. You turned slightly to see your right hand tentatively wiggle it's fingers. You were now closer to this stranger than you had ever been before... literally. You laughed silently at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" You new friend asked inquisitively. He probably saw your wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Now I see why they asked me to sit down; I would... we would probably have fallen if I had been standing before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, probably not the best way to start out. Oh and on that note, I had better introduce myself. The name is Michael.\" Your new friend, stretched out your, his, right hand to shake. You would have to get used to not calling it your hand, your side of the body any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was awkward, but you grasped his hand tightly and shook. \"Matthew. Nice to officially meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice that you two are getting acquainted.\" Patricia said as she moved into both of your views. \"Why don't you two see how you look?\" She brought out a large mirror so that we could see. Surprisingly, Michael's head matched up nicely with you. It was almost like you were related or something. You could not see a seam or anything to show that you two were not born like that. Besides the obvious fact that you weren't twins, it looked like Michael always shared the right side of your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! We look... great... I guess that is the right word.\" Michael began to say. \"You can't see any marks or scars. I matched up with you perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Weird' you thought. 'I was just thinking that.' You turned from your reflection to Patricia. \"Are our minds connected too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your thoughts are purely your own, which will cause the two of you some problems as you learn to coordinate.\" Patricia smiled again as she answered. \"It takes some time for our newly joined customers to adapt to each other, but you two will get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well on that note, what do you say about getting out of this chair, Matt?\" Michael asked as he turned to look at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah. We're going to have to figure this out at some point.\" With that, the two of you slowly and carefully shift out of the chair and stand. A three-legged race did not even come close to a comparison on how sharing a body was like. Feeling only the left side of your body was challenging when you needed to work together with the right side. But in time, you and Michael were better at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think its time to leave? We should get better the longer we're together.\" You asked Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you go,\" Patricia walked towards the two of you. \"Let me give you two something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the paper from Praticia's hands, and Michael helps you hold it in front so both of you can read it. \"It's a warranty.\" you state mater-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. If you and your body partner are not happy with your predicament in a 24-hour period, then you are able to go back here and remove one of your heads.\" Patricia replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice...\" You say. That did not particularly matter. You could always come back within the time period because of your ability. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the help.\" Michael smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah thanks.\" You say. Michael mirrored your thoughts again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back any time!\" Patricia waves them good-bye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Michael leave the facility on unsteady legs; you mutually agree to sit for awhile and rest. During that time, you guys chat it up, getting to know the person you share a body with better. You come to learn that Michael had lost his body in a bad accident, and being an orphan, no one came to help him. He had been stuck in the facility, bodyless, for quite awhile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually open up enough to tell him about the ability you discovered. Of course, Michael did not believe you, at least until you poked him with an invisible hand. Michael was so stunned, he actually turned invisible himself, or at least half invisible. His side of the body turned invisible, while your side could still be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing!\" Michael exclaimed. \"I guess since we're attached now, I can go invisible too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazed, and slightly bummed. You didn't exactly want to share your ability. But on the other hand, you were sharing a body, so sharing your power did not seem to be that bad. \"That's not all.\" You say with a smirk. You close your eyes and concentrate. When you open them, everything is frozen, except for you and Michael. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! You can control time too!\" Michael smiled brightly and made a fist, which you pounded. \"Can I do that?\" Before you could answer, Michael closed his eyes and caused everything to start moving again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But, lets not get carried away just yet with any heroics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" Michael nodded in agreement. A light bulb suddenly appeared to go off in his head. You could see the gears of his mind working. \"Can we travel through time too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" you thought about giving a white lie, but decided there was no point hiding the truth. You did not want him to accidentally make you both appear in the dinosaur area or something. \"Yeah... and to tell you the truth, I'm not even from here, from this time period at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, really.

We'd stand out like a sore thumb.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael raised an eyebrow, \"Huh? What does a sore thumb have anything to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... well, its an idiom. I guess you guys don't use it now. It means that we would not blend in too well with the crowds; everyone would gawk at us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but we can go invisible though?\" Michael said, making a good point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a second to come up with a good excuse. \"Yeah, but we can barely walk as it is while visible. I don't think we'd get very far if we could not see each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll just make me invisible, so you can blend in.\" Michael said. A moment later, his head vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you were still getting used to sharing a body, suddenly not seeing Michael's head, inches from you, made you panic a little. You looked down, and your face quickly began taking on a green tent. You could see into your body. From where Michael's head vanished, a neck-sized hole appeared in his shoulder. A bony column-like structure snaked downward. Blood vessels weaved around it, spiraling inward. A moment later Michael's head reappeared. He too looked a tad green. You both clutched your stomach and leaned forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats not going to work either.\" You say, fighting the urge to vomit. Your shared nausea passed after some time. You both leaned back into the bench, and you gave him a slight smile. \"That was gross. I could see into our body. Neither of us should go invisible without the other. And besides, everyone would see my head tapered weirdly to the left.\" Michael nodded and smiled weakly. You then offered, \"How about we explore the city in this time period. I wanted to visit the future to see some amazing things. And you've been in the Head Sanctuary for a long time, things might have changed that might be cool for you to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael agreed, \"Alright, we can do that for now. I still would like to see from where you are though. Traveling through time would be amazing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal. First we look through the city, then we can travel back in time.\" You and he awkwardly shook hands on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first thing we should do is head to the nearest transit station. That's the quickest way to get around town, and its free.\" Michael said as you and he pushed yourselves up from the bench. \"There should be one right around the corner of this building.\" You and he slowly started walking in the direction he pointed. After more than ten minutes, the two of you were finally in line for the transit, which normally should have been a 2-3 minute stroll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOval-shaped hovering pods regularly flew in and picked up passengers. The vehicles then flew off in different directions. Michael explained that the pods could take you anywhere you wanted. Once they dropped you off though, you would have to head to another transit station to board another. They were not sophisticated enough to pick people up from anywhere else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you waited, a few people's gazes strayed on the two of you, before abruptly turning away to hide their staring. You figured that sharing a body might not have been that common despite facilities like head sanctuaries. The last three people ahead of you stepped into their pod, and flew off. Finally, it was yours and Michael's turn. Another identical pod touched down, and doors opened for you. Carefully, Michael stepped in, followed immediately by you. The doors shut a moment later when no one else hopped in. \"Where to?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael shrugged, obviously not know where to start. \"Uh... Tour the city?\" He said more as a question, but the pod responded to his direction. It gently floated into the air. </span></div></div>",

However, there are few who say that they want to, so you decide between these female heads. You eventually decide on the head with red hair and green eyes, who accepts this. The other heads agree that she is an excellent choice for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you bring her back to Patricia, you ask her what her name is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naomi,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matthew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Matt, you seem like a nice guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.

She then notices that you found a head. \"Oh! You picked Naomi. Excellent choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she thinks so,\" you say, which causes Naomi to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me.\" While holding onto Naomi's head, you follow Patricia back to the machine, which now has two neck slots. \"Now hand me Naomi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give Naomi's head to Patricia, who then puts it on top of the right neck slot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now get in the machine.\" You stick your head through the other slot as Patricia presses a different button. You hear mechanical sounds coming from the right neck slot. \"Now, you both may leave the machine.\" You pull your head - and Naomi's - out of the slots and see that her head is now attached to your body, right next to your head. You both look at yourselves in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, we look even better than I thought!\" Naomi remarks as she places your right hand on her chin. \"And now I can control the right half!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratch your head with your left hand. \"This will take some getting used to,\" you say. You both then walk around the room, with you controlling your left leg, and Naomi controlling your right leg. \"Come on, Naomi. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Patricia says. \"Let me give you two something.\" She hands you a piece of paper.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou read it. \"It's a warranty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. If you and your body partner are not happy with your predicament in a 24-hour period, then you are able to go back here and remove one of your heads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" you say. Luckily with your time-traveling powers you can go at any time in this day-long period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Naomi leave the building, Patricia calls, \"Thank you for your business. Come again any time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Naomi begin talking about yourselves. Apparently the reason that Naomi sold her head here was that she was giving her other parts to people who needed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, so medical science has definitely risen in a millennium,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Millennium?\" Naomi says. \"Are you a history buff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sort of. I'm actually from the 21st century.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut. Up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious. I have time-traveling powers, and I can turn invisible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi scoffs. \"Prove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou prove your claim by taking Naomi to right when you entered the building, and then you turn yourself and her invisible. You then point to your past self, who is just walking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you weren't kiddin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to take you back to my time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Naomi says.</span></div></div>",

He requests that he be awoken once every century, where he will spend 2 years experiencing the new time period, and make 1 new animated movie, then go back into the jar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do actually know which brain is which?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can scan the unique codes on the rim of each jar, which links me to our database.\" She tells you \"We also have technology that can scan through their memories and read their thoughts.\" She adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you can actually do that?\" You ask, quite surprised at how advanced this time period is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. We also use it to identify brains that have had their bodies stolen.\" The woman informs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are amazed by what the woman has told you.

Although your relationship with Fiona is going well, there are times where you wish you knew what she was thinking. You'd love to try out this technology with her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on. I'll be right back.\" You tell the woman in the lab coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be waiting.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then leave the building, though you didn't have to with your powers. You just thought it would be less awkward if you didn't just suddenly vanish then reappear in front of her. You close your eyes and focus. You feel the rush of air again as you time traveller once more. When you open your eyes, you are standing outside your house. You were expecting to be standing in the same position that you were before you left, but this is more convenient since Fiona is just inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to open the door and walk in. You can hear the TV in the living room and assume that Fiona is watching it. You walk in and see her on the couch. She turns to you and welcomes you back, thinking that you were only gone for a few minutes. Before she can take the conversation any further, you freeze time. You confirm that Fiona is frozen by waving your hand in front of her, then you head to the kitchen. You grab a large, sharp knife and go back to Fiona. You begin to feel a bit queazy about what you are planning to do, but remember that you aren't killing her, since you are going to take her brain to the future and hook her up to whatever keeps those brains alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully line up the knife and start cutting around the top of her head, in order to remove her scalp. It is tough to get through her skull, but you eventually succeed and lift her scalp away, revealing her exposed brain. You carefully scoop it up with your hands then cut the stem to separate it from her body. Once that is done, you place Fiona's brain inside a plastic container. Thankfully you had one that was big enough. You then clean up your hands, which have been covered in blood and slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to Fiona's body with the plastic container in your hands. SInce she is frozen, she still has the same expression as she did when you first entered the room. Curious about what would happen, you unfreeze time. Fiona's body almost immediately slumps over, her eyes staring ahead blankly. Kinda creep'd out by Fiona's lifeless, brainless body, you decide to time traveller to the future again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou appear back in front of the Brain storage facility. You look down to check that Fiona's brain definitely came with you. Thankfully, she did. You enter the building again and are greeted by the labcoat woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, welcome back....And I see that you've brought a friend.\" She says, acknowledging Fiona's brain in the container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. If it's not too much to ask, I'd like to scan through this brain.\" You ask.   </span></div></div>",

As instructed, you follow her, still clutching onto the container with Fiona's brain inside. The labcoat woman approaches a control console which is connected to a big, futuristic looking machine. She boots up the machine before turning to you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I?\" She asks, gesturing for you to hand over Fiona's brain. You nod your head and then open the container, allowing the labcoat woman to scoop up the brain. She carries it towards the machine and places it in the middle of a brightly lit pedestal. She then connects some wires to the stem before returning to the console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. We are almost ready to begin.\" She tells you. As she finishes typing commands into the console, you hear a beep and then watch as the machine uses some sort of telekinetic energy to make Fiona's brain levitate just above the pedestal, slowly rotating it in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm just going to send a shock through the brain and then we'll be able to interact with it.\" The woman says. She presses a glowing red button and then hear a small buzzing sound. Just then, noise starts coming through some nearby monitors. It's Fiona's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!! What the?...What's going on!? I can't feel anything! I CAN'T SEE!! Am I dead?...Hello?...Somebody help me! Please!! I don't what's happening!!\" You hear Fiona's voice say, rambling off every thought that pops into her brain. The labcoat woman then holds out an earpiece to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can use this to speak with her.\" You take the earpiece from her and put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiona, can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt? Where are you? I can't see!\" Fiona says. till panicked, but relieved to hear your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I'm right here. You're going to be fine.\" Just then, the labcoat woman activates a hologram grid that displays a life-sized 3D hologram of a naked Fiona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I can see you now.\" Fiona says, the hologram acting as a sort of temporary body. The hologram looks around the room, then looks at you confused. \"Where are we? And what's going on?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....\" You hesitate, thinking about how to brake the news to Fiona about how she's a disembodied brain. \"We are....In the future...And you might want to look to your left.\" You say. Fiona's hologram then looks left, like you told her to and sees her brain in the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Is that a brain? What the hell are you doing?\" Fiona asks. However, before you can answer, Fiona looks down at \"herself\" and notices that her sight is currently linked to a hologram. She looks at you in disbelief. \"No...It can't be....That's impossible.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not. That is you.\" You tell her, pointing towards her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....Why!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I kind of wanted to scan through your mind to see your thoughts and memories.\" You tell her nervously. You then see Fiona's expression turn from shock to sadness, then eventually rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU SON OF A BI-\" Suddenly, Fiona is cut off mid sentence as the hologram vanishes. You turn to the labcoat woman, wondering what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies. I had to cut her off. Anger driven thoughts use up much more energy and can overheat the system. I couldn't take any chances.\" She explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, shall we dive into her mind now?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The woman then uses the console to activate a conveyor belt of sorts, which rolls in a naked cyborg skeleton. As you predicted, the labcoat woman manages to link Fiona's DNA to the Cyborg and so the surrounding machines begin the transformation process. They add and remove parts from the cyborg skeleton until it matches the body shape and size of Fiona. It then adds a surprisingly detailed layer of artificial flesh, recreating Fiona's image perfectly. When the cyborg body is ready, you cannot believe the outcome. If you didn't already know, you would never guess that the body in front of you wasn't human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe labcoat woman then retrieves Fiona's brain from the machine and carries it over to her new Cyborg body. She open up the top of the Cyborg's head and hooks Fiona's brain up inside before closing the top over once again. The labcoat woman then returns to the console and prepares to activate the cyborg Fiona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a quick warning. She did seem pretty mad, and those bodies are pretty strong. If she attacks you, she could potentially kill you without realising her own strength. I can remove the limbs until she calms down if you want?\" She offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's true. Fiona was mad, but would she really be a danger to you?</span></div></div>",

Your hands exploring your new body, in vain hope of finding it to be illusory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/4fd41adfae2061856dee8b2174799c30/tumblr_oujb5qCU131w2lwkto6_r1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/4fd41adfae20...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her desk, the receptionist is nodding her approval, proud of her work, of what she's done to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stalk over to her, demanding to be restored.

The rippling rump, and the jiggling girls causing your cheeks to warm.</span></div></div>",

The Collar comes packed with its own security system, meaning that your head cannot be detached from your body without your consent.\" The woman explains carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment about this option.

I dunno?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, no!,\" assures the woman, putting up her hands. \"Um, long story short all of that is covered by us and the government.\" She then catches herself. \"Er, that is, our government! So long as you have internet access, pay your bills, and have a VISA, you'll have all the coverage you need,\" she smiles. \"Internet access, constant emergency hotline access, the works!,\" she notes, counting off her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, this deal seems good enough for you. \"Well then, I'll take,\" you say as you scroll up and down through the many varieties of collar available, \"This one!\" You settle on a simple chrome colored collar with a split in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An excellent choice, sir,\" the woman smiles. \"I'll call in the surgeon right away to explain the process.\"  At this the display suddenly reads, \"Please step back\". As you do so, the console levitates and the display changes to a rather simple face: a pair of eyes and a line for a mouth. The console smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, sir, I'm Doctor Ada,\" chirps a surprisingly sweet, female voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Ada, I'm Sam. Sam Jackson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I call you Sam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you say, politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Sam,\" Ada replies. \"Please, have a seat with me.\" A little ways off, a neat little seating area is suddenly lit up, featuring two armchairs seated across each other with a coffee table in between. Ada then approaches your side, at level with your arm. \"May I offer you a handle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take her handle and approach the area. Naturally, you oblige yourself to an armchair while she hovers above one across from you. \"So here's how this is'll happen,\" Ada explains. \"The cameras around you will perform a complete body scan of your person, while I crunch the data into a virtual copy of, well, you!\" She shows a black, human silhouette circled by cameras on the left, while the outline of a silhouette stands at the right, slowly filling in with white. \"We'll then use this copy to tweak your collar's technology to match its parameters\". The original silhouette fades away, the white silhouette slides to its place, and the outline of a collar slides appears in the right. Then it fills to white. \"The copy of your body will then be sent to this franchise's database and I'll fit the collar onto you!\" The white silhouette is slid into an envelope and put into a file cabinet. The cabinet is then pushed off-screen from above by the black silhouette. The white collar flips onto it's bottom, becoming a white bar at height with the black silhouette's neck. The silhouette and the bar slide then into each other, becoming one. Then the silhouette grabs its head with its hands and pulls up, popping off it's head, one half of the white bar on the body's half of the neck, with the other half of the bar on the head's half of the neck. Finally, the silhouette puts its head in the crook of it's arm and gives a thumbs up before fading out. \"With that in mind, Sam, are you interested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... sure, why not?,\" you smile. Ada smiles at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's make a day of it! Follow me, please.\" At this, a cylinder of azure plasma beams onto a close-by segment of the floor. A straight, red wall of plasma then beams down from the center and rotates, sterilizing the interior. It promptly turns green and deactivates. A crescent-shaped screen then descends from in the cylinder, with an odd number of straight, cushioned, white panels on the inside. As it makes contact with the floor, the center panel swings out, flattens, and folds into an operating table and a display of surgical equipment . A surgery lamp then stretches out from it's void, along with an array of cameras and monitors. You look towards the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here?,\" you squeak, as you and Ada stand just outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Ada chuckles, \"It is a little weird, but it helps other clients see what they're getting into.\" She then motions to the large, empty room. \"Tuesdays are rather slow for us. Doesn't help that the theater looks so sinister!\" She laughs at this, silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you assess, observing all the equipment, all that cushioned paneling. \"Carpe diem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda passes through the wall, unharmed. As you also pass, you note how it feels oddly hot. \"Should I change into something else,\" you ask?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping not to ask,\" Ada chuckles. \"Of course, I'd have to insist, us running a clean ship and all. Just hang your shirt on the rack and step onto the blue circle with your arms spread out.\" A blue line appears in the floor beneath you, leading to an area of the floor with a blue circle of broken lines. A nearby panel pivots from an axis, extending a hanging rack under a folded robotic arm. You comply with Dr. Ada, hang your shirt on the rack, and then stand in the circle with your arms to spread out. The arm then extends, firing a blue, fan-shaped beam onto you, sterilizing every bit of your upper body. It feels just like the wall panel, if gentler, cooler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Dr. Ada approaches another panel of the screen. As she approaches, the panel swivels from it's center, revealing a slot where Dr. Ada can fit and a set of two, folded, robotic arms. After she connects herself, the panel detaches from the screen, becoming her body, and the table folds into a chair. She procures a small spray bottle from the display rack of surgical equipment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a seat.\" You comply, seating yourself as cameras whiz around you, performing their scan. \"Please stick out your head,\" Ada asks. After you do so, she sprays a line of foam around your neck, which tingles its way into your skin. \"This nanospray has just sent a team of bots into your neck, which'll target the pain receptors in the area, gently severing them from the surrounding network.\" At this you note how the tingling is fading. \"They'll then stick around to help the collar mesh with your nerves, and your body in general. Eventually, the collar will then wirelessly connect your brain with your body!\" At this, the cameras complete their work, folding back into the ceiling. \"And now that the calculations are done, our nurse should come in any minute.\" Seconds later, an arm descends between you and Ada, bearing your collar in a glass case. As she retrieves it, cold, sterile gasses whoosh out. \"I'll now apply it to you... and then begin calibration.\" Her hands don't leave the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm?\" Suddenly a plume of cold enters your neck and everything below it suddenly feels slow, and impossibly heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm re-configuring your atomic and molecular structure in the area inside the collar. That chill is the nanobots working as I build a smaller version of your body under your head, and a smaller version of your head above your body. Then I'll create a transponder in the half of the collar on your head, and a receiver in the half on your body. I'll also give the half on your body a limited A.I., so that it can help out your brain when your connection is weak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, wait,\" you say with steadying clarity and speed, \"Can someone hack into my body then? Or my body go rogue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if someone gets your body's virtual copy and can somehow replicate <i>exactly</i> the way you think and feel. Yes they can copy your body down to the last cell, but they can't copy your conscience without taking your still-living head. As for your body going rogue, that's not happening unless someone gets into your collar, passes all the security, and physically messes with the A.I.'s hardware.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin wondering if this was a good idea. The idea that you can be hacked daunts you. \"...So if I'm kidnapped, I could be screwed for life then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If so, then... don't be kidnapped!\". Before you can reply, there's a succinct ding. \"Ah, looks like you're ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up, dazed at what you've gotten yourself into. As you instinctively run your hand through your hair, down the back of your head, you feel the smooth, warm metal, now around at your Adam's apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it out,\" Ada chirps, looking expectantly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel it around, finding no buttons, and then pull up. Sure enough, with a magnetic pop, your head separates from your body. You put your head in your lap, feeling the warm metal on your thighs. You spin your head around, your lips and nose brushing against your happy trail. Then you look up, noting your physique. Instinctively you try moving your jaw, feeling it rub against your belly, and your belly being rubbed by your jaw. You belly button, now at nose level, presses you gently with your breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, Sam, we're done! Leave whenever it's best for you.\" She slides her body-panel into the screen, detaches from it, and floats back to the front desk. Meanwhile you sit there, your head on your lap, facing your stomach, your hands mindlessly petting your scalp as you think of what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place your head next to you, then use your vision to guide your hands as you face your head to the shirt rack. You walk your body up to the rack, put back on your shirt, and return to your head, resolved on what to do. As you exit the cylinder and wave goodbye to the woman at the desk, you...</span></div></div>",

Please follow me and we'll get started.\" The woman said. She then gets up from her desk and walks towards the double doors behind her. You follow her through the doors to a big white lab with a chair in the center. You notice that the chair appears to be hovering above the ground somehow. The woman asks you to have a seat, so you lay down on the hover-chair. She walks over to a big control panel and presses something that immediately makes your chair lay back. She then presses some more buttons and you notice that a little robot flies over to you. It pulls out a needle and jabs it into your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! What was that?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. That was just an anesthetic mixed with a muscle relaxant. You won't feel any pain and it'll stop you from moving around too much.\" She explains.\"Alright. We are ready to begin.\" She presses some more buttons and more little robots appear from nowhere and begin working on you. They use a laser on the top of your head and lift off the top of your skull. The laser robot moves out of the way and another one comes along and carefully lifts your brain out of your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing great so far. This is where you will lose all of your senses for a little while, but don't panic. Everything is fine.\" The woman tells you. Just then, the laser robot comes up to you again and uses it to cut through your brain stem. Just like the woman said, everything goes black and you lose all of your senses. It felt very strange. You felt like just a spirit, wandering around in the dark. Soon, you regain your senses, but notice that there is less weight on your shoulders. The procedure must have been successful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good. You're awake. How do you feel?\" The woman asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel strange. My shoulders feel lighter.\" You say. You then pause to think. How did you just speak? How did you see the woman, or even hear her voice? You don't have a head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After transferring your brain into your body, I installed microscopic microphones, cameras and speaker systems into your neck.\" She explains, as if reading your mind. You raise your hand up to your neck and feel around. It really happened, your head is really gone. It felt strange, but you kind of like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me. I want to show you something.\" The woman says. She then leads you into the next room. She stops you next to a cabinet. Inside, you see a few disembodied heads, including your own. To your surprise, your head seems very much alive. Your head makes several different facial expressions one after the other, spending a few seconds holding each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, is somebody using my head already?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry. There's no brain in there at the moment. Your head is just hooked up to a system that stimulates its face in order to demonstrate different expressions. Customers like to see the heads in action before making a purchase.\" She tells you. \"Which brings me on to my next topic.

You follow her through the doors to a big white lab with a chair in the center. You notice that the chair appears to be hovering above the ground somehow. The woman asks you to have a seat, so you lay down on the hover-chair. She walks over to a big control panel and presses something that immediately makes your chair lay back. She then presses some more buttons and you notice that a little robot flies over to you. It pulls out a needle and jabs it into your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! What was that?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. That was just an anesthetic mixed with a muscle relaxant. You won't feel any pain and it'll stop you from moving around too much.\" She explains.\"Alright. We are ready to begin.\" She presses some more buttons and more little robots appear from nowhere and begin working on you. They use a laser on your neck and completely sever your head from your body. The laser robot moves out of the way and another one comes along and carefully lifts your head into an upright position. Another robot the places your head inside some sort of telekinesis bubble to transport you over to the other side of the room, where they then hook your head up to a life support machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing great so far. The scary part is over, so we just need to do some more work on your body and then we'll hook your head up to a portable support machine.\" The woman tells you. It felt very strange. You couldn't feel anything anymore. Your movements have become limited to just turning your head. You watched as the robots continued to work on your lifeless body, from the other side of the room. As they finish, they transport your body into the next room before connecting your head to a more portable version of the support machine, which fastened around your neck. The woman then picks up your head and holds you to her head height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels very strange, not having my body anymore.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

You see your body, standing inside some sort of cabinet, making several different poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm. How is my body doing that?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it is connected to a device which stimulates its movements. Customers like to see how a body works before making a purchase.\" She informs you. \"Which brings me onto my next topic. Since you made a donation, you can choose any of the bodies we have for free.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You hear a very familiar voice give a sharp gasp behind you.  \"Right on schedule.\"  You say aloud, making sure that she could here you.  The voice belonged to your girlfriend of four months Fiona, whom you were actually out to meet right before you discovered your powers.  You were right in front of the cafe that the two of you frequented and she arrived exactly on time, as she always did.<br>\r\nYou feel her soft hands take a quavering hold of your head, lifting it up and turning it around to face her.  You saw fear and confusion in her soft green eyes, her olive toned face contorted into a panicked frown.  You can also tell that she had recently had a haircut, her normally back length hazel brown hair now cut to a short and cute bob.  \"Matt?\"  She says hesitantly, in shock and disbelief at your speech despite being only a head.<br>\r\n\"Hey cutie, glad to see you?\"  You respond nonchalantly.  Fiona is immensely relieved and hugs you tightly to her chest, much to your own enjoyment.<br>\r\n\"Christ Matt you scared the living hell out of me!\"  She said, bringing you back up to her eye level.  \"What... just what is... what the hell happened to you?!\"  She demanded, studying the metal device on the base of your neck.<br>\r\n\"It's a long story.\"  You simply reply, adding \"I can tell it to you at your house, though I suggest we get there discreetly, I don't want to grab too much attention.\"  Luckily the streets were mostly empty right now so no one had caught sight of the two of you just yet.  Fiona nods and quickly dumps you into her purse before briskly walking back to her apartment.  The purse was rather cluttered and a tight fit, and the constant bouncing around wasn't really all that pleasant, but luckily your little journey only takes about fifteen minutes, and soon enough Fiona sets you down on the living room table of her apartment, the two of you now totally alone.  You explain to her your new found time powers, demonstrate your ability to become invisible, and explain how you donated your body to a clinic one thousand years into the future, finishing by explaining \"So for now I'm seeing what it's like to just be a head, and when I get bored or have had enough I'll just go back to the future right after I donated and recollect my body or another one of my choice and it'll be like nothing happened at all.\"<br>\r\nFiona let's this sink in, taking a sip of her tea before responding \"Well, now that I know that you're like this on your own free will and that you can reverse this at any time this is actually really cool!\"  She picks you up and begins to make out with you.  You don't really have much in the way of equipment but you can tell that this is arousing you.  After a while she breaks off the kiss and says \"Hey, want to watch the movie we picked out now?\"  She inquired.  You remembered now that the date plan was to meet at the cafe, go out dancing, and then come back to her house and watch a movie.  Seeing as how you couldn't really dance at the moment you shrug (or rather, think about shrugging while your neck does an odd little wiggle)<br>\r\n\"Sure, put it on!\"  You agree.  Fiona turns you around to face the screen while she pops in the movie,  a cheesy action flick by the name of \"Dare to die 3: dying all over again, again\".  Absolute schlock about a nineteen eighties mercenary brought back to life as a cyborg in 2200 to hunt down mutant cultists, but the two of you enjoyed watching bad movies together.  Fiona went to the kitchen as the opening credits rolled, the sound of popcorn being popped overpowering the sound of the narrator explaining the back story but you didn't mind.  You'd seen the first two, you didn't need to hear the same part of the story again.  As the recap ends Fiona returns with popcorn in hand, setting the bowl on the table beside your head before picking you up.  She sprawls over the couch on her side, setting your head down in front of her stomach facing the screen and using her right hand to keep you upright.  With her right hand she begins feeding herself.  \"Hey, could you give me some?\"  You ask.<br>\r\n\"Can you even eat like that?\"  Fiona inquires skeptically.<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"  You honestly answer, \"Let's try!\"  Fiona laughs at your blind enthusiasm before taking a single piece of popcorn form the bowl and sliding it into your open mouth.  You chew and swallow, and to your surprise when the popcorn reaches the bottom of your throat a strange tingling sensation occurs before the popcorn breaks down and dissolves, leaving behind nothing.  \"Apparently yes.\"  You reply.  With a shrug Fiona alternates between feeding herself and you, the two of you watching and commenting as the action progressed.<br>\r\nAbout an hour later in the midst of an underground shootout though the movie stops, the picture of the hero hanging off the side of a subway car freezing on the screen.  \"Aw, the disk froze!\"  Fiona complained  \"It had a couple scratches sure but it honestly didn't look too bad.\"  With the movie effectively cancelled Fiona and you decide to...</span></div></div>",

You begin slowly kissing the area around her belly button, causing Fiona to squirm and laugh as you tickled her with your tongue.  \"Ah, stop it Matt you know how ticklish I am!\"  She tells you, though the fact that she could easily move your head at any time made it clear that she really didn't mind.<br>\r\nYou smile, stopping your little belly torture.  \"Well, if you don't like me kissing you there you can move me somewhere else.\"  You offer, making your intentions very clear to her.  She paused, then giggled in a very sexy fashion.<br>\r\n\"You know what my little airhead?  I might just do that!\"  Fiona lifted you up and set you back down on the table, facing towards the TV.  She stood up and walked around the table into the center of the living room, right in front of your line of sight.  With a sickeningly gorgeous grin she began swaying her hips from side to side as she worked her shirt up and over her head, allowing it to flop onto the ground.  She slid out of her jeans next, kicking them off of her long slender legs.  She stood for a moment, allowing you to take in her body clad in its deep purple bra and panties.  Her hips were wide, her stomach flat, and her breasts while not large and likely being a moderate B all contributed to a lean and athletic build that was driving you absolutely mad with lust.  Fiona continues her tease by sliding her hands behind her back and with a click unhooking her bra.  She held the bra in place over her chest with her left hand while her right hand went lower.  She slipped her thumb into the strap of her panties and began working them down her legs, crouching as she did.  Once she had slipped out of them she stood again and let go of her bra, the last pieces of her clothing sliding off of her body and leaving her delectably exposed from head to fuzz covered crotch, the only thing left on her (a personal preference of hers) being her short cut socks..<br>\r\nFiona then struts back over to you and plucks you off of the table, bringing you to her lips the two of you are absolutely furious in your passion, heating up like a furnace as you kiss.  Fiona slowly works you down her body, lowering you to her neck, then to her sternum, down to her stomach again, to her pelvis, and finally when she could not stand the pressure any more she dropped you down between her legs.  You used what little you had left for all it was worth, tongue rolling every speck of flesh she had in reach and nose nuzzling her clitoris.  She held you down for as long as she could last, her trembling hands eventually too tired to maintain grip causing your head to tip back out of reach.  She was absolutely spent, panting like she never had before.  She can't even speak, only mumbling an indecipherable thanks.</span></div></div>",

You aren't able to resist the urge for very long in such a snug and comfortable position either and you two were soon in dreamland, smiling as the day slipped away into the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour slumber was rudely interrupted by the sensation of falling, your head tumbling down and smacking into the luckily carpeted floor.  \"OH SHIT!  I'm sorry Matt I forgot you were there.\"  Fiona apologized, lifting you back up and setting you on the table facing her.  You soon notice what awoke her with such a start, the sound of her alarm going off.  Fiona picks her phone off of the table to deactivate the alarm and groans.  \"Ugh.  I just remembered I have work today.\"  She laments, sitting up to further awaken herself.  \"I can't take another sick day, Gillian is already pissed at me for sticking her with Sunday last week.\"  She informed you.  Fiona worked as a store manager for a local grocery chain, boring work but it kept the lights on.  \"We should probably figure out something to do with you but in the mean time I have to get ready for work.  Would you like to join me in the shower?\"  She asked.<br>\r\n\"Do I you think I have a say in the matter?\"  You joke, making note of your current state.<br>\r\n\"Would you say no if you did?\"  Fiona countered.<br>\r\n\"Nope.\"  You reply with a smirk.<br>\r\n\"Then no you don't have a say in the matter.\"  She teases, cradling you under her arm as she went the the bathroom.  She set you on the side of the sink while she turned on the shower and began washing herself, making sure to use as many over the top poses and gestures as she could to provide you a good show.  Once she had cleaned herself off she approached you and decided to help you with your morning grooming.  She washed your face, shampooed your hair, and brushed your teeth, all the while her smooth hands were caressing your face scalp and neck soothingly.  Soon the two of you were clean and Fiona dressed herself in her work uniform.  \"So, what're we going to do with you now?\"  She pondered.</span></div></div>",

With low grunts you bent, wormed, and rolled your neck on the fabric of the couch, the muscles pulling on phantom shoulders. For incredibly enough, you still felt your body, with a hungering manhood to boot. But even as you  felt the motions of your hands and fingers, and the straining throbs of a <i>very</i> hard member, your ghostly limbs could grasp nothing. Tried as you did to move them, they phased through each other and felt nothing as they did so. It was like your whole body had become air, your sex present but literally uncontainable -- and Fiona, your lovely vessel, was inches away. Inches that may as well been lightyears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona, meanwhile, was coming down from her high, letting her lust evaporate with slowing, shrinking breaths. With considerable effort, she grunted herself upright. She noticed you then, as you wormed about on the couch, feet away from her snatch. Humor and pity filling her chest, she slid a warm palm under your cheek and rolled you up so you could face the ceiling, as her other hand cupped your neck. A thumb rolled on the ball of your neck, then pressed the pit just beneath. The electricity arced your neck upward, along your air-like spine to your cloud-like lust, but nothing came but rolling, spastic, ghostly thunder, grunting at your phantom chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God you look awful,\" she smiled, with eyebrows bent in guilt. As one thumb let go of your neck, another rolled over your lips. Her folds bloomed anew at the red plush of your tongue, and she dug her digit deeper. And you sucked on it all the harder, teething at her bones. She heaved you upward then, arm wobbling beneath your weight, and switched her finger for her tongue. So she spent a precious few seconds before disappointment brought her to stop. \"I miss your dick\", she said as fatigue nipped at the base of her arms. She lay herself back down then, and brought you to her breast. With a boner raging at the ether, you devoured what you could down there, sending her slit to full bloom. \"Ah! Matt~!\" She pressed you hard against it, pelvis humping at your imaginary thighs, pelvis hungering for the genuine article. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I miss it too, babe,\" you said as you kissed around her luscious mounds, themselves rocking before your feeling lips. Her fingers began to grope around your neck when suddenly, hitting a button aligned with your spine, she sent a low buzz up from the base of your neck, sending honey-like waves up your ass to your scalp, a sweetness that curled your now-slobbering lips with bliss. But Fiona, feeling only vibrations, froze her for a moment. But then a naughty idea crept a small, naughty tingle up her chest. As your tongue lolled against her skin, she spun you so the tip of your head pointed to her legs and your tongue pointed to her chin, pressed against her silken skin. Slowly you slid down her body, dragged once more to her warm abyss, carnal madness awaiting below. As once more your nose crossed her clitoris, your tongue fell into the great unknown, between her thighs, which she scrunched against your face. And so the lightning that coursed your phantom body sent thunder against your Fiona's fuzzy fields, your metal plate's rim touching her clit, splaying her legs with a sharp gasp. And as your face plunged between her thighs, she grounded you hard against her sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, like a drill, something dug into the depths of your being, and your phantom body suddenly had phantom skin, muscle, hair and fat. And a delicious feeling of stretchiness overtook you, pulling at your limbs and spiralling your body into long, hot, blob of taffy. It felt almost exactly like the skin of your dick. And then, as you seemed to stretch, squish, and knead 'til you were hundreds of feet long, you felt the great bulk of your body sink into you somehow. And it felt <i>good</i>, rolling inside the slick, quivering walls of your steamy flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona, still seeking arousal from the buzzing, metallic plate beneath your neck, suddenly noticed the slick, cold metal turn to soft, firm skin. And then, suddenly, it became like smooth chewing gum, wrapping itself around the bones of her waist, 'round the small of her back, and forming a fleshy, form-fitting hoop. Her moans faded to silent awe, while you worked your vocal cords to the bone into the cushions of the couch 'cuz <i>boy</i> did you feel something, when an inexplicable yet totally explicable sensation poked into your asshole, and <i>expanded</i>. You couldn't mistake what it was, because you could feel from it's perspective too, pushing upwards, edges brushing against the strangely smooth walls of your digestive tract, then up against your newly missing tonsils, your newly missing uvula, and up your tongue as your head was involuntarily craned upward. And as you looked down, you couldn't deny what was growing out your mouth. And in a way, a metaphorical way, it could look back at you with it's great cycloptic eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n\"AGHHH!\" Fiona panicked, jumping out of the couch as your head bobbed up and down the stubbornly clutching growth on her crotch. She banged her shin against her coffee table, shocking her back to calmness and bending her forward in pain. Finally loosened, you felt your support rapidly deflate inside and against the inside of you. But as you were caught up in the sensation of collapsing skin pulling back against your tongue, you noticed, all too late, a sudden swelling in the veins of your head and dense pressure squeeze at your skull. Then you saw Fiona's legs were upright -- and that gravity was working it's magic on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUNK! felt your forehead against the rapidly breaking glass, as you smashed through broken glass and faceplanted onto a motley of messily placed remotes. Fiona, dumbstruck, could only look with hands up against her mouth as she stared at your disembodied head, at the penis-equipped flesh-harness that had grown around her waste, and the emerald sea of glass at her feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds grew stale on the tense air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owwwwwwww.\" Still another second passed.<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Fiona meekly piped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------<b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were propped now at the edge of the coffee table, facing Fiona as she vaccumed the last shards of glass from her carpet. She was still so shocked by this episode that she kept your dick on,  which stuck itself out like a small, shriveled tongue in the cold apartment air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you, uh, take that off?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh! Right.\" She felt around the back for a latch, but found none. You could feel the fresh skin of the thong, strangely feeling just like your right thigh, graze against her fingertips. You instinctively clenched your phantom thighs, and sure enough you felt her thumb squeeze against her waist, and felt the top of your left thigh press and become perfectly enveloped between her legs. Then you tried squirming them around, and sure enough the straps ever so slightly moved against her. Your manhood perked at this new possibility, as did a disturbing tingle from within your neck-tube. Gingerly, then, she put her hand against your member, firming it even more. She looked up then, urged by a growing guess, and met your eyes to confirm it was true. Her eyebrow raised at your face, clearly loosened, clearly aroused, with questions and guesses of an increasingly sexual nature. \"Are you feeling this, Matt,\" she asked as her palm slid against your rod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled for something to say, anything to get her doing <i>more</i>. It was captivating, feeling your thighs grind against your Fiona, your dick rubbed in ways only you had done before, as your knot slowly rose before your eyes. Her hand pumped faster, and your mouth opened as your cock lengthened. Then you clenched your teeth, hissing with all the restraint you could muster, as cum seemed ready to blast out your tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry, hurry\", you gasped, words growing clumsy against the mounting pressure. \"Gonna cum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as close to cue as she could get, she stomped herself before you, kneeled down, and sent the thickest, hottest, whitest stream you've ever let out spouting over your face and hair, sending globules spattering against wood and fabric. And kinky minx as she was she kept right on pumping, as your urethra clenched at phantom cum, trying to tease out more and more. Then it pressed against your lips. You opened. The weight of your head kept you stable as with remarkable skill, Fiona slid it inside your mouth. Your lips kissed and smacked against your dick, shooting waves of bliss from up your loins. The last gobs dribbled out on your tongue, and you cupped it to take as much as you can. Then, feeling a final clench from your thigh-skin straps, Fiona drove it deep against your tongue, your dick gliding against cum and spit, into the warm, needy walls of your throat. So swallowed were the final dregs of your lust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finished, Matt?\" If you had to answer, you would choose...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Would you please walk me to the clinic?\"  You request.  Fiona does as you asked, walking the two blocks slowly and taking in all of the sights.  When you reach the clinic you are greeted by a familiar looking woman.<br>\r\n\"Back so soon?\"  She asks you.<br>\r\n\"For you it's been a short time, yes.\"  You respond.  \"Anyway I'm here to get my body back.  If I remember correctly you said I got one free because I was donating, right?\"<br>\r\nShe frowns.  \"Well... normally it's against company policy to just trade people their own bodies back, we normally require that they pick a new one so that it's a body exchange.\"  She pauses.  \"But for you?  I'll make an exception.\"  She turns her attention to Fiona.  \"Miss?  Would you please hand me Matt so that we can begin the reattachment procedure?\"<br>\r\nFiona responds...</span></div></div>",

Immediately, Fiona's body goes limp and lifeless. One robot carries Fiona's brain away in a telekinisis bubble, while the rest continue to work on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then place the top of her head back on and reseal it. As they finish that up, you see that the is no scar or any trace that they were ever there. The laser robot then returns and cuts off Fiona's head, which is then carried out of the room. Meanwhile, Fiona's brain has been placed inside a strange looking machine. As it is activated, Fiona's brain begins to shrink, until it is the size of a golf ball. The surgery woman then walks over and retrieves Fiona's brain and carries it back to her body. She places the brain inside an odd looking syringe, then somehow injects Fiona's brain back into her body through her neck. The robots finish up with Fiona's body and then leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Fiona's body comes to life, sitting up, facing the surgery woman. The surgery woman speaks to her, but you can't hear through the glass.

They are all muscular, but not too muscled. From the bios, the previous owners were all fit and athletic, either being in some sport like swimming, running, gymnastics, or similar sport. The bodies are also taller than yours used to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next... Next...\" you say in your head. \"Next...\" The machine halts, not moving to the next body. \"Oh great, did I break it?\" Less than a mintue later, the machine swings back into motion. The body it showed you was exactly what you were looking for. With your mind, you make the body strike a few poses and turn in place. \"It's perfect.\" you say, excited that you finally found what you were looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, who had been standing there the whole time smiled brightly. \"Great choice.\" Her enthusiasm did not waver, which surprised you. She began typing on the console in front of her, and the body disappeared from view. \"Alright, let me take you back to the surgery room. We will attach you right away.\" She unplugs you from the body selection console and carries you back down the aisle. She takes you down a couple of corridors and opens up to a room surgically room, nearly identical to the one that removed you from your body. Setting you down on a nearby table, the woman smiles. \"The medical drones are going to sedate you temporarily. The process of connecting the nerves and blood vessels are a little tricker than severing them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, you could feel the room going dark. The chemicals had been injected into your life support system. \"Sounds... good.\" You try to say before falling unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how long your were out, but when your began to come to, you were laying down on, what you assumed was the cold medical table. And on top of that, you had a severe neck ache. \"Ugh...\" You moan, bringing a hand to the base of you neck. Underneath your fingers, you could feel a hair line scar. \"Wait...\" You bring the hand you used to rub your neck, into your view. It was a hand. It must have been the hand of the body that they attached you to. \"Yes... it worked!\" You cheered. You slowly turned the hand back and forth, examining the new limb. It was incredible. It felt just like your old one, but... stronger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou concentrated for a moment, and to your great enjoyment, the hand became invisible. \"Yes... and my power still works. I don't have to worry about that.\" You stopped focusing, and made your hand reappear. Smiling inwardly, you now wanted to see the rest of your new body. You made an attempt to sit up, but suddenly your head began to swim. The movement almost made you pass out again. \"Okay... not yet. Ugh.\" You brought the hand to your stomach, feeling nauseous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were met with a very peculiar surprise; you couldn't feel your stomach. Or more precisely, you could not feel your hand touching the left side of your stomach. You suddenly became aware that the left half of this body was complete numb. \"No... wrong word.\" you say, thinking out loud. The left half of your body felt missing, but you could feel the whole stomach with the right hand. \"Great... they screw up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a door slide open. \"Oh good, your awake now.\" It was the familiar, cheery voice of the woman that had helped you earlier. \"How are we feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" You began to complain. \"What did you guys do? I can't feel, I can't move the left side of this body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a normal part of this surgery, don't worry.\" The woman walked over into your field of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is? Okay... so when will I feel that half of my body.\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at you puzzled for a moment, but then replaced it with a smile. \"You won't be able to feel or use that half of your body at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? But... that wasn't on the bio. The body was perfectly healthy.\" You exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the body is perfectly healthy; it was an excellent choice. I'm not sure what the problem is sir.\" The woman said calmly. You were about to yell at her more, but she cut you off. \"Oh, wait... Now I understand what the problem is. That machine continues to glitch when selections are made sometimes. I keep reporting the problem to the maintenance crew, but they are so backlogged.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were starting to get really annoyed, but you bit on your tongue to keep from saying something insulting. You took a deep breathe and slowly released it. \"What is the glitch you were talking about? Can this body be fixed, or can I get a new body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me answer your questions in backwards order.\" The woman's smile was beginning to get very annoying. \"You cannot get a new body unfortunately; only one body selection is allowed per donator. Second question, the body does not need to be fixed; it is perfectly healthy, like I said earlier. And for you first question, the body selection machines are all connected to the same body storage system. When bodies are selected, they are supposed to be removed from the possible choices. I can see now, that this body was not removed after the other person selected it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... someone else selected this body? Then why do I have it?\" You ask, panicking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You both have it.\" The woman smiled brightly. \"Since neither of you can select a new body, you guys will be able to share it. We're sorry if that causes any inconvenience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to make the situation worse, \"Ugh... What is going on?\" a male voice questioned. The voice was directly besides you, obviously another head attached to the same body as yours was.</span></div></div>",

You went through a lot of different \"phases\", starting off by creating some ridiculously over muscled Olympian monstrosities before toning it down to more normal forms, then going further and making humorous joke bodies like skinny little waif bodies that could still lift tons and outrun cars according to the readouts.  Eventually though you decided on something relatively close to your original body, simply idealized a bit.  Slightly more muscles, a bit more of a tan, a bit more... more down there.  It wasn't godlike by any means but it was certainly a step up in the looks department and you imagined your girlfriend Fiona would agree once you showed it off to her.  Satisfied with your creation you concentrate on the \"Finish\" button and the display shuts down.  After a series of clicks and whirs secures all the pieces of your new body together you watch as it walks up to you and lifts you up, positioning your life support over a shallow cylindrical hole on its neck.  Placing you down in it you hear a final \"Click\" and a rush of sensation and information fills your head.  You see with your mind's eye a bunch of bars and stats giving you a readout on all of your mechanical body's vitals.  A disembodied voice in your head says \"Connection complete, remote control now enabled.  Welcome to the new you!\"<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\"  You think, flexing your new limbs and prodding your new flesh.  It felt quite lifelike, almost indistinguishable from the way your flesh and bone muscles felt (albeit a fair bit stronger of course).<br>\r\n\"So, I see you've crafted a body to your... specifications.\"  The doctor said, looking you over from head to toe.  \"In any event here are your clothes, a bit plain I know but we're not exactly a mall.\"  She said, handing you a plain white shirt, boxers, and jeans.  \"So, would you like my help with anything else?\"<br>\r\nYou think about this and say...</span></div></div>",

It's good to know that I can be mistaken for a human.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a young woman enters the operating room. She appears to be around 25 years old, or her body does at least. She is 5'5 with blonde hair and a slim figure. As she approaches the operating table, she is instructed by the other surgery woman to strip her clothes off. A small robot appears next to her to collect each item of clothing as they are removed. Less than a minute later, the girl is standing completely nude in the middle of the operating room. It's then that you see just how stunning she really is. You wonder how anyone could have a body that looks so perfect, yet so natural, then you remember that this is the future. The surgery woman then gestures towards the operating table and the young woman lies down on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the operation begins, a large machine lowers from the ceiling until it hangs just above the young woman. It appears to scan her body before activating some sort of beam across the full length of her body. At first, it doesn't look like anything is happening, then you notice that the girl's blonde hair is slowly retracting back into her scalp. Her arms grows thicker, her legs grow longer and her breasts start shrinking. Her cute soft face soon moulds into a more ruff, masculine one. By this point you have caught onto what is going on, but the penis surfacing from her crotch confirms it. The young woman has just transformed into a young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! How is that possible?\" you ask the surgery woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We use that contraption to manipulate the DNA into matching the chromosome of the opposite sex. In this case, the patient started off with the chromosome X/X and we manipulated her DNA to match the X/Y chromosome, resulting in her body transforming from female to male.\" She informs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former young woman sits up and looks down at \"her\" new form. She patted the flat area of \"her\" chest, embracing the lack of weight before running \"her\" hands over her newly acquired abs. A small robot then wheels up to her, holding a set of male clothing for \"her\" to put on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surgery woman then turns to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what would you like to do now, sir?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Figuring that it isn't important at that moment, you decide to forget about it &amp; move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get home and see your mom and then go to your room, you start to think about your girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your phone and see her number still there so you relax a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later your \"best friend\" showed up. It was at this moment you realise that things really have changed in this reality.</span></div></div>",

You stand there, on the porch of the house that you had owned in the previous timeline and wondered what the hell was going on before you pull open the small designer purse that had appeared on your arm when you transitioned into this new timeline. After a little digging (and some swearing as your new long hair kept spilling into your vision), you pull up your keyring which is significantly smaller and has only three keys on it as opposed to the normal five that your male life had. One is thicker and obviously a car key, the other two are small and generic looking, just as your old house key had been. You subconciously bite your lip, not knowing how sexy it looks as you try both keys in the door lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic swells in you as you hurry off the porch and look in the front window. The interior is dark, most of your vision is blocked by curtains, but you move from window to window, standing on your toes and pressing your new face against the glass as your breasts rest against the window sill. Each tiny fragment of vision reveals only a sliver of the larger picture, but you can see that you no longer live here. The furniture is different, the walls are painted a different color, the television is too large what you could have afforded on your modest budget. You stand there, in the yard you formerly owned and rack your brains, a manicured finger sliding to your new plump lips as you think of what could have gone wrong when you notice one of your former neighbors staring out her window, suspicion filling her eyes as she dials a number that you don't even have to guess at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take off in a hurry down the street, your new breasts thumping painfully against your smaller torso and struggling to escape the confines of the tight pink shirt and bra you had re-materialized in.  When you feel you are far enough away, you stop and sit down on a nearby bench to catch your breath and dig through your purse once more to find your driver's license. You don't even notice your legs crossing themselves in a proper ladylike manner as you dig through the small, leather container, letting out a hissed 'YES!' when you pull the feminine billfold out and crack it open to reveal your driver's license.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your elation falls short as you see how much has changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Alexandra Walkins.<br>\r\nAge: Seventeen<br>\r\nDoB: April 22nd, 1997<br>\r\nAddress: 607 Frontier State Drive<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of that information is correct. In the previous timeline, your name was James, you were twenty-three, you were born in November and you most certainly did not live at 607 Frontier State Drive. You were female, a minor and apparently lived across town from where you had previously lived only hours and a reality ago. Apparently interacting with your mother in the past has completely changed everything about your life, not just your gender. And then you realize that Walkins was your girlfriend's last name. And that her family had lived on Frontier State Drive until she was six when the house had burned down when her younger brother had accidentally set off a package of fireworks in the attic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold dread fills you, but as you try to jump back in time to fix this mess, but you find that you cannot. You grit your teeth and tense your muscles, but all you succeed in doing is giving a couple of teenage boys across the street a good show as your new nipples become erect and poke through the flimsy material of your shirt. You try freezing time, but nothing happens. You try turning invisible, but the boys across the street are still very much tracking you with their cute brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake off the weird feeling and begin walking towards the address, the implications of what you've done filling your mind. You were and still considered yourself to be a bit of a science geek, at least when it came to enjoying a good science fiction film, novel or video game, so you try to piece together what may have happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n If your life is completely changed to where your previous male self never existed, then logic dictates that you could have never fulfilled the conditions that led to you being able to be able to control time in the first place. Could you replicate the events that happened, or was the power linked to all events in your male tmeline, with the car accident being the piv...piv...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, struggling to find the word that you were sure you knew. It's not, like, you had simply forgotten all the grades you'd gotten throughout high school. They were going to help you get into college!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was that line of thought that suddenly filled your mind with a new fear, one that overrode the heavy implications that you were no longer capable of time travel, and that you may have either joined your girlfriend's family or had somehow erased one of them from existence; You HAD gone to college and HAD been finishing up your final year when the accident had happened. But you couldn't remember any of it. You could remember the years of high school, puberty and your first period (wait, no) erection and getting your first car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was if somehow you were, totally, integrating with this reality in both form and mind now that you were no longer able to control it. You try not to think about it as you hurry down the street that apparently housed your new home. You had never seen your girlfriend's house (even though you didn't swing that way, but you knew you totally did) since it had burned down, but it was quite immaculate. Frontier Drive had always been a prosperous part of town and it was no different now than it was in the other timeline. 607 Frontier Drive rose before you, a golden-tan neo-Colonial house that was at least three stores high (though you always remembered it being that big because you were always on the short side. But yet you had always been the tallest in class) with wide windows and a enclosed front porch that simply dwarfed your old home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is even the familiar, slightly crooked mailbox (that you had never seen before yet had accidentally backed into when learning how to drive) that had 'The Walkins' stenciled in bright yellow with the tiny honeybee that you had never painted on the side of the mailbox's arm when you were not nine. You shake your head viciously, sending your long blonde hair flying in all directions and your breasts shaking side to side painfully and you stamp your slightly heeled show one hard on the ground, trying to focus on your male life that, while stopping at the beginning of Senior year in High School, was still present within your mind. It was there but just...receded. The more you thought and the more you saw with your new baby blue eyes (even though you had yet to see a clear reflection of your new face), the more the female version of memories became dominant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no choice to go but forward. With a practiced grace that you had always never had, you quickly climb the low stone stairs, cross the porch where you had never first had your first kiss with a boy and open the familiar strange weight of the oak door and cross the threshold into uncharted home territory.</span></div></div>",

The foyer is as wide open as you remember it never being, leading to the long living room that had the giant couch that you always had never loved to lounge on during rainy days. You feel the comforting coolness of the aged hard wood floor beneath your dainty feet and you walk through the columned entryway the same way you have never always walked through it and take a seat on the arm of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, on the other side of the couch, sunk so low that you couldn't see from the doorway, was your mother. Your eyes go wide in shocked non-surprise at her taut, sleeping face, a face that, had you not always remembered never seeing through your life, you would have barely recognized. On the low table in front of her snoozing form was a bottle of wine, her favorite (you take little relief in the fact that there has been one constant across time) and a open container of what look to be painkillers that you once remember never going to the hospital for eating because you thought they were candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore memories flood your mind the more you look around the living room. It was always you, mom and the dad that had replaced your other dad. And you remember that you had never had the little brother that you had always never gone to ballgames with when your not-dad had taken you. No, instead you remember mom being very clingy and always stressed whenever your dad had come home just a few minutes late, and had never always been the contented slightly plump woman that only casually worked out. Instead you remember the private gym that your mother had in the expansive basement, taking up the space that girl whose name you couldn't remember now had always said was where her brothers had had their bedrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom here it looked like your mom wasn't very happy, but then you always remember her always being sad and never spending time with you and always being slightly mean because she thought you were prettier than she was. That you were always had been a daddy's girl and always liked it when he was home because he made you laugh and because mom was always too busy giving him everything he wanted instead of being, well, a bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the flood of new memories you try to center yourself because, like, all this time travel stuff was giving you a total headache. You focused on all that kinda geeky stuff that you never let anyone know that you liked and tried to work out the details of what might have happened. You knew you could always wake mom up, but from the experience that you'd never always had, she'd be more likely to bite your head off and retreat to her bedroom than spill out a long...what was the word? You shake your fist silently in the air instead of snapping your fingers when you'd always never been stumped. Narrative! That was it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt proud of yourself that you could remember the proper word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo if in your timeline your mother had married that...one girl's old father than that meant that that girl and her brothers had never existed, which meant that instead of being born a boy and instead of having never been born in 1991 you had always been born in 1997. And that because of the advice that you had given your mom as a child she had obviously gone overboard and latched onto the first man that had ever shown an interest in her which was obviously the man who had never always been your loving daddy. Which meant that you had never grown up as the older brother but the single teenage daughter of a wealthy family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was the girl that got erased again? You furrowed your brow in thought but the name just never came to you. In fact you couldn't remember what she had never looked like. But you did remember never having sex with her a week ago during Senior year. The thought of never having liked girls sent a shiver of disgust down your spine, you were totally into boys but had never gone all the way. Right now you were 'between boyfriends' which was girlcode that you had never always knew stood for 'running out of fish in the sea'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich you had partially blamed on your mom because she would always scare off boys even more than your daddy would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quietly as you could, you lifted yourself off the arm of the couch and made your way into the fancy kitchen that you never always remembered having. You gently pull open the fridge door and grab a bottle of water and quietly go upstairs, your small feet following the worn pattern in the carpet that had never not burnt up in a fire that had never happened. You find your door, as always marked with your favorite stickers of cute things that you have never always liked and enter your bedroom.</span></div></div>",

You had gone back to your mother's childhood and had planted within her an idea so deep and profound that it had taken root and twisted her life and by extension yours in a way that you had never imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was twenty-three years and a timeline ago. You don't think about it very often, not when it reads like some movie fading from the recesses of your brain. You should be sad, but you're not. In fact you're the opposite of sad, and you smile with perfectly white teeth as your beloved father who had once been the father of some girl you had once never knew cuts the first slice of your birthday cake and hands it to you with a gentle smile and a perfunctory kiss on the top of your immaculate blonde hair. You mother fritters around in the background, a over-tanned rail thin wisp of a creature whose eyes dart jealously between you and your father who once never was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was normal, and you ignore her like you have always never done and instead give your father your babiest blue eyes and tell him thank you before frittering off to eat chat and chatter with your girlfriends, who, like you, are all dressed in your sorority colors and the latest fashion accessories and hairstyles. Once you would have felt some primal attraction towards these girls and yourself, all the very definition of rich, college women, but that version of you had never existed anywhere but within your own mind. And you didn't miss that life that had always never been. Before you had always never been single, a worker drone with a subpar, unrewarding job that was headed nowhere fast, now you had always been the daughter of a successful lawyer, a top member of the sorority and had a loving boyfriend who unfortunately had to tell you happy birthday over the phone as the university's basketball team bus was stuck in traffic several towns away. But you understood, and looked forward to the birthday gift you and he had planned for his return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, everything in your never always had been life was perfect, save for your mother whom you had no doubt was psychologically damaged and had constantly looked at you with hate in her eyes from the attention your lovely body received, and from your incredibly close relationship with your never had always been father. There were times where you even caught her mumbling under her breath during one of her 'nap times' of wine and painkillers about 'being promised something different' and that you were the source of all the wrongs in her life. You merely brushed it off like always and ignored her. If she couldn't be happy with the fantastic life that you had always accidentally had given yourself, well, that was her fault, not yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough in a way, you muse as you sip your not first glass of alcohol and laugh at your BFF's latest trashy joke, it sort of was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a happy life has a way of making you not care about that.</span></div></div>",

Oh my god, I erased the existence of my own girlfriend! I need to bring her back!\" You say. You try to remember how things changed. You then remember that you met the younger version of your mother. That must be when everything changed. It caused a butterfly effect. You come to the conclusion that the way to return things to the way they were; make you male again and bring back your girlfriend, is to never meet your mother in 1978.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I just need to stay away from my mother and things should return to normal.\"</span></div></div>",

The longer I stayed in that time, the more I forgot who I was.

It kind of scares me.\" You admit. You then find yourself looking down at your body. Strangely, you feel awkward as you stare down at your cleavage. You feel yourself blush and decide to cross your arms over your chest. As you do so, you catch your male self checking you out. He turns away in embarrassment when you spot him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I'm you! That's really creepy!\" You yell at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I couldn't help it.\" He says. \"If it's not too much to ask, what's it like being a girl? I've always wondered.\" You male self asks. You know all too well that he has wondered what it's like. You ARE him after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back when I forgot who I really was, it felt natural to me. I didn't really think about it, but now that I remember being a guy, it feels really strange.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....That's it? No more details?\" Your male self says, trying to prompt you for more information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're being creepy again.\" You tell him. He apologises and starts avoiding direct eye contact with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sitting for a little longer, you both agree that it is time to go back to the present. There's no reason for either of you to stay any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, this is goodbye.\" Your male self says. \"I guess so.\" You reply. your male self stands there awkwardly while you stare at him. You smile at how weird he looks. \"What!?\" He says, as he begins to feel uncomfortable. \"Come here!\" You say with your arms wide open. You wrap them around your male self and embrace. After a few seconds, he returns your embrace. You both stand in that position for s few moments before letting go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as your male self closes his eyes and concentrates. Suddenly, he just vanishes into thin air. \"So, that's what it looks like from everyone else's perspective.\" You think to yourself. You then close your eyes too and concentrate on going back to the present. You have no idea what will be waiting for you, now that your original history has theoretically been restored.

Of course this is directed at your male self. She approaches him and gives him a kiss. You can't help but feel a little hurt. Not so long ago, that would have been your kiss.

You are now your male self's sister?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm....Yeah. I ran into her on the way home and invited her over.\" Your male self finally manages to blurt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Well, make yourself at home, Alexandra.\" Your girlfriend says.

We must have changed something without realising!\" He whispers back. You both then head into the living room and take a seat on the couch. You try to act as natural as possible while your around your now former girlfriend. As you think about your new relation to your male self, you remember the date of birth matches your male self's. That must mean that you are actually twins.

Back in your original universe, it was you that booked the holiday to Barcelona, so you already knew about it. You decide that it's easier to just play along as if you didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours pass and you discover that this universe it pretty much the same as your original one, apart from the obvious. Same news, same lives, same scenarios. You finally decided to leave, feeling that you may be overstaying your welcome. Besides, you still need to find out what life as Alexandra is like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good seeing you again!\" Your girlfriend says on your way out. \"See you later....Sis.\" Your male self adds, sounding pretty uncomfortable with the situation. You say your goodbyes and then leave the house. You wait until the door is closed, then freeze time. After doing so, you re-enter the house and approach your former girlfriend. You wrap your arms around her and hold her tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna miss you.\" You whisper in her ear, although you know that she won't hear you in her frozen state. You stand in that position for a few minutes, shedding a tear as you let her go. You then place a kiss on her lips before turning to leave again. You retake your position and compose yourself before unfreezing time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk down the path, you realise that you have no idea where you live now.

Here's UR address. I'll be in touch.\" It reads. Under it is the supposed address of your new self; Alexandra. Not wanting to waste any more time, you grab a taxi and go straight to your new home. As you approach the front door, you wonder how you are going to get in. Luckily you find the key in your purse. You open the door and enter. After closing the door again, you stand with your back to it, facing the interior of your new home. It looks pretty nice, you have to admit.

You had planned to travel back in time, but you may have overshot your mark. As you take a breath, you discover how fresh it feels. Fresher than any breath you had ever taken before in your life. You must have pre-dated any form of major pollution.<br>\r\nYou decide to wander through the woods for a while. You can hear birds above you and other wild animal calls in the distance, but you still don't see any sign of human civilisation. After a short while of near silence, you hear an unfamiliar rustle in the nearby bushes. You stop. You keep a look out and listen carefully. You suspect that some form of predator is watching you right now. After a minute of silence, you decide to move on. A few minutes later though, you hear footsteps rushing towards you from behind. You turn around, expecting to find a wild cat or wolf chasing you down. As your eyes lock on, you are shocked to see that this is no wild animal. It is a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man is running straight for you, rage in his eyes. A sharpened rock in his hand. He is completely nude, but doesn't seem to care. In the split seconds before you have to react, you notice that he is quite short, but it doesn't seem to matter when you look at his build. This man was built for survival, and he is coming to kill you. You turn and run, but the man is much faster than you and manages to catch up easily, pulling you to the ground. His pins you down and begins forcing his sharpened rock towards your chest. You resist, but he is too strong for you, if you don't do something quick, you will die. As the rock edges closer to your heart, you go for the weak spot. You drive your knee into the man's groin, forcing him backwards onto the ground, grasping his nutsack. You take the opportunity to flee further into the woods. You continue running until you can't run any further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you collapse onto the ground, gasping for air, you take one more look around you to make sure that you weren't being followed any more. Where you lay, you are surrounded by tall shrubbery, concealing your location. You decide to take advantage of your cover and get some rest. When you come to, you hear the sound of running water nearby. Feeling thirsty, you decide to go check it out. Maybe the water will be suitable to drink. You make you way through the woods slowly, being wary of your surroundings from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally locate the source of water. There is a small waterfall that runs into a spring at the bottom. You begin to head over to it, but stop when you see a human figure, kneeling at the edge of the spring. At first you think that you have stumbled across the man again, but after inspecting the figure more closely, you realise that it is actually a woman. Just like the man you came across earlier, she is completely nude. You can see that she has quite a muscular build to her, probably gained after years of survival in this harsh world. Despite her build, her breasts are a respectable size. In the present, you would take a guess that they were a C cup. She has a very natural beauty to her. There's something about her that seems to remind you of many girls you have met before.<br>\r\nYou watch her for a while as she soaks her blonde hair in the spring, then grabs a make-shift spear, made from a large stick and a sharpened rock. She sits with the spear, observing the water as she tries to catch fish. After a while, you try to move closer, but accidentally step on a twig, snapping it loudly. The woman stands and faces you, spear in hand, ready to attack. You put your hands up and exit your cover slowly, trying to insure her that you are not a threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you.\" You tell her. The woman gives you a confused expression, as she lowers her spear again. At first you thought that it was because she doesn't understand what you are saying, but you would soon find out that it was more than that. This woman has never seen a man before, In fact, she has never seen any other human before. She approaches you cautiously, not trusting you just yet. She reaches out with one hand and runs it across your face and down your chest, seeming amazed the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Matt.\" You tell her. She gives you that confused expression again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-A-T-T\" You repeat slowly, pointing a finger at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M..Ma....Maaatt?\" She repeats, trying to copy what you say. You nod your head. The woman then surprisingly, let out a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt! Matt Matt Matt! Haha! Maaaaatt!\" She repeated, somehow delighted by the sound of your name. You then decided to give her a name, assuming that she doesn't have one already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll call you Eve.\" You say. The woman listens carefully to what you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-V-E\" You say slowly, pointing at her this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeeeveee?\" She repeats, pointing at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Now say, M-Y N-A-M-E I-S E-V-E\" You instruct her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M..My...Naaame...Is....Eve?\" She repeats. As you nod, she starts dancing around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Eve! haha!

You have breasts. I don't.\" You tell her. Already realising that she won't understand, you begin to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHEST.\" you say, while running your hands across your chest. Eve copies your movements. \"C...Chest?\" She says, wanting you to confirm. \"Yes. Very good.\" You then slowly and carefully place your hands on Eve's breasts. \"BREASTS\" you say. You take your hands away and Eve cups her breasts in her hands. \"Brrrrrreasts?\" She says. \"Very good, Eve.\" You then place her hands on your chest. \"NO BREASTS. I have NO BREASTS. None.\" You try to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....No Breasts....I have no breasts.\" She says, copying what you said, even though it doesn't completely apply to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. YOU have breasts. I have NO breasts.\" You explain to her. She smiles at you as she begins to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoouuuu have nooo breasts.....I have breasts?\" She repeats. You nod at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve, now satisfied by what you have taught her about your chest compared to hers, moves onto your trousers. She once again starts tugging on them, the not as roughly as she was with your shirt. It seems more like she was just trying to get your attention this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Eve. I'll take them off.\" You unlatch your belt and drop your trousers down to your ankles, stepping out of them, before doing the same for your underwear. You are now standing completely naked, wearing nothing but your shoes. Eve seems even more confused this time, as she discovers that you now have something that she doesn't. Without warning, Eve takes a firm grasp on your penis, causing you to yelp slightly, as Eve starts tugging on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Eve, no! Please, let go!\" You tell her. Eve releases her grasp, but starts laughing at your reaction. He laughter soon comes to an end as she notices your penis growing. She looks you in the eye, as if waiting for your permission to touch it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead. Just be gentle this time.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve runs her hand over your shaft, before taking hold of it once again. The feeling sends shivers down your spine. You then watch as Eve uses her other hand to compare you to her vagina. As she continues to compare, you notice that her crotch appears to become more moist and her breathing is heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You realise, don't you? What it's for?\" You ask her. Eve looks you in the eyes again, only this time, there seems to be some sort of desire or lust in her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a MAN.\" You say \"You are a WO-MAN.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve points at you. \"Maaan?\" Then at herself \"Wooooman?\" You nod to confirm.</span></div></div>",

Her hands reaching up to her neck.  \"What's wrong Alice?\"  You ask with alarm, wondering if your abuse of powers had a greater effect than you had at first anticipated.<br>\r\n\"I fell funny all of the sudden.  My neck is ki-\"  her lips continue to move but no sound comes out, Alice noticing this as well and beginning to panic.  Suddenly a thin line becomes visible on her neck at the same spot you cut it, the line growing more defined with each passing moment. Soon enough her head uncermoniously topples forward, face planting into the table as her body remains paralysed in position, its hands locked in frozen horror at the unexpected loss of her head.<br>\r\nYou stare at Alice's neck, noticing that it looked like a perfect medical cross section of a human neck.  What's more no blood is comming out, the freezing effect of your time pausing still in effect.  Slowly you reach over and lift Alice's head upright to inspect it, tilting it upright as you did.<br>\r\nAlice's face was in an absolute panic, though seemed to be very much alive at least for the time being.  Her lips flapped frantically and still no words came out, probably because she had no lungs yet that didn't seem to stop her from dry heaving, throat expanding and contracting despite no air entering or exiting it.  \"Uh...\"  Was all you could say as tears streamed from Alice's eyes.  \"Hang on Alice, calm down okay?  By the looks of it you're not dead, and you're not even bleeding.  Does it hurt?\"  You inquire, trying to get as much informtion as possible.  You were a bit worried but you had time on your side, you had a literal eternity to find ways to fix this.<br>\r\nAlice thought for a moment before her neck made an odd motion, the lack of a body making it incomprehensible as a nod or a ahake, though the motions of her lips made a definite \"No.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm going to try and put your head back on your body, okay Alice?\"  You ask rhetorically, already bringing her head over her stump.  You set it down squarely, lining up the cut surface perfectly and...</span></div></div>",

You quickly grab it before it falls and hold it in position, Alice quickly moving one hand to the top of her scalp and pushing down to hold herself in place.  She didn't speak this time, trying to move as little as possible save for her free hand which she flexed ever so slowly to check that she still had control of herself.  Puzzling, while her head was attached she could do anything she normally could but once it came off her body went into a numb immobilized state without connection to the brain yet her head could still live without being attached to any of the vital organs in the body.  Very odd indeed.<br>\r\nSeeing that Alice was beginning to grow impatient and panicked you stood up and removed your leather belt, wrapping it around her neck before cinching it as tightly as you could before sitting down again.  \"Alright, this is only temporary until we can find a more permanent solution but at least you'll be able to move around a bit.  How do you feel?\"<br>\r\nAlice stared at you in a dumbfounded glare before angrily snapping \"How do I feel?  MY FREAKING HEAD IS FALLING OFF!  NOT WELL!\"<br>\r\n\"Well yeah I guessed that much but I mean physically.  any pain?  Any numbness or soreness?\"  You clarified with a roll of your eyes.<br>\r\n\"I... not really.  I feel fine right now, no real difference apart from the throbbing bump on my head but when I fell off I couldn't feel my body any more, only my head.  It was really scary.  Look I'm sorry I snapped at you, it's just that getting decapitated is a little nerve racking.\"  She said with a light and hollow laugh, her left hand feeling the belt around her neck.<br>\r\n\"I bet.  This whole thing must be making you light headed.\"  You joked, to which Alice responded with a well deserved hard punch to the arm.<br>\r\nAlice was about to respond when she stopped, eyes narrowing.  She stared at you very deeply and very harshly, boring her pupils deeply into yours and eventually forcing your eyes to the floor when you couldn't match her accusatory gaze any longer.  \"Say, you don't seem all that surprised that all of the sudden I'm a Marie Antoinette cosplay.  Tell me, you wouldn't happen to know anything about this my dear friend, would you?\"  She inquired.  Before you could come up with a reply you felt Alice's foot press against your crotch firmly, eliciting some discomfort but hinting at a hell of a lot of pain in the near future if you played your cards wrong.  How do you respond?</span></div></div>",

As you look at Alice; your hand still resting on her face, you see that her face is dimly glowing a light shade of blue. The blue glow is also pulsing through your arm. This continues for a little while until the glow fades away. As you remove your hand from Alice's face, you notice that it looks different from what it usually does. It looks more feminine. You then notice that your body feels strange, and your clothes fit differently.<br>\r\nAs you look down at your body, you are shocked and surprised by what you find. You now have the body of a girl and your clothes have changed. Despite having just turned into a girl, you couldn't help but recognise your new body. Your new clothes also seem to match what Alice is currently wearing. You get up and head to the bathroom to look in the mirror. It is then that you discover Alice's face staring back at you in the mirror. You have somehow uncovered a new power that has turned your body into an exact copy of Alice. As you eye up your cleavage, you begin to imagine Alice in some sexy clothing.<br>\r\nAs soon as you let your imagination run wild, you see the blue glow cover your body once again, although this time there is no tingling sensation. Only parts of your body are covered by the glow. As it fades once more, it turns out that it was actually your clothes that were glowing, since your outfit is now completely different. You are now wearing a green two-piece bikini that really shows off your, or rather, Alice's body. As you look in the mirror, you also notice that your hair is now tied back into a ponytail, revealing that you are also wearing a pair of heart-shaped earrings.<br>\r\nYou stare at the mirror in amazement. You had always found Alice attractive, but you have never seen her like this before. Only in your imagination has she ever appeared like this, and now it is a reality.

You take one last look at your current form, taking in an eyeful of cleavage as you do so, then focus on changing back. You cross your legs on the couch, rest your hands in your lap and close your eyes. As you continue to concentrate, you feel the tingling throughout your body again as whatever power you now possess comes into effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the tingling finally stops you open your eyes again, immediately sensing the changes you've made. As you down at your body again, you see that you are flat chested once again. Your green bikini is now gone, having been replaced with your original combo of jeans and a longsleeve tshirt. You decide to make sure that everything was definitely back to normal by racing over to the mirror. To your relief, your own familiar face is staring back at you. You then raise your shirt to confirm that your definitely male chest had returned also, then checked in between your legs for good measure. Everything was back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with your changes, you return to Alice and resume time. Almost immediately Alice begins chatting away to you about the latest gossip. As much as you would like to stick around and listen to what she has to say, you would much rather toy around with your new powers. You start thinking of an excuse to leave, but soon stop yourself when you remember that you can just manipulate time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of this, you abruptly get up and leave Alice's house, ignoring her concern about where you were going and why you weren't answering her questions. It didn't matter anymore. Once you were a far enough distance away from Alice's home, you focused on reversing time, feeling the sensation of wind rushing past you. Once it was over, you checked you watch and saw that you had successfully gone back an hour to just before you make the phonecall to Alice.<br>\r\nYou decide that your next plan of action is to show off your powers to your friend David. He had always been interested in sci-fi and fantasy, so you figured that he would appreciate your new powers. You give him a call, asking him if he wants to hang out. He tells you that he is home at the moment and that you are welcome to come over. You accept his offer and start walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpatient to try out your powers again, you decide to spice things up on the way to David's house. You look up pictures of bikini models on your phone until you find one that you like; a tanned woman with dark hair and a well toned abdomen , wearing a black bikini top with yellow bottoms. Focusing on the picture, you feel your body beginning to change. Minutes later, the tingling stops and you notice long dark hair drop in front of your face. Looking down, you discover that your body is now an exact copy of the woman in the picture and you were wearing the same bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue walking, you draw lots of attention to yourself. Some were stunned by your beauty while some were confused by your choice of outfit, as it isn't exactly summer and you are nowhere near any beaches. You liked the attention and you enjoyed the feeling of this body even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get closer to David's house, you decide that you've had your fun and change back to your original self before knocking the door. David soon answers the door and invites you inside. You both sit down on David's couch. He was in the middle of playing a video game when you arrived and resumed playing as you explained to him what a crazy day you've had. He doesn't seem to believe you and continues playing his game. You are determined to convince him and come up with a plan to prove that you can control time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start by watching what happens in his game the rewinding time and predicting what will happen to him. This still doesn't seem to phase him as he believes you must have played the game before. Next you trying changing the channel on his TV and watching what happens on the news then predicting it to him after rewinding. He isn't convinced by this, but seems a little confused by how you managed to predict live television. Lastly, David gets a phonecall from his girlfriend. You make him tell you what she was calling him for, then use it to your advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rewind one last time and tell David that his girlfriend is about to call him to cancel their plans for tomorrow because she has to go visit her grandmother in the hospital. At first he finds your prediction absurd, but soon everything you predicted comes true and by the end David is left speechless. Now fully convinced that you do possess time manipulating powers, he starts asking you lots of questions about how you got them and what you have done so far with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than answering his questions, you decide to reveal your other powers to him. You start off by slowly turning invisible in front of him. He becomes very confused and starts calling out your name. You answer to confirm that you were still there. Realising what you just did, David becomes very excited and wants to see more. You decide to throw in a surprise for him. You feel your body tingling once again as it begins to change. When it over, you can feel that your body is different, but can't see it yet since you are still invisible. You ask David if he is ready for what you are about to show him, now speaking in a distinctly female voice that is familiar to David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly turn yourself visible again, revealing the changes you have made to yourself. David's eyes grow wide as he sees that you have taken on the form of a short Asian woman in a silver dress. Your hair is tied back, with a fringe that stops just above your eyes and two long strands that hang down either side. David recognises your new form as his Japanese/American girlfriend, Suzuki.</span></div></div>",

At first he was sure that you were the real Suzuki that was here to surprise him, but after studying your movements for a few minutes he soon accepts that it really is you standing in front of him as a copy of his girlfriend. He walks around you, complementing you on how well you have taken on Suzuki's image. He seems especially surprised by how accurate the jewellery that you are wearing is to the ones that Suzuki owns. David also recognises your dress from a wedding that you had all recently attended together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid asks you how it feels to be an exact copy of Suzuki. You try to explain to him how different it feels being a woman compared to a man. You talk about the weight of having breasts and the sensation of having a vagina in place of a penis. You then mention how strange it feels to wear a dress and heels and how odd it feels to wear earrings and the sensation of having pieces of jewellery piercing and hanging from your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, David then asks if he can touch you, visibly blushing as he does so. Seeing as you have currently taken on the form of his girlfriend, you decide to let him. It's only fair. David then approaches you and starts fondling your breasts with both hands. It was an odd sensation for you, but a welcome one. You just continue to stand there as David runs his hands over your body. He then lowers the straps of your dress, pulling it down to expose your breasts for the first time. As he continues fondling them, David comments on how they look exactly like Suzuki's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid then lowers one hand to your crotch and begins rubbing through the fabric off your dress. Unfamiliar with these sensations, you begin to moan. The experience is short lived though as David stops and takes a step back from you. You ask him what is wrong. He then confesses that he has weirded himself out. Even though you look exactly like his girlfriend, the thought of his best friend inhabiting that body as he played with it put him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can understand how he feels. From your perspective it did feel weird that your male best friend was feeling you up and pleasuring you. David continues explaining how ashamed he feels after touching you. He tells you that even though you look like his girlfriend, you still move and talk differently from her and that it became obvious that you weren't the real Suzuki. He then asks you to change back as he finds it uncomfortable to look at you anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you think more deeply about what David said and how he feels, you notice a tingling sensation stirring inside your head. Feeling dazed, you fall backwards onto the couch, clutching the side of your head as you do so. David grows concerned and asks if you are okay. You don't answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the tingling fades away. You look down at yourself, but don't notice any changes to your body. In fact you don't notice any changes at all. You stand up again, sorting the bottom of your dress as you straighten up. Realising that your breasts are still exposed, you turn away from David and fix your straps again before turning back to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid asks again if you are okay, and comments on how you are acting strange. You tell him that you don't know what he is talking about as you fix a strand of hair that had fallen out of place. David then comments on how you are now speaking in a more feminine tone now. You don't understand what he means, as you've always talked this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, as David takes a step closer to you, placing his hand on your shoulder, you feel you heart begin to race. You can't understand why you are so flustered by David's presence. As you look up at him, you find yourself unable to draw your attention away from his eyes. As you continue to stare deeply, David has his own revelation on what is happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid notes how you became light-headed and collapsed onto the couch, the started acting more feminine immediately after recovering. As the two of you stare into each other's each, David realises that not only does your body now match Suzuki's, but your personality does too. Whatever happened before has somehow changed your personality to match that of your current body, but oddly enough, you don't notice it yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to act on the new urges that you are feeling, you lean in and kiss David. He doesn't resist and instead returns the kiss. Things only escalate from there as you tear away each other's clothes before moving over to the couch. As David mounts you, a variety of new sensations rush through your body, yet they feel oddly familiar somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour passes before the two of you finally reach your climax, collapsing onto the floor next to each other exhausted. David accidentally calls you Suzuki for a moment before correcting himself. He admits that he forgot you aren't really her. He tells you how he thinks that your personality has changed somehow and how he thinks that you haven't noticed. He was right, you hadn't noticed any changes until he pointed them out. As he does so, the tingling returns and before long your original personality came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise how strange everything you just did was. Hell, you just had sex with your best friend while posing as his girlfriend. Yet in the moment, it didn't feel strange at all. It seems that your list of powers just keeps on growing...</span></div></div>",

That and the fact he might think the two of you were twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can tansform into my girlfriend, what else can you do?\" David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do more than turn into Suzuki like I can turn into Alice.

It may take some time but you could do it. You then relaxed with this and felt soemthing happening. Looking back in the mirror, the girl in it changed from a Japanese girl to the way you were. It was nice to be back to normal again but wont be normal with your abilities.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Staring at your reflection in the mirror, you weren't sure whether you were going through a philosophical epiphany or an existential meltdown.  It would seem your powers weren't quite as controllable as you'd originally thought.  Changing into someone else didn't just alter your appearance, as you'd hoped, but your mind as well.  You took on their personality, quirks, disposition, and apparently their sexual orientation too.  Maybe it was all the female hormones coursing through your female brain.  Maybe it was a side effect of your powers, changing parts of you that you hadn't intended.  Either way, you'd just fucked your male best friend while pretending to be his girlfriend and now you'd have to live with that for the rest of your life, which may or may not last forever if you can just keep morphing into younger versions of yourself and<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eureka!\"  You shout, shooting to your feet.  All thought of your encounters with David were pushed to the back of your mind as the idea of morphing induced immortality filled your thoughts.  So far you'd only tried changing into different people as they were now, but would it be possible to change into a past version of someone?  You just had to know!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried that changing into yourself prior to you getting your time powers would somehow remove your powers, and not seeing any way to tell the you from a few hours ago apart from the you that was you now, you look around the room for inspiration.  Seeing a pair of nail clippers lying on your desk, the idea comes to you.  Taking up the clippers you find the fingernail most in need of a good trim and see that your left thumb could do with some shortening.  Sheering off the white edge of your thumbnail, you toss the clippers aside and begin concentrating.  If you're right, you should be able to morph yourself into yourself from just before you'd clipped your nail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not right.  The blue light which should have surrounded you was... different.  It wasn't the same shade.  It wasn't quite purple but it was now closer to purple than it was to blue.  You didn't have time to wonder whether or not you should stop, because the power stopped itself for you.  The purple light exploded around you, throwing you backwards onto your bed and shattering the mirror across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\"  You said.  Or, rather, your voice said it.  You didn't actually say anything, as your landing was pretty soft and you were too stunned to cry out.  Blinking twice, you are stunned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying in a heap across the room, surrounded by a small minefield of broken glass, was you, or a dead ringer for you.  \"Shit!\"  He (or you) hissed, inspecting his bloody palm.  \"Gonna need to disinfect that.\"  He bitterly remarked, pulling one of the bigger glass splinters out.  Looking at his fingers he commented \"And the nail is still clipped.  Shit, looks like I can't change my own age in relation to the time I exist in.  Maybe if I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally noticed you, sprawled across your bed and staring at him.  \"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is such bullshit.\"  Your doppelganger complains, flinching as you dab at his wounds with antiseptic.  \"So not only am I not going to live forever, but now I don't even have any powers?  I'm just a shittier copy of you now!  Or, a shittier version of myself now!  Or... WHATEVER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, shrugging as you wrapped some gauze around his palm.  Your clone had been throwing a hissy fit for the last hour, ever since the two of you had tried to use your powers again and found that while you could still morph, turn invisible, and time travel, he had no powers whatsoever.  Apart from super-human whining, as it turns out.  You hadn't tried testing out whether or not you could still clone, two of you frankly felt like one too many, but after learning of the loss of his (your) other three powers your clone had either already tried and failed without you realizing it, or he was afraid that if he came out as a worse copy of you, his clone would come out as a worse copy of him and he didn't want to subject anyone to that level of existential depression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fair!\"  He said as you completed the bandage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I ever say it was?\"  You snap, frustrated.  You wanted to ask him if he wanted you to rewind to before he existed so that he could not exist, but you knew that that would be too harsh.  You knew exactly where to draw the line, because you knew yourself exactly.  You also knew that it wouldn't work, because you'd secretly tried that without telling him.  Every time, he would just explode into existence exactly where you had been standing at exactly the time you'd tried to reverse age yourself, with all of your memories up to that point.  You're also pretty sure that even without telling him he knew that you'd tried to erase him, because he thought exactly like you and you'd thought of that within ten minutes.  You suppose he was handling all of this pretty well, all things considering, and you were a bit impressed with yourself.  \"Look, I'm sorry I m... I'm sorry, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed.  \"It's okay, I know I didn't... you didn't mean to.  It just sucks, you know?  Having all those cool powers then getting them all taken away, just to see yourself stealing them all.  Well, not stealing, but... you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure I do.\"  You say, the two of you chuckling a little at your bad joke.  \"Look, if it makes you feel any better, we can share this power!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Share?\"  Your clone asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  We both think exactly the same, right?  So anything you would want to do, I would also want to do, and anything I would want to do you would also want to do.  So if we stick together-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it'll be like we're both using our powers.\"  He said, completing your sentence exactly as you had it in your head.  \"So if I ask you to do something-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then of course I'll do it, because I wanted to do it as well!\"  You say, completing the sentence exactly as he'd thought it.  \"So, what do you want me to do?\"  You ask.  Thinking about what you'd want you to do in this scenario, you-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to turn into Alice.\"  He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... w-what?\"  You stammer.  You'd thought you'd want to use your time powers to go and play a prank on your older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to turn into Alice.\"  He repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would've asked him to explain why he wanted that, but you already knew.  You'd transformed into three different women today, and each time you'd enjoyed the experience more and more.  Getting fucked by David was hands down the best sex you'd ever had, but was it just a novelty?  Did you actually enjoy being a woman more than you enjoyed being a man, or were you just caught up in the hype of trying something new?  You were curious, and by extension, he was curious.  You'd wanted to try this out a little bit later down the line, but it would seem that while you and your clone had the same thought patterns, the two of you didn't think in perfect sync.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would've argued with yourself, but you knew it would be futile.  You knew he'd win you over, because you knew that you'd win him over if he were the original and you the clone.  Because you were curious and you both knew it.  \"Alright then, my wish is your command!\"  You say, concentrating on your body.  With a familiar tingle and a wave of blue light, you are now Alice.  And not just Alice, but an Alice perfectly styled to your own tastes.  You are dressed in...</span></div></div>",
