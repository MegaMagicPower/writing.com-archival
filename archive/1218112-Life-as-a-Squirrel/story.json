The squirrel went over to inspect the space rock and unknowingly absorbed some of its gamma rays, thus becoming a RADIOACTIVE SQUIRREL! Dun dun duuuuun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day you are out taking a walk in the park, enjoying your peaceful surroundings, and as you pass a certain tree...you get attacked by the RADIOACTIVE SQUIRREL! The squirrel leaps out and bites your shoulder, and then scampers back up into the tree. \"What was that all about?!\" you ask yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we continue the story, however, you will need to determine your gender.</span></div></div>",

First thing tommorrow, you should go to the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk home, and you're right outside your house, when everything gets strange. You start spinning, and you feel an unbearable pain. You lay down on the grass and close your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, you open your eyes to find everything looking pretty normal, and you're actually feeling pretty good again. You stand up, and start walking back to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where is became strange. The house was huge, and you couldn't even open the door. You sit down, and think that you might have shrunk somehow. You look down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How down I turn into a squirrel???\" You say to yourself, but it comes out as a squeak. You don't know what is going on, but the sun is going down, and you have to find a way inside.</span></div></div>",

All you had to do was climb... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I climb a tree when I'm so small?\" You say to yourself. And then it hits you. Another squirrel quickly scurries up the tree without grabbing branches or anything. Squirrels can climb trees!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run over, accidentilly stumbling over. Instead of getting up, you keep running, much faster, and more easilly at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're at the base of the tree, you look up. It seemed so big now. You always climbed it when you were younger, but this was so different. You stick your newfound paw on the tree, and much to your surprise, it firmly sticks there. With a hopeful leap, you get all four paws on, and start to climb upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to the branch, you realize how easy it was. It was almost the same as walking, but verticly. As you step onto the branch, your first fear is losing your ballance, but no such thing happens. It's like you knew how to walk a tight rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the branch, you slowly look down. It was a long drop. If you fell, it would surely be the end of not only your Life as a Squirrel, but your whole life at that...</span></div></div>",

When you fall face first onto a pink pillow by the window, you jump with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! A Squirrel!\" Says a loud female voice. You look up, and see your little sister standing tall over you. You panic as she grabs you with both hands. \"You're so pretty!\" She says, pulling on your tail. It hurts, and now you can actually feel it. It felt so natural that you never noticed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so, she shoves you in a cage with her hampster, and locks it, leaving the room.</span></div></div>",
