A golden bow he took from a lone archer in the woods. A impressive looking dagger from a merchant he had \"visited\" a few days ago. And there was his newest item. A strange wand he stole from the nearby church. It was listed as forbidden. Of course that just made Matthew have to have it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long slender stick was carved with figures and words that Matthew didn't understand. He doubted he could use it. It would be up to a sage or a priest/valkyrie to get this thing going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't mean the staff wasn't valuable, and Matthew would most definitely make a pretty hefty amount selling it, perhaps even to someone in the party. Matthew bet a lot of people would want this rare item. Of course he would not say it was stolen - instead that it was a gift from the church for being loyal and kind [nobody would really buy that but at least no one would decline either].<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, why let such an item go into the hands of another? Who knew what this miracle item could do for Matthew? Maybe it'll improve his speed, strengthen his low health or even provide him with a skill he'd never thought existed. But in order to do that of course he would have to find a cleric or a mage and let them activate the staff on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do to? Matthew picked up at the staff from the stash and looked at it more closely. It felt to fine and light, he was almost jealous that he couldn't use it.</span></div></div>",

He'd have to avoid the clergy though. Serra and Renault might recognize the staff's origin. Eventually he settled for Erk, the purple haired mage. Matthew would have to offer him something in return for helping him and grabbed a few gold coins from his pouch before heading off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments after the thief was showing the staff to Erk who viewed it with suspicious eyes. \"Are you sure you found this staff lying in the woods? It looks pretty valuable, I doubt anyone would just lose it like that.\" Erk waved the weapon around to get a feel on how it gripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah of course! Now do you want the gold or not?\" Matthew tapped his foot impatiently. He was both curious and excited to see what his stole-er found artifact could do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but I'm not liable for any damages...\" Erk sounded doubtful but began drawing from the magic within the staff. A white light glowed and quickly surrounded the two, blinding Matthew. \"Hey Erk you're sure you're doing this right?\" He shouted with his eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well I think so anyway!\" Erk shouted back. His hand couldn't let go just yet but the light had blinded him as well. The magic felt strange but not unpleasant and he could feel it targeting Matthew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes the light faded. Erk cough and opened his eyes, waiting to see the results of his actions.</span></div></div>",

He should have known that the most famous lance seller wouldn't be able to be haggled with easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you want to be a fine cavalier or paladin one day you'll most definitely need a good killer lance.\" The traveling merchant was talking again. \"All the famous ones did anyway. I even sold a nice one to your friend the other day. A real good killer lance too, the head was dipped in the most vile of poisons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"friend\" that the man was talking about was Sain. Kent had been astonished when his companion brought back the fine weapon, grinning from ear to ear. Somehow Sain's people skills and high charisma had worked on the merchant ; he had sold it to him for a merely 100 coins. And yet here Kent was being offered a deal of 5000 coins, enough gold to buy himself a promotional crest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look sir.\" Kent was polite but it had been clear for the past hour or so, his people skills were not very exceptional. \"I really believe you can offer a much better price.\" He cringed at himself once again begging the old man to lower his prices to at least 2000 coins (that was all he was able to take - the party was low on fighters and weaponry and there had been few rewards from villages in the past few weeks).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe merchant sighed, for he too was tired of all this haggling and arguing over something so casual. \"Tell you what young man. You like a promising paladin. I will give the weapon as a gift to you, for free.\" Kent could hardly believe his ears. He was about to utter a thank you when he was interrupted. \"Now don't go getting all happy and such. There is a catch. I will donate the fine weapon to you if you can take this off my hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe merchant took out a small triangular bottle with purple liquid inside. The cap was a green cork held onto the bottle by a black ribbon. \"Now this thing was given to me by a druid to the north. However it vexes me so. I despise the presence of it in my shop. Please, if you are willing to take this accursed potion off my hands, I will gladly give you the item.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent frowned a bit. \"Is the drink poisonous?\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man shook his head, \"Oh no no. The druid promised me the potion does no harm to anyone. However I dislike magical items very much. but still the potion has brought me much curiosity. If you drink the potion I will not only give you the lance but also a bonus of 5000 coins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent was chocked. The lance AND 5000 coins. That would have filled the group treasury high. It would make Sain jealous when he realized Kent had achieved so much over at the lance seller's. This was an offer he could not refuse. \"I'll do it!\" Was the eager reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe merchant's face lite up. \"Good good! Here you go!\" He held out the potion towards the young man, not wanting it in his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent slowly accepted the item but was not hesitant to pop off the cork and allow the sweet liquid to pour into his mouth and stomach. Smiling Kent then held up the empty bottle. \"Tada! Now if you will allow me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe merchant waved his hand. \"Go ahead.\" and Kent raced forward and accepted his reward. He almost ran back to camp. Wait till the others see this!</span></div></div>",

He didn't want to seem too eager when he entered the tent, but it was hard not to start running. After all, although Kent was the more hardworking one, he was never the \"sociable\", so when things worked his way in that area, he was very eager to show off his skills to Sain as a way of saying \"Hey look. You're not the only one with a nice smile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the height of all the excitement, Kent felt a strange feeling. It was like a dark magic had overtaken him, cursed him. Glancing down at his fingertips, Kent could clearly see black sparks shooting from them. Stopping in his tracks he observed the seemingly magical sparks. Had he somehow gotten the power to cast magical spells? Was this because of the potion? Yes! Kent grinned. Not only had he succeeded in getting a fine weapon for free but also now was able to cast magical spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what they did, Kent decided to test his new profound skills out. Aiming at a nearby bush, Kent let go a surge of power aimed directly at it. A black aurora surrounded the thing and within a few moments, it had been reduced to 1/50 of it's original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent stood there shocked. Wow. Was this what his powers allowed him? To ability to shrink things? Wild ideas began to fill the young knight's mind. Would this spell work on humans? The idea of a tiny Sain or another general forced to do to his will amused Kent. But there was a lot more things he could do with his new found powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He dreamt that he was shrinking and everything around him was growing to gigantic proportions, his weapons, the group's collection of mage scrolls. His friends were standing around him, astounded at what they were observing. Kent watched as he became smaller and smaller passing his friend's waists, knees and finally standing tiny in front of a large pair of boots. He looked up (way up) into the face of his friend Sain. He was grinning and smirking at the tiny Kent. \"Oh look! What do we have here? A tiny useless bug perhaps? Kent always did say bugs deserved to be crushed, so I suppose I'd better..\" Kent's face paled and shook his head. \"Hey hey!\" He attempted shouting at his gigantic friend but was shocked to find his voice tiny and unheard by everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha. This'll be fun.\" Sain lifted his foot up in the air above Kent's tiny body. Kent, too scared too move stood frozen as he looked up at the bottom of his former friend's boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen slowly the shoe lowered, darkening the area around Kent with a large foot-shaped shadow. Down and down it came, until it was right above the shrunken knight. He could have even reached up and touched...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent sat up, gasping. It was morning. Everything had just been a bad nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing his eyes, Kent took a good look around. Wait. Was he still in his dream? Why did everything look so small? Panicking, Kent stood up on his bed, peering around and the edges of the bed, which was far far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the door to the room was pushed open. \"Hey Kent! Lord Eliwood wants us up and early today for...woah. What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent turned to face the giant intruder. Even in his shock he could tell that it was  . . .</span></div></div>",

If anyone could help him, it would be the person that had been with him for the past few years. Frantically he jumped up and down, waving his arms while making sure he didn't fall to his death several feet below (the clothes he had worn to bed were sliding all over the place on the sheets).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down. I see you.\" Sain waved his hand as he walked over to the bed and keeled down beside it to get a better look at the tiny shrunken Kent who sat down and looked back up at the giant face that belonged to the famous green knight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Sain who began the conversation. \"So, do I need to ask why you've been shrunk to such a tiny size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what happened Sain, we need to get me to a cleric or a healer right away! Maybe then can counteract-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down Kent!\" Sain frowned at the tiny orange knight. \"We need to take it once step at a time. How about this. I take you to go see Lucias when he's awake. But first I need to report to Lord Eliwood. He wanted to show us the new hero crests he obtained. It's not important for us, but I still should go see him ok?\" Sain stood up, his figure becoming a blur for a few seconds to Kent. \"Now don't go anywhere...*snicker* as if you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent looked up at the grinning face of Sain. \"This isn't funny you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the contrary, I think it is.\" Sain winked before turning back and heading out the doors leaving Kent alone on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed before Kent heard noise outside his room. The sound of footsteps approaching. Maybe Sain was back. Kent had been sitting here this whole time, unsure of what to do. He couldn't get his weapons, now that they were several times bigger than himself and he definitely couldn't put on his bright orange armor anymore. He would have to stick with the shirt and pants that he always wore to sleep instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the door swung open.

Seeing Kent so small and powerless made Sain feel wonderful, and he wasn't about to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing Kent got up and began pacing around the bed. \"Okay well there's always Lucias right? Oh wait..he's probably with Lord Eliwood as well. I hear he's taken quite a interest in promotion items too.\" Kent stood still and closed his eyes. Was there nobody available to help him? Someone who was not busy? He didn't want to make someone go out of their way just to sort out a little problem like this (pardon the pun).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may suggest..\" Sain interrupted Kent's train of thought. \"Why don't I take you back to my room and have a look through some of the army's scrolls? Erk the mage has been dumping quite a bit of his extra tomes in my chambers and maybe one of them is the cure to all this..\" Sain gestured to Kent's tiny size and was unable to hold back a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not funny Sain.\" Kent spoke with a serious tone while looking up at the giant face of his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes it is.\" Sain replied with a snicker. \"Why you're so small I could do anything with you.

He could see the bottom of Sain's boot. They were longer than his whole body. If it was lowered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSain smirked. He wasn't really going to do this.

Eliwood came to on the ground, staring up at Erk peering over him. It took him a second to fully grasp what just happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" He made out before being helped to his feet. \"I apologize.\" He spoke, realizing how reckless he was being. Erk shook his furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The blame is all mine. I should've warned you before showing you.\" Erk insisted. \"You may want to lay down in your tent; there could be some nasty side effects.\" Eliwood nodded slowly, now worried by the warning. \"Would you like me to escort you back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't be necessary.\" Eliwood replied quickly, \"If I may ask, could you inform Marcus of the incident? He should know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my lord.\" Erk nodded and hurried out of the training tent. Eliwood himself left quickly as well and began across the temporary base. Along the way his body began to feel a bit sore and it seemed like his pace was gradually slowing. He simply shrugged off the circumstances as a result of Erk's spell thinking that it was messing with his senses. He didn't realize anything was wrong until he bumped into the group's pirate, Dart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch where you're goin--!\" Dart growled before realizing he was speaking with the leader of their army. \"Ah, my bad.\" He muttered awkwardly, not used to be in the presence of royalty. \"Say, you don't look to well...\" Eliwood glanced up the large pirate in front of him. He did a double take when he realized that the pirate now stood slightly taller than he last recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was just heading back to my tent...\" Eliwood replied feeling a bit dazed. \"If you would kindly excuse me.\" Eliwood brushed around him quickly with a new realization. There's no way Dart had grown a few inches within the last day...and it would explain why it seemed like he wasn't walking as fast. It only took another minute for him to enter his own tent and sit down on the makeshift bed. With the present fear of shrinking upon him, Eliwood found it difficult to sleep or not worry.</span></div></div>",

What would become of him now? The pirate had been sent here by his own captain in hopes he would be of use to the army. He couldn't let his captain down by being deported back to the ship for misbehavior. As the representative of the ship, Dart had to leave a good impression on Eliwood. Too many people believed that all pirates were horrible village ransacking thieves, and Dart wanted to change that view. Not to mention traveling with Eliwood meant seeing things on land he'd never be able to see on a boat, and to partake in battles that could one day become historic. No, he couldn't risk it. He had to go apologize. Too much was at stake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving his tent, Dart began hurriedly walking towards Elwood's tent. On his way there he was stopped by a worried looking Lyn, who asked him if anything was wrong. Managing a straight face the pirate replied with, \"Everything is fine ma'am\" before brushing the blade lord aside and continuing on his way. He had to go fast-Eliwood was probably heading to bed early today, especially since he didn't look so well earlier. It could have been a sickness, or something even worse. Hopefully it was neither and Dart would catch the young lord before he went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the pirate slowly peeked into Eliwood's tent, he was surprised by what he found. Or rather, what he didn't find. Eliwood's tent looked completely empty. There was a light on the far side from a burning candle but the Lord's bed looked empty. There was a rough looking sheet on it, but there was no bump underneath it. Where had Eliwood gone? Dart was sure he saw the young lord come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping quietly into the tent, Dart took another good look around. It was then he noticed something strange underneath the covers. There was a shape there, but it was too small to have been noticeable from where he was before. It was too small to be a person, in fact it looked like Eliwood had stuffed an small dagger in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDart began to worry. If there was a dagger in there, then someone was out to get Eliwood. Rushing over to the bed the pirate flung the sheets off, expecting to see the shiny metal object. What he saw instead however made his jaw drop right open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath the sheet was the tiny shrunken figure of Lord Eliwood, laying on his side, sleeping away as if nothing had happened. Dart couldn't do anything but stare. Was he dreaming? How did this happen? And most importantly, what was the pirate going to do now?</span></div></div>",

Eliwood was very still but Dart thought he could make out tiny snoring sounds. A low giggle escaped his throat. Oh boy, he was going to have a lot of fun, whether Eliwood wanted it or not. Even if the Lord was to awake during all this...well Dart couldn't stop know. He had made up his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was, what kind of fun was Dart looking for?</span></div></div>",

Eliwood was usually a very powerful, commanding Lord and often Dart viewed himself as inferior to the other man. However now Eliwood was barely the size of his palm, weak, insignificant, inferior. Dart felt powerful, being a giant compared to Eliwood's size. The feeling of power, the rush he was getting from just watching Eliwood was slowly turning him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon a visible bulge formed in the pirate's pants and Dart felt himself constricted. He didn't want to reach out for Eliwood, no that might make the tiny Lord up but his hard erection was making holding back difficult. One hand went down and began to rub at his cock through the fabric of his pants, feeling himself grow harder every second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a daring moment Dart inched forward, hovering over Eliwood so that his crotch was near the tiny Lord. His own erection was pressing hard against his pants and was already the size of Eliwood. Dart knew that if he set his monster free, it would easily be bigger than the tiny commander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis muscular arm continued to stroke himself from outside and Dart began to instinctively thrust into his hand, his length wanting to be set free. If the pirate kept this up, pretty soon he was going to have to find a way to release himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in his mind told him that this was wrong, but Dart's young hormones made him unable to control himself. Taking a deep breath the pirate knew he had to make a decision fast, or risk waking the shruken Eliwood. </span></div></div>",

Seeing Eliwood at this size, and the fact that his own dick was bigger than him was turning the pirate crazy horny. Clumsily he fumbled with his pants, tugging them downwards until his erection popped out, a hard 6 inches. Dart quickly inched forward, until his dick was only inches away from Eliwood's tiny body. The shrunken Lord was still blissfully aware of that was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly the pirate grabbed his length with both hands and began to stroke, biting down on his lips to keep from moaning. He couldn't risk Eliwood waking up before he was done. Buckling his hips Dart began to jerk himself, aiming the tip of his penis right at Eliwood's tiny body. Precum began to drip out and the muscular pirate used that as lube, stroking himself. His eyes were closed and in his mind he imagined himself with tiny Eliwood on his dick while he laughed at his power over the shrunken commander. The thought drove him mad with power and Dart began to furiously pump himself, making little grunts as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon his pace quickened and the pirate prepared himself, forcing his eyes open to aim directly at Eliwood's tiny body. Then with a sudden loud yell and one final thrust, Dart came, streams of white cum spraying out onto the bed, hitting Eliwood and soaking him completely. Dart felt his knees began to weaken but he didn't stop stroking himself as more and more cum came flying out. Gasps and moans quickly followed as the pirate thrust himself at Eliwood's body, milking himself for every last bit of cum. The white stuff leaked over his hands and covered the area of the bed completely, creating almost a puddle of semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud gasp, Dart fell backwards, exhausted from the amazing orgasm he just had. Trying hard to catch his breath, the pirate was completely drained. Never before had he come so much, and this time it was all over Eliwood's tiny, sleeping body. Dart pulled himself up and got on his knees, dragging himself over to the bed. Glancing down he looked at the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cum had landed everywhere, soaking the pillow and leaving streams of creamy vanilla like substance all over the bedsheets. However what he was really looking for was Eliwood's tiny, cum coated body.</span></div></div>",

As much as he respected his commander, he never felt that close to the man and often avoided him in combat, fearing that Eliwood would be able to see through his mask and into his past. Today however, the meeting was unavoidable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliwood's tent was quiet and rather dark, leading Geitz to believe the Lord had fallen asleep. A small, rather childish shaped lump underneath the covers on the makeshift bed confirmed this. The warrior was rather relieved and quickly tossed the note on a small wooden table nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was about to exit the tent however, Geitz noticed something strange. The lump on the bed seemed different, smaller than what it had been when he had come in. Curious, he made his way over to the bed and examined it. He was sure he could make out a lump of Eliwood's red hair coming out from under the covers. Something told him that things were out of the norm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding his breath the warrior pulled the sheets. What he found was shocking.

Normally the two kinds had distinct differences, but these were almost identical. In fact the only thing separating them  was that the one of the left had a moon carving onto it's wooden handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give up yet?\" The cheeky thief Matthew was practically grinning from ear to ear as he looked at the crease in Wil's forehead. \"You know, if you keep frowning like that it's going to become permanent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWil frowned even more, and he ignored the babbling thief. Oh why had he agreed to take this challenge anyway? Oh ya, it was because he thought every bow of it's own kind looked the same. Boy what a fool he had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guess! Which one is the killer? Don't forget,\" Matthew smiled innocently as he began to recite the rules of the guess which bow is which game he had slyly asked the archer to play. \"If you guess right, I will gladly hand over 10000 coins as a reward AND you can keep the bows. However if you guess wrong..\" Matthew put on a silly \"evil\" expression, \"You're in for a punishment of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWil sighed as he listened to Matthew talk. It was obvious the sneaky little thief had tricked him and set out identical bows. The best chance he had was to guess. At least there was a 50/50 chance..as long as Matthew kept his promises anyway. And so what if Wil guessed wrong. How bad could a punishment coming from someone like him be? Matthew probably make him do something silly like dancing in front of the ladies [Lyn often found this punishment from Matthew very amusing and so did Fiona]. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh...Fiona. Thinking of her made Wil smile. Even if he guessed wrong, he'd still have a chance of seeing Fiona giggle and laugh. It was rare for him to see such a sight normally - the young Pegasus knight was awfully bashful around men and archers. Considering he was both, Will hardly ever had a chance to confront her. But this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Will straightened up and put on a good show of confidence. \"The brave bow is...THIS ONE!\" He pointed to the bow without the moon craving and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem...is that your final answer?\" Matthew looked suspiciously giddy but before Will could speak, he cut him off. \"Well too bad if it isn't. There's no changing it. The bow you selected is...\" </span></div></div>",

That doesn't seem fair now does it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe archer looked at Matthew with impatience, his fingers curling into a fist at the thought of having to do something for this prankster. He always fell for them, every single time. \"Alright Matthew, what do I owe you now. 600 coins? My red gem? A lock of Lyn's hair?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew looked disgusted. \"What kind of person do you take me for Wil? I don't want her hair. I just need you to try on this charm I found.\" The orange haired thief removed a small trinket from the thieving pouch he kept around his waist. \"I found it at the bandit's cave last time. It doesn't seem to be worth much but it probably has some kind of magical enchantment on it, or else they wouldn't have been guarding it in the first place.\" He took the golden object/necklace and handed it to the archer. \"Just try it on for me, nothing else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWil took the necklace and looked at it with curiosity. It didn't look too special. He could see there was what might have once been a white gem in the center but it was so dusted he couldn't be sure. Looking back at Matthew he found the thief already diddling off. Matthew never had much of a long attention span anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that it wasn't too dangerous (and that a bet was still a bet), Will slipped the object around his neck. Most likely it wouldn't even do anything, and if it killed him them at least his death would be on Matthew's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the necklace securely fastened, Wil headed off to target practice.

Sure, Mathew probably wouldn't throw him in harms way in the name of a good joke, but he was still an excellent prankster. It was probably only a matter of time before his hair turned green or something along those lines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't the case. A split second later, Wil's head felt insanely light and his vision began to dim. He began to stumble forward as his legs gave out beneath him. He dropped the iron bow he had been carrying with him and fell forward onto the ground, just shy of bashing his head into a nearby tree. Moments before falling unconscious he felt his body go completely numb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, he opened his eyes. The sun, which was overhead when he blacked out, was now blocked out by something. Along with this, the tree Wil had fallen next to seemed much taller and wider. He slowly stood up again, gasping at the tree next to him. What had happened didn't sink in until he saw the amulet laying behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The amulet!?\" He gasped, seeing the string that had tight been around his neck not too long ago now make a large circle around his body! And to shock him further, the bow he had dropped was nearby also; he was about as tall as it was wide. \"It...shrank me...\" Wil stated the obvious. \"Mathew...he better come looking for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that someone would be more likely to notice an amulet and bow on the ground, Wil planted himself next to the amulet and waited for anyone to show up.

The thief had already knew what the amulet did of course. He didn't just hand mysterious relics out to just anybody. But he wanted to fool around with Wil first, play some tricks on him. That was why as soon as Wil was out of sight, Matthew went and hunted down the person who he knew was right for the job. A person who was blind when it came to small things but innocent enough not to question anyone. Of course, that being said Matthew didn't exactly tell the person that there was a tiny archer lying around where he was going. Hopefully Wil would be smart enough not to get stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the forest, Wil tried to get a grip around his current situation. Yes he was about the size of a bug. Matthew had done this. Would be come looking for him? Of course he would. Matthew couldn't just abandon Wil like this right? Somebody had to come. How was Wil going to get help without-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the archer was thrown from the amulet and tossed onto the ground. A loud thumping sound came nearby, creating earthquakes for the shrunken archer. Somewhere in his mind it registered that the sound came from somebody's footsteps, but it was hard to tell with him holding down his lunch as the vibrations became stronger. Wil grabbed for the amulet, latching himself on it's side and held on for dear life as the sound came closer and closer. What was happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Wil, his battle experience came into play at the right time and he looked around. Before him was the giant skyscraper of a dirty, dirty boot. Wil's eyes grew wide as he saw the colossal thing come near him, raising and falling, viciously crushing the grass underneath it. As the boots came closer Wil panicked. Oh no, he was going to be crushed underneath if he didn't do something. No, life couldn't end this way. No way, he couldn't just go like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a burst of strength Wil flung himself from the amulet and into the opposite direction. He didn't make it far but it was enough. Within seconds the boot came crashing down on the amulet, where he had been only moments before, crunching the metal underneath it. The boots stopped then and a curious Hm? sound came from high up. Wil pulled himself from the fallen position he had landed in and crawled onto his back. Shaking at the dear death experience, the archer slowly looked up. Who had almost killed him without knowing?</span></div></div>",

Heath's massive figure made him seem like a giant to the tiny archer, who was probably no bigger than a half of the flier's foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeath was out for a stroll, leaving his Wyvern back at camp for resting. The green haired flier didn't find the day particularly unusual and was busy thinking about advanced flying tactics to try out tomorrow during battle. Normally he stayed away from grassy forests like this, finding it too risky with enemy archers everywhere but today was an exception. The sun was out and the army was resting peacefully in a nearby village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below Wil clutched his chest as he caught his breath. The thought of almost being crushed, unaware beneath his giant friend's boots made him feel sick. He supposed he should call for help but he doubted Heath could hear him at his size. Either way, Wil had to do something fast. Glancing up, way up, he watched as the giant Heath stop for a moment, his tall boots resting only a few inches away from Wil. If he wanted to get his friend's help, Wil was going to have to act, NOW. </span></div></div>",

Heath lifted his giant boot into the air, blocking out the sun completely for the tiny archer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings moved like they were in slow motion and Wil saw his life flash before his eyes. Suddenly Heath's giant boot was above him, crashing down on his tiny body. He could feel the rough undersole against his body as it smashed into him, pressing him against the ground. Above Heath remained none the wiser, carelessly stepping on his friend's shrunken body as he continued his walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below Wil was struggling, feeling the full effects of having a fully grown man crush his body into the ground. For some reason he was still alive, his face buried in the dirty undersole of Heath's boot. It was probably the soft ground that saved his life, or maybe it was pure magic. Wil wasn't sure. All he wanted was to get Heath off of him.</span></div></div>",

Somehow he had lost track of time and it was nearly dark. He wanted to get home soon, to make sure that Natalie was safe and that bandits would not come near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother few steps, a few more gasps and Dorcas had to stop. This was ridiculous. Even someone as muscular as him wouldn't be able to transport a group of logs this heavy. He had to leave them behind. That meant to inventory to take home. Natalie would be disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Dorcas sat down, tossing his blunt axe to the ground. He didn't want to leave the entire day's work here. But it was getting dark soon and there would be no way for Dorcas to lug all this stuff home. He wished someone could help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd them, as if his prayers were answered, a shaman approached from the mist.

All done.\" With that Ug, vanished into the mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorcas was confused. What had just happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the sweaty fighter felt a strange feeling. It was like a surge of power. What was going on? What did the shaman do?</span></div></div>",

We could find Eliwood's dad in a moment.\" Several thoughts came to mind about what it would to be a giant -- to have his power multiply. He reached into his ruck sack and fished out the potion Matthew spoke of. It was definitely a size potion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this is a potion for giants?\" Hector asked, holding the bottle in his right hand. \"Did they specify that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't say they did for sure.\" Matthew answered, \"However, they mentioned gathering strength.\" That was good enough for Hector. He held the potion upright and popped the cap off. The thought of being a giant was too overwhelming. </span></div></div>",

Hector smirked slightly and felt as his body expanded. Hector could feel his long sleeved blue shirt underneath grow with him along with his brown pants but the armor that was strapped on through belts snapped off and fell to the ground. The man grew and grew, doubling, tripling, quadrupling in size. He ended up at an enormous size, with Matthew only being the size of his foot. \"Maybe you shouldn't have drunken all of it...\" Matthew trembled slightly at Hector's enormous size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awesome!\" Hector boomed, sounding like a huge shout to Matthew. He peered down at his right foot and caught site of Matthew only reaching up to his ankle. All around him he could see mountains and cities from around the region and chances are they could see him. Looking south he could see the point where he was planning on meeting up with Eliwood. \"This should be easy.\" He smirked and crossed his massive arms. He knelt down and grasped Matthew in his large hand held him up to his face. \"You actually did something right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, my lord.\" He could barely hear Matthew speak back. Hector lowered his arm and began at a steady pace towards the point which he was going to meet Eliwood. It only took a matter of minutes for his massive legs to reach the point and peered down over the mountains in the area spotting Eliwood in a skirmish with bandits. He saw the fighters froze and stare up at him in shock. As an act of strength he pulled down on a mountain tip and ripped off a peak, now holding it like a ball in his left hand. The bandits turned and began to flee in fear of the Ostian giant's might. He quickly blocked their way and looked down at them menacingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've messed with the wrong guy.\" He spoke, freezing all of them in fear. He dropped the peak to his left and reached down, scooping the bandits up in a handful. He slammed his fist shut feeling an odd sensation in his hand and disposed of the bodies behind one of the mountains. He was loving this strength. He returned his look to Eliwood and his companions, staring in awe at him also. Now what to do...?</span></div></div>",

What's gotten into you!?\" Matthew exclaimed getting a smirk in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't question me.\" Hector spat, slightly scaring them. \"When you're in my hands, you do what I want you to.\" Hector plucked Matthew from his left palm with his right hand. He dangled fearfully from Hector's hand, worried about his fate in the hands of a power hungry giant. Hector smirked again and brought Matthew closer to his body then dropped him, causing him to fall down his shirt. The belt around his lower stomach remained in tact, keeping Matthew from falling all of the way through his shirt. \"Now what to do with you...?\" Hector asked Eliwood with the smirk still on. \"Why don't you massage my neck or something?\" He proposed placing his friend on his shoulder. Eliwood began what he was told out of fear, unsure of what Hector would do next.</span></div></div>",

Not too far from his own was Hector's tent, a heir to the Ostia thrown and the same people responsible for his family troubles. He glared at him in hatred, not understanding why he was working for him in his army. \"Do you really need to make it so obvious?\" Lucius came out from his own tent holding a Lightning tome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remind me why I'm working for him?\" Raven asked, sounding completely ticked off. \"If only Priscilla hadn't joined him.\" He murmured flicking a twig into the camp fire. Lucius sighed and disappeared into his tent again to sleep for the night, since Raven was too hot headed to listen to logic. The sound of rustling grass startled him, making him spin around quickly to spot Matthew stalking up behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Matthew flinched when the man spun around, \"Take it easy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" Raven asked slyly. It was unlikely to see him around camp at this time. Matthew smirked and took his arm out from the small cape like thing on his right shoulder. He revealed a potion in his right hand, slightly sparking Raven's curiosity. \"What's that?\" He asked, pointing towards the beaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Canas said something about the enemy attempting to use it in the last battle.\" Matthew told him, \"I thought it would be of value so I stole it.\" Raven's eyebrow lifted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're showing me this, why?\" He asked again, slightly confused by Matthew's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said it would've made the enemy immensely powerful, though just one of them.\" Matthew continued, \"So I figured you'd be a potential buyer.\" Apparently Matthew wasn't thinking of his master's safety. Raven glanced over at Hector again and noticed his size. He was one of the biggest men in the army, slightly bigger then Raven himself. At the same time that meant he was more powerful and wouldn't need to buy into any of Raven's demands. A little power behind himself might get a little bit of leverage to his plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much?\" Raven asked, standing up. Matthew scratched his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two hundred gold.\" Matthew answered, holding out his hand for the money. Raven gave him an angry look but pulled out his gold pouch and counted out two hundred and forked it over. Matthew exchanged the beaker with him and ran off into the night like a thief should. Raven held the potion out in front of him and contemplated it, would now be the best time. Without a second thought he flipped up and downed the potion, craving the power he was promised.</span></div></div>",

It was an invincible feeling, as though he was too strong and mighty to be stopped by anything. A feeling so exciting that he fumbled the empty beaker, causing it to fall to the ground (it landed softly, so the result was only a few cracks rather than a complete shattering.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven could feel it happening. Slowly, but it was definitely there. His limbs were growing larger, his muscles bigger and thicker, his entire being widening, becoming larger and more capable. He turned toward Hector's tent, the object of his desire, and watched with glee as the tent, once a foot or two taller than he was, steadily sank down so that its top was eye level to him. Then as it reached up only to his throat... then his ever-expanding chest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the feeling died away and the process finished, Raven stood at about 12 feet tall, more than twice as tall as he used to be. His eyes never left that tent, which was now small enough for him to kick over with just one foot. Inside that tent was the man he loathed more than any other, the man whose family had destroyed his kingdom and irrevocably changed his life. Hector, Ostia's favorite son. Once, he had been far too strong for Raven to confront directly. He had been a beast, a titan who struck down enemies left and right with ease and shrugged off wounds that would have killed a smaller man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now... he was barely more than a little child, a defenseless infant that Raven could snap in two with his newfound power. It was time... after so many years of disillusionment, misery, and loss, it was finally time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo, whaddaya think?\" Matthew said nonchalantly, as though what he just witnessed happened everyday. As he expected, Raven paid him no notice, too focused on revenge and his newly acquired strength to acknowledge anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then...\" the theif said dismissively, although, unbeknowst to Raven, his lip curled into a devious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot...\" he thought to himself, \"What, did you think me treacherous? Cheap? Simple? That I didn't know about your life, your motives, your history with my lord? Did you think I would sell him out that quickly, for a piddling like 200 gold, no less? Why would I give something so valuable and powerful as this (He held up the cracked potion bottle at this) without making sure there were a few... safeguards first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished his thought, Matthew calmly drew a small, brass trinket from one of the numerous pockets in which he kept valuables on his being. He held it next to the bottle, smiling at the indentical markings imprinted on both of the items. Looking up, he continued to smile even as Raven reached out toward the tent, his fingers flexing lustfully, wanting so badly to grab it and rip it open. Calmly, Matthew took his thumb and smoothly traced a pattern over the surface of the trinket, right on top of those mysterious markings.</span></div></div>",

Supernatural, unbelievable powers. But he had given most of them away to his twin sister, the equally extraordinary Ninian. With the magical, rejuvenating powers of his music gone, he had lost all his use in combat. He was much too small and frail to be a warrior, a fact he was constantly reminded of by Lord Hector, a key figure for the group in both leadership and fighting power, and an absolute mountain of a man. All he could do was use what was left of his powers to summon up foggy visions of the coming battles in an attempt to aid the army's tactician, a mystery man of such intelligence that Nils doubted he needed the boy's advice at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like a waste of space within an \"army\" that couldn't afford the slightest of burdens, Nils had slipped into a deep melancholy, a sadness he was trying to escape through the one thing he had left: his music. The boy sat alone in a cabin, lazily improvising melodies and playing whatever notes his aching heart deisred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a special kind of inspiration struck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... that sounded good,\" he thought, replaying something he came up with on the fly, \"Put it with that... maybe a little of that... Let's see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicturing his hastily composed melody in his mind, he proceeded to play it out on his little wooden flute. Once... than twice... than a few times more, adding in dynamics and changing his rhythm ever so slightly, he finally got it feeling just right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then...\" he mumbled, proceeding to play his gentle, slightly sad, yet still sweet and slow melody one last time for the empty room, finishing with one final, sustained note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he continued to hold the note, a beam of blue light erupted out from one of the open holes of the flute. Before the boy could tell what had just happened, it quickly spread over the rest of the instrument, and then his entire body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?!\" Nils thought, as the blue aura engulfing his body began to take effect.</span></div></div>",

His limbs grew longer, his body expanded outward, and his muscles (the few that he had) grew bigger. Meanwhile, the world around him steadily shrunk. His body soon became too big for him to stay on the bed without breaking it, forcing him to stand up. The walls and ceiling of the cabin were closing in on him, allowing for less and less space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" the frightened boy thought, \"I'm gonna get squished!... OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head hit the ceiling with a pronounced and painful thunk, and then all at once the growing process stopped. The blue aura simply evaporated, leaving the boy to stand around and take stock of his new transformation. As the head injury he just took would lead him to guess, he was exactly as tall as the room was, the top of his hair brushing up against the ceiling. His small, one person bed was now about as long as his foot, and his wingspan was just long enough for him to touch both walls to his left and right at the same time. Strangely, the aura had surrounded and affected his flute as well, so it too had grown to a size where he was still able to play it in his larger form. The most unfortunate change of all, though, was that the door to the cabin only came up to a little below his waist, meaning he wouldn't be able to leave the cabin without breaking something down and drawing attention to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh...\" The boy sulked, in a voice that had deepened somewhat in pitch, \"How am I gonna get out now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood and watched the door, as though staring at it would cause the answer to his problems to simply enter the cabin at will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden knock at the door snapped the boy out of his funk and caused him to break into a nervous sweat. Certainly whoever saw him like this would be surprised by his growth spurt, and they may not take it well at all. Even worse, letting someone see him like this would quickly lead to EVERYONE knowing about his new, larger size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again,\" thought the boy, \"as long as I'm like this, they'll know eventually. And it's not as though I have any good ideas as to how to reverse this, so... might as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" he called out in response, allowing his guest to enter.</span></div></div>",

Hello, Milord! What did you want to ask?\" Nils replied sheepishly, thankful that his lord had closed the door behind him, so that no one else would notice him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliwood had wanted to ask him something else at first, but the question that came out his mouth was \"How... how in the world did you get this big, Nils?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... would you believe it's because I played a song I just came up with? I know it's hard to believe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've seen more than my share of hard to believe things on this journey of ours, so I suppose I should believe it, but... A song, wow... I knew your music had special powes, but I never imagined...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, nothing like this has ever happened before when I played!\" Nils said, \"This is completely new for me and my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Eliwood nodded in understanding, \"Say Nils... Ah, this may seem like a strange thing to ask, but could you, perchance... play the melody for me, so I could hear it for myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Nils yelped, holding back just enough so that no one outside would suspect anything unusual from the sound of his voice, \"Lord Eliwood, are you absolutely sure? I mean, I don't know what will happen! I could grow even bigger, or something could happen to you, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we won't know unless we find out, won't we?\" Eliwood answered, \"Nils, I understand your concern, but I'm willing to accept to risk. There may be some use we can get out of this new power of yours. Besides, your playing is always so lovely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNils still thought it was a bad idea, but when the boss asks you to do something, you do it. \"OK...\" he said, slowly bringing his enlarged flute up to his mouth and playing out his newly composed melody. In spite of the fact that he had only played it in full once before, he didn't make a single mistake. Meanwhile, his lord simply stood in front of him with his eyes closed, appreciating the music that he was being treated to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the final note slowly faded out, Nils looked up to see what would happen next.</span></div></div>",

Instead, it had the same effect on his body as it did on Nils'. Steadily, Eliwood's frame began to grow upward and outward, taking up more and more space in the increasingly cramped cabin. When he had entered, he had been about the size of a very young child relative to the enlarged Nils, but by the time the aura took its full effect and evaporated, Eliwood's hair was beginning to brush up against the ceiling of the cabin as well (although he was lucky enough to avoid the painful bump on the head Nils had to suffer.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... interesting.\" Eliwood said calmly when he stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milord! Are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm quite alright, Nils, thank you for your concern. But I wonder... why didn't you grow any bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're right.\" Nils said, \"I mean, I played it just like before... And I was here to listen to it just like before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, listen! That could be it!\" Eliwood cried, inspired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nils, was anyone with you when you played that melody for the first time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was here by myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... So would you say...\" he paused before finished the rest of his sentence slowly, \"That you were playing for yourself? That you were your own audience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... suppose so.\" Nils replied, still not able to follow his commander's line of reasoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be it!\" Eliwood said, his face lighting up, \"Your audience is who grows when you play that song!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Nils asked, even more confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it! You were your own audience when you first played the song, so you grew. Then you played it for me, and I was your audience, and I grew! Don't you see? That has to be it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... come to think of it, that really fits!\" Nils said, happy that he finally understood. It was that kind of clear-headed intelligence and analytical skill that made Lord Eliwood such a capable commander despite his young age, and that sharp mind of his amazed Nils to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all, that's how it worked when you played for Lady Lyndis on the battlefield, wasn't it? You didn't benefit from your own playing, but the person you played for did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but... I can't do that right now. I gave my power to Ninian, remember? And that doesn't explain why I grew when I just played alone. I never got any extra power when I played all my other songs for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... you're not completely powerless! You still help us by seeing shades of our future battles and giving us advice, right? You can still do that even though Ninian has most of your power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright, but she could never do anything like this with any of her dances!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe she didn't do the right dance yet... or maybe you're just special!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... me being able to do something she couldn't... I mean, normally she has more power than I do, but... wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNils smiled. Learning that you can do something that nobody else can do is always a great feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nils, this... This is incredible!\" The expression on Eliwood's face changed from joy to something else. Something strange, almost like... lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milord?\" Nils asked, a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it! This is the key to stopping Nergal! We've lost and sacrificed so much, but this... Don't you see, Nils? Anyone in the army, ANYONE, can grow up to... this!\" He held out his arms, signalling his large frame, \"Not even the Black Fang's most seasoned veterans could stand up to an army of giants! We'd be unstoppable! We'd have to nothing to fear! The rest of our mission would be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milord, please, calm down!\" Nils interrupted, \"I know it's very tempting, but let's think about this. We're short enough on supplies as is. Growing our entire army would just mean even more of a burden our food and weapon supplies. I mean, it looks like your rapier grew just like my flute did, but it's not like I can grow every weapon we have just by playing around them. I mean, a weapon isn't exactly an audience, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not...\" Eliwood said, a little disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, we don't even have a way to reverse this yet. We can't expect everybody to just live the rest of their lives as giants after the war is over, can we? That would just be... strange!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True...\" Eliwood sighed, dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Nils said, patting him on the shoulder, \"You just got caught up in the opportunity, that's all. We've all worked so hard and lost so much to get to where we are now, and you were just looking for a way to make it easier on us. You're usually a better thinker than this. You just got caught up in this giant army fantasy because you're worried about all of us, and that's nothing to be ashamed of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Nils.\" Eliwood smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, don't you think we should put our heads together to try to find a way out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... It doesn't look like there IS a good way out of here.\" Eliwood sighed, \"Come to think of it, as long as we're stuck here, maybe we should talk about how to use this power. I mean, growing everybody is just unreasonable, but certainly using it on just a handful of people could give us a huge advantage without taxing our resources too badly. And before you tell me about how we've no way to reverse this... I've spoken to quite a few people in this army, Nils. They've suffered like you wouldn't believe for our cause, and are more dedicated to it than you can imagine. They want this war over, and if they have to spend the rest of their lives as giants to make that happen, well... I'm certain they'd be more than willing to live with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Lord Eliwood,\" Nils admonished, \"First things first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe someone will show up and help while we're talking? Not to show a lack of faith, but I don't think we're going to find a way out of here on our own. Might as well make good use of our time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Milord, it's up to you as always, but this power of mine is no good if I'm never able to even get out of my own cabin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True!\" Eliwood said with a soft laugh as he thought about what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Eliwood, the commander in question, had picked up on the fact that Hector had been picking on Nils for his short stature, and had urged him to go apologize. Needless to say, the sight that met the large axeman when he entered the room quickly eliminated the need to apologize for calling Nils short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he saw Lord Hector enter the room, a strange feeling awoke inside Nils. All of a sudden, it felt like this was the best thing that could have happened at that moment in time, and Lord Hector was exactly the right person to enter the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Lord Hector.\" Nils said, his lips curling into a suspicious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nils... I... Oh, I get it! New power, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... you could say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, OK! Boy, you had me worried there for a second. You and that sister of yours are something strange, that's for sure. Anyway, shrink back down and come on out, would you? We need to get ready for the next battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHector turned to leave, but he didn't go far before a force pulled him back sharply. Turning around, he saw a huge thumb and forefinger keeping a tight hold on his cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where are you going, Lord Hector? Don't you think we ought to have a little fun first before we go out to risk our necks again?\" Nils said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really.\" Hector said flatly, \"Now please let go of... HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thumb and forefinger had pulled back sharply on the cape once again as their owner said \"Well, I do. I'll tell you what, Hector, you always made plenty of fun out of how short I was before. Well, now that I'm a little bigger, what do you say to seeing how much fun my size is now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah geez. Look, Nils, I'm sorry about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure you are!\" Nils said, his voice now becoming slightly aggressive, \"But I'm not looking for an apology, Hector. I want to test this newfound stregth of mine against the biggest, toughest guy in the army! So what do you say to a quick arm wrestling match, huh? Between friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no. C'mon Nils, this is serious, Eliwood needs us to... WHOA! Would you stop pulling on that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me, Hector!\" Nils said, his voice and face now stone serious, \"I'm going to enjoy this new power with you one way or another, and that means, if you don't like my way... well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled on the cape in a way that forced Hector to turn around and meet him face to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think of another way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHector gulped softly. Something had gotten into this kid. Maybe giving in to his little demand for an arm wrestling match would get it out of him. It certainly sounded a lot nicer than letting him \"think of another way.\"</span></div></div>",

Between the heavy armor he was wearing and the axeman's own considerable strength and bulk, he was exerting just enough force to not only match the force coming from Nils' enlarged muscles, but to exceed it. Slowly, the giant hand pushing against him was pushed back, little by little, inch by inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNils was shocked. Even after he had grown to more than twice his original size, he couldn't match Hector's strength. He tried his hardest to rally back, but while the growth had enlarged his muscles, it had done nothing to help his stamina and grit.

It... was intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NILS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh- Huh?\" Nils grunted, breaking out of his self-imposed trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked you if we're done here.

Strangely, it took a longer time for his feet to reach the ground than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something's going on here, but... AHH!\" he turned around to see that his bed was still growing, larger and larger until it was more than twice his height, at which point its rate of growth slowed to a crawl before eventually stopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the growth stopping and the world around him seeming to normalize, Nils, feeling very uneasy, took a good long look around the cabin, which had suddenly swelled to castle size along with his bed. The ceiling loomed far above him, while both the opposite wall and the door to the cabin had moved away from him by large margins, being an extended walk's distance away from his current point, rather than the nonchalant movements they were supposed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take the clever boy long at all to realize what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH, NO!\" he cried out in an squeaky, high-pitched voice, \"Now I'm even punier than ever! Oh, what if Lord Hector sees me like this? Wait a minute... will ANYBODY see me like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had better, he realized, because he was about the size of a child's doll now, and he would need plenty of protection from the new threats that would arise due to his new size. Not only that, but he didn't trust himself to find a way to reverse this on his own. More than anything, he needed to get noticed and get help first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, OK, but how to do that?\" he wondered aloud. He could slip under the door and go outside for help. Obviously dangerous, but at least he'd feel like he was making progress toward his goal. Plus, he wasn't so small that being seen would be too much of a problem, and his innocent looks and vivacious personality had won him quite a few friends in the army. Certainly someone would be willing to take him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaying inside and waiting for help would be the safer option, but it would also be the most boring. Sure, he did have his flute to play on while he waited (having been engulfed by the aura along with him, it shrunk down as well), but after what just happened... well, maybe best to take a break from playing. Certainly a worried someone would come by eventually (his sister, perhaps, or Lord Eliwood), but he didn't want his absence to cause anyone tell much trouble... especially since trying to fix his size would cause them enough headaches by itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew... who would've imagined this would happen during practice?\" he said to himself as he idly tossed his flute into the air and caught it.</span></div></div>",

I never thought I'd ever stumble upon one of these in my life, and yet you insult it as if it was waste!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranz turned back to the stranger he had met only recently. \"Look. I don't hold anything against dark magic, but this is ridiculous! Who on earth would ever need a size changing scroll?

He was furious and Knoll and at himself for allowing him to behave to unprofessionally. If the Lord found out...Franz pushed the thought out of his mind. It was only a little spar, no need to inform the others. Standing up Franz brushed the dirt off his outfit. Knoll was truly someone to be avoided, if necessary, alert the others about the new spell he had acquired.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranz wasn't about to let that get in the way of him continuing the rest of the day. He walked back to his house and sat himself down on the wooden stool used for dining. He was supposedly to share this place with Forde, but since he was out most of the time General Seth had given the house to himself (although nobody had really informed Forde and he visited often saying he had nowhere to go). Today was one of those days. Franz found Forde upstairs, sleeping on the bed he had made only this morning.

Life was calm and peaceful, minus the mishap a few moments ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the strangest feeling overcame the young knight.

Eyes quickly opening Franz looked himself over, worrying for the first time that perhaps Knoll's spell was indeed something to be invest aged and if needed, to remove from himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Franz looked up again, something was strange. Had the window always been this low to the ground? No. Just a few moments ago it was eye length to the young man but now it was obvious that Franz had to bend over to see out of it. Realization came. The spell! The effects obviously matched the name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic was obviously used to change the sizes of items, and in this case humans too. Clearly Knoll had cast some sort of magical power over Franz and now he was growing taller because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around Franz began to panic. How tall was he going to grow?

If he was going to bring destruction onto the house, then he needed Forde out of here!

His arms exposed to the outside by another set of giant circles. Luckily though, his growth seemed to have stopped, as he so found out when the ceiling of the house touched his head in a rather painful manner. All he could see at the moment was the remainder of the walls that used to belong to the second story bedrooms. He couldn't see outside though and had no idea where his feet had landed. His arms could be moved though, although Franz was worried about causing even more damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Forde was standing more than 20 meters away from his former house, unable to speak or even move. He had witnessed what could have been the world's possibly weirdest thing ever. The house was ruined, wood pieces were all over the place along with doors and bits of window. It was even more shocking for the knight to see his brother's giant boots, on either side of him. They were probably the same height as him. Those powerful feet that had just smashed through the walls of the house like it was cardboard...Forde didn't know what to think. He just stood, mouth open, stunned and beyond amazed. How did this happen? What could he do now? Try to get help? Repair the house? Go in and speak to his giant of a brother?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, someone came by and snapped Frode from his little shocked episode. It was Joshua, the gambling swordsman. He was dressed in his usual outfit, with a sword by his side. What was unusual about Joshua was, that he took once look at the house/giant body of Franz and acted completely unsurprised, like this was an everyday occurrence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah..tsk tsk tsk. Looks like Franz has been playing around with improper magic again.\" The young swordsman shook his head as he looked at the scene in front of him. \"What a shame too. Such a nice house..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForde's eye twitched as he turned to Joshua. \"What? Are you kidding? Look what happened! What are we going to do! I mean, he's just so big, like a giant. And the house! Where am I going to sleep? What would Prince Ephraim say about this? I..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua sighed as he looked at the pitiful sight of the older (and normal sized) sibling. \"Look, this happens all the time. Lyon sends us a fake gift, something weird and random and then some member of the alliance army uses it by accident and disastrous things happen. You're lucky all Franz did was grow to a giant. It could have been a lot worse you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForde looked even worse after hearing this. \"So..what should we do?\" He questioned the other man for advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go tell Ephraim. I'm sure he has some kind of thing that could counter this. You might want to find Molder too - maybe he can perform some healing magic.\" Joshua was eager to send the babbling knight away for he was curious to head into the house and speak to Franz - if Franz was still capable of speaking of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Forde left, racing towards the direction of the castle where Ephraim and Erika were staying in the village and Joshua was left alone to peer with delight and curiosity at the broken house and the giant knight that was now trapped in it...Oh boy. This could get interesting for him.</span></div></div>",

This was considered odd for a mercenary leader, taking a late night shift to watch over his group. There was something about the late night that he didn't mind, so this job wasn't so bad for him as it would be for others in his group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Gerik!\" A young voice chimed behind him. Gerik turned his head to find the youngest member of the group, Ewan, strolling towards him with a smile on his face as usual. \"You took the late night shift again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Gerik answered, slightly confused as to why someone his age was up this late at night. \"What's got you up so late?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't sleep...\" He responded sitting himself down right next to Gerik. \"I'm too excited to figure out what this tome is.\" He held out a black tome towards Gerik. \"One of the mages at the campsite we visited gave it to me, as a thanks.\" Gerik gave it a curious glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he didn't tell you what tome it was?\" He asked taking a hold of the tome in his right hand. \"I'm not so sure you should use it. At least get it checked out by your teacher.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the mage said it grants a certain strength.\" Ewan piped up, \"It can't be bad if it grants strength.\" Ewan was just young enough that he didn't quite get the darker nature of the world. If someone said something, it must have been true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone can tell you anything.\" Gerik told him, figuring he was old enough to know. \"Your enemies can play tricks on you.\" He put simply shaking the tome as he spoke. Ewan looked a little bit disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can't use it until I see Saleh again?\" He moaned, slightly dropping his shoulders in shame. \"That's a bummer.\" Gerik realized despite the fact that Ewan played pranks on him, Tethys had taught him to listen quite well. \"Well, I'm going to try and head off to sleep again.\" Ewan stood up and spun around real fast. \"Good night!\" Gerik waved his hand and turned to find himself still holding the tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewan, wait!\" He cried holding it up. The young pupil didn't notice and disappeared into his tent. 'I suppose I should just keep it with me until tomorrow.' He set it down beside him and began looking back up at the stars. Not too much later another mercenary came out from his tent ready to take over the shift giving Gerik the chance to sleep. He took Ewan's tome into his tent with him and fell asleep moments later. Just after he feel asleep Ewan reemerged from his tent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang, he must have been replaced.\" Ewan sighed seeing the new guy on shift. \"He must have taken it into his tent.\" Ewan darted through the sand into Gerik's tent and found him passed out on a sheet. Just to the right of him was the tome Ewan was looking for. \"He never said I couldn't keep it with me...\" He spoke to himself as if he was trying to convince himself he was getting around some sort of rule. He reached over and grabbed it, opening it up on his way out. He stopped and stared at the text in wonder as it began to glow a dark purplish color. An aura of the same color illuminated around Gerik, slightly scaring him hoping nothing too drastic would happen. He scurried out of the tent and back to his. Meanwhile...</span></div></div>",

His eyes slowly opened as sat up and yawned, stretching his arms up and bringing them back down to his sides. He then realized he wasn't in his tent like he was when he fell asleep. Not only that but there were no tent around him at all. \"Hey...\" He began but he quickly realized what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerik...how'd you get so huge!?\" He heard a mercenary cry up to him. Gerik was now massive figure in the desert. His tent now laid on his stomach like a mere napkin and one of his mercenaries was the size of his hand. Before he answered, he peered around for Ewan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, though it probably has to do with that tome Ewan was given.\" Gerik answered with his voice booming. \"Though I kind of like this strength...\" If a mercenary was the size of his hand, his arm was at least two times the size of their body. \"With this size I could do whatever I wanted really...\" Gerik stood up and took a look around though all he could see was sand. He looked down at his mercenary group and spotted all of them staring up at him in awe. He could easily crush any of them with a single move of his boot so he had to be careful...unless a darker side come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewan ran back to town, saying he was looking for a way to return you to normal.\" One of the mercenaries called up before he decided to act.</span></div></div>",

The group needed all the help it could find, and that meant the swordsmanship of Joshua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swordman looked down at his twin relic, the weapon his mother had given to him. Many thought of the weapon as a deadly killer, efficient especially against the forces of evil. However Joshua knew the weapon's other hidden power. Along with Latona, Joshua's sword had the ability of size changing. It allowed it's user to change his size at will, and also change the sizes of other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua stared at the weapon for a bit, thinking about it's \"side effects''. Earlier Eliwood had informed the party was going to stop for a while and wait for Lyon's forces. Joshua had been forced to spend day after day in the camp, talking with nothing to do. But maybe it was time for the swordmaster to use the weapon's effects. He could turn himself into a giant, become big and might, maybe even scare Eliwood and the others a bit. Or he could shrink himself down, go and scare the crap out of someone. Or maybe he could go and shrink someone else down instead, as a little joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about those things made Joshua grin. It looked as if the boring days of waiting would be over.

Sure, Ephraim had taken out Emperor Vigarde but the rest of the troops had been ordered to search the castle for any stragglers who may be lurking. While Colm was somewhat doing this, his attention was mainly on the hope of discovering some secret treasure hidden in the castle; after all, his job as a thief was to scavenge anything he may be able to find on the battlefield. However, most of the rooms seemed to be cleared and emptied, much to his disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no fun being a thief when everyone else pillages the castle before I get the chance to...\" He murmured to himself, reaching for a nearby latch on a door. Much to his surprise, the latch wouldn't move. Needless to say, his curiosity was piqued. He quickly reached into his pocket and pulled out the handy lock-pick and put it to use. It only took a minute or two before the lock on the door was busted and it swung wide open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nColm entered carefully, making sure that there were no soldiers waiting to ambush him in here but he was relieved to discover that the room was completely empty. To make things better, various treasures were lined against the walls; each a different size and metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackpot!\" He exclaimed, quickly running up to each of them, giving them a good look for any possible booby traps. \"Wonder what these are exactly...\" He murmured before yanking, what looked like, a giant family crest off of the wall. He quickly made his way to the next emblem and yanked it off the wall next. On the far side of the stone chamber he saw a desk; without another thought he darted over to it, hoping to find chests behind it. He was disappointed to find nothing there, so instead he began searching the cabinets in hopes of finding keys or clues as to where more of these heirlooms may be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the desk he found a key with a curious tag on it. \"Magic heirlooms...?\" Colm read with a hint of excitement in his voice. He quickly pulled the key from the drawer and began looking around the room for any other chests he may have missed. After a moment of searching he let out a sigh of defeat. He figured that the heirlooms probably weren't hidden in this room; they were probably elsewhere in the castle or possibly hidden in a treasure vault below. However, the last thing he noticed on the desk before looking away was a bottom drawer that had a keyhole. Desperate to see what these \"magical heirlooms\" were, he shoved the key into the hole and turned it. A beaming smile grew on his face when he heard the tumbler shift and drawer open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the drawer was two small rings that vaguely resembled Guiding Rings; one was a dark blue-ish color while the other was a dark red. Beneath the rings was a parchment with large text on it. Colm fished the two rings and parchment then threw them onto the desk in front of him. Before taking a close look at the rings, he read over the parchment:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Family Heirlooms: the Gleipnir and Garm rings. These rings hold unusual magical powers; rather than boosting the users capabilities, it changes their size. The blue ring, Glepinir Ring, will shrink either shrink the user quickly or slowly through the use of the follow chants. The red ring, Garm Ring, will cause the user to grow quickly or slowly by using the same chants. It should be noted that these rings should only be used when the wearer has both rings with them. This way the effects can be counteracted and will not be permanent.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nColm was stunned by what he found. This could potentially change the tide of the war for them should they give the Garm Ring to one of the more powerful members of their team. On the other hand, this could be useful for his own practice; if he handed it over now he'd probably never get them back.</span></div></div>",

Oh well, the two rings he was holding was worth more, at least in his own mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he made his way back to the throne room, he was surprised to find it completely empty. By the looks of things Prince Ephraim had called off the search and likely retired to one of the castle's many rooms. It was prime time for Colm to try out his new toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking the thief made his way over to the extravagant golden seat and sat down, playing the position of high king for a moment.

Of course, someone with Colm's experienced already achieved that all, but it never hurt to get a little bit of help. Besides, he had the other ring. He could always reverse the effects if he wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning the blue haired thief slipped the ring on and admired it. It was a fine piece of jewelry for sure and if it had not been enchanted, probably would have gone for a hefty price at at any merchant. As he turned his hand around to admire the band a sudden wave of nausea suddenly overtook him and Colm found himself slipping into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an unknown period of time, the thief slowly regained his senses, moaning and rubbing his head. Was this how the ring worked? By knocking out the wearer without warning? Some dumb piece of artifact this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened his eyes though, it was clear that he was wrong. The ring had worked, it just happened when he had passed out. Looking around he was amazed by the sheer size of how everything was, but his senses allowed him to adapt quickly, making sense of where he was. He was still in the same place as before, abet the world around him was much much different. Grado Castle was now a continent, the room he was in a massive field. Colm estimated the ring must have turned him just a few inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning mischievously he prepared to explore at his new size. Undetected, who knows what he could discover. As the tiny thief made his way for the exit of the treasure room, he was stopped by the sound of voices outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sir, I believe Colm headed into here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.

The ring probably just needed some time to take affect, some time for the magic to work it's way through his body. Yeah that was it. Colm relaxed and leaned back onto the throne. Some time was all he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, without warning Colm felt a strange tingling sensation. It was as if something was pulling at his bones and flesh, tugging them outwards. It wasn't painful but yet it was still uncomfortable. Still Colm knew it was Garm taking it's toll on his body and he sat up excitedly, fingers almost shaking with anticipation. This was going to be so great, who knew what he could do when he was a giant. Maybe show off to the others, frighten his commander or go out and crush some bandits with a quick step of his foot. The possibilities were endless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel the magic wrap around himself and intertwine with his clothing. But wait, Colm suddenly felt like there was something he forgot. Oh yes, the charm! The ring said something about a charm to control the rate of his growth. For a moment Colm panicked, what was the charm again?! If he didn't want to suddenly burst through the castle roof he was going to have to remember it fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr did he not mind? </span></div></div>",

In fact, his entire body felt sore and tense. Struggling to open his eyes, the blue haired hero let out a moan has he tried to pull himself up at the same time. He was in a tent of some sorts, one he had never seen before. There was a cot underneath him and his armor had been removed and placed to the side.The tent was a small one, enclosed from all four sides with only the one farthest away from him letting light through from a partly open flap.

The practice wasn\u2019t going so well, though, as the sword fighter found himself filled with thoughts that were taking an effect on his skills. The boy examined a cut on a dummy he made from some hay and appeared displeased. The cut was no where as clean as it should have been. At this rate, he would soon find himself further behind all his companions than he already was. Ever since everyone, save for him and his comrades, were turned to stone by some evil goddess, he was feeling a lot more distant from everyone than usual. The tacticians, such as Soren, and the \u201cimportant figures\u201d, like Ike and Sanaki, were the ones taking the spotlight. He was only good for bringing his sword into battle and cutting himself through the enemy forces. Even that was becoming a rare occurrence, seeing how more skilled swordsman had joined their ranks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding it impossible to train like this, Edward sheathed his sword and headed back to his tent. They were short on tents, so he was forced to share his with a few others. He didn\u2019t mind, but was glad no one was currently inside so he could be left alone for a bit. Edward put his sword on the ground and laid himself on the bedroll, hands folded behind his head. He was about to close his eyes when something caught his attention. Something that looked like a small, green pebble was hanging from he ceiling of the tent. Edward reached up and tugged the rock free. He examined it closely and found nothing special about it, although it did look kind of nice. Something else was hanging next to it: a note. He took this as well and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Swallow this and all attention will be on you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwallow it? This rock? Is it even edible?\u201d Edward asked himself. He took a quick lick of the rock and drew his head back in disgust. \u201cThat\u2019s a rock alright.\u201d What kind of joke was this? Did someone know he had been feeling down and given him this to make fun of him? It seemed really childish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, looking at the green stone, something was odd. Edward couldn\u2019t explain it, but the pebble seemed to radiate a mystical force. He could never sense magic before, maybe this was a piece of really powerful magic. What seemed like a joke might be an extraordinary gift! The again\u2026it might also be a trick planted by the enemy! No\u2026.wait, that couldn\u2019t be. No one would be able to sneak into the camp undetected. There were traps set up all around the camp\u2026or so he had heard. No one tells him anything, he just happened to overhear it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo if I swallow this, everyone will start showing me the attention I deserve? Seems kind of farfetched\u2026but it couldn\u2019t hurt, I suppose. I swear, though, if this thing gives me a stomachache, I\u2019m finding the one who put it here and gutting them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward opens his mouth and prepares to toss the pebble in.</span></div></div>",

There seemed to be at least some good in this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Edward laid down again. Who knew how long it would have to be before the effects of the strange pebble would active? He didn't want to sit around all day long awaiting results..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling restless, Edward thought of all the things he could do once he was famous. Maybe give himself the title of lordship? Ask someone to help him with this naiveness? Or perhaps he'd force someone to make him the best sword in the world. Ya. That's be nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward sat up suddenly. What was that strange feeling? Standing up, Edward shook his head. What was going on? This was getting ridiculous. Maybe he shouldn't have swallowed the stone after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to leave to go out into the open, Edward noticed that the roof above his head seemed lower. Had it always been this way? Confused and worried, Edward stepped outside into the fading light. Day time was almost over. Edward guessed in 2 hours it would be dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then...</span></div></div>",

The mysterious stone was reckless in terms of not going on and Edward was equally reckless in forcing it to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, chocking and eventually gagging, Edward somehow managed to make the green gem go down, feeling uneasy but excited as he did so. Finally he would be able to garner some attention around here so force he would be the center of attention rather than Leonardo. It wasn't that he disliked his friend. It was just that he was too serious and wise, all many of the mercenaries visited him instead of Edward.

He feels something like a blanket draped over his bare skin, which is odd since he doesn\u2019t recall stripping before he went to sleep. The memories of the weird stone and the painful results that came after swallowing it flood back into his mind. Edward\u2019s eyes shoot open and he sits up while looking around him. The \u201cblanket\u201d he felt was all around him, trapping him in darkness. The air reeked of BO\u2026a strangely familiar BO. At first he thinks the stone had knocked him unconscious and he had been stuffed in a bag, but this was way too big to be a bag. Also, as far as he could tell, he wasn\u2019t moving. With confusion fueling him, the young swordsman decides to see if he can make his way out by climbing up. Ignoring the fact he\u2019s naked, Edward climbs through several layers of strange fabric before he spots light filtering through the walls. He heads for that light and eventually breaks through to the surface, taking in a big breath of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes some time for his eyes to get used to the light, but once they do he sees that he hasn\u2019t moved at all. He\u2019s still in his tent\u2026except everything is much, MUCH bigger. Still with a puzzled expression, Edward lifts himself all the way out of his prison and starts to walk forward. He soon trips over something and looks at his foot. It\u2019s a gigantic button! Not only that, it\u2019s HIS button. To HIS shirt! The truth collapses on Edward like a ton of bricks; that stone had shrunk him to bug size and he had just crawled out of his own, oversized clothes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat stone was supposed to make people notice me, not make it so NO ONE could notice me!\u201d Edward screamed, boiling with anger. If this was a prank, it wasn\u2019t the least bit funny. When he got back to his normal size, he was definitely going to find the person that did this and definitely gut them!  The pissed off swordsman made is way off the pile of clothes and onto his sleeping bag. He sat down for a moment to think. What was he supposed to do now? He needed to find help, but going outside to look for some would be suicide! At his pathetic size, he might get picked up by a bird and eaten. He decided to wait patiently for someone to come to him. He didn\u2019t have to wait that long as he started to hear the slamming of boots approaching the tent. The stomping got louder as the entrance of the tent was pushed back and someone entered.

He sat himself down at the table in the mess hall and relaxed his sore body. \"You just get done from working out?\" Ike asked, entering the room from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Boyd smirked, \"I can't believe how much I've grown in only three years. Simplicity is actually pretty effective.\" Boyd chuckled a little bit, checking out his large arms. Ike sighed and little bit and looked down at his own. His were large and had grown plenty for only three years, but Boyd was basically his rival. If his arms were bigger, he was losing the unpronounced race. Rhys limped into the room carrying a large crate and grunting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I get some help?\" He begged, just about ready to drop the box to the ground. The two other men walked over and assisted him in placing the heavy container on the table. \"Thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in here?\" Boyd asked curiously, poking his head closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't get too close.\" Rhys warned, \"They say if this spice is used raw it could affect someone's size magically.\" The other two gave him a confused expression. \"When cooked its an amazing ingredient, when used raw it's a magical item. And to make things worse, it's tasteless raw.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's turns them into a giant?\" Boyd asked, intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On more accounts, it shrinks the victim.\" Rhys told him, \"The amount shrunken depends on how much is consumed. Though the affects wear off after a while if the victim keeps away from the spice long enough.\" The two men nodded their heads in understanding. \"Oscar ordered it for the meal he's preparing tonight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do you need to eat to shrink yourself to a size people can pick you up and stuff?\" Boyd asked jokingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhys chuckled slightly, \"Depends on the person's size. Usually only a handful.\" He answered, \"You see, it only affects you the first time if you inhale/digest it. After it gets in your system, you can be affected by contact.\" Rhys left them room to go relax in his own room after explaining this to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Ike and Boyd returned to the table where Boyd decided he needed to go bathe before they ate lunch. It was then it hit Ike. \"Hey Boyd, I'm gonna make a sandwich, you want one?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll get a ham if we have it.\" Boyd responded and left the building to go bath. Ike entered the kitchen and prepared two ham sandwiches and once he completed them he returned to the box. The lid was already cracked some so he just hand to reach his hand in there...and scoop out enough. 'Boyd's a big man...' He thought to himself. He used his other hand to scoop out another handful. He used his arm to close the crate and return to the kitchen, where he doused Boyd's sandwich in the spice, hiding it inside the pieces of the folded ham. Ike smirked and cut Boyd's in half, to be able and distinguish the two when the time came. In a matter of moments, Boyd returned cleaned off and ready to eat. Ike carried the sandwiches out to the table and set them down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ike!\" Boyd replied trustingly and took a bite out of his. \"Taste pretty good.\" Ike smiled and nodded and began conversing with him, ready to see the spice take affect. </span></div></div>",

Finally he passed out leaning backwards and shrank before Ike's eyes. His was quickly obscured beneath the table and the sound of metal hitting the floor rang throughout the small building. At first he was worried Boyd's clothes didn't shrink with him, but for some reason the clothes had but the shoulder pads didn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIke stood up from his seat and approached Boyd's unconscious shrunken body. How was he supposed to keep him like this? Oscar was going to be using the spice tonight for dinner. 'It looks like I'll have to take some of it...' Ike thought to himself. He reached down and scooped up Boyd into his hand and grinned. 'Now who's the smaller one?' He slipped Boyd into his belt to hold him temporarily as he went into the kitchen to get a few bowls for the spice. He took several bowls and filled them up and slipped out of the mess hall and made it back to his room without any confrontations. He hid the bowls in his dresser and took Boyd off of his belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or so later Boyd came to, spotting his giant friend not too far from him. \"What the hell happened to me!?\" Boyd cursed, standing up on the night stand and looking around. \"I shrunk!?\" His voice was loud enough to be heard by the giant. Ike spun around and saw him standing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you.\" Ike joked, laughing slightly. Boyd looked furious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do!?\" He roared as loud as possible. \"What did you do to me!?\" Ike smirked and reached over to him. Boyd attempted to back away but the larger man grabbed him in his hand. No matter how much muscle Boyd had he could break free from Ike's grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so much weaker now...\" Ike taunted, squeezing him slightly. \"You can't do anything about it.\" Boyd used all of his might but Ike had him beat. \"It's about time I passed you up.\" Boyd gave him a look of disbelief. \"Now that I have you...what should I do with you?\" Ike lifted him up a bit to give him a sight of his arm, which was now bigger then Boyd's entire body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ike began out of his room towards the training center they had. The longer he held Boyd in his hand, the better he felt. Ike had always wanted to hold complete power over someone, though not like having a position as a General. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ike...!\" Boyd called, beginning to be crushed by Ike's obsessive grasp. \"Don't tell me this is because I was bigger then you!\" Ike didn't respond but rather entered the training and grasped a sword. Ike slipped Boyd into his cloth pieces he had wrapped around his wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to see my arms in action?\" Ike taunted, looking down at Boyd on his wrist. He swung his sword several times at a training dummy working the muscles in his arm right in Boyd's face. Boyd attempted to struggle a bit as he swung, wanting to escape from his crazy new owner. At first nothing seemed to be happening but as Ike increased the intensity he began to sweat more, dousing Boyd and Ike's cloth wrists in his sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is disgusting...' Boyd gagged a bit as giant drops of Ike's sweat covered his body. 'It's bad enough being covered in my own.' At the same time he noticed the cloth restraining him was being weakened by each drop that hit it. 'If it weakens enough...' Boyd began to use his arms to try and rip the cloth as he was swung around. 'I don't care if I get hurt, I'm not letting Ike keep me as his pet.' At the low point of a swing Boyd managed to rip the cloth and free himself...only to be launched upwards by Ike's swing. He grasped onto his friend's arm in attempt to keep himself from flying away and wasn't noticed thankfully. 'It's only a matter of time before he notices...' Boyd looked around for any other chance at escaping. From this high in the air and this speed the only way down was a flight from a swing. </span></div></div>",

Boyd's face twisted in disbelief as he began to try and wrestle Ike's fingers off of him. \"Please Boyd, you're too tiny to do anything anymore.\" Ike laughed as he shoved Boyd unwilling into his stomach against the six pack.

His father was still sick as ever and had no doctors had been brave enough to stand up to the plate and take a shot to look at the aging ruler. Worry filled the young boy's mind. So much was going on! His father was ill, the attempt to contact Lady Lynis had failed and neither Lugh or Ray, the party's resident magic users had achieved connecting with the long gone spirit of Nils and Ninian, two powerful dragons that had once severed and helped his father. The bother and sister duo where either deceased or vanished. Roy had heard from Lord Hector, a friend of his father's, that dragon spirits do not die and fade out. When dragons die their spirits where released back to their land to wander. Sort of like a dragon heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his eyes, Roy wished that his friends where here to support him. Unfortunately most of the party had been sent to suppress a bandit raid in a nearby village, leaving only several people of interest, none of them who Roy wanted to see at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the unusually large box Lord Eliwood had sent his message in, Roy peered out of the small window of his room, or rather his hut as the remaining members of the party had had taken residence in the small village of Napalm. He wished Marcus has here to help him on his lessons, but he too had been sent out on the attack against the bandits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy's mind wandered back to the yellow box in which his father had used to carry the sole letter. Eliwood was never one to waste material, so the strange large item had confused Roy when he had opened it. Why was it so empty?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a thought dawned on Roy. The letter probably wasn't the only thing hidden in the yellow box. There must have been something else in there, hidden away so bandits would not be able to steal and pilfer it away. Quickly the young boy once again took the lid off the box and peered inside. There was the letter and a yellow silk covering for it. And off to the side was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait! What was that? Roy's keen eyes latched themselves onto a small brown string near the left hand-side. Reaching a hand him, the young lord pulled the object to reveal...</span></div></div>",

Size potions. A special liquid made by the most powerful mages and shamans of the land. They were more typically used to shrink spies and assassins to send to the enemy in hopes they can either gather information or murder an important general. However it was more obvious why Lord Eliwood had sent these two to his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy smiled, thinking of how much his father cared for him. His father had probably read all the letters from his son saying how much he was bored and pressured and how much be wished that he could just relax and have fun for a change, like a normal child. Well the two potions were obviously going to take care of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy's boyish mind filled with wonder at all the silly things he could do with these items. Shrink himself and sneak into a general's room and secretly disturb them? Shrink someone else to the size of a toy and use them for fun? (Roy didn't realize this seemed rather cruel). Perhaps he can make himself big and boss everyone around. So many possibilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Roy's mind wandered to a recent book he had read. Experience life - sexual relaxation. General Seth had demanded he read it, saying he would have to one day grow up and have children. When Roy had protested, Seth had plainly told him that every other male in the party had already studied the book and that Roy was behind everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo choices.

Roy made up his mind. He was going to try something other than is usual tricks for once. These potions were sent to him in hope that he would relax and let loose. Roy did not see himself relaxing and playing pranks while tiny. However the sexual urges he was getting as a result of his thoughts might be able to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitating before opening the bottle labeled \"S\" for small, Roy quickly took a small wooden toy and laid it on the floor. It was a model wagon, constructed by Wolt for placing as a form of decoration. Roy would use that thing to get around when he was much smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with no further thoughts, Roy undid the bottle and poured the liquid down and into his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the changes took place. Roy felt himself becoming smaller and smaller, the world around him growing to titanic heights. His clothing was shrinking with him, so no need for embarrassment. Pretty soon a 2 inch Roy was standing in the middle of a huge room that once belonged to him. Grinning from excitement, Roy then preceded to hitch himself to the toy wagon which seemed normal size to him. He marveled at the fine details Wolt had made into the sides of the object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Roy soon realized that the wagon was non-functional without someone to pull it. And since Roy was the only one small enough to do so, he couldn't attempt to pull himself. It just didn't make any sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling disappointed that he would not be able to try out the wooden toy, Roy started walked towards the giant piece of wood that was the exit door from his place. He was going to have to find someone else. The book mentioned things that were unfamiliar to Roy. Impressive words such as \"release\", \"sperm\" and \"masturbation.\" Roy needed to find someone who knew the book fairly well and could do the complicated process with him.

Not to mention just last battle the knight had saved his life by quickly dispatching a group of bandits when Roy was injured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking out of his room was easy. Being only two inches tall made it easy to slip away through the door, where Roy found himself standing in the middle of a long hallway.

A long blue lance that seemed like a skyscraper told Roy he was in the right place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his perspective, the room was huge. A large wooden bed occupied most of the space and Roy couldn't make out much more. There was a table and rather plain looking curtains nearby.

There would have been no way this would have worked if Roy had needed to run for very long in his new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEying that Zeiss' door was open, Roy slipped between the crack and found himself in a darkened room. It was only dust. Zeiss should have been active. Where was he now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy stood alone in the large and strange new world. Zeiss' room was a lot different than his own. To the immediate left was a table that loomed over Roy's shrunken figure. To the right, a few feet [seemed more than  a few to Roy] was a nightstand, with a lone candle on top, providing the entire light source for the room. The shades were drawn tightly, blocking out all view of the outside world, and casting the room into a flameish glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Roy saw Zeiss' bed.

Zeiss was still unconscious. Good. This would be easier than expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking along Zeiss' leg, Roy could not but marvel at how defined his friend was compared to him. A wynern knight was always said to be tough and strong, and clearly it was true, as Zeiss' leg muscles would have been at least twice as strong as Roy's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid his hand along Zeiss' pants as he went, enjoying the feeling of the fabric and the feel of the powerful and gigantic leg. It made Roy feel secure, so nothing was to do wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon the young Lord had reached Zeiss' waist. He could see the pant-line and Zeiss' shirt covering it. Reaching forward Roy lifted up the shirt [which smelt a lot like his friend] and peered inside. To his disappointment, Roy could only see skin.

Zeiss was really a sound sleeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back, Roy had to guess the exact location of where Zeiss' penis was. He could hardly wait to see the sexual organ up close and personal, even help get it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly crawling into Zeiss' pants through the waist opening, Roy found himself unable to stand up, as the fabric pushed him down. Not going to let the restrictions hold him back, Roy began pulling himself forward, blindly hoping that he would reaction his friend's cock soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few pulls, Roy found himself surrounded by a mass of tangy things. \"Pubic Hair\", he remembered from the book. It felt a lot like real hair, but it was a lot more curly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Roy started to advance through the grass like hair, a strong scent hit him. A manly musky smell, the same as described in the book. Roy smiled. He wasn't too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother few pulls forward and Roy found his hand pressing against flesh. Using all his upper body strength, Roy stood up and saw an astonishing sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere in front of him was the warrior's cock, floppy and long. \"So this is what a penis looks like before erections\", Roy thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Roy advanced forward, until he was standing beside the monstrous beast. He reached out a hand and felt it to be warm. Rubbing his hand in a little, Roy was shocked to feel the muscle getting hard. Zeiss' erection was starting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Roy took both his hands and placed it on the ginormous organ and began massaging it. Zeiss' cock turned harder and harder, until Roy could no longer easily reach it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, Roy remembered that in order to correctly masturbate someone at his size, Roy was going to have to do some climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up freely (Zeiss' hard erection had created a tent in his pants), Roy moved to the towering organ and began scaling it, pulling himself up to the top with his bare hands. As he pulled, the cock seemed to get harder and harder, straightening up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few seconds, Roy was riding the thing, his hands grasping the head like it was a horse.

Lance had been jousting with him during most of the morning [although Alan beat him at most times since he was older and more experienced]. Marcus had come and watched and even cheered the boys on a little, saying that no bandit would be able to overcome and make fools of the pairing. After the short practice Roy and Lugh had called him and several other melee fighters to a meeting based on strategy in the battlefield. Lugh had even shown a demonstration where he enchanted an ordinary sword by blasting it several times with fire and then Excalibur (the weapon of course was given to Lord Roy for use in upcoming battles.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it wasn't until nearly nighttime when something strange occurred. Well not strange, more like rather unusual, which in reality is only a little bit less than strange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan had been approached by Ray who offered him a \"glimpse into the future\" which Alan's mind had told him that it was just another one of Ray's tricks to gather more attention for him and away from his current competitor, Lugh. Still Alan accepted, as the day had been boring than most and he was eager for something new and refreshing. Even local bandits and the enemy seemed to have called off their troops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing he sat down next to the young shaman and gave him a \"go ahead\" which sent Ray into smiles. \"Yes yes...\" the shaman began by casting what looked like a dark and magical blob of air floating in front of the two. \"I can tap into the mystic power of the moon!\" Ray turned and threw in a \"ohhh\" for added affect but had to stop when laughing took over. \"I'm just joking. Nothing scary about seeing into the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humor was short-lived however, when a wind began to pick up. To Alan it seemed cold and strangely bitter for this time of year. To Ray it seemed natural and suspicious. The wind carried some of Ray's \"magical\" cloud of dust towards Alan and the dust stung his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? I think I'm going to turn in for the night.\" Alan stood up and looked down at Ray. \"You coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya ya.\" Was the annoyed reply. \"Can't get anything done in this weather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two headed into the large and abandoned castle the group had chosen for their place of staying for the next few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan headed towards the chamber selected by Roy for himself. Being one of the original to accompany the young Lord did have it's advantages when it came to sleeping chambers and who was the first to be given a new weapon (although of of the stuff actually went to Marcus).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving just the major parts of his armor, Alan flopped down on the cold bed and drifted off to sleep. It had been a weary day and he wanted as much rest as possible before the sun came up again.</span></div></div>",

The room seemed strange and unfamiliar, even thought Alan had slept here for over a week already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan wanted to climb out of bed and walk into the hallway to see if anyone else felt a strange presence, but could not when he realized something heavy was holding him down, trapping him in his bed. Reaching out he could feel that it was cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait cloth? How on earth did some much cloth get on top of him? His sheets weren't this heavy and surely not this thick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling himself out using his arms, Alan sat on his bed and carefully looked around his surroundings. It seemed like someone had moved everything away from him and somehow expanded the room? Alan was extremely confused until he saw his armor. The pieces he had pulled off earlier last night were lying on the floor beside the bed and they looked gigantic. Huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping and filled with shock Alan attempted to peek over the bed to get a closer view of the former small outfit when he realized the walk to the edge of the bed was at least 3 times his current height. That meant he was only around 3 inches tall. Oh my.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, Alan sat down in his pillow. What had happened? Why had he shrunk? Or was this all a dream? Many different thoughts swarmed the knight as he pondered his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alan?\" A voice came from outside his door. Alan stood up, his silk underclothes had shrunk with him so there was no big bundle of outfits to rummage through before emerging into the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock came. And then another. Alan was too afraid to speak. Who on earth could be visiting him at such a late time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the door was pushed open slowly and candle light from the candle the intruder was holding lit up the room. Alan looked up as the person walked in. It was...</span></div></div>",

Shining the candle over at Alan's bed, Lance could see nothing. \"How strange...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan on the other hand, being only roughly 3 inches tall was jumping and waving his hands all over the place. \"Lance! Lance! I'm over here! Lance! Can you hear me?\" But everything was futile. Alan simply couldn't get Lance to acknowledge his presence. He was too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance was turning around to leave. Maybe Alan was out in the courtyard, strolling because he couldn't sleep. It was a dangerous place to be at such a time, Lance thought. \"But he must have his reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan was getting worried. Lance was about to leave. He couldn't let that happen. If Alan was ever to figure out exactly what happened, he would need the help of his long time friend. But how was he going to get the giant's attention though? Shouting hadn't worked. Maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan didn't hesitate before putting his new plan into action. He started running as fast as he could towards the edge of the bed.

He couldn't get his grip on his giant friend's pants tight and was slowly sliding down and closer to the floor. The steady motion of Lance walking didn't really help either, as Alan was tossed forwards and backwards with each stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting, Alan attempted another try to regain his composure. Unfortunately for him he had to let go of his left hand in order to fling himself upwards more. Too bad his left hand was the only one clinging onto the pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan fell down and down, landing on the cold stone floor on his back, sending waves of pain throughout his body. Alan had to shut his eyes, as if that would make the pain pass through quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he had regained his breath, Alan open his eyes and looked up. Hugh, the mage was there, having a normal walk down the hallway. As he took another step, Alan realized what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hugh! Down here! Look down! Please!\" He was too pained to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugh, being giant to Alan, heard nothing of his friend's pleas and continued walking, lifting on big boot after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan's eyes widened. Hugh's foot was raised over Alan's tiny body, surrounding him in a large shadow. It was like the nightmare he had experienced only moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan watched as the bottom of the boot came down on his body. It was like in slow motion. Soon the boot was pressed against the tiny man, and then it was crushing his pelvis, his chest and finally, with another loud snap, Alan's body was completely destroyed under Hugh's gigantic and powerful boot. </span></div></div>",

Now he was lying on the sheets, gasping for air and watching Lance as he moved about, examining the books that were scattered around he room. The giant had obviously yet to take notice of him, so Alan could have some freedom for now. After all who knows what Lance would be like to find his friend in a state like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWandering around the massive area that was the bedsheet of Lance, Alan found mysterious things. For one there was several patches of ... what looked to be like white coloring on the sheet. Also there was signs that Lance had been in bed recently. Everything was rumpled, making creases that were like speed bumps for Alan to cross over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Alan had gotten bored of exploring the bed and decided that it was time to get some help to return to his normal size, when he noticed that Lance was no longer looking through the scrolls. Instead Lance was taking off his leg armor and locking the door with a large key. Damn it, Alan was trapped in this room. He wanted to run and let Lance's attention but his curiosity got the better of him. What was Lance doing, locking the doors and then taking off the bulky armor that protected his legs? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Lance began to grow! Wait no, not grow. He was coming closer to the bed. Alan watched as the sight of his friend grew even bigger than before and found himself extremely curious. He ran a bit and hid behind a crease in the covers as Lance got into bed with his back against the wall so that he was sitting on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance took off his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell not all of his pants. He just lowered and slid his pants down a bit to his knees. That action revealed Lance's private area and Alan was shocked. Lance had the biggest cock he had ever seen in his life. Well not that he's seen many, but surely Lance's must have been huge, even at normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took another moment for Alan to snap out of shock and tear his eyes away from his best friend's penis. He realized what Lance was about to do. It was something he had done often himself. Many of the men did it. Lance was about the masturbate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first step was Lance closing his eyes and his hand reaching out to grab his penis. Unfortunately Alan somehow managed to get snagged in the process and was carried from his hiding position to right next to Lance's dick. That was when the hand gripped around the massive organ (along with Alan) and began sliding the little knight up and down. Lance himself was unaware he was using his bestfriend to masturbate, and Alan was too shocked to make a noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pumping began soon after and Alan found himself humping the gigantic cock as Lance slide his body up and down his shaft. The veins throbbed and Alan's body was rubbed against it. Even worse, Alan was helping him involuntarily! He clothes he was wearing was completely made out of silk and slid easily. Also his arms had been forced to wrap around the organ when Lance began masturbating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then the moaning and speaking started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh..Alan. Ohhh..Alan, let me put my dick in you. Let me fuck you and shrink you and masturbate with you..ohhh..Alan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHOLY CRAP! Lance was masturbating to images of him fucking Alan! The tiny was shocked and he didn't even notice Lance's motions become faster and his moaning louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance babbled on and on, moaning, sighing and saying things about Alan being tiny and Lance dominating him by having sex and footplay. Alan was completely stunned by all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until Lance's motions became rapid that Alan realized that his friend's cock was getting bigger and bigger and precum was starting to leak out. Alan knew what was happening. Soon, if he didn't stop it Lance would surely cum all over his tiny body. </span></div></div>",

Alan could feel the penis of his friend pulse and shake. It was as if he could feel the sperm rushing up, waiting to get out. Meanwhile Lance's babbling had turned into a series of gasps with words stuck in between. \"Oh...Alan (gasp)...fuck..*gasp*...you're so...*moan*..uhhh...hot..ohhh..ya!..oh ya!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan closed his eyes. He knew it was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud yell, Lance's cock throbbed and let out a burst of hot cum that few into the air and landed in swirls on his hand. Another thrust made another strand to shoot out of the volcano and coat Alan. He came 3 more times, yelling out each time as he did before he stopped and relaxed the grip on Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wet tiny fell backwards, landing in the pubic hairs of his best friend. Never had he thought Lance was capable of this. He was covered in head to toe with his friend's cum. His clothes were completely soaked  with the white stuff. Yet he still managed to get to his eyes and wipe Lance's sperm off his face to see what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside him was Lance's cock, deflating and covering with white strands. The same could be said for the surrounding skin. Looking up at Lance's face, Alan could tell his friend had fallen asleep, tired from such an organism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around him was the fishy white stuff and Alan himself too was tired, stunned and feeling extremely warm.

The sniper's body got bigger and bigger, eventually making the tree he was leaning on cringe and bend under his weight. His boots each looked like the size of a full grown human being and his hands could probably grasp three or four people at once. His muscles got bigger as well, his torso becoming firm as his arms began to experience muscular growth as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this took a full good ten minutes before the archer's eyes fluttered open. The first thing he noticed was how small everything seemed. The trees around only came up to his head (and he was still sitting down), the bushes of berries no bigger than his thumb. Klein groggily looked around at his body. Weird this muscles seemed better and more firm too. Had he really grown so much in just a short nap? Oh wait..the fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlein scanned his surroundings again, marveling at the sizes of the trees and other things. Off to the not so far distance was Roy's camp, where the others were staying. Maybe Klein ought to make his way over and show off his new height. The thought of being a giant with so much power was slightly intoxicating to Klein. </span></div></div>",

The lord rubbed his eyes as he pulled himself upwards. What was that he had heard in his dream? It sounded like screaming, but that was impossible. It was probably just nightmares again.

He should go back to sleep - the sun wasn't even up yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath him the tiny shrunken Robin finally gasped for air, stumbling as he got himself up. Looking back behind him he was horrified to see the back of the giant titan lord and quickly made a made dash for it, running to the side of the bed so he was out of the way. He was just in time too because just then Chrom leaned back down, falling back into the back with a loud yawn. The impact caused Robin to jump and he had to stabilize himself before he could move again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Chrom was in front of him, not on top of him, only the giant lord looked like he was dozing off again and Robin had to act quick. </span></div></div>",

Mind loosening your grip?\" Chrom responds trying his best to not be intimidated by his best friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tactician only tightens his grip, making things even more uncomfortable. \"Don't you get it Chrom? I shrank you. My spell. I had been wondering for weeks how to get you out of the way so I could lead the Shepherds properly. What better way than to reduce you to the size of a bug?\" Robin laughed darkly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom's jaw dropped in shock. All this time he thought Robin was his best friend. But no. No. The tactican made it clear he resented Chrom. \"Robin, why? Why did you do this?!\" Chrom demands. He winces as Robin tosses him into the air and catches him roughly. Something Robin would often times do with his thinking ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your leadership has been questionable at best. Thanks to you, we've had countless avoidable injuries. You claim to trust my tactical know how and yet you never really listened. Well, now it's my turn to lead this army.\" Robin responds as he tosses Chrom into the air and catches him roughly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's it then?

Before the lord can respond, the tactician snaps his mouth shut, sealing him in darkness. He begins to fling Chrom about his mouth, for whatever reason being careful not to swallow him, yet. Chrom whimpers as he's tossed about like a piece of food. He tried to steady himself more than once but eventually gave up. What was the point? At his current size, there was nothing he could do against Robin. After a bit, the tactician paused his play, only to pin his prey to the roof of his mouth using his tongue. He swallows the excess saliva that had built up in his mouth before letting his tongue drop back to a resting position, Chrom laying limp upon it. \"Hmm... You taste better than I thought you would.\" Robin's voice booms around Chrom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's it then? This is how I go? How I'm to die?\" Chrom sobs as he lays limp on Robin's tongue. He hears and feels the tactician's chuckle before hearing him mutter something in a different language. \"Robin!\" Chrom yells, demanding a response now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said before, Chrom, I've no interest in killing you.\" Robin replies as his tongue pushes Chrom toward the awaiting throat. \"Don't worry, you won't die. Enjoy your new home, Chrom.\" He says before swallowing hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom yells in both surprise and fear as he's forced down the tactician throat. He whimpers as he slides deeper with no effort at all. Before long he lands with a plop in Robin's stomach. All around him it's hot, humid and twitching. But to Chrom's surprise there's no acids. He sits puzzled for a bit before standing and walking around. The constant twitching makes it hard to keep his balance and he falls several times before finally giving up and crawls. He hears the constant thumping somewhere above him and figures it's the heartbeat. <i>\"Is this how it ends? I'm to be stuck like this, forever? Trapped within the confines of Robin until he decides to kill me?\"</i> He thought as he stared up where he had fallen from. Sure Robin said he had no interest in killing Chrom, but what else was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" Robin's voice booms from all around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What could you possibly want?!\" Chrom yells in rage before punching one of the stomach walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Robin was sitting at his desk, his eyes focused on his gut. He barely felt the punch but knew Chrom had done such. He let out a deep sigh as he put his right hand to his gut and gently rubbed. <i>\"Maybe I took things a bit too fast with him.\"</i> Robin thought as he continued to focus on where Chrom was. \"Chrom...\" He began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me alone you jerk.\" Chrom responded as he sobbed softly. \"I don't want to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrom...\" Robin attempts to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! You shrank me then ate me! I thought you were my friend! But no! You're just the same as Validar! A monster with no regard for others!\" Chrom yelled angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was taken back briefly. It took him a moment to regain his composure. \"Is... is that what you think... of me...?\" He questions as he sits back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing else to it! I thought you were different! But I guess deep down all from Plegia are the same!\" Chrom's voice was filled with rage. He took a moment to catch his breath. \"There's nothing more to say.\" Chrom added.</span></div></div>",

He was forced through the small intestine with easy and was gagging at the smell in the large intestine. But things didn't stop there, he was forced further. Eventually Chrom found himself forced into the rectum. Gods did it stink. Chrom gagged on the stench as he was pushed around. Eventually he was being pushed out, just when he thought fresh air, he was pulled back in. Robin merely smirked as he heard Chrom yelling and cursing. He pushed the tiny lord out a little then pulled him back in. Out a little more then pulled him back in. The sensation was starting to make his pants feel tight. A light went off in the tactician's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe undid his belt and slid his pants and boxers down as he continued to toy with Chrom. The shrunken lord yelling the entire time. Robin brought his hand around, catching Chrom as he finally released the lord from his ass. Chrom didn't even get a moment to adjust to the light or get a breath of fresh air before Robin forcefully shoved him into the slit of his member. The feeling was amazing to the tactician as he forced Chrom deeper. He heard the frantic screaming of the lord and felt him trying to anchor himself, even wiggling to try to make it out. But such only pleasured the tactician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom landed in pool of cum as he was finally deposited within one of the balls.

Not when, if. And that's not going to happen. You're mine, I own you.\" Robin responses as he cups his nut with Chrom. He gives himself a squeeze sending a wave of pleasure down his spine. \"Had you been more compliant, I would've kept you somewhere less humiliating. Now then, enjoy your new permanent home.\" Robin laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom curses as he attempts to find his way back into the cock. The smell burns his nose, his eyes are watering and his body keeps having a stinging sensation. \"Naga, help me.\" He begs as he's on the verge of giving up.</span></div></div>",

Can't say I enjoyed that too much, Bubbles. But you look thrilled too bits.\" came the voice all around Chrom. Gaius. The thief they recruited awhile back and tended to work behind the scenes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin hummed in delight as he leaned back in his chair, pulled his lower garments up as he did so. \"What can I say, Gaius, you're amazing at such. And I know you enjoyed that more than you let on. After all it was you who came to me.\" Robin purred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaius shrugged as he left the tent. He walked back to his tent before acknowledging his passenger. \"You alright, Blue?\" He asks as sits down.

I really owe you after that.\" Chrom states as he cleans himself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... well... you took a chance on me all that time ago. So I guess in reality I owed you.

He smirks as he grabs the shrunken tactician and holds him in his open palm. \"That worked a lot faster than I thought it would.\" Chrom notes as he looks Robin over. The tactician trembles under Chrom's piercing blue eyes. He looks to either side, if he jumped, the fall would be his death. \"What? Nothing to say?\" Chrom mocks the tactician in a similar fashion to how he had been mocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin says nothing. He doesn't budge. He merely accepts his fate. \"Do what you will, Chrom?\" He says, his tone emotionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue haired lord tosses Robin roughly then catches him just as roughly. \"I'm going to do to you the exact same as you did to me. See how you like it.\" He growls before tossing Robin into his mouth. Quickly he snaps his jaws shut and begins to work his tongue over, tasting and teasing his captive. Robin had a unique flavor to him, he tasted like a mix of bear meat and a tarty fruit. After a moment, Chrom pins Robin to the roof of his mouth and swallows all the built up salvia. He lets his tongue lay limp for a moment, seeing if the tactician was going to fight back. There was no movement, Robin didn't care. He merely accepted everything. Chrom swallowed hard sending the tiny tactician to his stomach. Assuming Robin had used the spell, Chrom knew that the tactician would survive such. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\nRobin lands with a plop in Chrom's stomach. He wipes the excess salvia from his face, muttering two spells to himself as he did so. The first gave off a blue flash before dissipating into him. The second created a small pale green light, illuminating the innards. He sighs as he curls up against a stomach wall. He wiped his face, this time wiping the tears from his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside...<br>\r\nChrom glanced at Robin's desk and saw two books open. The first was about how to reverse the effects of a shrinking spell. Next to it was a book regarding how to break a dark tie between two people. Looking closer, Chrom has a brief flashback to when Validar was able to take control of Robin before. He takes a closer read at the second book. \"Was he being possessed when he did all that stuff to me?\" Chrom mumbled as he continued reading. His gaze goes to his stomach as he feels no movement from Robin. A slight pang of guilt begins to settle into Chrom. If Robin was being possessed, then he had just acted cruelly to his best friend. But if Robin was in his right mind... \"Robin?\" He questions, trying to get a response from the tiny tactician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin, I know you use magic. And I'll wager you used that immunity spell on yourself. So cut the act and answer me.\" Chrom says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stirs slightly. \"What can I say, Chrom?\" Robin pauses trying to compose himself and not let his voice reveal he had been crying slightly. \"I saw everything. Couldn't stop myself, but knew what I was doing. Couldn't control my voice either. I did whatever Validar wanted me to do.\" He says, his voice betraying him. A few tears began to stream down his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you snap out of it?\" Chrom asked bluntly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sniffles slightly. \"Just after Gaius left. I knew that at the least, if you were with Gaius, you'd be safer than with me. Even if Gaius was unaware.\" He replies, sniffling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom felt his guilt rising. He trusted Robin was telling the truth. The tactician had never lied to him before. He let out a heavy sigh as he rubbed his gut. \"So what do we do now, Robin?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do whatever you chose. I'm at your mercy now.\" The tactician responds as he curls up again.</span></div></div>",

You're going to---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to deal with Validar. If he's out of the way and dealt with, then he has no hold over you.\" Chrom states as he reaches town. Going from shop to shop, Chrom gets an amulet that wards off any dark magic that would be thrown at him. He also finds the same potion maker Gaius had gotten the potions from earlier from. He tucks his potion purchases into a belt pouch then heads off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, old friend, you ready?\" He asks as he gives his gut a slight rub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin perks up slightly and nods. \"Yeah, let's do this.

You just let me know if he tries to get in your head.\" Chrom answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about a day of walking but Chrom found where Validar had retreated to. He took a deep breath and readied himself. Gripping Falchion tightly he headed in. The various guards were hardly a challenge for him, each one crumpling against him. Soon he reached Validar. \"I've come to end this, Validar!\" He calls as he readies to fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cannot undo what is already written. Surrender to your doom.\" Validar growls as he readied his Grima's Truth tome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two exchange blows for a bit. Chrom can feel himself wearing down but he can also see Validar was wearing down. He knew he had to wrap this up and soon. Validar was about to unleash a Grima's Truth when he suddenly dropped his spell book. Chrom arches an eyebrow, cautious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Insolent cur! Stop this at once!\" Validar yells angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrom, attack now!\" Robin calls, his voice strained. The tactician winces as he struggles to take advantage of the link between himself and Validar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Let's end this!\" Chrom responds as he rushes Validar.</span></div></div>",

Just spare me!\" He begs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom smirks at the power he had on Validar. Just moments ago, the sorcerer was going to kill him. Now the sorcerer was at his mercy, he could end the sorcerer at any moment. With his free hand, Chrom removes his boots and socks. He sets Validar down and shoves his right foot into the sorcerer's face. \"Get rubbing. It was a long walk to get here and my feet are sore.\" He demands. Validar wastes no time out of fear of what Chrom could do. He presses his hands against the lord's feet and rubs them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrom? What's going on out there?\" Robin pipes up after hearing things quiet for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom glances down at his gut remembering he still had Robin inside. He thinks for a moment. Should he fill the tactician in or not? The next question was should he let Robin out or keep him in there? He had total control and dominating power on both the tactician and the sorcerer. He loved it. He loved the godlike power he had over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nValidar finishes with the right foot and quickly scurries to the left foot and begins massaging it. He wrinkles his nose at the stench but knew if he was to survive this, he would have to obey the blue haired lord's orders. After some time, he finished with the left foot and collapsed from exhaustion. \"Oh... you're not done yet.\" Chrom says almost menacingly. He reaches down and picks Validar up. The blue haired lord brings Validar to his waistline before pulling back his pants slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Anywhere but there!\" Validar screams in horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom smirks darkly. \"Here's how this works, I'll make it really simple. You do what I say or I crush you like the big you are.\" He says, his voice dangerously low. He nods as he sees Validar accept such. He then drops Validar into his boxers and shifts slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nValidar wanted to vomit as he tumbled through Chrom's boxers. He ended up directly under the Ylissean lord's testicles and gagged at the knowledge of where he was. He feels things shift as Chrom gets his socks and boots back on then starts walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrom?!\" Robin calls from inside the stomach. He hated how long Chrom hadn't answered him. \"Chrom, what's going on out ther---\" he was cut off by a rough pat to the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change of plans Robin, you'll be staying in there for a lot longer.\" Chrom states as he walks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin growls slightly at such but knew at his size there wasn't much he could do. \"Very well.\" He answers, keeping his emotions in check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom couldn't help but moan softly as he felt Validar become wedged between his balls. Very quickly his pants felt tight and he knew he needed some release. Coming to a stop, Chrom removes his pants and boxers, his hand grips his royal member as he begins pleasuring himself. A light goes off in his head and he grabs Validar from between his balls. He grips Validar and grinds him against his dick as he gets himself off. The sorcerer whimpers as he is forced up and down Chrom's throbbing cock. Before too long, Chrom blows his load and begins panting a bit. He looks down at Validar, amazed that the sorcerer wasn't a smear. He smirks at Validar before forcing him into the slit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nValidar struggled but sigh only brought more pleasure to Chrom. The lord massaged the buldge that was the sorcerer until he was finally desposited into one of the testicles. Chrom gets an idea, he wants to balance things out between his testicles and recalls he still has Robin. He spits Robin up but doesn't give him a chance to adjust to the outside before shoving him down his slit. Robin, unlike Validar, doesn't struggle and merely lets Chrom do as he pleases. Despite his best efforts, Chrom feels Robin land in the same testicle as Validar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two might as well get comfy, you'll be staying in there a while.\" He says as he pulls his pants back up and walks off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He reached down cupping the one containing his shrunken captives. \"Which of you attempted to escape?\" He questions, his voice holding a bit of malice in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Robin nor Validar spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if neither of you speaks up...\" he pauses to let his threat sink in. Still neither spoke up. Chrom growled and began jacking off. His load is much smaller this time but it sprays the grass a few feet away. Both his captives coming out with such. He quickly begins looking for his tinies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin wipes cum from his face and simply returns to Chrom. Even if Chrom had gone mad with power, it was better to be with him than trying to survive on his own in his current state. \"By your boot, m'lord.\" He says as he reaches Chrom's right boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValidar on the other hand ran. The moment he hit the ground he sprinted as far as he could, which hardly any distance. He saw Chrom nod downward. \"Stay.\" Chrom ordered before he began looking for Validar. The sorcerer found a crevice within some tree roots to hide. He went as deep as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom saw the crevice within the tree roots and knew Validar would hide there. He grasped Falchion and slashed away until he spotted the sorcerer. His hand quickly shot forward, grabbing the shrunken sorcerer. \"Trying to flee from your master? That deserves a harsh punishment.\" He says as he walks back where Robin had in fact stayed. Chrom tosses Validar into his mouth and swishes him around for a bit. Robin watched, his mind blank. He felt nothing. The loud bone splitting crunch, snapped the tactician to focus. Chrom picked Robin up and brought him to mouth level. He opens, giving the tactician a view of the broken sorcerer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nValidar's lower half had been severed from him. The legs lying limp on the Ylissean lord's tongue. While the rest of the sorcerer rested on a molar. CRUNCH! There was nothing left of Validar aside from a bloody pulp on Chrom's teeth. He swollowed sending most of the sorcerer into his stomach. A sigh escapes him as he looks down on Robin. \"Now what do with you...\" he pauses for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin thinks up a plan. Chrom was drunk with power. The lord could and probably end him if he disobeyed. So rather than disobey, he needed to get on Chrom's good side. Chrom opened his mouth to speak and Robin took this split moment to move. He leapt into Chrom's mouth. \"Looks like that made quite the mess in here, m'lord. Please allow me to clean such.\" He says as he remains motionless near the molar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom opens his mouth a little wider given Robin a little more light. The tactician nodded and got to work with cleaning the blood and remaining body paste from the teeth and gums. Robin worked quickly and thoroughly, soon there was no trace of Validar's demise. With a sigh Robin walks along the tongue coming to a stop at the center. \"All done, m'lord.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue haired lord felt strange. He hadn't been feeling himself since Validar's hideout. He snapped his jaws shut and shook his head as though trying to clear it.</span></div></div>",

Last thing he remembered was being in a life and death battle with Validar. \"Huh... how did I get here?\" He asks as he tries to gauge exactly where he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach word spoken caused a flick of his tongue. Which in turn made things very difficult on the tactician within Chrom's mouth. Robin slipped, falling on the entrance to Chrom's throat. He felt the Ylissean lord start coughing a bit trying to clear his throat. After a few coughs, Robin tumbled back onto the tongue. \"Chrom...?\" Robin's voice is shakey at best as he remains montionless on the tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ylissean lord looked around when he heard the voice of his best friend. Then it hit him, all the memories of recent events came flooding back to him. \"Oh gods...\" he says as he spits Robin onto his open palm. He checks the tactician over for injuries. \"You're not injured are you?\" He asks as he holds the shrunken tactician. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm alright.\" Robin replies cautiously. He watches Chrom for a moment before speaking. \"Are you, you again?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think so.\" Chrom responds as he fumbles with his belt pouch. He reached for the enlarge potion only to find that it was gone. \"No.\" He began as he searched it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrom? What's going on?\" Robin questions as he hangs onto one of Chrom's fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue haired lord stops and only sighs in defeat. \"Must've lost it somewhere.\" He mumbles. His attention returns to Robin. \"I had a potion that would restore you to normal height but now I can't find it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin nods hesitantly. \"Perhaps we should head back to camp, maybe we can get help there.\" He suggests, trying to stay calm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom nods. \"Right.\" He says before he starts walking back toward where he thought camp was. Each step quaked and caused the tactician to lose his footing on Chrom's palm. \"Robin... I don't think it's all that safe for you to be... uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tactician knew where this was going. And knew he couldn't argue his ways out of this. \"Fine, but be gentle.\" He says, clearly not wanting to go inside Chrom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ylissean lord nods as he slides Robin into his mouth. He closes his jaws once he's certain Robin is clear of the teeth. There clearly some hesitation. Chrom starts walking again, keeping Robin on his tongue as he walks. </span></div></div>",

The tactician sat back, keeping his mouth open to provide a steady airflow to his shrunken friend. He felt Chrom running all along his mouth, the feet pitter pattering along his tongue, occasionally Chrom's hand brushing up against his gums. It took every bit of self control to not move, fear of hurting Chrom being the center of that control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin, you alright?\" Chrom asked as he laid back on the tongue. The tactician gave a very small nod, trying not to startle or jostle his friend. Chrom rolled onto his stomach, still resting on Robin's tongue. He looked out and surprisingly he enjoyed the view. Being so small and helpless, at the mercy of his best friend, it sent waves of pleasure through the lord. He looked over his shoulder, towards the throat. He wanted to take his fantasy further. He wanted to truly be at the mercy of his best friend. He had a handful of dreams where he was in Robin's stomach, safe and sound. Nestled deep inside his best friend. Repositioning himself, Chrom began crawling toward Robin's throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrom?\" Robin managed to speak. He felt the lord moving around and was starting to worry about just how far Chrom was planning on taking things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax, Robin.\" Chrom replies as he reaches the start of the throat. He runs his hand along the entrance to the throat, drawing out a moan from Robin. He watched as the throat open slightly, just enough. With no hesitation, Chrom flung himself into the throat. He felt the muscles quiver a bit as Robin coughed, clearly not wanting to swallow. But Chrom wiggled his way deeper until the muscles took over and dragged him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin coughed a gagged a bit, trying to keep his best friend from going down. But it was no use, Chrom had past the point of no return. He put his hand to his stomach when he felt the tiny lord land inside. \"Chrom?!\" Robin called, worry in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awesome.\" Chrom said as he walked about Robin's stomach. Robin breathed a sigh of relief once he heard Chrom's voice. The lord explored every part of the stomach, each movement felt by Robin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what's it... you know... like in there?\" Robin asked slowly as he sat on his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's amazing. It's dark, kind of damp and really warm.\" Chrom replied excitedly as he flop about inside. He heard Robin chuckle slightly. A light bulb went off in Chrom's head as he began rubbing one of the stomach walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, take it easy, that tickles.\" Robin responded as he tried not to laugh. Chrom only smirked as he rubbed a little more. Drawing out a few laughs from the tactician. \"We should probably get you out of there soon.\" Robin finally said as he continued to rest his hand against his gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! You said that spell had two hours. It's barely been five minutes.\" Chrom responded as he laid back, resting snuggly within the fleshy chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrom, I just---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to tell me you're not enjoying this?\" Chrom questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, but at the same time I don't want you dying in there or anything like that.\" Robin replied as he looked at the mountain of books on his desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Robin, it's amazing in here. Besides, with how strong you are, I'm practically in the safest place possible.\" Chrom argued, clearly wanting to stay where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Safe until that spell wears off.\" Robin muttered. He thumbed through one of his books until he found the spell again. \"Though I suppose, if you really want to stay in there, I could use said spell again. Maybe see about extending its affects.\" He added as he read over the spell. \"Or we use the potion version which lasts much longer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my tactician! Using his head to figure out how to make this work!\" Chrom cheered as he made himself comfy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright, you can have your two hours of fun, but after that, we're getting you out. Deal?\" Robin responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" Chrom replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin nodded to himself briefly as he went back to reading through different texts. He hated to admit it, but he very much enjoyed having his best friend this close to him. It meant he could protect him. Look after him. But most importantly, they could actually spend time together. All the war and battles, constantly kept them too busy to even have so much as a talk. <i>\"Maybe we can make this work permanently. I wouldn't mind keep him in there forever. He'd be safe and sound. Plus he really seems to enjoy being in there.\"</i> Robin thinks as he feels Chrom shift slightly. </span></div></div>",

He feared that Chrom wouldn't be impressed and would reject him even after what they had shared earlier. Chrom on the other looked Robin's cock over. He knew Robin wasn't the biggest but he didn't care, he loved the tactician regardless. Chrom leapt from Robin's hand to the cock and began rubbing and grinding against it. He heard Robin moan in pleasure as he worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom smirked as he continued working over. He felt the cock becoming hard, he watched as it grew slightly. Chrom knew he had Robin fully now. He continued to grind against Robin's cock, then they both felt it. Both of them cummed at the exact same moment. Chrom laid limp on his friend's meat, cum sticking to him and keeping him in place. Robin reached down and plucked the limp lord, bringing him up to face level. \"That was amazing, Chrom.\" He said, his brown eyes still glazed with blissful pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lord smiled and he repositions himself to look at Robin. \"Glad you enjoyed that.\" He said as he continues to lay in Robin's hand. He felt Robin stand and begin walking. Before long he felt a damp cloth against his tiny form. He smiled as Robin cleaned him up. He knew he was in the best hands at his current size. He yawned slightly as he snuggled into the tactician's palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled as he watched Chrom. He brought Chrom up to his lips and gaze him a kiss. Chrom grinned as his eyes drifted closed and he fell asleep. Robin gently placed him on his desk then got himself cleaned up and dressed. <i>\"He looks so cute when he's asleep.\"</i> He thought as he watched the sleeping lord. He softly murmurs the spell he used earlier and scoops Chrom up again. He fully intended to let Chrom sleep but also intended to keep Chrom with him. He considers sending Chrom to his stomach again. It was safe and Chrom enjoyed it greatly. But part of him considered keeping his love in his balls. Surely it would be comfortable, they were empty after all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Robin brings Chrom to his mouth and carefully slides him inside. He feels the shrunken lord snuggle against his tongue and purrs softly. He licks Chrom over a few times before finally swollowing him. He feels the tiny form descend through his body and is amazed at how good it feels. After moment Chrom lands in Robin's stomach with a plop. Robin gently pats his stomach then steps out of his tent. He hears a lot of commotion, mostly Frederick and Lissa. Both panicking about Chrom's disappearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin! Milord has gone missing and---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the risen or brigands or something else got him!\" Lissa on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he's fine. Chrom's more than capable of looking after himself. For now we should stay put. There've been know signs of risen, brigands or any other threat in this area.\" Robin said sounding like the cunning tactician they knew him to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth took a moment but agreed to Robin's words. After they went back to day to day tasks, Robin decided to poke around and listening in to various conversations around camp. Maybe someone knew how Chrom had shrunk. He happened to over hear Tharja muttering something about how she couldn't find the latest victim of her hex. Something about how it was meant for Robin but got someone else instead. Robin figured she must've meant Chrom. Surely this was why he was tiny. He listened in a bit longer and overheard Tharja mumble something about how the victim was likely dead due to his tiny size. Yep, definitely a shrinking hex that got Chrom. Listening even more, Robin over heard her mumble something about how there was no anti-hex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his heart stop, his blood run cold. Chrom was forever tiny. Robin walked slowly back to his tent, slumping down in his chair, his hand resting against his stomach. \"Oh Chrom...\" He felt his heart sink as the things settled in his mind. If Chrom was forever tiny, that meant he was forever vulnerable. It meant that the shrunken lord would need round the clock protection. Robin knew he could provide such but how would Chrom take such news. The tactician shook his head and looked through his books looking for any spell that might help their situation. He winced as he felt the marking on his hand burn. It did this when he stressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin perked up the moment he heard his love's voice. \"Hey sleepy head.\" Robin replied as he rubbed his stomach. He felt Chrom snuggle against the stomach wall. <i>\"I swear to always protect you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything new happen while I was asleep?\" Chrom asked as he yawned and stretched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin hesitated for a moment. He knew he needed to tell Chrom. With a sigh he spat Chrom up then informed him of what all was going on. He saw the expression on Chrom's usually stoic face, the expression of defeat. \"Hey, Chrom...\" Robin paused as the lord looked up at him. \"No matter what happens, I will always be here for you. I will always protect you.\" Robin reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom nodded as he tried to regain his composure. \"Guess we best tell Frederick and the others that way we can figure things out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin nodded as he held Chrom on his palm. The two went out and rounded everyone up for an important meeting. Robin explained as much as he could and Chrom would occasionally add in. Many of the Shepherds were surprised, in disbelief even. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we follow Chrom's lead when he's so small?\" Rickey asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom didn't have an answer, he looked away. \"Same as we always have.\" Robin stated, his voice confident as ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the Shepherds shook their heads in disbelief. Some, a great many of them disbanded. Chrom was left with hardly anyone at this point. Despite everything, he knew he still had Robin though. He broke down in tears the shrunken lord couldn't contain himself any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin held Chrom close, gently holding the tiny against his chest in a hug. He felt Chrom cling to his tan shirt and cry into it. This was painfully hard for Chrom. Robin didn't know what else to do other than hold him close. After a while Chrom finally regained his composure. \"You know what, forget it. So long as I have you, Robin, I'll be fine.\" He said as he hugged Robin as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit Chrom.\" Robin said as he held Chrom against his chest. \"We'll be fine, so long as we stick together.\" He added as brought Chrom to face level and nuzzled him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I broke down like th---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Chrom. Feeling better now?\" Robin asked. Chrom nodded. \"So what now my love?\" Robin asked as he held the shrunken lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom thinks for a moment then decides</span></div></div>",

He undid his pants with his free hand then moved his boxers down enough to reveal his cock. <i>\"I hope Chrom doesn't mind.\"</i> The tactician thought as he lowers the shrunken lord to the slit. Carefully and slowly he begins to slide Chrom inside. Robin watches as his love smiles in his sleep and even wiggles a bit. Soon only Chrom's head was sticking out. With one final but gentle thrust, Chrom disappeared completely into Robin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tactician sat at his desk, gently stroking the noticeable buldge that was Chrom. Each stroke pushing Chrom a little further down. After a few moments, Robin felt the shrunken lord land in his left nut. He moaned softly in pleasure before pulling his boxers and pants up. He felt Chrom shift slightly then it felt like his love was snuggling up into the flesh. The tactician barely contained a moan as Chrom moved about. He stood from his desk and decided to grab some food. It was a quiet day around camp which meant there was little chance of running into anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mess tent was some leftovers from breakfast, much to Robin's surprise. He grabbed a roll, some dried meat and an apple. Not a lot, just his usual light meal, he never was very hungry unless there was bear meat involved. He found a quiet sunny spot and sat back, enjoying his meal, book in hand. He set a little bit of his food aside for Chrom, knowing that his love would likely be hungry when he awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Maybe we can really make this work. So long as he's inside me, I can protect him. And I can let him out whenever he wants. He enjoys being inside me, well in my stomach at the least. Maybe whatever divine force did this, knew we were meant to be and was just pushing us in the right direction.\"</i> He thought as his left hand subconsciously went to his left nut. He cupped it slightly and gently stroked himself before realizing what he was subconsciously doing. A smile formed on his face as he thought about how Chrom probably looked at this very moment.</span></div></div>",

He landed with a wet but soft plop in one of Robin's balls and snuggled into the warm musky flesh. Chrom bounced about inside as Robin walked and went about the day. The movement lulled the lord to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like hours, but Chrom had no idea how long it had been when he awoke fully. He yawned as he stretched. Sitting up the lord saw only darkness. He knew he was inside Robin but it took a moment to register where exactly. The musky smell filled his nose and Chrom merely smiled as he snuggled into the flesh of his tactician. He was content with how things had been going. Robin had been caring and gentle with him. He was also protecting Chrom in his shrunken state. The lord could not ask for a better arrangement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard snoring and assumed Robin must've dosed off for a bit. Chrom grinned deviously as he decided to pleasure the tactician from within. He rubbed the flesh then massaged it using his entire body. He felt something warm sticking to him and knew it was working. Chrom continued to pleasure his giant friend until he felt himself being forced back up the cock. He shot out, but was held in darkness by the fabric of his friend's undergarment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom smiled to himself as he crawled along the fabric, taking in Robin's musky smell as he did so. He could tell the tactician was sleeping soundly. It took a little bit of crawling but soon Chrom emerged from under the waistband and pulled himself out from his friend's pants. He sat for a moment on Robin's shirt, right above the gurgling stomach. Chrom laid back, resting his head to listen to the sounds within the stomach. He looked onward and saw Robin had fallen asleep with his mouth open, his tongue partly hanging out and drool dripping from the the corner of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny lord stood and walked along the sleeping giant's chest. He reached the shirt collar and continued, thought more of a climb as he moved to Robin's face. It took some work but he soon reached Robin's chin and sat back. He debated about climbing into his friend's mouth while he slept. Doing so would likely result in being swallowed. Or he could hang out somewhere on his sleeping friend's form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom nodded as he made his choice.</span></div></div>",

It was a little bit messier and had a different smell compared to the last time he was in Robin's mouth. Chrom figured it was probably because Robin had eaten before napping. He sighed contently as he moved around Robin's mouth. In truth Chrom was enjoying being tiny. He was beginning to not care about returning to his regular size. All the burdens of royalty and being a leader were nothing anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were simpler now. He crawled to the back of the mouth and breathed in the smell coming from the throat. Chrom knew where he wanted to be and he knew he would be safe no matter what so long as he was in Robin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrom...?\" Came the tactician's voice from all around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sleepyhead.\" Chrom chuckled as he felt the tactician shift. He slid around until he was on the middle of Robin's tongue. He smiled and nuzzled his face against the warm surface. Around him was a soft chuckle from his protector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your nap?\" Robin asked as he felt Chrom running a hand along his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good. Though I would've rather been awake for your little fun time.\" Chrom replied, referring to going down his friend's cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin blushed a bit as he sat back. \"We could do it again if you want.\" Robin said as he glanced down to his lower region. He enjoyed having Chrom in such an intimate area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom chuckles slightly as he rolled over onto his back. \"Maybe later.\" He said as he enjoyed being where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Chrom...\" the tactician began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...?\" Chrom responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like being small? Or do you want to return to your normal size?\" Robin asked his voice sounding a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom thought for a bit. Sure his independence was gone. And sure everything was dangerous now. But he had been enjoying his newly shrunken size. He liked not having the weight of the world resting on him anymore.   </span></div></div>",

If I'm tiny, so what? So long as I've got you looking out for me.\" Chrom replies as he tightens his hug on the tongue. He feels the tip of it lick his head and lets out a laugh. \"So what do we do now, Robin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin grins. \"Well you climbed into the mouth of a hungry giant...\" Robin says playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom laughs a little. \"Oh no! Please mister strong and attractive giant, don't eat me.\" He responds going along with the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin laughs as menacingly as he could, which is surprisingly very frightening. \"Don't think such words will save you, tiny one. You're my prey now.\" He says as darkly as he can. His tongue twitches, flinging Chrom onto his back molar. He bites down, gaining a panicked scream from Chrom. The lord flinches, worried it's not a game. His eyes are clenched as he waits for the end. He feels nothing. But suddenly feels sunlight. He slowly opens his eyes, finding himself on Robin's palm with the tactician loaming over him, worry in his eyes. \"Chrom...\" he says slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom breathes a sigh of relief when he sees Robin is still himself. \"I'm ok, Robin. Just got a little panicked that you might've---\" he was cut off by the tactician brining him to chest level and holding him in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never hurt you, Chrom. Sorry I got a little carried away.\" Robin says as he holds Chrom in a hug. His voice is sincere as he speaks to Chrom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lord nods as he tries to hug back. \"I know, I just got a little worried when you started being rougher. You can sound very intimidating when you try.\" Chrom stated as he listens to Robin's heartbeat. He smiles at his irrational fear that Robin was going to harm him. He knew the tactician was probably the most gentle person in the Shepherds. \"We can continue if you want.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin shakes his head. \"I don't want to scare you more than I already have.\" Robin replies as he holds Chrom close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom chuckles as he snuggles against the fabric of Robin's shirt. \"Then why don't we have some fun, down there.\" Chrom suggests as he indicates the tactician's lower region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin grins as he undoes his pants and boxers then lowers Chrom. \"Which do you want to do?\"</span></div></div>",

The shrunken lord slides his arms in first then starts pushing his head in. Robin decides to aid Chrom in the entry and gives him a slight nudge with his finger, only the lord's lower half is sticking out. Robin lays back, his cock standing straight up as Chrom slides deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lord wiggles a bit trying to go deeper but seems to be stuck with his lower legs sticking out. Robin winced slightly as his cock has difficulties swallowing the tiny Chrom. He didn't have this issue last time, and begun to worry if there was something amiss. Before he could over think things, Chrom had managed to wiggle deeper. The tactician sighed in relief and pleasure as he felt Chrom descending again. All of Chrom was within the cock now and sliding ever deeper. The shrunken lord felt Robin's fingers outside gently guiding him deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a soft, wet plop as Chrom was deposited in one of the balls. He smiled and laid back within the flesh. Chrom snuggled into the flesh, drawing out a soft moan from the tactician. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Chrom...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Robin?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which do you prefer being in?\" Robin asks shyly as he cups the testicle containing Chrom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom chuckles slightly. \"Honestly, so long as I'm within you, I don't care.\" He replies before rubbing the flesh of his friend's ballsack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin lets out a soft moan as he feels Chrom rubbing. \"You sure you don't care? I want you to be as comfortable as you can at this size.\" He says as he continues to lay back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought for a moment. The stomach had more room to move around. But the testicles were by far the most intimate. The heat was a little less in the stomach. But going into the testicles pleasured both of them. Chrom weighed the pleasuring aspects of each before speaking again. \"Well, I prefer your stomach but you have a more pleasureable experience with what we just did.\" Chrom finally responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin nods slightly. He already knew how Chrom would answer. He sits up and rubs his cock a little. He wanted Chrom to be comfortable. To be safe. While Robin preferred having Chrom in the more intimate area, if Chrom preferred his stomach, so be it. After a little, Robin began sucking himself. He felt his load rush through his cock, Chrom being carried along. He felt the spray in his mouth and Chrom land at the back of his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom wiped the cum from his face as he tried to regain his bearings. Robin swallowed hard, he felt Chrom easily slide down his throat. The tactician laid back, pulling his pants up as he did so. He felt his tiny land in his stomach and smiled. He glanced to the side and realized he still had the food he had set aside for Chrom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom grinned when he entered the stomach. He wasted no time in snuggling into the flesh. His stomach rumbled slightly. He realized he hadn't eaten anything since he was shrunk. Before he could think further on it, a small chunk of apple landed next to him. He took a step back as more small food chunks landed where he had been. Once it stopped, Chrom picked up some of the food and ate. \"Thanks Robin.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you might be hungry.\" Robin's voice thunders from above and alround. He stands and walks back to camp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom had finished eating and was getting comfy when a little bit water began trickling in. He smiled as he cupped his hands, catching some of the water. He drank some then hugged the fleshy wall. He heard his tactician chuckle slightly on the outside. He was content being tiny. He had Robin taking care of him. And in return he could pleasure Robin in ways neither thought possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin yawned slightly as he headed back to his tent. \"I'm going to get some sleep. You want to stay in there or you want to come out?\" He asks as he lays on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like stay in you.\" Chrom replies as he massages the flesh. He hears Robin chuckle a little. \"Rest well Robin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get into too much trouble in there.\" Robin lightheartedly replies before falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom hears Robin's hearrate slow as the tactician soon dozes off. He hears the lungs filling with air before expelling such. The sounds of soft snoring. And the gurgles of the stomach. At his regular size, Chrom never paid attention to the various sounds that someone made when they slept. Now he couldn't imagine not hearing these sounds. <i>\"I wonder if Robin would let me stay in here forever. It's safe and relaxing. Plus I'm able to get food and water. And all around, it's like I'm getting a great big hug from him.\"</i> he thinks as he snuggles into the flesh.</span></div></div>",

Very carefully, Robin brings his hand up to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom sits upright when he feels movement. He looks around frantically. \"What is---\" before Chrom could finish, the movement stopped. \"Robin?\" Chrom murmurs, knowing full well the tactician can't hear him. He sees the tongue descend toward him and is pulled into Robin's mouth. Chrom shudders slightly as he sees how tiny he is compared to the tastebuds on the tongue. \"He probably doesn't even know I'm here.\" Chrom says as he looks around. His entire body sinks into a single tastebud, only furthering Chrom's nervousness. He feels everything shift as he tumbles back towards the awaiting throat. He easily slide inside and tumbled down the long tube. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sits back, hoping to feel or hear something. So far he could only feel Chrom for a split second on his tongue.

High above he hears the powerful thumping of Robin's heartbeat. He smiles as he listens to the sounds all around him. The heartbeat. The lungs filling with air then expelling it. Despite how hopeless things seemed, Chrom knew Robin would take care of him. Even if he could never leave the tactician's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stood, the ground around him quaking as he did so. He decided against returning to the Shepherds' camp and instead went deeper into the forest. While he couldn't feel any of Chrom's movements anymore, he knew the tiny lord would be safe inside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the two a couple of days to get a system down when it came to eating. Robin had to chew everything until it was a very fine paste. And Chrom got used to such. He didn't enjoy the meals half the time but knew this was how things were to be from now on. Every few days, Robin would recast the protection spell on Chrom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral years had passed with them living like such. Both content with being with one another on such a deep level. \"Happy anniversary, Chrom.\" Robin says softly while he watches the stars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom nuzzles the stomach wall. \"Happy anniversary to you too, Robin.\" He replies as he tucks himself in for the night. \"Hey, how many years has it been?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin chuckles slightly. \"Tired of me already?\" He jokes as he leans back on his elbows. \"Five years now. Five years since we admired our feelings for one another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom yawns. \"Seems like just yesterday we were fighting and carrying the weight of the world. Didn't even realize I'd been tiny and in you for five years.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, hard to believe sometimes. But I'm glad we're together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad too. I can't even think of anyone else who'd be so dedicated. I mean, you cast that spell on me every few days. I figured eventually you'd get tired of doing such and just let your innards do what comes natural.\" Chrom admits. He was genuinely surprised that Robin had been so deidcates to keeping him safe for all this time. Had their roles been reversed, Chrom wasn't sure he could be as dedicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin chuckles slightly. \"I don't mind. I told you before, I'd protect you no matter what. I'd never let anything more happen to you.\" He says. He paused thinking for a moment. \"You know I'd never digest you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But this isn't fair to you. Having to cater to me and carry me around like this. I'm just a burden, a parasite.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see you as such. You're never a burden. We've been together for five years. I'd do anything to make it longer. I want to grow old with you, Chrom. Living like this, I'm fine with it. So long as your safe and fine with things, I'm happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom smiles, he blushes a bit. He rubs the stomach walls to show how much he loves his tactician. Deep down he knows Robin won't feel it but he rubs anyway. \"I love you, Robin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiles as he finally lays back. \"I love you too, Chrom.\"</span></div></div>",

He glanced at his bed, sure it was comfy but if anyone came in while Robin was out, a lot of things could happen to Chrom. His desk wasn't comfortable no matter what he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light went off in the tactician head as he glanced down at Chrom. He thought of a place he could put Chrom, and be able to ensure his safety. Chrom would hate it but Robin had already made up his mind. Carefully he slides Chrom into his mouth and closes once he was sure the lord was clear of his teeth. He felt Chrom roll over on his tongue and even snuggle into it. Sure it wasn't the most logical of places but it ensured Robin could keep Chrom safe and knew his whereabouts. Plus he couldn't argue with how good Chrom taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tactician walks over to his desk and begins thumbing through books again. After a solid hour of reading with no results of anything regarding shrinking, he decides to head into town. As he's walking he over hears some of the other Shepherds talking and commenting about Chrom's recent disappearance. Some were worried, like Frederick, Lissa, and those that had been Shepherds longer than Robin, some seemed indifferent. Frederick was talking about mounting a search of the surrounding area. He assigned each Shepherd to an area and the search began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was thankful he hadn't been noticed and could easily continue to town. Or so he thought. Turned out someone had noticed him and also noticed he was calm about Chrom's disappearance. After a bit of walking Robin heard someone behind, he quickly spun around only to end up face to face with Gaius, a thief that they had recruited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Bubbles, you were awfully calm at Frederick's little meet earlier.\" Gaius says as he calmly follows Robin. The tactician shrugged, he still had Chrom in his mouth and didn't want to speak due to such. \"So heading into town? Know something we don't?\" Gaius paused. He knew he was right, Robin always knew something that no one else did. \"So where's Blue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stopped in his tracks. He couldn't believe Gaius had figured him out so quickly. He looked at Gaius, trying to read the thief's body language. He was calm, almost to an eerie degree. It made Robin uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bubbles, where is Blue?\" Gaius asked again.</span></div></div>",

He felt Chrom shift slightly on his tongue, he would've moaned in delight but knew such would catch Gaius' attention. Chrom shifted again, this time moving closer to Robin's throat. The tactician tried keeping his cool as he moved his tongue to reposition Chrom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bubbles, wait.\" Gaius said as he grabbed Robin's arm stopping him. His eyes were intense, something that was unusual for the thief. Robin reached down slowly grabbing his tome. Gaius had his steel sword drawn and ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of them were some bandits. Nothing they couldn't handle. But the situation made Robin very uneasy. Gaius watched and waited. His cool temperament showing through. The bandits rushed the two, determined to steal anything of value. Robin hurled a fireball forward taking out the first. Gaius blocked a sword strike before countering with his own. During the combat, one bandit had managed to sneak up on Robin and knocked him to the ground. He felt a lump in his throat, coughing several times trying force the obstruction out. Nothing, the obstruction was still present. Robin mental kicked himself as he was forced to swallow to clear his throat. \"Gaius, on your left!\" He called as he got to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaius easily dodged and took out the bandit. Only the one that knocked Robin to the ground remained. He took a step back clearly rethinking this. Robin launched a fireball at him but he easily evaded. He lunged forward, his axe aimed for the tactician's chest. Robin moved to avoid but was still grazed along the his left arm. He winced slightly before hurling another fireball. The bandit was hit but still standing. There was clear hesitation in his eyes. Before he could make a move though, he felt a sharpness across his abdomen. Gaius pulled his blade back before wiping it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all of them.\" The thief said as he turned to the tactician. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin nodded as he tore his sleeve off and tied it around the wound on his arm. He winced slightly from the pain. He paused as he moved his tongue around his mouth and didn't feel his passenger. <i>\"Chrom!\"</i> His thoughts instantly drifted to when he swallowed. His eyes looked down at his gut as he moved his left hand to it. He felt movement inside, at the least he knew Chrom was alive but for how long?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bubbles?\" Gaius asked, a faint hint of worry in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\nChrom had woken up to being jostled about but it was pitch black. He couldn't see anything. Then he felt it. He was flung backwards and was pulled down a slimy tube. He landed with a wet plop and quickly figured out where he was. \"Who ate me?!\" He yelled in panic as he tried to move to one side. He heard voices, one sounded like Robin's voice, it was the more clear of the two voices. The other while muffled, sounded like the orange haired thief. \"Robin!\" Chrom shouted as loud as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrom! Are you alright?\" Robin responds, his voice panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, mind telling me why you ate me?\" Chrom questions. He's surprised there's no acids but is thankful nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighs in relief. \"It's a long story.\" He starts but fills Chrom in completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom nods and sits back against the stomach wall. \"Well... while I disagree with where you put me, I'm unharmed. And looks like it's staying such for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin murmurs a spell to himself. A blue light envelops the lord before vanishing. \"There. You should be safer now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me get this straight. Blue shrunk somehow, you were going into town to find some books about such then all this?\" Gaius asks. Robin nods. \"Well, I'll help ya both out, I guess.\"</span></div></div>",

It was no big deal right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Gaius took out a set of forks, digging one into the pie before handing the other to Stahl. \"Try a piece!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men gathered around the baked treat and started stuffing their face. After just a taste both of them looked extremely satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that was so good!\" Stahl licked his lips. The pie was incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I agree.\" Gaius stuffed another mouthful inside. But wait, he was feeling oddly strange for some reason.</span></div></div>",

Despite being in the middle of a war the team still had days of just waiting around. Today was one of those days. Ryoma had set out early with Kaze and Setsuna to meet with a nearby tribe while Corrin and Azura were shopping for new weapons. That left a handful of people to watch their base, one of them being Takumi himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his hands was a pendant. Azura had found it in the forests and had given it to him as a present. Many of the others had trinkets and accessories, so Takumi decided it was just too rude to leave his off any longer. Looking down he examined the strange gem on the necklace. It was probably magical. Who knows<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakumi slipped the pendant around his neck and turned to head back to camp. The deer and boars of the woods weren't interested in playing the hunting game today. He might have better luck rummaging through camp to see what he could find, maybe help Jakob with his tasks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began walking back to camp he felt a strange sensation. Suddenly a glowing light radiated out from the pendant and surrounded his body. Takumi was startled and jumped slightly, \"H-Hey! What the!\" The light engulfed him within moments and he felt his vision go dark. Oh no, was this wicked magic? Before he could call for help Takumi collapsed into the grass, just moments away from camp.</span></div></div>",

They went up all the way to his waist, and it seemed like a forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him only seconds to realize the magic had shrunk him. Takumi frantically moved around, scanning the horizon. Although the camp had only been a few feet away, it seemed far too into the distance for him to run to. Worse of all, his bow was nowhere to be found, leaving him defenseless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing his eyes he started walking. He was surprised he could be so calm, but Takumi knew he needed to seek help, and fast. Maybe Sakura could reverse this or Azama could. Or maybe someone had some herbs and potions. Either way, he had to get back to camp no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began his journey wading through the dense grass Takumi felt like he heard some strange noises. Almost as if someone was walking towards him, causing the ground underneath his feet so shake violently. Turning around his eyes widened as he saw a gigantic figure strolling about, seemingly like a titan statue walking towards him. Closer and closer the figure came and Takumi knew he had to get out of the way fast. Running full speed ahead he peeked back to get a glimpse at who was following him exactly.</span></div></div>",

One misstep and he'd up a bug on someone else's boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting he laid down on the grass, looking up at the sky, taking a moment to catch his breath. What was next for him?

As much as it was nice to have Tobin looking for him, Alm needed to be on his own playing grounds and lying here dangerously in the grass was not to his advantage. Pulling himself up he took one last look at Tobin who was standing next to a tree, and began his run back in the direction of camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis journey back was relatively safe, having only been threatened by a large curious squirrel at one point. Once Alm saw the sights of his army's makeshift camp he slowed down, stopping finally to catch his breath when he was near a giant wooden log that was used as a seat during the nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camp was now a massive, sprawling maze for him at this size and he could hear the sounds of people moving about, although he had avoided any narrow deaths on his way here. Leaning against the log, which was more like a large tree to him Alm debated his next destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas would be in the nearby tent at this hour, likely resting or reviewing the army's strategies. If Alm could get the attention of the red knight, he'd know he was in safe hands. But then again, Python was making rounds on guard duty - Alm could just wait for him to walk on by and try something then, saving himself from running yet again across a large distance. But then again neither of them knew about magic, so maybe a mage was the best bet.</span></div></div>",

Like this amulet that he held in his hands. It was pretty in design, but it didn't seem to grant anything special. The old lady who had given it to him had told him it had the power to morph sizes, but they already had a few Dragonstones. There was no need for any of the others to use something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find something?\" Nearby came the voice of Alm. Lukas turned, holding the amulet into the air. \"Just this necklace.\" He tried to look cheery about it, but he was quite disappointed by the find. They could at least sell it perhaps, to help fund the army's weapon supply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should try it on.\" Alm smiled at Lukas. Why not, it was his present after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I...alright.\" The red knight sighed before slipping the strange amulet over his neck. Immediately the round piece began to glow, surrounding his body in a bright light. Lukas took notice almost immediately. \"Huh? Whats happening?\" </span></div></div>",

His entire body was changing suddenly. Alm wasn't sure exactly what was happening at first. But as he looked on he realized that Lukas was rapidly expanding! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Lukas' body seemed bigger, his form expanding in all directions. The red knight was grimacing in pain as it happened. Every inch of his body felt like it was being stretched out. Opening his eyes Lukas felt queasy. He looked at his hands in shock as each one suddenly grew bigger. Then the ground seemed to get further away by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down he noticed his boots rapidly expanding, covering more and more area as they did. Nearby Alm and Tobin were slowly backing away at his expanding form but Lukas was too distracted to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his height shot up rapidly. The ground beneath him suddenly got smaller and smaller as his body grew bigger. The Deliverance knight wanted in awe as his vision passed trees which seemed to be shrinking in height. Marveling at what was happening he stared downwards. Each of his boots were growing fast, their size quickly crushing and pushing aside shrubbery and trees as they expanded. He could see Tobin and Alm running away looking like little toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't sure when it stopped but the growth seemed to halt after a moment. Lukas looked onwards in confusion. He could see far into the distance, trees barely came up to his knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?!\" Lukas' voice boomed as he spoke. Awkwardly he shifted, lifting one of his huge boots as he did. His massive foot quickly crushed the remains of the makeshift tent they had been standing beside, sending shockwaves throughout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, how was he going to get out of this one?!</span></div></div>",

But he wasn't out of the clear it as one of Lukas' boots expanded towards him, the tip approaching him like an unstoppable force. Looking up Alm barely made out the outline of Lukas' legs. The knight's growth was too fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSidestepping Alm dashed into a series of berry bushes, narrowly avoiding Lukas' boot as it covered the area where he had been.

Over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing his voice Tobin turned around, stopping to give Alm a puzzled expression. However this would prove to be a fatal mistake.

In front of him Lukas' giant boot was still pressed firmly against the ground, although Tobin's body was nowhere to be seen. Alm couldn't believe this had just happened.

He had no idea what was happening, only witnessing the trees around him become shorter and shorter. His gaze could see more and more as he shot up in height, the landscape around him looking more like a toy model than anything else. At this height his mind was fuzzy and he couldn't think straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier he had stumbled, taking a step forward and without his knowledge, crushing Tobin mercilessly under his step. Now Lukas was finding it hard to focus, but he knew he needed help. Lifting one of his boots he headed for a nearby village, easily covering huge amounts of ground with a few steps. As he walked he realized even the tallest trees barely came up to his lower leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Lukas found himself standing at the outskirts. The villagers inside had quickly noticed his approach, screaming and fleeing in horror. As he watched the tiny citizens run in fear he frowned. \"Wait! Don't run, please just listen...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClumsily he lifted a leg, taking a step forward into the village. Unfortunately it resulted in his massive red boot crashing down onto a wooden house, the structure splintering and breaking easily under his weight.

Even worse, a few villagers were crushed as well, disappearing as Lukas stomped ontop of their bodies. The path he had cut through the village was left in ruins, massive footsteps in he shape of his boot leading to the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red knight felt his head spin again, his vision blurry. Suddenly he stumbled, falling backwards into a sitting position. His armor creaked as his rear flattened the village well, crushing a market stall and a horse carriage as he sat down. His legs went out in front of him, one of his boots kicking out to demolish a two story inn full of fleeing people. The other bottom barely stopped short of reaching the village armory. Inside the blacksmith watched in horror as he looked outside his window, only to see the dirty, bloody sole of Lukas' boot facing inches form his home.</span></div></div>",

Either way he couldn't stop himself as his blood suddenly flowed downwards to his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mila..\" Lukas muttered a word as suddenly his cock began to harden in his tight pants. It great quickly, bulging towards. A part of him couldn't believe he was feeling horny at a time like this, but his body and brain couldn't help it. Ignoring the destruction and chaos he had caused Lukas reached down, pulling at his pants, easily pulling it down enough for his huge, hard cock to spring out. It towered over parts of the village center in between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to hold himself back Lukas began stroking himself, his entire body shaking with pleasure. The remaining villagers, including Alm watched in horror as the gigantic red knight, sitting in the middle of their village started to masturbate.

His organ was so big it cast a shadow in the direction of some villagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods, this feels so good...\" Lukas couldn't stop himself. Tossing his head back the red night groaned, forgetting the promises he made when he joined the Deliverance. Biting his lips he shouted, \"I'm gonna c-cum!\" Furiously Lukas jerked, tugging at his hard monster cock until suddenly a jet of sticky white cum spurted from the tip. It flew across the air, splattering against a ruined building nearby. The villagers all began to scream and run as another ribbon of cum erupted from Lukas' cock, spraying and landing on several fleeing civilians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding his cock in his hands Lukas was in bliss. Aiming his cock forward he felt himself unleash a wave of hot jizz, his cum shooting foward and flooding into the roads like a tidal wave. It splattered across buildings, spraying into the streets and picking up citizens and debris as he flowed. Again and again Lukas came, his cum covering the village in front of him, his spunk leaving huge puddles in some places and acting like a flood of goop in others.</span></div></div>",

His triceps, visible under the soailder of his Dread Fighter uniform were bulging with size, his decent muscle tone easily doubling in mass. A fast *ping* was released as the gold ring wrapped around both shot off. The bandages restricted tightly against his biceps as the armor on his chest pressed against his grown pecs. His pants clung tighly to poweful thighs, their looseness giving more room to accentuate the muscular curves of his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith it the pain began to subside, aching muscles and burning skin numbed.

Usually, he would head to his dorm to get some shut-eye, but he had other plans for tonight. After meeting with several of his students to help them improve personally, he decided to do something besides sleeping his evening away. As he left his classroom, he thought about how much progress all of his students made, and his mind drifted to his male ones. He shook these thoughts away, <i>\u2018I can\u2019t think of them like that, they\u2019re my students. Maybe after they graduate, but I shouldn\u2019t do that now.\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dropping off his belongings and getting a quick drink from the dining hall, he went towards the meeting place to set up ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A Tea Party</b>: After putting down all of the food and getting the tea ready, Byleth shrinks while hanging over the table. Dropping from the sky, he lands in one of the filled teacups disoriented from the high fall. Coming back to the surface, he discovered the cup looked more like a pool from his perspective. After swimming over to the sloped edge, he began to climb out, only to hear the voice of one or more students that had discovered his delectable display of pastries and hot tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Sauna</b>: After taking a seat in the sauna, Byleth collapses, waking up an unknown amount of time later tiny and naked on the bench. As he tries to figure out a way down, he hears the door open and sees one or more students enter. Byleth is shocked by their new massive size, but he must still get their attention and hope that they don\u2019t sit on him in the process. Of course, he might discover that now is the time to do some exploring of his own.</span></div></div>",
