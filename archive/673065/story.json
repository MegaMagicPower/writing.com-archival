You go into the compartment and there is a red-headed boy and a bushy-haired girl sitting there. The red-head was rolling on the floor laughing, and the brown haired girl was snickering loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go, new girl, by the way, I'm Hermoine\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ron, and that was the funniest thing i've ever seen.\" Said the red-head.

He helped you to your feet. You could barely see Ron holding on to Hermoine tightly and you couldn't help but sigh. It was obvious he was in love with her. Harry clutched his forehead. \"Ahhhhh\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry\" You gasp and stand beside him. You use a pain numbing charm and his head hurts less. Erie green light is pouring through the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bout of shrill cackiling high-pitched laughter echoed until it was drowned out by an enourmus rumble of thunder. You reached into your robes and pulled out your wand. Your muscles started to twitch as your body sensed the incredible danger. You wanted to change. The doors to the compartment burst open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, dear, sweet Riley. We meet again,\" Harry took a step toward you and seemed to be defending you. \"Oh, how sweet. Potter is trying to save you. You have to come with me. Your father sold you to me. You are nothing more than my slave, little one\" His hand slithered to your face and slid down it. He brought his face close to yours and the memory of that night long ago came to mind. You felt his icy breath on your lips. You yanked your head away before he could do it again. \"Feistey one, still, aren't you. Tried to disipline you didn't I. Ohhh, yes. Tempered one you are. Perhaps you need reminding\" He said as his icy hand caressed your face. He backed you off of the train. You lept down and he followed you. Your body shook as you shrank and white fur curled over you. A blinding purple flash came from your eyes.  You were done. Hermoine gasped. Ron suppressed a startled yelp. Harry stared openly. You lept at Voldemort. He kicked you. You howled in pain. You staggered back to him, and with your remaining strength, struck him with your sharp claws across the face. Blood poured out of the wound as a purple shimmer ebbed over you, returning you to a human form. \" Until we meet again\" He vanished. You collapsed into the mud. A huge bruise was forming on your stomach. A lump formed on your head. You looked at the blood on your fingertips. You felt yourself being lifted off the ground. You looked into Harry's concerned green eyes and passed out. </span></div></div>",

You let out a slight scream and backed of the top stair. You fell backwards. You tripped past someone and grabbed them. You both rolled down the stairs. You landed with a thump at the bottom with someones arms wrapped around your head so it wouldn't hit the ground. Harry was on top of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First time I've seen anyone fall down the stairs.\" He said smiling at you. You realized he was still on top of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errrr..Harry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" He was blushing furiously. He stood up and offered you his hand so you could stand up. He pulled you halfway up and you held yourself with your other arms. You slipped off teh last step and stubled against him. He didn't let you fall. Your eyes locked. You were drowning in his eyes. You were in a trance. His lips moved towards yours. A door flew open. You finally stood up and you pretended to be arguing about broomsticks. Who is it?</span></div></div>",

He smiled at me in a way that made my insides quiver. My anger faded away. <br>\r\n\u201cSorry I bumped you.\u201d His was voice was deep and musical.

I didn\u2019t know whether they heard me or not. They had already started walking away. I felt a pang of anger but I let it slide. I ran up to my mom. \u201cI changed my mind, I want that broomstick.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to learn?\u201d My mom asked hopefully.

Every girl in our family had been part of the flying dance. She always wanted me to learn, despite my debilitating fear of heights. <br>\r\n\u201cHave mine.\u201d Mom\u2019s eyes filled with happy tears. She handed me her nimbus 2001. I hesitated before grabbing it. If \u2018Oliver\u2019 was on a quidditch team\u2026Oh hell!

I breathed a loud sigh of relief. I turned to face him. I faked a small gasp. <br>\r\n\u201cOh. Hello. Can I wait here for a while? I\u2019m avoiding Cho.\u201d If I was right he would laugh, if I was wrong\u2026well I wouldn\u2019t care then. He raised a brow. <br>\r\n\u201cYou guys aren\u2019t close?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, she\u2019s more of a trophy girl.\u201d I confessed. I snapped my mouth closed. I hadn\u2019t actually meant to say that. Oliver laughed. <br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not?\u201d he teased.<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d I said indignantly through my grin. \u201cFor one, trophy girls are brain dead.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not?\u201d He interrupted me with a smile. <br>\r\n\u201cAnd ALL trophy girls are pretty.\u201d I continued ignoring his words. His smile fell. <br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not?\u201d he asked seriously. I laughed, unfortunately loud and hard. For some reason I couldn\u2019t stop giggling. I felt my face turn red. Oliver just watched me with wide eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d I gasped breathlessly. I recovered myself. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026no one has ever said that before.\u201d I explained. He frowned. <br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m Oliver Wood.\u201d He held out a hand as if to change the subject. I shook his hand warmly. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Lizzie Dominque.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cDominque? As in the Flying Dance Dominque?\u201d He watched me with hopeful eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cUh, yes and at the same time no. I\u2019m going to be in the flying dance\u2026when I learn how to fly.\u201d I admitted blushing furiously. His face fell. <br>\r\n\u201cSo you can\u2019t fly?\u201d he repeated. I shook my head. <br>\r\n\u201cUm, I was wondering if you could you show me how? I mean you are on a the Puddlemere team, aren\u2019t you?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cMe?\u201d He squeaked. He turned the idea over in his head. I saw a grin starting on his lips. \u201cIf you promise to introduce me to the rest of Flying Dance, I\u2019ll teach you to fly.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We could start with the stairs\u2026\u201d he trailed off lost in thought. <br>\r\n\u201cOliver?\u201d Cho\u2019s voice sounded outside the door. I tried to shush him but he answered her anyways. I closed my eyes and let myself shimmer into the background. Oliver twitched. Cho stepped in. \u201cI thought I heard voices.\u201d She accused. <br>\r\n\u201cI was just talking to myself.\u201d He said after a second. He must have believed it. \u201cActually I might have been dreaming. Yes, I think I was dream.\u201d He repeated emphatically as though trying to convince himself. I smiled. Cho shut the door behind her. <br>\r\n\u201cWas it a good dream?\u201d she asked slyly. He nodded. He looked so unaware of her intentions. Innocent really. I snuck over to his side as she nearly sat on top of me. He was warm and smelled of some new kind of cologne. It was an amazing smell actually. I inhaled it. He twitched as though he felt me. I scooted so our sides were touching. He was really warm. He stood abruptly. <br>\r\n\u201cCho? I am going to go to the trolley.\u201d He backed to the door. He bolted. I followed him out the door and shimmered back into reality. <br>\r\n\u201cOliver!\u201d I shouted. He turned looking more scared than I\u2019d ever seen anyone. I ran up to his side. \u201cAre you okay? I swear gone for two seconds and you get scared out of your wits.\u201d I chuckled. His eyes narrowed. <br>\r\n\u201cWhen did you leave?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhen you were mumbling about stairs, I wanted to go to the trolley. You didn\u2019t seem to hear me when I tried telling you.\u201d I lied. <br>\r\n\u201cWait, if you\u2019re coming from the trolley, where\u2019s your food?\u201d He asked suspiciously. I rolled my eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cI forgot my purse, silly.\u201d I hated lying, yet here I was doing it again.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You sit down, and get your drawing pad out of your Jan Sport; you were about to start your new piece when the compartment door swings open.

I\u2019m dying of thirst\u201d Derrick says standing up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you get me something to drink?\u201d You ask kindly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, want anything Draco?\u201d He asks he asks heading out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA drink sounds great\u201d Draco said not breaking eye contact with you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, be back in a minute,\u201d and with that you and Draco were left alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s up, haven\u2019t seen you in like, what four years?\u201d He says showing you his pearly whites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing really, I\u2019ve been doing a lot more art, and stuff like that.\u201d You say leaning back in your seat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckles \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t that surprise me, you were always drawing even at dinner.

Derrick hands the two of you the drinks, and sits down himself.

And who knows, by the end of the year, out family\u2019s could be sitting in luxury beyond our wildest dreams.\u201d He says opening up his bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or so later, the two guys leave to go deal with \u2018business\u2019 leaving you alone to work on your art in peace. You got out your pad, and a freshly sharpened pencil. You let the lines flow on the paper, and you go off into your own world of peace and tranquility. You get out your colored pencils, and add color to your world. Draco and Derrick return, and catch you off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like someone\u2019s been day dreaming again.\u201d Derrick said chuckling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s POTTER!\u201d Draco snapped swiping your drawing from your grasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d You ask snapping out of your trance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you draw Potter?\u201d He snapped throwing the paper back at me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI picked it up, and looked at it. Harry\u2019s emerald green eyes were starring back up at me through the portrait. You were at a loss of words, you drew your cousin\u2019s and his friend\u2019s worse enemy, and worse of all, you didn\u2019t even know you draw him. You just shut your pad, and get out as fast as you could. You open a nearby compartment, and run in without even checking if it was empty. You sit down, when you noticed you were in a room filled with guys, older guys. You notice one of the guys was the boy who helped you find the platform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t know anyone was in here.\u201d You blush standing up, but Oliver\u2019s gentle hand pulls you back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, you can stay\u2026. What was your name again?\u201d He asked leaning back in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaria Simmons\u201d you say smiling gratefully, you noticed the two red heads from before, besides being twins they looked kind of like Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Fred, and George Weasley, and Alex Fleming.\u201d He said pointing to the guy next to the window; he had dark blue eyes and shaggy black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you related to Ron?\u201d you ask raising a brow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeap, don\u2019t tell me he harassed you already.\u201d The one you thought was George said snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry he didn\u2019t harass me, I don\u2019t he got the chance with my cousin there and all.\u201d You say weakly leaning back in your seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Maria, what year are you transferring in?\u201d Fred asked looking at you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m transferring into my fifth year.\u201d You say in monotone, had to be the sixth time you answered that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d was all you could hear, from the boy sitting by the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re stuck with my brother, and his friends.\u201d George joked happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect, you can meet my brother, he\u2019s in Slytherin though\u201d Oliver said warning you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, I\u2019m used to Slytherins already\u201d You say grinning, a few minutes later a boy walked in your age, he had shaggy brown hair, and deep black eyes like his brother. You had to admit he was ten times cuter than his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh\u2026 speak of the devil.\u201d Oliver starts grinning \u201cTyler, this our fifth year transfer Maria Simmons, Maria this is Tyler my little brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI prefer younger, I\u2019m almost as tall as you remember?\u201d He said smacking his brother on the back, he looked at you and smiled making your heart flutter.<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you\u201d He said smiling, while extending his hand. You take it, and he kisses it lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026. Did you say Simmons? Your cousin\u2019s looking for you, so is half the Slytherin house.\u201d He said chuckling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, here I am\u201d You shrug, and he laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the hour you arrive at Hogwarts, you head into the Great Hall to be sorted\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You waved your wand and the crystals came off. The glitter was gone except for the three streaks on your eyelids. You realized how wet you were. A golden brown owl swooped in over your head and dropped a hogwarts letter into your hands. At almost the same time, a large white one gave a letter to the boy. You were still soaking.

The red head turned and stared at you. The girl looked afraid. You decided to make up a last name so they wouldn't be terrified of you. No one knew what Voldemort's daughters first name was except for that it started with a K, but they knew her last name was Riddle. \"Oh, by the way, my name is Kyrie...errr, Kyrie Ellason\" The red-head shook his head and smiled.

So get over it, now, I see something I need to take care of.\" You see malfoy, beating up a little first year, and you knew why. \"Malfoy, stop\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you wanna take over\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm not my fathers flunkie. Unlike your father and a lot of others. Looks like your shaping up to be a good one yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed you out of the way. \"Crucio Maximus\" He said the spell to the little girl. You lept in front of her and fell to the ground. You lifted your wand and undid it. Then you fell. Harry was there to catch you. He believed you. Hermoine helped the crying little girl and asked you if you were o.k. She believed you. Ron leapt up and raised his wand to Malfoy. They all believed you. Harry looked into your eyes and his scar hurt. You lifted your right hand and touched it. A pinkish purple light flowed from your fingers and his scar stopped hurting. He smiled at you and you realized he was still holding you. You saw your fathers eyes in the back of your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run, he's coming\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who\" They all asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't wanna meet him, trust me\" You stayed there and your father showed up. You ran away as quickly as you could. You leapt onto your broom and flew expertly away from him. You got away before a major gust of wind hit you and you fell. Right into Harry's arms. He clutched his scar. You smiled at him and he smiled back, blushing. Oh no, why did this have to happen. The boy you were supposed to kill was causing you to get goose bumps and the chills. Great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, what is wrong\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what it is. My scar hurts like it does when Voldemort is around, but I can't see why\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that little backstabber is his daughter, are you bloody blind?\" Screamed Hermoine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just talk about me like I'm not here. I won't mind\" You said, your eyes flashing. \"We'll see who you think is the real traitor. In a while... You glanced around. \"Hmmph\" You walked away. You turned around and saw your father's most pathetic follower yet. Wormtail. He raised his wand from behind them. He opened his mouth. They spun around, Hermoine glaring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avada Kedavra\" He started to say. You flipped in between Wormtail and the others. You shoved his wand hand backwards and pulled him down, and flipping him into the air with your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leviosa\" He stopped in mid air. You yanked your wand to the side and he flew into a tree. \"There\" You turned on your heel and pulled a pouch from your pocket and taking the Durmstrang patch from your beret and bewitching it into a Hogwarts one. You hesitated. \"Listen\" You said with your back turned. \"I'm just trying to make my way around here. Think I'm evil or not. I don't care what you think. Opinions are of minimal importance to me. I'm just going to study, get good grades, and live my own life. Since we've managed to launch ourselves from the train, thanks in large part to me, saving your lives, TWICE\" you said glaring at Hermoine. \"We need to get to school. Come here. Trust me.\" You smiled and held out your hand. Suprisingly, Hermoine grimaced and place her hand in yours. Ron grabbed her hand Harry grabbed your other hand. You threw down a pinch of powder from the pouch. \"Hogwarts\" You reappeared in the great hall. You were sorted into Gryffindor. Hermoine started to like you. You glanced at Harry and smiled. He winked at you and smiled. You blushed. Ron and Hermoine smirked. You all walked to the common room, talking and laughing. People stared at you. You didn't care. For the first time in your life you had real friends. And maybe something more. You thought as Harry offered you his arm and you took it. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Removing the silk blanket that covered his half-naked body, he looked at the female who woke him up, it was a female veela working with his family for galleons. He gave a small smile at the female before setting his feet off the bed and grabbing the bath robe she offered him. Going to the bathroom, he showered and did his morning ritual. Stepping back in the bedroom, he saw his room cleaned, bed arranged and his clothes for the day folded on top of the blankets. Wearing them on his almost dry body, he looked around his room, he was going to miss his home and his school. It was the year of the Triwizard tournament and he would be the only guy to join the female members of Beauxbaton's 7th year batch to their trip to Hogwarts. He got stuck to it since they needed the best representative on the males to help them, which meant him since he was the cousin of the possible champion, Fleur Delacour, he was 3/4th veela, he was the gentleman of their batch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing down the grand staircase and to the dining room, he saw his family- Monsieur Delacour, Aunt Apolline, Fleur and Gabrielle. Sitting between Fleur and Gabrielle, he grabbed a plate with pancake and ate silently, listening to Fleur and Apolline's conversation about the Tournament. Someone rang the doorbell and another female servant answered before going to the dining room \"Monsieur Alexander, Mademoiselle Fleur, Mademoiselle Gabrielle, the carriage awaits\" the three nodded, eating the last piece on their plate before going outside to see their Louis Vuitton luggages moved inside the carriages they're going to use to travel to Hogwarts. Saying farewell to their family, they entered the carriage where the other students smiled at them. Sitting on a couch near the window, he waved goodbye at his acting parents who smiled sadly at him. Fixing his beauxbaton clothes, he closed his eyes and waited for them to get to Hogwarts.</span></div></div>",
