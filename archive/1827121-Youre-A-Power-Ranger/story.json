That's right, you are an aspiring martial artist. You train day in and day <br>\r\n<br>\r\nout in order to be the best and hope to one day be able to prove that you are. You hold black belts in several different styles and no amount of skill or prowess is enough for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy do you have this drive though? What causes you to show such fierce determination? A look back at the television at the front of the dojo (training hall) would answer that. The <br>\r\n<br>\r\nnews was on and the top story was once again about-...\"The Power Rangers have once again saved the day\" said the news anchor man. \"That's right Jeff\" replied the anchor woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have once again brought down an evil monster bent on destroying Angel Grove\". \"One thing is for sure Candice\" said the anchorman. \"The Power Rangers will always be <br>\r\n<br>\r\naround to save the day\". \"It sure seems that way Jeff, it looks like there's no one out there stronger than the Power Rangers-\" *CLICK* You turned off the T.V. and walked across the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nempty dojo to the heavy bags. \"No one out there stronger than the Power Rangers huh\"? You retort as you wail on the heavy bag. \"Well see about that\" you say with determination <br>\r\n<br>\r\nin your voice. \"When the time comes, I'll prove that I'm the strongest, KIYAH\"! You yell as the heavy bag busts open and begins pouring sand everywhere from the force of your <br>\r\n<br>\r\npunch. \"Someday....\" you say as you grab your tote bag and head out the door to go home.</span></div></div>",

Rita yelled. \"Every time, every SINGLE time\"! \"Do not fret empress\" replied Goldar. \"We will destroy them for <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsure next time\"! \"Shut it Goldar\"! She retorted. \"It's obvious to me that you are incapable of handling those pesky Rangers on your own\"! \"B-but, my Queen-\" \"SILENCE\"! Rita <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyelled as she stomped away. \"Boy Goldar, you sure made Rita mad this time\" said Squatt. \"Yeah, I've never seen her this fumed\" replied Baboo. \"GGGRRR....\" Goldar growled <br>\r\n<br>\r\nas he stared <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndown the two numb skulls. \"YIKES\"! They both yelled in unison as they ran. Rita was walking through one of the passageways of the castle when she saw one of the rooms <br>\r\n<br>\r\nglowing green. 'What the hell is that' she thought as she walked to the room. Upon entry she saw a glowing green power coin like one of the Power Rangers'. \"GASP\"! She <br>\r\n<br>\r\nexclaimed. 'Has the time finally come'. She grabbed the power coin and hurriedly made her way back to the lookout post. Finster saw the glowing coin in his mistress' hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What might that be your highness\"? He inquired. \"If my hunch is correct, then it's the answer to our Power Ranger problem\" she replied. \"I'm just curious to see what kind of <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhost the power coin has chosen to become the new Green Ranger\" Rita continued as she began to look through her telescope with great interest. The telescope began to focus <br>\r\n<br>\r\nin on Angel Grove, then on an individual. \"Yes\"! She exclaimed, \"It's coming into focus\". Then finally you came into focus on the telescope. Wearing your white gi (martial arts <br>\r\n<br>\r\nuniform) black belt around your waist, and kanji (Japanese writing) that read \"Death\" on the back of your gi top. \"Ooohhh\" she said with earnest as she continued to look through <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe telescope. Seeing your short blonde hair, bright blue eyes, and muscularly defined body. \"My, he certain LOOKS like he meets the qualifications\" said Rita. \"Finster\"! She <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyelled. \"Yes your majesty\"? He replied. \"Send down the Putty Patrol, I think we should test our new candidate\". She said, smiling wickedly. \"Yes ma'am\" said Finster as he fired <br>\r\n<br>\r\nup the monster making machine. \"I think I'll go as well and enjoy the show\". Rita said with a sneer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You turned down an alley, it was the normal <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshortcut you took to get home quicker. When you were halfway down the alleyway you were suddenly <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsurrounded by six gray looking men with ugly faces. They continued to jump around, wave their arms <br>\r\n<br>\r\nabout and yell. \"Hmph\"! Is all you say as you drop your tote bag to the ground and crack your <br>\r\n<br>\r\nknuckles. \"I've seen you guys before\" you say. \"Your the guys I've seen attacking the Power Rangers\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately for you guys\" you continue as you begin cracking your neck on one side, then the other, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not as forgiving as the Power Rangers\" you say raising a fist to them. \"A fight with me\" you say as <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou take a fighting stance, \"is a fight to the DEATH\"! You yell as you charge one of the putties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYAH\"! The putty was caught off guard as you give him an uppercut, sending flying a few feet back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more try to charge you from behind, but you see it coming and grab both of them by the neck and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nimmediately slam their heads into one another. They both flop on the ground as another putty comes up <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfrom behind and grabs you in a bear hug. Then another one comes at you with a flying kick. However, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou duck just in time and the putty ends up kicking the other putty who had you in a bear hug, breaking <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhis hold. You tuck and roll and turn to face the putty. The putty turns around in time to see your fist <br>\r\n<br>\r\nflying at him. \"AYA\"! You yell as your fist punches through the putty's chest. He collapses on the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nground and evaporates into a pile of gray goop. You turn to face the rest of the putties. \"So, who's <br>\r\n<br>\r\nnext\"? You say, blowing the gray dust from your knuckles. The five remaining putties take a step back <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand look at each other nervously. Never before have they fought someone so tenacious and merciless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then\" you say. \"If you won't come to me...then I'll come you\"! You charge at the putties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYAH\"! You kicked one of the putties heads clean off. He falls to the ground in a pile of goop just as <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe other had. Before the rest of them had time to react you swung around giving one of them a back <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfist to the head, again knocking it clean off. He too collapses into a pile pf gray goo. \"Heh, the way the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Rangers fight you guys I would've thought you were tougher than this\" you say arrogantly. The <br>\r\n<br>\r\nremaining three putties look at each other and nod. Then suddenly, they all charge at you. \"Bring it\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou say as you charge them as well. You jump in the air to perform a drop kick and kick both the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nputties on the left and right at the same time. Knocking both of their heads off. They both fall and turn <br>\r\n<br>\r\nto goo as you flip back and land on your feet. The last putty looks at you obviously scared as he scoots <br>\r\n<br>\r\nback against the wall of the building behind him. \"What's the matter\"? You say condescendingly, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the ones that challenged ME! And now that you're losing it's no fun anymore\". You continue to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwalk slowly towards him. The putty waves his arms at you in a plea for you spare him. \"I don't think so\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou say grabbing him by the neck and lifting him off his feet. You're going to have to finish what you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nstarted\" you say giving him a stern look. You raise your other fist and pull it back as you prepare to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfinish him. \"Goodbye\" you say in a monotone voice as you thrust your punch forward and punch clean <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthrough his head. He then finally collapses into a pile of goop just as the rest did. \"That wasn't nearly as <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhard as the Rangers make it look\" you say to yourself. \"Your perfect\"! you hear a feminine voice yell as <br>\r\n<br>\r\na mighty wind suddenly erupts. You then see a peculiarly dressed woman floating down from the sky <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwith a big wand in hand. \"Who might you be\"? You ask inquisitively. \"I am Rita Repulsa, Queen of <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness and future ruler of this world\" she says with a curtsy. \"Interesting\" you reply looking her up <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand down. \"Whoever you are, you're certainly easy on the eyes\" grabbing her hand and kissing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you\" she says. \"Am I safe in assuming your the one that sent those putties after me\"? You <br>\r\n<br>\r\nask. \"Yes\" she replies. \"But don't get the wrong idea, I was merely testing you, and you passed with <br>\r\n<br>\r\nflying colors my boy\". \"Why were you testing me exactly\"? \"To see if you were worthy of this...\" Said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita pulling out the Green Power Coin. \"And what's that\"? You ask. \"The key to the power of the Green <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanger\"! She replied showing it to you. Your eyes go wide realizing what it was. You look at it intently <br>\r\n<br>\r\nas if it were calling to you. \"I've seen the way you fight\" said Rita. \"I've seen your drive, your <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndetermination, and your tenacity. Your the perfect candidate to become the new Green Ranger\"! She <br>\r\n<br>\r\nexclaims. Your eyes begin to glow green as you react to the coin. You then shake your head \"Wait a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nminute. What's in it for me\"? You inquire. \"Ah, thinking of the benefits huh\"? Said Rita \"I like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell first off, you'll be a driving force in my conquering of the world and get a grand spot in my new <br>\r\n<br>\r\nworld order...and....\" she leaned in closer as to whisper in your ear. \"You'll get....to fight....the Power <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRangers\". That last part caught your attention as flashbacks of what you had said earlier today rushed <br>\r\n<br>\r\ninto your mind 'I'll prove I'm the strongest' rung in your head. \"You mean it\"? You ask. \"I'll get to test <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmy strength against the one and only Power Rangers\"? \"But of course\" she replied \"I want you to be <br>\r\n<br>\r\nable to prove that you are the strongest fighter in the world\" she said as if she could read your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you say? Will you become MY Power Ranger\"? She asked seductively.</span></div></div>",

'On the one <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhand, the power I've always wanted is finally within my grasp' you think. 'However, I'm not entirely <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsure I can trust this woman and she IS trying to take over the world and I don't know if I can support <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthat'. You continue to contemplate until you come to a decision. You look to her smiling and say \u201cYes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it means the chance to prove I'm the strongest, then yes, I will\u201d. \u201cHahahahaha\u201d! She laughs smiling <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwickedly. \u201cExcellent choice\u201d \u201cSo, how does this work? Do you say some sort of magic word or <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsomething\u201d? You ask. \u201cSimply take the Power Coin in your hand and let the power take you\u201d she <br>\r\n<br>\r\nexplained handing you the coin. \u201cSounds simple enough\u201d you reply taking the coin. You close your <br>\r\n<br>\r\neyes and grip the power coin firmly in your hand. Green sparks begin to shoot out from the coin and a <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngreen light envelops you. \u201cGRRAAAHHHH\u201d! You yell as you feel your newly endowed powers come<br>\r\n<br>\r\nrushing through every fiber of your being. Rita looks on with earnest to see your final transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, YES, accept the power and become MY new Green Ranger\u201d! She exclaims. Finally with sound <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlike the crackling of thunder, FWOOM! The transformation was complete. You open you eyes to see <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou are now in a green spandex suit, a golden chest plate strapped over your chest, white gloves and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nboots, and a green protective helmet on your head. You look to your hand to see that the coin is no <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlonger there. You look down to your waist to see it is now embedded in your belt buckle, you then see a <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngreen dagger in a holster on the side of your belt. \u201cThis...is....AMAZING\u201d! You exclaim looking at <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour hands as you clench them into fists. \u201cI could accomplish anything with this power, HHAAAA\u201d! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roar as you raise your fists to the air and green lightning sparks from your body. \u201cAnd you fill out <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe suit rather well\u201d said Rita looking at your butt. \u201cNow my Green Ranger, I shall draw the Power <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRangers out of hiding. Go and prepare yourself for the challenge you've been so desperately seeking\u201d.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my Queen\u201d you say with an evil smirk. Rita teleports back to her castle. \u201cGoldar\u201d! She yells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Empress\u201d he replied bowing. Go down to Angel Grove and have some fun.

They all come in at you from different directions with a wide array of different punches, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nstrikes, and kicks. You however, avoid all of their attacks with ease, dodging every blow. On the moon <br>\r\n<br>\r\nat Rita's palace, she watches your battle with great interest. \u201cThis is great, with any luck my strong and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhandsome Green Ranger will rid me of those pesky do gooders once and for all\u201d. \u201cYeah, I just wish we <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhad some popcorn to enjoy the sh-.......Wait.....what did you call him\u201d? Asked Squatt. \u201cUm, strong\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita said hesitantly. \u201cAfter that\u201d said Baboo. \u201cNone of your business\u201d! She yelled as she turned back to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nresume looking through her telescope at the battle below. \u201cYAWN\u201d you say nonchalantly as the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRangers continue their assault. \u201cGuess it's time for me to go on the offensive\u201d. You turn to face Billy <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe Blue Ranger since he was the closest to you at the moment. \u201cLights out, AYA\u201d! You yell striking <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhim with a two-handed strike combination to the gut and the face, which sends him flying back several <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfeet in a heap. \u201cBilly\u201d! Exclaimed Zach the Black Ranger. \u201cyou'll pay for that one, TAKE THIS\u201d! He <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyells running and jumping in the air to perform a flying side kick. But before he connects with it, you <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngrab him by his kicking leg with both hands. \u201cI don't think so, but whaddya say I take ya for a spin\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou say as you begin spinning Zach in circles fiercely. Increasing speed and momentum you release <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhim, sending him flying through a brick wall with a CRASH! \u201cOh no! Zach\u201d! Yelled Trini. \u201cCover me <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim, so I can get in close\u201d she said pulling out her sai. \u201cYou got it\u201d said Kimberly pulling out her bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrini rushed at you as Kim began firing energy arrows at you. However, PING PING PING! They all <br>\r\n<br>\r\nreflected off your golden chest plate with ease. \u201cHehe, nice try Pinky. Let's see how you handle this\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say as you rush at Trini, catching her by surprise with your amazing speed. \u201cGWAH\u201d! She screams <br>\r\n<br>\r\nas you clothesline her and secure her in a headlock. You continue your assault running at Kimberly <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwith Trini still in your headlock. You close in and grab Kimberly by the throat. \u201cGAH\u201d! She yells in <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshock. You lift both her and Trini off the ground by their necks. \u201cDon't worry ladies\u201d you say <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsarcastically. \u201cThere's plenty of me to go around\u201d. You then throw them both into the air, jump up and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM! You knee both of them in the face sending both of them soaring into the air even higher. You <br>\r\n<br>\r\nland perfectly and see both of them collapse on the ground unconscious. You then turn around and see <br>\r\n<br>\r\nboth Zach and Billy were unconscious as well. \u201cWell Red, looks like it's just you and me\u201d you say <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsmirking. \u201cHe's doing it! He's ACTUALLY doing it\u201d! Cheered Rita as she continued to look through <br>\r\n<br>\r\nher telescope. \u201cYeah! Go Green Ranger! Go Green Ranger\u201d! Cheered Squatt and Baboo waving <br>\r\n<br>\r\npompoms. \u201cYou won't get away with this\u201d! Yelled Jason clenching his fist in anger. \u201cYou think so <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhuh\u201d? You say calmly. \u201c well if you think you can beat with THAT pitiful power level you're sadly <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmistaken. But if you think you can, come prove it\u201d you say motioning for him to attack you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAARRRGH\u201d! Yelled Jason rushing at you sword in hand in a blind rage. He swings the blade at your <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhead and CHING! You easily catch the blade between your thumb and index fingers. Jason still <br>\r\n<br>\r\nstruggling to push the blade down on you says \u201cYou will pay\u201d with anger in his voice. \u201cI don't think so\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou reply smugly and SNAP! You snap his blade in two with your fingers. He takes a few steps back in <br>\r\n<br>\r\naw of your power. \u201cAllow me to take this opportunity to properly introduce myself\u201d you say as you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nslowly remove your helmet. \u201cI'm Ryan, Ryan Cordaine\u201d you say bowing. \u201cAnd as for you, well\u201d you <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncontinue as you raise your open hand aiming at Jason's chest. \u201cyour history\u201d you say with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen energy begins to form in your hand as lightning starts crackling around it. \u201cKYA\u201d! You yell as <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe energy blast bursts from your hand and makes a direct hit sending Jason flying back twenty feet and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nskidding along the pavement. You walk across the battlefield and stand over him. He groggily looks up <br>\r\n<br>\r\nat you, chest smoking, about to pass out himself from the impact of your last attack. \u201cW-what ARE <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou\u201d?  He asks fearing for his life and the lives of his friends. You look down at him and simply state as <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou aim your hand at him \u201cI'm the Green Ranger.....BITCH\u201d! Energy begins to form in your hand again <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfor your final attack. \u201cALPHA! Quickly teleport the Rangers back to the Command Center before it's <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntoo late\u201d! Said Zordon. \u201cYou got it Zordon\u201d! The robot exclaimed as he pressed a few keys on the <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncomputer. Back at the battlefield you say \u201cGoodbye, KIYA\u201d! You yell as you fire another energy blast, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut just as it was about to connect, Jason and the other Rangers vanished in flashing lights of their <br>\r\n<br>\r\nrespective colors. You look around to see that they were all gone. \u201cHey Goldar\u201d! You yell. \u201cWhat the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhell happened\u201d? You say confused. \u201cIt must have been that meddling Zordon\u201d! He yelled in anger. You <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwalk across the battlefield and pick up your helmet. \u201cWhatever the case, let's get back to Empress Rita <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand figure this out\u201d you say as you and Goldar are enveloped in a green light and are teleported back to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita's palace.</span></div></div>",

A few hours later, after everyone <br>\r\n<br>\r\nregained consciousness, they all returned to the main room of the Command Center so that Zordon <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncould explain. \"Zordon\" Jason began. \"What the heck happened back there?

Just do as we do. It's morphing time!\" Jason shouts, but before he can continue suddenly-<br>\r\n\"Stegosaurus!\" You cut ahead of him, as if it were a natural reflex. Suddenly you feel a huge amount of energy build up inside you, a black armour-suit similar to the others' fall upon you, a helmet looking like a lizards head, with huge spines going over it like a stegosaurus...and continuing down your back! Luckily they're not as big as you'd think. <br>\r\n\"...Zordon what happened? His suit is different from ours...\" Jason asks as Zordon looks down in amazement.<br>\r\n\"He has been chosen as an S-list ranger, his suit now gives him certain powers, and because he is of the stegosaurus, he has increased endurance during battle. But now's not the time to go into great detail, you must go before Angel Grove is destroyed!\" Before anyone can reply, you are whooshed up into the air again and are racing back to Angel Grove.<br>\r\n\"Where're we going?\" Kimberly asks.<br>\r\n\"To save the world!\" Jason replies. <br>\r\nBefore long you're in the streets, huge amounts of the strange creatures again attacking innocent civilians.  <br>\r\n\"Putties!\" Trinni exclaims.<br>\r\n\"Okay guys, we need to focus on taking out these guys-\"<br>\r\n\"And saving the civilians.\" You add.<br>\r\n\"Good call, we would'nt be heroes if we didn't save anyone right?\" Billy backs you up.<br>\r\n\"Let's go guys!\" Everyone moves out, taking out groups of putties like nothing.<br>\r\n\"They're nothing compared to us!\" Jason exclaims out of confidence.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" Trinni shouts as she points over to a pram, up above on a building, a strange creature that looks like a Golem is about to drop down a taxi onto the pram. <br>\r\n\"Try and save this child rangers, bwabwabwabwa!\" The Golem mocks the rangers as it drops the taxi.<br>\r\n\"Not on my watch!\" You shout as you run over and jump into the path of the taxi, you think that this will hurt like mad...but instead the taxi bounces off your back like rubber.<br>\r\n\"Oh my baby! Th-thank you! Thank you!\" The mother repeats herself, running over and taking out her baby before running off.<br>\r\n\"That was real heroic off you Adam...\" Trinni compliments you, affection in her voice.<br>\r\n\"Good job man!\" Jason adds, giving you a slap on the arm as everyone else runs over.<br>\r\n\"Bwabwabwa! No way, nobody is more sturdy than me!\" The Golem jumps down, causing an earthquake as he lands.<br>\r\n\"Whoa-whoaaaaaaa! This guy must be causing the earthquakes!\"  Kimberly states as the group almost falls over. <br>\r\n\"Bwabwabwa, now for the first and final strike spike-boy!\" The Golem charges at you as the other jump out of the way.<br>\r\n\"Watch out!\" Billy shouts at you, but all you do is hold out your palm, catching the punch.<br>\r\n\"Ngh! Nggggggghffff! Bwhat is this!?\" The Golem whines as he tries to push you back.<br>\r\n\"Evil begone!\" You throw the Golem back into the wall in front of you.<br>\r\n\"Bwaaaaaaah!\" *THWATOH!* \"Ohhhh...\" The Golem wobbles about as it gets up while the others gather round you.<br>\r\n\"All right!\"<br>\r\n\"You're on a roll!\"<br>\r\n\"Bwabwa...behhhh...I don't get...this...\"<br>\r\nMeanwhile at Rita's moonbase.<br>\r\n\"Gaaaahhhh!

It'll crush him no matter how hard his back is.\"<br>\r\n\"Aha! Of course, Magic Wand, make my monster grow!\" As Rita throw her wand down to earth, the Golem grows to Titan size.<br>\r\n\"BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Try to stop me now spike-boy.\" You look up at the towering monster but try to stay strong.<br>\r\n\"...looks like we need Dinosaur power...um...come Stegosaurus!\" Suddenly from outside the city, Stegosaurus, black body, trimmed silver with glowing purple eyes and spines, comes running into the city.<br>\r\n\"Whoa, that's a zord?\" Kimberly asks as everyone looks up at your zord.<br>\r\n\"Okay...guess I have to jump?\" You jump up at the zord as the same power that zoomed you to the desert sends you into the cockpit of your zord. <br>\r\n\"Stegosaurus zord, take him out!\" At your command, Stegosaurus charges at the Golem knocking it into the ground. <br>\r\n\"I'll lend you a hand man! Come on, we need dinosaur power now!\" Jason shouted as the Tyrannosaurus zord comes running into the city, Jason jumps into it as Tyranno zord walks up to Stegosaurus zord.<br>\r\n\"I have an idea, Jason, can you swing us into that thing?\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, hope you know what you're doing man...let's do this! Go Tyrannosaurus!\" <br>\r\n\"Adam, if you can get Stegosaurus to curl up as it flies into that rock creature it's spines will deal critical damage.\" Billy suggested as Tyrannosaurus grabbed a hold of Stegosaurus' tail.<br>\r\n\"Got it, okay ready?  Go, Prehistoric Punt!\" Tyrannosaurus swinged Stegosaurus around, letting go at full speed, Stegosaurus is launched at the Golem as it curls up into a spiky ball.<br>\r\n\"Bwaaaaaaagh! No! I only just started causing-auggggggggggh!\" Stegosaurus sends the Golem flying, sparks coming out of it. Tyrannosaurus and Stegosaurus pose as the Golem explodes in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater de-morphed and back at the juice bar, everyone is watching the news. <br>\r\n\"And so Angel Grove was saved, according to witness reports, by warriors in colourful suits as-well as mechanical dinosaurs. Well whoever they are, they have Angel grove's thanks for saving countless lives.\" <br>\r\n\"Well guys, looks like we might have to keep this going, with Rita on the loose an' all.\" Jason stated.<br>\r\n\"As long as we do it together, Rita will always fail.\" You add while Trini looks over.<br>\r\n\"You were so heroic out there Adam...you're even the one who took out that thing.\"<br>\r\n\"With Billy and Jason's help.\" You reply.<br>\r\n\"Zordon was right, you ARE honest.\" Jason commented as the group giggled. Suddenly Bulk and Skull walk in.<br>\r\n\"Well well, if it ain't the transfer kid, ain't you cool hanging out with these geeks?\" Bulk remarks as Skull looks over his shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, ain't ya?\" Bulk gives Skull a fierce look as Skull backs off.<br>\r\n\"Look you guys, we aren't looking for trouble so just leave us alone okay?\" Kimberly asks as the daring duo walk around to you.<br>\r\n\"Hey we only want to help out the new kid right Skull?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bwahahahaha.\" <br>\r\n\"Bet you know karate like all these other guys huh?\"<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact I do.\" You retort as Bulk steps back.<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh, then show me.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay...\" You get up, walk over and do a high kick, thinking that will settle Bulk's curiosity.<br>\r\n\"Heh, that's nothing, and here we thought you were a dark belt.\"<br>\r\n\"Black belt you idiot.\" Bulk corrects Skull as he pushes you out of the way.<br>\r\n\"But he's right, even I can do something like that.\" You walk back to your seat and watch.<br>\r\n\"Huaaaaaiiiyaaaa!\" Bulk attempts to do a high kick but his leg only goes half as high and he ends up falling backwards into Ernie holding a cake. Bulk falls onto the floor, icing and bits of cake all over him as   everyone laughs, except Ernie who's shaking his head.<br>\r\n\"You better not make a habit of this Bulk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Cue credits for episode*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanna make a move...but who are you planning on dating?</span></div></div>",

They wouldn't attack their friends...\" The shadowy figure suggested.<br>\r\n\"Ah yes of course! Brilliant idea! Now let's see...\" Rita began as she walked over to her telescope. <br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm?

The plucky automaton punches a few buttons, and finds five teens inside the Angel Grove Youth Center. The five teens were Jason: the headstrong, compassionate, loyal would-be leader; Billy: The intelligent, shy, but agile tech specialist; Zack: The fun-loving, level-headed comedian; Kimberly: the pretty, naive, yet strong gymnast. The fifth member was to be Trini, however Rita Repulsa had other plans. On her castle on the moon, she spies these events taking place and knows Zordon will likely form his Power Rangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goldar! Where's that talisman?!\" The stout, shrieking witch shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, my queen. This talisman has been in your collection for millenia.

But, since you asked, This talisman will be my key to Zordon's undoing! It not only will make sure a different teen is teleported, it will forever imprint the child with a trait that will ultimately render whatever team Zordon creates into nothing but a gang of rowdy teenagers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita wasted no time and flung the talisman toward Earth. Just as Alpha sent the signal to bring the teens in, the talisman worked its magic! Instead of Trini, Alpha ended up teleporting a girl who was in the gym's locker room. She was surprised to find herself alongside four people she'd never met before. What's worse, she was only wearing a towel! As the boys looked around at the gadgets, Kimberly noticed the odd girl wearing very little clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there.

Do not fear it.\" Zordon explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five teens turned to look at a large white sphere on a pedestal. It appeared to be a normal globe around a lightbulb. However, as they gazed into it, they started to views images not unlike a VCR. It was snowy at first, but the picture became clear. It showed a manin a white robe waving his staff before a great white flash went off, and a sparkling ball flew from the staff into a woman wearing a horned hat and brown robes. The woman was gone in a flash, and the sparkling ball zoomed and deposited itself in a small gold container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"During my final battle with Rita Repulsa, I wasn't able to defeat her, but instead imprisoned her in that dumpster, hoping she would never escape. Unfortunately, she has come back, and that is why I've called upon you five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we supposed to fight against a witch if she's too powerful even for you?!\" Zack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With these!\" Zordon bellowed for dramatic effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, five small objects appeared on the console. Each was a silvery metal gadget that was an inch think and four inches across and two and a half inches long. They were octagonal by shape, and in the middle there was a round piece of what looked to be bronze. Each one had a different animal stamped on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are your power morphers.\" Zordon explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morph?\" Kim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Metamorphosis.

Afterward, you re-group with your teammates and celebrate your victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that was awesome!\" Zack cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, these suits work great!\" Billy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lexie, how are you?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's fine. seems that even though she isn't wearing anything, nothing can touch her. I'm fine by the way.\" Kim commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that true?\" Jason asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's like I'm wearing a suit, but I'm not. It's not like an invisible suit, cuz I don't feel anything on my body. It's like a force filed or shield.\" You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zordon, if you can hear us, can you explain what's going on?\" Jason yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can hear you Jason. While you're in those suits, I can listen to your conversations. It seems what Lexie is experiencing is a slight loophole in the power coins' power. The symbol on your morphers are more than decoration. They are what give you power. It creates the suits and grants you extra strength and stamina during particularly strenuous battles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the lecture, but in case you haven't noticed, Angel Grove is being terrorized by a giant flying ape!\" Zack interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just about to get to that. Your power coins also power the greatest weapon we have in fighting against Rita's creations. That monster terrorizing the city is named Goldar, and he is Rita's closest advisor. She has used her magic to make him grow. In order to fight back, you merely need to call upon your Zords.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zords?\" Billy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are fierce, fighting machines that that take the form of the animal on your power coins, and each of you is assigned one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, but how do we call upon them?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simply announce that you need their help. They will immediately come to assist you.\" Zordon explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, guys. Let's do this.\" Jason says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need DinoZord power now!\" You all shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom seemingly out of nowhere, you hear a rumble. The thundering Zords suddenly appear n the horizon, from different locations before arriving right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, they're HUGE!\" Zack shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we'd better get acquainted.\" Billy said, stepping closer to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rangers, you must pilot the Zords. Leap onto their heads and enter the cockpit.\" Zordon explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I guess we'll just jump five five to ten stories into the air and hope we land on our Zord.\" You comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" Jason asks everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all jump into the air, and miraculously, you're drawn straight to your giant yellow Sabertooth Tiger. You open a hatch and jump, landing right into a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it's like it fits perfectly.\" You comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and the controls are very intuitive. It's almost second nature to me.\" Billy adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's fight this guy!' Jason announces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of you do your best to fight Goldar, but his swift movements and swordfighting skills are too good for your Zords. He easily fends off all your attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zordon, something's wrong. We aren't winning!\" Kim yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the event that your Zords aren't enough, they can be combined to form the MegaZord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would've been helpful a few minutes ago.\" Zack quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's see if this works.\" Jason says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of you find a crystal on your armrest and a slot opens for you to insert it into the console in front of you. Inserting the crystal immediately initiates the MegaZord sequence. Slowly, each of your Zords slides into place, creating a large humanoid robot. To your surprise, you're now all in a large control room, however something is different...</span></div></div>",

You extend your arms, ready for the impact, but then you see the fist suddenly move away, followed by another robotic hand next to it. You then get an idea. You move your right arm down, and you see the robot hand do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lexie, you've figured out that the MegaZord responds to your movements.\" Zordon commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the deal, Zordon? How come she is the only one who controls this thing while we just sit here?\" Zack asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. The MegaZord was originally designed for all of you to work together. It seems Rita's talisman was able to change the controls so she has to do the fighting. I trust that all of you will help her control the MegaZord so you can work together and defeat Goldar.\" Zordon explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. I can't even figure out how to turn my coffeemaker on, and now I'm in control of a giant robot.\" you comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kick!\" Jason orders, and you kick with your left leg, sending Goldar stumbling backward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow in the heat of battle, you let go of your modesty and nervousness. You tune out everyone's yelling and concentrate on defeating Goldar. you block and punch and kick, but then his sword hits you, making you stumble backward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you need a more powerful attack, summon the Power Sword!\" Zordon chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need Power Sword power now!!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a silver sword drops from the sky! You try to catch it,but it flies out of your reach and lands behind you, embedding itself in the ground. You turn around and bend over to pull the sword from the ground. Behind you, Zack whispers to Jason and Billy how they can totally see everything thanks to your posture. Kim scoffs and clears her throat, alerting you to the show you were inadvertently putting on. You pull the sword from the ground and about to strike when Goldar simply vanishes out of thin air. You stand limply, not sure what to do when you're suddenly teleported back to the command center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job, Lexie! You won the fight against Goldar, but I'm sure Rita has some other plans up her sleeve.\" Zordon explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now? Those Zords are still out there.\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Jason. They'll be just fine. Once you are teleported back here, they'll return to wherever they came from. As for what to do now, you may go back to your lives and act like this never happened. When Rita shows up again, I will alert you. Be sure not to tell anyone that you are the Power Rangers. It not only protects you, but them as well.\" Zordon continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will we know if we are needed again?\" Billy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will alert you viathese communicators.\" Zordon answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of light appeared and on a small table looked to be a set of five metallic bracelets. A metallic dome was positioned in the middle of the strap, like a wrist watch. Everyone took one and fastened it around their wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will alert you with a beep from these communicators. You can press the button on the side to talk, and either Alpha or I will tell you what to do. Farewell Rangers, until we need you again.\" Zordon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I'm still...\" you begin, but are cut off when you are teleported back to Angel Grove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Naked.\" you finish as you look around you.

You sigh as you realize you have to get home. You look around for anything that will cover you, finding a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least this day can't get any worse.\" You say to yourself as you cautiously exit the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into the dark room, not surprised since the center is closed at this time. You hope you can make your way to the exit and get home without anyone seeing you. However, you're surprised when the lights suddenly come on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise!\" you hear a crowd cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your surprise, you let out a yelp and clasp your hands to your face, causing your towel to drop tot he floor.

All of you realize you're standing there naked in front of them, and you finally try to cover yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not a secret nudist, are you?\" Kim jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...\" You squeak out, trying to reach for the towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave it, it's fine. We've seen all of you already. When we were teleported back here, we wanted to do something special for you to say that you're one of us. I was hoping that it would give you a chance to get to know us with your clothes on, but it seems that's out of the question now.\" Jason explained, holding up a pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow guys, I'm...this is so unexpected!\" You beam with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can do this another time if you're uncomfortable.\" Jason offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mull it over before deciding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To hell with it.

Make sure my Ranger is ready to be deployed ASAP!!\" she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoldar left and went to the laboratory, where on the slab was a pulsing green form in the vague shape of a human. A Power Coin was mounted on a stand in the corner, beaming its light onto the humanoid. Goldar walked over to look things over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, this evil Green Ranger will prove no match for Zordon's Rangers.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goldar!!

Kimberly must be slightly more petite, since the clothes she gave her turned out to be a tight fit. Luckily, the tank top was stretchy enough to encapsulate Lexie's ample breasts. The shorts were made of a spandex-like material that was able to stretch in all directions, affording Lexie the cover she sought. Of course, te tightness came with its own problems. Even though neither garment showed any signs of straining or tearing, the fact remained that her anatomy was pressed against a thin layer of clothing. Her nipples poked through the tank top, and their dark pink color was slightly noticeable. Further, the shorts hugged her curvy hips and outlined her backside very nicely. The only drawback was the very noticeable cameltoe in the front. No matter what Lexie dd, her front cleft was going to be on display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexie bit her lip and hoped no one but Kimberly would see her. She emerged from the locker room, and all the guys noticed how her clothes hugged her like a second skin.

Your name is Brevin Vice and your good friends with jayden and Antonio, the red and gold samurai rangers. your 17, you have not seen your friends since you were nine. you have been in china studying martial arts, you are a master in 3 styles of kung fu. you used wolf, bat and horse style, to befit your zords. These zords and their disc where going away presents from jayden, Antonio, and your first sensei. you got them back plus your new morpher when you were ready to return to the states. you had just gotten your bags and made sure your stuff was all there for you had made a list. you had two copies of said list, one english the other japanese, you had learned the language from your teachers, as well as how to use a sword. you took a taxi to get to the dojo. when you got there you saw 4 unfamiliar faces. by eavesdropping you learned the blonde Swedish guy was Tyler the green ranger. the dark haired Australian guy was Donny the blue ranger. the brunette farm girl was Lilly the pink ranger. And lastly Jonie the blonde was the yellow ranger. you then saw jayden and Antonio in full armor walk out with sensei yelling about a nighlok alert. you smiled, this was your chance to surprise them. while the others morphed and ran, you walked up to sensei and told him who you where. of course sensei was glad to see you and said you should join the others against the nighlok attack. \" yes sensei\", you said. you ran onto the street and pulled your morpher. \" its morphin' time\" you shouted. then you where clothed in a plack uniform the the symbol for darkness on your mask. you ran to the fight, and got there just as a goon was sneakin up on jayden. No, you thought, pulling explosion symbol power to attack the goon. It shot out like a rocket and then...</span></div></div>",

Instead the shot hit what looked like a tree until it turned threw seeds at you which made more moogers, which the others except for jay and Antonio went to fight. One weakness you always had wrote to sensei and your friends about was, you cant use your symbol power without physically draining your self a bit. You spent hours trying to beat that weakness, and always woke up in your room. Jaden and Antonio rushed to your side as soon as they recognized your black symbol power. 'Brevin, you OK me amigo?', Antonio asked. 'I'm fine, really'. <br>\r\n'No your not, morphing and explosion you used symbol twice', jaden said. 'Plus, I actually used super speed to get from, the airport to the dojo, then used the last of it to get to the fight', you said meekly. '3 times?!? How are you still on your feet?', jaden asked. 'I've gotten stronger since my last letter to you guys', you explained. Meanwhile the tree monster was making more and more moogers. 'Jaden have the others move, I have a plan', jaden seemed uneasy at first but you gave him a thumbs up, and he nodded pushing a comm button on his mask and mumbling a fallback and regroup command. Four bright flashes later the others were behind you as well, and jaden did a round of introductions. You then took your morphed and put up a symbol power you developed in japan. A wave of energy, picking up degree and starting fires and small earthquakes had appeared and all that was heard was screaming and breaking bones. After it was over as you thought there was charred earth, blood and bones everywhere and fires. The other rangers seemed terrified,'glad you moved now huh?', you said. 'I call it 'Vince wipeout', cool right?' Then small tremors came out of nowhere, 'we have bigger problems' jaden said. Then the tree nighlok appeared as a giant. 'Time for mega mode power', jaden said. As they each picked a zord you chose yours it was..</span></div></div>",

You stood proudley inside your zord, ' lefts rock wolf-zord', you said. The nighlok seemed, interested in you but ignored the others, who formed a mega-zord together and were obviousley confused that, the tree was ignoring them. But you understood completely, you called jaden,' J you thinking what I'm thinking?' 'Unfortunately, I think I am, he wants to test your strength for xandred, so he will ignore us completely.' 'Stand down guys', you said hearing protest followed by jaden encouraging words, everyone wished you luck, then the megazord dissapeared. 'So, it is down to you, and it is down to I, Treebora!', the nighlok roared. You needed an attack plan, and you knew it. Then an interesting idea came to mind, it would help since you were basically on your own. 'Wolf-zord, converge!', you say defiantley, the machine changed shape, taking a more human stance. 'Wolf-zord, beast warrior mode!', you were not done though. 'Bat-zord converge!', your bat companion, to your enemies surprise, turned into a sword with a glowing blue blade. 'But let me guess, you want me at my current best right Treebora?', you asked. The nighlok nodded slowly, very slowly. 'Right then, wake up horse-zord!', you shout, the warrior wolf-zord climbed atop the horse sword held high. 'Behold, I present to you the wild-heart samurai trimegazord', you say proudly. 'Let us begin ranger!', Treebora roared, charging at you. You charged back, sword to a point, then you jump over the nighlok, turn around and slash across his back. You smile until, the mark healed! 'Ha, fool a sword like that is useless against me', Treebora said, he then grabbed your sword and snapped it in half. Then he trashed the horse zord, from right under you. The wolf-zord fell to the ground, and turned to normal mode. You held your other zords in your hand, they needed rest. 'Come on Brevin think, he's gotta have a weakness. My sword didn't work, so that's out. He's a plant nighlok, he has immense strength, wait! That's it he's a plant', you say most triumphantley. The other rangers watched, as Treebora moved in for the final blow. A bright light then surged throughout the area, blinding the nighlok, you stood strong knowing you had him beat. Using symbol power, the wolf-zord was blessed with the power of fire. You attacked the nighlok leaving scratches that burned, and did not heal. 'No, impossible', Treebora roared as you attacked him more and more. 'One more hit, and your done Treebora', you said to the charred nighlok. 'Who are you?', he said weakley. 'I'm the black ranger, and your dust', you said. As the wolf-zord finished, preparing his attack, the nighlok was sucked into a red portal and dissapeared. You then joined the other rangers, 'what happened? Where did he go?', you demanded. 'Xandred called him back to the sanzu river, they will heal him and he will come back', jaden said. You then realized how weak you felt, and you collapsed to the ground. 'Brevin? Brevin?, oh god!', you heard Antonio scream, as you reached the ground blacking out. <br>\r\n*Meanwhile, back at the sanzu river* 'Thank you master, for saving me. Next time the black ranger will fall', Treebora said. 'See to it he does, we will cover for your vulnerability to fire next time', Xandred said. 'In the mean time, just heal', Octoroo said.<br>\r\n*Back with the rangers* The rangers were all brimming with worry at your condition. 'He will be stronger next time', Jonie said. 'Brevin or the nighlok?', jaden asked. 'I'm talking about the nighlok', Jonie replied. 'We'll train Brevin then, he has to get stronger to', Antonio said.</span></div></div>",

And the deer zord was never left behind. But 4 zords are sealed on earth that only the deer zord can find, he will only find them for the new ranger. The 4 zords are, boar, hippopotamus, owl, and raccoon. The story starts with the princess, talking with 5 zords about a 7th ranger. The zords are, deer, gorilla, elephant, and the bear brothers.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The princess woke with a start, looking at the clock Cole gave her. Its 2:47 am, but the princess could not sleep. She heard cries from outside, so she put on her traditional dress and grabbed a candle. Walking outside, she was surprised to see 5 zords just outside the temple. Her shock turned to fear and concern, when she saw how upset and nervous they seemed. The gorilla zord, reached out and lifted the princess up to the roof. <br>\r\n The princess looked to her zords, she knew they needed to speak with her. \"What's wrong dearies? Tell me what's the matter\", princess shayla said. The zords look to the princess, then deerzord spoke in zord tongue. The princess could not believe what she heard. \"A new ranger? Are you sure?\", shayla asked them. Then lights came in from all over the island, some coming from the five zords the princess could see. The lights formed a floating orb, which took on a flowing shape the princess recognized.<br>\r\n \"A morpher?\", she asked as the zords nodded. They gave her instructions to follow, then left to go back to bed except the deerzord who slept in the yard. The princess was gonna follow the instructions, but one quick issue. She was stuck on the roof, so she needed help. \"Merrick! Merrick! Come help me!\", she bellowed. \"Princess? Princess, where are you?\", Merrick called. He saw the princess waving at him, from the roof?!? \"Princess, how did you get up there?\", Merrick asked. The princess told him what happened, and Merrick was intrigued about the morpher. He fetched the ladder, and helped her down.<br>\r\n The princess approached the sacred water, and dips the new morpher in. The water glowed, and the morpher glowed and gained a look, to befit its new ranger master. \"Deerzord said that this morpher, will be he key to obtaining missing animal crystals\", shayla said. The water revealed an image of a young human mortal, the princess knew this was the new ranger.<br>\r\n However, the princess had an unwanted visitor. An org spy sent an image of the vision to his master, before heading out on his hover bike. However, gorillazord smashed the hover device from under him. Rhinozord slammed the spy over the edge of the island, sending him to his death. <br>\r\n The next morning, you walked downtown to start your job as a cafe cashier. You don't wanna screw your first day. You turn a corner, and see a bunch of grey creatures! One points at you and you run, you ran straight home. You look out and see them following, its like they knew who you where. 'What is happening', you think. Then suddenly the power rangers started fighting the grey things, out of nowhere!<br>\r\n But what's got you, is one ranger is guiding a women in a white dress and flowery crown towards your house. After they are out of view, you hear your doorbell. You answer and find the ranger, standing at your door. You let him into your house, along with the woman who was holding a box. <br>\r\n The woman tells you, she is a princess who helps the rangers. She says also that, she knows who you are just like the grey creatures. She says you were chosen, to do a special mission. You ask her what it is, why were you chosen and chosen b who?<br>\r\n She smiles sweetly at you. \"Well...</span></div></div>",

I mean sure, I've got a black belt in karate. But I can't take on such a responsibility, not without thinking first. I gotta go to work now\", you told them. The princess was concerned, this was not what she had expected to happen. She left the morpher with a note, on your living room coffee table. \"He will come around\", she said calmly. <br>\r\n \"Princess, is it not strange that we fought no giant monsters today? What aim did those goons have?\", asked the red ranger, Cole. The princess simply continued to watch the sacred water, obviously she was troubled. After everyone left, Cole and the princess had been left alone. Cole was bored, he wanted to train. But he also was, worried for the princess and what upsets her. Eventually the princess turned to Cole, she decided to gain his aid. <br>\r\n \"Cole, I think I could use your help. There is an urgent matter, I need you to help me\", the princess said to Cole. \"Then how can I refuse? What do you need of me princess?\", Cole asked kindly. \"I need you to watch this boy for me . Its very important, the orgs want to harm him.\" The princess showed Cole the image of you, you were working briskly at the shop. \"I don't understand, he seems so normal.\" \"Looks are deceiving Cole, keep an eye on him whenever possible.\" \"Yes princess, as you wish.\" <br>\r\n You meanwhile, had an excellent first day at work. When you got home, you saw a note on the table. It said, 'if you change your mind the morpher will guide you.' You picked up the morpher. When you did, you heard what seemed like a voice. You reached out to hear it, and you saw bright lights. \"I am the deerzord\", said the voice. \"I must guide you, to find the four crystals of four missing zords.\"<br>\r\n You left your house, to track down the first crystal: boar. Cole followed you, but lost you at a fork in the road just out of town. He picked the wrong road, as you went to dead oak tree that had a  heart shape. You smashed it with your morpher, and reached to pull out a crystal. <br>\r\n Cole was freaking out, he backtracked a mile and saw you running to the river. He followed you, but you had already gotten the crystal for hippopotamus by sticking both hands in the river. But Cole was following orders to keep an eye on you, so he kept running after you. You made a stop, at an abandoned animal nest and pulled your morpher and a light shone from inside the nest. You reached in and a spiritual raccoon, gave you the crystal and a thumbs up. <br>\r\n Cole followed you still, he was wondering what all the running was for. But you were taking a break from running, to climb the tallest tree in turtle cove! Cole reached the clearing the tree was in, after losing track of you again. He decided to climb the tree to look for you, just as you reached the top to see an owl shrine. When you grabbed the crystal, the shrine vanished. You started back down, Cole scrambled down when he saw you to stay out of sight.<br>\r\n The deerzord told you to take the crystals, and go to a cave at the top of a cliff. There, he said the zords would channel their share of power into the morpher. Cole was exhausted, he called the princess and told her how tired he was getting from chasing you all over turtle cove. The princess told him to come back, and get some rest. <br>\r\n Cole passed out in his bed, and the four other rangers asked the princess what he had done.The princess said, Cole was on an important observation mission for her. The rangers asked what it was, but got no answer.<br>\r\n You found the cave around midnight, you went inside to finish what you started. \"Place the crystals in the four corners, of the chamber\", deerzord said. You followed his instructions, then waited for the next step. Deerzord said to recite a spell, that would transfer the shares of power, and allow the four zords to awaken on the anamarium. \"Ancient rangers! The test of the lost four is done, let the light shine on my source of power! Let me walk, in the footsteps of those who came before me!\", you shouted. <br>\r\n On the anamarium, the princess saw the 4 lost zords appear. She looked to the deerzord, who nodded to her in confirming. Back in the chamber, 4 white lights flew into your morpher which began to shine brightly. \"Good, now you simply must morph, and your are an official ranger. But be warned, if you finish the ritual there is no going back,\", deerzord said to you.<br>\r\n \"I came this far, I'm finishing what I started! GOLDEN ACCESS!\", you shout. On the annimaruim, the princess was walking by the sacred water. Suddenly, a flash of golden light came from the water! The princess knew what was happening, she called and yelled for Merrick and Cole. \"Boys, the gold ranger is ready, go find him!\",  the princess said as the two ran out. But Cole didn't understand what, this was about, what gold ranger?<br>\r\n Meanwhile after you triggered your morpher, things got real trippy. You saw hundreds of glowing animals, running right at you! But each one dissapeared in a flash of golden light, just as they are about to make impact. You meanwhile, had started feeling excruciating pain. It felt like, a mysterious force was trying to explode inside you! Your skin was burning and sizzling, like you were being cooked alive! <br>\r\n A bright light had appeared after you triggered the morphing sequence, but you didn't see it. The light flared through the whole cave, it charged into the sky like a shining pillar. It glowed so brightly it was like a sun, making midnight shine like it was noon. Everyone in turtle cove was awakened by this light, they looked at it in awe. Many were taking video footage or taking photos of the event. Animals, whether tamed or wild panicked. They panicked because the light was so bright, and continued to panic as it would not stop.<br>\r\n Merrick and Cole, looked in wonder at this amazing pillar of light. The princess, as well as the four other rangers had begun looking from the annimarium. The light was amazing, the princess was in wander, the four rangers asked wildly what was happening. Master org meanwhile, was observing the light from his lair. He sent goons out, to get a close look at the light. A small army of goons, about 40 had shone up just as Cole and Merrick were landing. <br>\r\n As soon as Cole and Merrick showed up, the goons were on the attack. Meanwhile, the pain, animals, and lights all stopped and faded. You made your way to the exit quietly. 'No turning back', you thought. Outside, the goons didn't see the light fade nor did Merrick or Cole. But everyone else did. You then stepped out, glowing just like the pillar. Everyone stopped to look at you, so an intro is needed. \"Angry boar! Golden ranger.... wild force!\", you shout. Then the goons charged, but you weren't running. You went in, charging like a mad beast. <br>\r\n Eventually all the goons were down or retreating, then Cole and Merrick approached you. \"So you're the one the princess had me watch right?\", Cole asked. You nodded, explaining that deerzord gave you the heads up. You all took off then, heading to the annimarium.<br>\r\n When you arrived, the four other rangers bombarded the lunar and red rangers with questions not seeing you apparently. The princess came out, and she did see you. Once the others did, they were in awe of your golden armor. After de-morphing, you explained your day to everyone. The black ranger commented, saying you had quite the day. You nodded, then passed out.</span></div></div>",
