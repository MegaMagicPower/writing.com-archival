Despite the hundred years of interstellar travel and the spread of human presence amongst the stars; there was still more to learn on the long-term effects of development of the human mind and body while stationed in space. A routine checkup on the children of the Guinevere was absolutely standard; to ensure the rollout of rations and equipment for the day to keep the kids occupied, with Randall Kaufman, dutifully accepting the responsibility of overseeing the Mars room for an entire peta-cycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors to the Mars room open, revealing a medium sized lounging zone decorated with several chairs and a large table rested in the middle. An oval window reavealed the vast view of space and the nearby planet -- Ulin'Tahn. He enter's the room and is immediately greeted by one of the nurses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, Mr. Kaufman.\" Nurse Julie nods, she gently interlocks her hands and straightens her posture. \"Here for a routine checkup of the children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Business as usual,\" He chuckles, stepping forward with a checklist in hand, \"I'm here to also deliver the new ration cards. The dispencer for the protein gel malfuctioned and a replacement will be sent out from the surface of Ulin'Tahn soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Nurse Julie felt her cheeks redden, \"The malfunction of the protein dispencer was most unfortunate. I don't know what went wrong. I couldn't possibly give an explanation. The children were saddened to hear they wouldn't receive their favourite nutrient for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are the kids?\" Randal asked, he slowly walked over to a nearby terminal and began accessing the room's information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd like, we can bring them from their resting pods.\" Nurse Jolie responded, \"There hasn't been a proper inspection since the last cycle. I'm sure it'll jog their memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful.\" Randal clapped his hands, smiling. \"An inspection. It's been a while since I've seen them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse quickly leaves through one of the sliding doors; leaving Randal to wait for a few minutes before hearing the familiar voices of children and the nurse herself. He readies his checklist and begins to ready his pen.</span></div></div>",

The children -- despite being placed in educational ship with the best learning equipment known to humans everywhere -- were developmentally behind in ways that would make most parents worried. The children slowly toddled in, waddling with obvious thick bulges underneath their jumpsuits as their focus on the holo-projector was above everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All seven,\" Nurse Jolie called, she entered last with the final child holding her hand. She stood before Randall and presented one of the girls, only to be met with a shy reaction as she hid behind Nurse Jolie's leg. \"This is Chirran. She's one of the brightest, but happens to be a little shy -- as you can see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child beared tattoo-like markings across her face, light blue in tone, with silver hair and a bright set of orange eyes. A gentle crouching motion by Randall allowed him to get a better look at her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Chil'uluan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Nurse Jolie replied, \"The warrior humans. Hailing from Arcturus IV, their young are marked with tattoo's -- being a mark for their family symbol.\" She stepped aside, removing Chirran's sudden protection against Randall and stood; vacantly staring at the inspector with a half-open mouth, lightly humming in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Chirran.\" Randal introduced himself, smiling. \"I'm Randall. Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She hasn't learned many words,\" Nurse Jolie added, her usual smile dropped. \"Nine years of age. I'm afraid to say her development has been slow; but much quicker than the others. She's polite, can keep her attention for much longer than the others and happens to be on the edge of feeding herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas; to Randall, the group of children were the latest in a long line of test subjects to undergo resistance to cosmic radiation and the unexplained forces of space. Their development was impaired, slower and more rigourous. Instead of the civilised, intelligent and well-behaved children they were originally supposed to be -- the group resembled an overgrown group of toddlers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job had to be done. It was time for Randall to spend time with several of the children and review their development since the last recorded cycle.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Especially given the archive of recently-discovered planets hadn't lead to a discovery as fascinating as this one in years. The planet, Aphios, a lush forest planet seemed to be piquing the interest of the brightest minds across the Human Continuum due to an unsual discovery. The discovery; being a energy field surrounding the celestial body -- emitted a type of energy no scientific instrument could properly attempt to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Castilla of The Montevado was taken aback by the simplicity of the mission. Land, observe and collect possibly any usable information for the scientists back on Morden to properly analyse. In addition; there also appeared to be life-signs on the surface. Intelligent? Civilised? Wild? Other humans? The confusing nature of the energy barrier prevented a complete scan of all life on the surface of the planet. As silly as it was -- there was single life-sign coming back and identifying as human amongst others which couldn't be properly pin pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe discussion to enter the planet's atmosphere was long and arduous. The risks of lowering the Montevado into an atmosphere with an unknown energy field was simply too dangerous, or perhaps, completely harmless. A great deal of equipment and supplies would be needed; including that of a fabricator to remotely spawn in materials and other types of supplies for an extended ground mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A single human?\" Head Scientist Frobisher had analysed what little information there was on the crew room's monitor. \"How unlikely. It's just a malfuction, right? This planet, according to our archives, hasn't been touched by humans or any other civilization.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to be prepared.\" Captain Castilla replied, she slowly leaned forward against the desk and rubbed her chin. \"All scenario's need to be taken into account. If there is life down there; including human, we need to move ahead and prepare for a possible friendly, hostile or neutral advancement. Diplomacy is currently our best strategy and I want to keep 'violence' as a last-chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the ship, Captain?\" The ship's Engineer, Ella, inquired, \"The energy field is made of strange particles. If we run the ship through; who knows what's going to happen? We can't risk damaging the engines or any of our equipment. What if we're stranded? If our communications equipment is damaged then we'll be stranded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point,\" Castilla nodded, \"We can probably take a small shuttle. Boost the shields to one-hundred and ten percent and that should grant us safe passage to a landing zone near the human signature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a bad idea.\" Ashton, the Head of Security shook his head. His lips curled, grey beard twitching, \"We can't lose our Captain to a basic exploration mission. Rules and regulations are set in place for a reason -- there must be a Captain on the ship at all times when crew are present. How are the rest going to react when you're gallavanting on that planet below?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I volunteer to go, Captain.\" Frobisher raised his hand, his eyes sunk to the surface of the table. \"In the name of knowledge itself, and the ensured survival of the human species.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Ella added, also raising her hand. Her face began to burn a slight red as Frobisher soon glanced surprisingly in her direction. \"For the name of... Knowledge and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAston grumbled, \"Oh for heaven's sake. You two can't just go, the rest of us need to stick together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe debating and ebb towards bickering in the quarters left Captain Castilla to silently ponder on her own personal decision. She nodded, vision soon glancing to the table, and stood up; leaving the room silent. \"I've come to a decision. Ashton's worries are genuine and I acknowledge his concerns about my safety -- but I'm agreeing with Ella and Frobisher. A small shuttle should be of minimal loss instead of the Montevado itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Claire-Arden Castilla...\" Ashton groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe preparations and goodbyes were done. For Captain Castilla, Frobisher and Ella, the three crew members completed their final requirements and prepared to leave in the shuttle ship. The shields were boosted, thanks to Ella's technical expertise, and the scientific equipmenta and supplies were sorted by Frobisher's list's -- list's which he read four times in a row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Preperations complete.\" Frobisher announced, \"We leave in two minutes. Strap in to harnesses; brace for impact as we collide with the energy field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brace for impact?\" Ella felt her cheeks puff, \"That sounds so serious! My work done to the shields should be more than enough to keep us safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was saying,\" Frobisher rolled his eyes, smiling, \"Brace for impact. Stuff that's been said before, any other words, Captain Castilla?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done well,\" Castilla nodded, she took a nearby seat and tightened her belts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I should be stopping this shuttle, y'know.</i>\" Ashton's voice came through the communication's link, \"<i>Goes against every rule and regulation we've set up to ensure health and safety, Captain.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need to break a few eggs to make an omelette, Ashton.\" Captain Castilla replied, inhaling as the ship began to ignite its engines. \"We're leaving for three deca-cycles. We'll attempt to make communication once we land on terra firma. If we fail to initiate communication, send help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Better come back in one piece, Claire.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will. We've got enough supplies to last us for several ecta-cycles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about us?\" Frobisher adjusted his glasses, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You're replacable. The Captain isn't.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha-ha, Ashton.\" Frobisher rolled his eyes, further drifting his gaze away from Ella as she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship slowly left the docking bay. The engines ignited further and slowly descended towards the planet's atmosphere -- a show of strange colours and lights soon flickered through the shuttle's windows as the shields began to take the brunt of the strange energy field. The on-board navigational system locked onto the life-signs below and began tracking.</span></div></div>",

Food; water and scientific equipment were all standard -- in addition with several military-grade blasters with stun fuction and a single proteon assault rifle with plenty of energy cells. The shuttle was eventually locked down, with the cloaking device being activated which gave Captain Castilla to finally call point and move her exploration team forward into the strange planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs strange as it was; the beauty of the world surrounding her couldn't be ignored. The planet was a paradise. Surrounding open fields of greenery and distant mountains aplenty brought a sense of wonder and scale. A rich blue river split the landscape in two -- providing the purest clear water she, and the rest of her team, had ever witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a perplexing landscape.\" Frobisher was left to comment. The journey towards the human life-sign eventually paused, leaving the group to aimlessly wander and inspect the nature surrounding them. A small break by the edge of the river allowed the team to reflect and inspect the landscape in greater detail. \"I don't think I've witnessed a more perfect-looking world before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla blinked, \"You can say that again. Where else y'gonna get a view like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...\" Frobisher paused, shaking his head, \"I don't mean to say it like that. Something feels off. The air is too clean; there's barely any clouds in the sky and the water is too clear to look natural at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're over-thinking things,\" Ella chuckled, she lowered her backpack and equipment to take a seat near the edge of the river. \"We've been to loads of awful lookin' planets before. Face it, boyo. We got lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain...?\" Frobisher groaned, he glanced at Castilla pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit;\" Captain Castilla nodded, \"It's a beautiful planet. If the scanners are working, we can assess the pollution and carbon monoxide levels. But, looks can be deceiving. We need to keep focused on locating that one human life-sign.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am!\" Ella responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Frobisher...?\" Captain Castilla added, \"Frobisher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief scientist had moved -- suddenly appearing behind a large bush next to the river; with eyes wide open and a pair of binoculars raised to his face. Ella and Captain Castilla quickly followed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Report, Frobish--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush!\" Frobisher hissed, \"There's something near.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering from behind the bush, Castilla and Ella soon saw a small brown furry lifeform on the other side of the river. A small child-size creature emerged from behind several bushes and toddled over to the river; happily toddling toward the source of clean water. Upon closer inspection -- the small creature seemed to be the size of a small child, with an aura of innocence toward its surrounding enviroment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears to be an anthropomorphic rabbit of some description.\" Frobisher noted, he tuned his binoculars and enchanced the zoom to get a better look. \"Limited intelligence? It's walking like a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toddler?\" Ella added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks and acts young.\" Frobisher hummed, \"Can't be certain. Lack of precision in walking, drool running down its chin and some strange underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever it is;\" Ella cooed, \"It's wearing cute little underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming unaware of its own surroundings; the small rabbit idly toddled along the side of the river and occasionally took a handful of grass to munch. His legs eventually gave way and resorted to crawling as his focus on the river intensified -- giving in and reaching for a small handful of water. His body eventually took its toll and leaned forward far too much; leaving him to fall into the river with a mightly splash. His underwear soon expanded and absorbed several pockets of water and brought on a significant amount of weight, dragging his head underneath the rustled water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe emitted a shriek of terror -- only to realise more water entered his lungs, leaving only the sounds muffled heavy footsteps to draw near along with a pair of unfamiliar hands grabbing him.</span></div></div>",

Out of sheer instinct; she threw off her jacket and rushed past Castilla and Frobisher with a sudden focus on the drowning toddler -- throwing herself head-first into the river with her arms quickly wrapping around the rabbit's short furry body. Both their heads quickly re-emerged from the depths of the river -- leaving the small antropomorphic rabbit to wail and cry in sheer confusion as his body was carried ashore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elenore Baker!\" Captain Castilla gasped, she ran aside the edge of the river and gestured to be handed the small toddler. Once in her arms -- despite the sudden wriggling and wailing -- gently rested him down on Ella's brown jacket and blanketed his small body. While unperturbed by the water; Ella soon rose from the river and rushed to the rabbit's aide, gently rocking and hushing the toddler in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, hey.\" Ella delicately hushed, \"You're safe now. Ain't no river gonna take you down anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small rabbit continued to cry, his wails soon hushed from a loud whimper to a series of light sniffles in Ella's soaking arms. She quickly tore off the toddler's heavy underwear and tossed it aside, using more of her jacket to keep the rabbit warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hng-- Sorry... Mumma...\" The rabbit coughed, small pockets of water soon exited his mouth and onto Ella's chest. His green eyes soon opened, with a trail of drool escaping his lips and down onto his sodden chest, \"You're not.. You're not Mumma...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a friend, sweetheart.\" Ella nodded, \"What's your name, little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared into Ella's eyes; unable to concentrate enough to register the words spoken to him in time, only for his natural response to the sudden stress of the situation was to insert his fingers into his mouth. He resumed whimpering -- but readily accepted Ella's comforting cuddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was incredible, Ella.\" Frobisher finally caught up, hauling his equipment with a series of exhausted steps. \"You saved a baby from drowning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't help myself,\" Ella playfully shrugged, \"This sweetheart ain't letting up neither. He's clung to my chest harder than a shuttle harness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA simple pat on the rabbit's head from Captain Castilla caused the toddler to squirm in Ella's arms. His wet fur combined with the surprisingly lop-sided ears felt awfully strange, \"You've saved a life. I wasn't expecting us to come into contact with native life so early in the mission; thinking recon was the best way to handle things. We should find his parents and return him before something else happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he leads us back to his parent's; then perhaps we can find the human signature? It's close by, according to my scanner.\" Frobisher added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hate to be the bearer of bad news;\" Ella interrupted, chuckling, \"But he's fallen asleep. Poor little fella, the stress of the situation must'a took the rays outta him.\" The small rabbit was delicately wrapped; head resting on Ella's damp shoulder with her hands supporting him backside and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Frobisher sighed, \"What now, Captain? Follow the signature or take the rabbit back to the shuttle for examination?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ain't disecting him, alright?\" Ella protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous,\" Frobisher rolled his eyes, \"We aren't going to harm a baby. That's against the rules of galactic engagment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The signature is close; but I do agree a proper examination and a medical check suing our equipment for the little rabbit might be necessary.\" Captain Castilla added.</span></div></div>",

A simple command from Captain Castilla removed the ship's cloaking device allowing herself and the rest of her crew to enter; giving Ella space to take the toddler-sized rabbit to the nearby living quarters -- still wrapped in her soaked brown jacket. The rabbit was delicately rested against a nearby pillow while Ella acquired a towel and began softly rubbing his brown fur; while the droplets of water were being absorbed, the rabbit began mumbling in his sleep. Still curled, instictively suckled on his fingers while resting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrobisher took a nearby seat, frowning, at the rabbit's infantile display of behaviour. He clicked the roof of his mouth -- only to roll his eyes before reaching for his audio recorder nearby, \"<i>We've landed on terra firma. Our shuttle easily passed through the mysterious energy field with little issue with our shields taking the full brunt of the damage. A full sitrep of the shuttle's capacity to re-enter orbit is required.

Intelligence levels? Unsure.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit was quickly further wrapped in appropriate blankets and medical equipment. His small body was gently laid upon a medical capsule which began tracking his pulse, continually beeping at a healthy rate. Ella leaned over the capsule's top, sliding the back of her hand across the rabbit's forehead with a worrying expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor tyke,\" Ella hummed, \"Hope bunny boy doesn't freak out when he wakes up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's going to be fine, Ella.\" Captain Castilla responded, she glanced at the medical information appearing on a nearby monitor, \"His vitals are still working. No serious injuries or bruising.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know.\" Ella groaned, she took a step back and scratched her head. \"Just couldn't let him drown. His parents are probably worried sick. They're probably looking for him, right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's if he has parents.\" Frobisher stood from his seat, discarding his audio recorder onto a nearby desk, and slowly walked over to the medical capsule. \"Or perhaps he's an underdeveloped being with a mind not as smart as ours. He could be the standard for the rest of his kind -- whatever his 'kind' is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A whole race of cute little bunny people?\" Ella asked, \"That sounds like a win right there. I'd cuddle them.\" She dipped her hand through the medical capsule and began to stroke the rabbit's ears, with the little rabbit emitting several light coo's and mumbles in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll attempt first contact protocal when he's awake.\" Captain Castilla explained, \"If he's really just a baby then we'll need to take this slowly. Frobisher, learn what you can about the rabbit's physiology and brain activity.

With the medical bay working; Frobisher had discovered that traces of the energy field were flowing throughout the rabbit's body. Even stranger, the physical age of the rabbit's body differed from the brain -- resulting in a small anthropomorphic rabbit that's, supposedly, lived for nearly two-hundred years. The brain was astonishing. The development of the brain resembled that of a four-year old human's, with an apparent lack of growth or development for as long as the creature has been alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed. Frobisher and Captain Castilla agreed to rest in the quarters, leaving Ella to watch over the shuttle and their new guest. The rabbit stirred in his sleep, tossing and turning; as his face twitched to the sound of loud humming. He opened his eyes and looked forward; and was immediately greeted to the sight of an unfamiliar face gazing through the glass shield. Panic and worry set in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whuh-- Whuh-- Where am I?\" He backed up against opposite side of the glass, idly kicking away the layers of blankets, and cowered in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey!\" Ella reached for the release latch, allowing for the glass dome to partially open, \"Don't you remember me? The lady from the river who saved your little tush?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit blinked, he took a surrounding blanket and pulled it closer, \"Y-You're not Mumma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a friend, kiddo.\" Ella cooed, she leaned inside the medical dome, slowly climbing inside and extended her hand over to the rabbit. \"You fell asleep, bun' bun. I thought you'd like a blanket and a pillow t'rest on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit's frantic breathing eventually softened. His small paws restlessly shook; clamping parts of his blanket between his legs. Ella's extended hand soon brushed against the rabbit's head -- after a small flinch, and finally stroked his lop-sided ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now, kiddo.\" Ella whispered, \"I get it. You're scared. Y'probably want to go back home and see your Mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" The rabbit nodded, \"Mumma said I shun' wanna go by the water but I dun' listen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't you a little rebel?\" Ella grinned, \"What yer' name fella?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBup smiled, \"I chose it myself! Mumma said I did a good when I did that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Names Ella,\" Ella replied, chuckling. \"Well now, ain't that a name for a cutie pie like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension between the two was immediately dismantled. Further into the conversation; Bup eventually lowered his defenses and slowly crawled over to Ella's chest -- glad accepting the warmth coming from her jumpsuit. \"Miss Ella?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, bun' bun?\" Ella assisted Bup onto her lap, gladly wrapping a blanket across his cold furry body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I g-gotta go.

She ensured that procedures were followed, but unlike most ship bureaucrats she was very nice. Where most bureaucrats valued paperwork over all she recognized that unorthodox actions were nessisary. Many crew members owed there jobs and paychecks to her, and her warm green eyes and red hair were always welcome. As the Electro-Magnetic wave of the plants started to affect her, she was in the middle of filing a report. She started to fidget a bit as she slowly got mentally younger, as her energy increased and her focus diminished. In addition, her smart suit and skirt started to feel restrictive. She then noted to herself, \"I'm in my room. No one will mind if I strip.\" So she got up and took off her shirt and wiggled out of her skirt, leaving her in just her bra and panties. She was at the mental age of 5 and she looked down at her plain grey bra, and confused she asked, \"What dis?\" She took off her bra, letting her rather large boobs jiggle freely. She toddled back to her desk and at the mental age of 4 realized something. The paper she had been working on had turned into strange squiggles that she couldn't understand. In reality she was now too young to read, but it still upset her. She started to wail until she stabilized at the mental age of 3. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuck her thumb in her mouth and babbled, \"Why me sad?\" She decided to find someone to help her with the paper.

She glared at the only thing she could think was responsible, her panties. As she looked at them her ability to walk became completely forgotten and her hatred of the adult item became a childish desire to be naked. She babbled, \"Me wanna be nakie\" and struggled. She eventually got her panties off and threw the offending garment across the room. She then crawled out of her room and down the halls in search of someone who looked sufficiently adult. Her first destination was the nurses office, hoping maybe someone was there who was a mommy. On her way she saw a naked lady and babbled, \"That lady swilly.\" She didn't realize she was looking at a mirror.</span></div></div>",

Many times had a crewmate opened a closet to see the two kissing within, and if a closet was locked from within it was usually because they were doing more than kissing. Zoe was a mathematics genius while Claudia was more gung-ho, but they sincerely loved each other. They were constantly surprising each other with presents, and on every new world they would pick some flowers for each other. This practice had unintentionally doomed them to a second infancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe sighed, blowing a strand of her raven hair out of the way as she considered how she had ended up here. She was a very curvy and busty woman with pale skin and deep dark eyes, and a genius when it came to numbers. She had managed to calculate a way to escape a gravity well without using more fuel than normal. And yet here she was, changing the diaper of an adult woman. This woman was apparently the mayor of this little colony, but you wouldn't know it given how she gurgled and cooed. Indeed, she was a baby in all but body, as she still had her impressive bust (which put much of the ATHENA program to shame) and her round butt. She finished up the diaper change and put the mayor on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mayor crawled away she heard another baby wailing. She ignored it believing it another colonist, when in fact it was Corporal Alex Jones, the first member of the ATHENA member on the planet to succumb to the flowers influence. Zoe rubbed her temples and decided to do a calming strategy she had learned, counting the digits of Pi until she was calm. She started, \"Three-point-one-four-one-five-nine-two.\" And then she stumbled, and she was puzzled. She could usually count the first hundred digits of Pi. She tried again, \"Three-point-one-four-one-five-nine-two\" and stumbled. She was getting scared now and tried a third time, \"Three-point-one-four-one-five-nine-two\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried time tables next, \"One times one is one. Two times two is.\" She was worried as she could remember, so she tried addition while lisping a bit, \"One plus one is two, two plus two is.\" Once again she didn't know and she tried counting, \"One, two, twee.\" Her eyes welled up with tears and she started to whimper, \"What comes after twee?\" She then burst in tears, wailing like an infant as she realized her mathematical genius, which was tied up with her self esteem and very identity, was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe needed someone to comfort her, and her regressing mind instantly turned to her mother. But her mother was back on Venus. She wouldn't just magically appear because Zoe wailed for her. Then she remembered Claudia, and while her regressing mind didn't fully understand the complexity's of there relationship she did know that she loved Claudia and Claudia loved her. Claudia would comfort her and take care of her and help her figure out why her smarts were going bye-bye. Zoe started toddling to the village and yelled out, \"Cwadia.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudia was currently searching the village for any clues as to why the colonists had become overgrown rugrats. She had platinum hair and creamy peach skin, she was attractive but also buff with a massive bust (not as massive as Zoe but still pretty big). She and Zoe were pretty much opposites, but they loved each other dearly. Claudia's hazel eyes searched for anything out of the ordinary. Something obviously hostile or strange, some hostile alien tech or a sigil of some sort. After all, some being did practice magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered Zoe's frequent lectures that magic was in fact either highly advanced technology or higher-dimension math. Claudia didn't remember much of those lectures, she was always to focused on how Zoe moved her body when she was lecturing. She remembered Zoe's blush when she had made a remark about how this was good practice for when they got married and had a child of there own. She laughed at bit at that memory, but it came out more as a giggle. They had both agreed when they realized there mutual true love for one another that marriage would come when it felt right, and if they wanted kids they would adopt. But she loved when Zoe was embarrassed, she went so red that it reminded her of her childhood as a farmer on Mars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a look at her laser pistol and realized something. She didn't understand how it worked, which confused her. She had set a record for the fastest disassembly and reassembly of a service laser pistol in the entire army. But now it was just a hunk of metal to her, one that was dangerous. She put the firearm down and decided to practice her kata's. This resulted in her falling down go boom, and she wailed. So many cool things she used to know she didn't anymore, like how to walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuck her thumb in her mouth, wanting someone to comfort her, She pictured her mommy, but she was back on her family farm on Mars. Mommy was too far away to help. She let out an infantile gasp as she realized who could help, Zoe. Zoe was smart, she could figure out why this was happening and how to fix it. Claudia got on her hands and knees and started to crawl while yelling, \"Zoe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------ <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe and Claudia met near the village, both hugging each other and sobbing a bit. Zoe spoke first, \"Me's forget math and smarty stuff\" and sobbed some more. Claudia sobbed and said, \"Me's forget cool stuff and hows to walkies\" and let out some wails. After a while the two calmed down from there hug and Claudia asked, \"Whys dis happening?\" Zoe sniffled and said, \"Me no know, but wes finds out.\" The two lovebirds nodded and began to crawl to where Zoe believed the investigation should start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------ <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndo we follow Zoe and Claudia as they try to figure out what is happening or do we follow another baby, either on the planet or back on the ship. </span></div></div>",

Zoe and Claudia were crawling down the way, and while she knew adults walked she had many memories of needing a stapler and them doing adult stuff in the closet. She had no clue what a stapler was now, but she knew them to be adults. She would consider them adults until they could only speak in baby babble, and she quickly toddled over to them. Amber had always been a good girl, desiring nothing more than adult approval. She yelled out, \"Zoe, Claudia! I used the potty! Yous proud of me, right? Me a big girl right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were surprised to see the attractive botanist naked from the waist down, but both looked at each other and understood the necessity of her help.

Claudia saw this and hugged Zoe while crying. She was begging now, \"Please don' leave me Zoe, me don' wanna lose you!\" Zoe shook her head and said, \"Me no baby.\" Claudia's tears immediately stopped and she sighed with relief. However, in doing this she inadvertently wet herself. But she then realized that she hadn't lost what little smarts she had left either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough pure cosmic chance Claudia, Zoe and Amber had a string of genes that allowed them to resist the Electro-Magnetic field produced by the regression flowers. This was not there original purpose, which is why they had stabilized at very young ages. It was also why there were differences in how they stabilized. Claudia and Zoe were mostly immune to the mental effects, explaining why they remembered being big girls and were able to focus on fixing the problem. This was offset by the fact that most of there knowledge was inaccessible and there lack of immunity to the physical effects. They could change diapers still, but they could only crawl and had the potty-training of an infant. Amber meanwhile was mostly immune to the physical effects, as she could toddle and use the potty, but this was offset by her relative lack of immunity to the mental effects, having regressed to a toddler mentally. However, there immunity meant that even if they were on the ship or elsewhere in contact with massed amounts of the regression flower it would still take a month for them to become complete babies. On the planet proper, with the regression flower scattered about, it would take a year. The genes that provided this immunity were originally designed to provide resistance to the psychic influence of the whispering vines, which could control minds even over 500 million years after it died. But given this plant only existed in the amazon rainforest and was killed by giant creatures that could be best described as fruit bat alpaca hybrids about 493 million years before humanity evolved, these genes are rare. It was only the regression flowers having enough similarity to the vines that caused these long dead genes to activate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nnone of the three knew that however and Zoe said, \"I guess we need diapers.\" She then had Amber grab three diapers for them to change into. Amber whined, \"But imma big girl. I no need diapies!\" Claudia quickly said, \"Well, we's need diapers and we's adults. Don worry, when we fix dis we can alls go back to panties.\" This mollified Amber, and soon the three women were in diapers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that they are pampered, what is the first step the three take at figuring out what happened and fixing it. </span></div></div>",

She quickly said, \"Wobots, help da big babies.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAboard the ship and on the landing ships the red singular eyes of the medi-bots turned on. There hover circuits activated, and they began to follow there orders. While they couldn't diagnose anything, there scanners could detect brain waves so as to help patients who for whatever reason could not be understood. This was why Zoe and Claudia weren't worried about being identified as big babies, they and amber were still mature enough to not read as big babies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ship and on the planet the medi-droids split up to deal with the adult infants. One medi-droid came upon Captain Starhall, Nurse Amy, and the orderly. It said in the calming and androgynous voice all medi-droids had, \"Looks like you need a diaper change little one.\" It booped captain Starhall on the nose and she giggled. It then said to the other two, \"Aww, your playing dress-up. But its time to wear your diapers, and I don't think your mommy's will appreciate you going potty in there clothing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne medi-droid went into the science lab and started diapering or changing the diapers of the former scientists. It was changing Nurse lily who made a grabby motion for the Regression Flowers. It merely said, \"Yes, they are pretty flowers aren't they?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother medi-droid found the team of giggling girls who regressed in the showers. It turned off the water, dried off the babies and put them in diapers. Then it noticed one was missing. It said aloud to itself, \"Now where is Alica?\" It soon found the would me model chewing on a communicator, being one of those who answered the communication. The medi-droid picked her put and said, \"Your a curious little monkey, aren't you?\" It tickled her and said, \"But you need a diaper so you don't make any messies while your exploring.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet another medi-droid found Brenda in the cafeteria, as she had abandoned her search for a mommy when she reached babyhood. Now she was a naked little baby seeking nummys. It changed her and produced a bottle, feeding her when its audio receptors heard a racket. It entered the kitchen and found Alice. It ruffled her hair playfully and said, \"Ok little Rockstar, its time for your diaper.\" Alice heard the word diaper and started to crawl away, but the medi-droid easily captured her and gave her an ultimatum, \"Either you put on a diaper or you will get spanked.\" Alica paled at the word spanked, and meekly accepted her diaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the planet a medi-droid carrying a diapered penny saw the trio and Zoe and Claudia were worried. Would they count as big babies. The droid merely asked, \"Do any of you need a diaper change?\" The three shook there heads (amber most emphatically) and it responded, \"Ok, but if you do and you can't change yourselfs, find me or another medi-droid, ok.\" Zoe and Claudia nodded and the droid went away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat do the three do now that the big babies are being taken care of and they are not in danger of being babied?</span></div></div>",

Claudia had better luck persuading the toddler botanist so she said, \"Amber, pwease stop pawying with da com-poo-ter. Wes no want it ta bweak.\" However, no matter how well behaved a child is they do need occasional correction from time to time, and Amber was no different. She merely said, \"And what if I don wanna stop?\" Claudia said, \"Then yous bein a bad girl.\" Zoe capitalized on her status as the strict aunt and said, \"Ands if yous bweak da com-poo-ter cause yous pway with it den I's get one of da wobots ta spankies you.\" The possibility of being spanked caused Amber to behave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the ship Zoe and Claudia were astonished at how through the regression was on the ship (Amber just giggled at the babies). Once the ATHENA program had been made of competent women who not only explored the unknown, solved problems that had vexed humanity for generations and fought creatures so strange and powerful that the only words that described them were gods and demons. That was no longer the case, as they were all just babies now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was bad seeing the colonists, but the ATHENA program was worse. Some of the colonists could hold a conversation, an extremely childish one but a conversation none the less, and some could toddle. But it would be surprising if an ATHENA program member aboard the ship could even say \"mine\" or \"poopie\", and any form of movement besides crawling was out of the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also more shocking because they knew there crewmembers. With the colonists it was a detached worry, troubling yes but no more than any other innocent that the ATHENA needed to rescue. But the ATHENA crewmembers had become family. Zoe looked over and saw Karen, a brilliant music player from Italy, making a racket using pots and spoons. Karen had once used her skills at entertainment to distract the carnival of doom while there captain banished there clown messiah. Claudia looked over and saw Lisa, a sort of mousy girl usually wearing glasses and having a scribe air about her. She had managed to not only talk down a rogue AI but also convince it to return to loyalty. Now she was just babbling, no longer a scribe, she couldn't even read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe and Claudia both promised mentally that they would fix this. They would restore there family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the security office, Zoe and Claudia entered to see Mia. The head of security was a tough ex-soldier who wore a buzz cut and fatigues as if she were still in the army. Now however, Mia was squirming on her back in nothing but a diaper, her blond buzz cut seeming a futile attempt to make a toddler look tough. Mia squealed as the women entered and rolled over to get on her hands and knees. Zoe and Claudia ignored her, focusing on the bypass key. It was low enough for Zoe to grab it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The two tugged back and forth, Claudia thought she heard a *crack* come from the key and pulled harder, hopefully she could get it away from Mia before it seriously broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Amber was drawing in the walls out in the hallway, humming a nonsense tune and occasionally doing a clumsy attempt at a ballerina movement in her dancing in between drawings.  Had the door been open, there's no doubt that she'd have gotten involved, but with it closed and blocking almost all of the sound, she ignored it.</span></div></div>",

Lola and Gillian are coming with as well, Lola as fire support and Gillian as the expert on Marnic culture. The cover of night protects your ship as it lands on the pavilion of the presidential complex. No one stands waiting on the pavilian, but as you enter the doors inside, a large banquet has been formed, and Marnics of all sorts look at you and gasp. Aliens might be a normal sight for you, but these aliens can hardly believe their eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one to break the silence is the president, an older Marnic woman with long navy blue hair. \"Welcome aliens, to our banquet! Who was it that spoke first over our radio?\" You silently step forward. \"Ah, welcome esteemed guest, the most honorable spot on this table has been reserved for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night commences, you dine on Marnic food, speak with President Nalia, and spend most of the night residing at her left hand side, a mirror of tradition on earth. Lola and Gillian are seated to the left of you, and all night the three of you are baraged with questions, you never even find time to excuse yourself for the restroom, and the need to pee grows within you. It is far into the night when you finally have a moment spare of questions from inquisatorios senators and industry leaders. You turn to President Nalia, \"Madame president, this is all well and good, but may I ask when we can start to plan how humanity can help bring democracy to this world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe president laughes at your request, \"Nonsense, it is custom for the first night of any visit to be a banquet, we can start discussing politics tomorrow, until then, you and your companions are free to sleep in my mansion, if you do sleep that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she mentions it, you are rather tired, you take her up on her offer and soon find yourself in one of the guest bedrooms of the house. You drop your dress off your shoulders and go to sleep immediately in your underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you sleep, do you wet yourself?</span></div></div>",

The bra itself is nothing special, most fabrics across the galaxy have similarities, and this one is no different. The only stand-offish bit about it is the color, bright red, both the straps and the cups, the dress has no shoulders, meaning the straps will be on display, but last night you gathered that seemed common in Marnic cultures.

At one point you stopped to wonder if Gillian ever even tried anymore, but you never got the chance to ask her, that opportunity is coming soon though, as you stand outside of her room, waiting for a night diaper. The days of all-nighters are yet to come, so everyone else on your growing team of alien assistants is already asleep. Tomorrow is going to be the first day of receiving and everyone seemed excited all day. Getting piles of money out of nowhere would be highly suspicious. So the plan you've all settled on is sending items for infrastructure, and raw goods to be processed, that it can simply seem like part of a growth plan. Tech is also being shipped, but slowly, if all the governments of Prienne woke up tomorrow to the Free State of Rask being armed with lasers, your cover would be blown. Figuring all of this out was exhausting but exciting work, slowly the exhaustion overpowered the excitement and everyone went home. Now Lola is asleep, and it's just you and Gillian. You knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" Gillian asks through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone who needs some assistance.\" You whisper back. The door swings open, Gillian stands in front of you, a big pink diaper completely on show, with only a bra on top. Both of you are teeming with excitement as you enter her room, you as you'll finally be confident tonight, and Gillian as she has someone to share this with for the first time all her life. \"So, I have a question,\" You say, as Gillian turns around to pull out the various items in her stash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask away,\" Gillian says, her butt in the air as she grabs something under the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you ever try and hold it anymore?\" You slowly start to remove your dress, and your diaper, leaving you in just a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's too much work, and I haven't leaked in years, not an accident anyway.\" Your eyebrows raise as she adds that last part, and as you lay down on a newly placed equally pink diaper, you ask about that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, not on accident?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGillian applies powder as she responds, \"I'm not gonna lie captain, a freshly wet diaper isn't the worst feeling in world, I've done some experimenting with it.\" Your face grows redder than hers as she says that, and you fall into your thoughts about that subject for the remainder of the change.

Amelxi's right, if you simply blow up the station, there's no way to look at it as not a coordinated attack that cost lives, this way looks like a system malfunction, and won't hurt the people as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to traverse the empty hallways, and eventually find yourself on the lowest level of the station, where the signal substation waits unguarded. This is no doubt the easiest part of the plan, the other two locations are going to be a lot more crowded. You enter the station and get to work. First the station needs power routed towards it, then the satellites need to be activated, and lastly you need to perform a little percussive maintenance on the equipment, breaking it, and stopping anyone from deactivating the satellites until the lockdown sends the entire station below the sea. As you go through all of this, you feel the need to pee again, it doesn't seem that bad, but it's distracting, you could give in and go now, or hold it, what do you do?</span></div></div>",

A part of your mind lets you know that your diaper is on full display, the soggy bulk between your thighs and the wetness on the seat letting you know you've leaked, that thought, however, is pushed by the wayside as you focus on the hologram in front you. The president's voice is firm and unwavering, \"Captain I'm glad to see you're still kicking. I apologize for the interruption, but there is a situation developing. 15 minutes ago, our armed forces bordering the Union of Olia found themselves under attack.\" You frown at that, a full-scale attack by the autocratic would likely force you to reveal your presence and drag you into a prolonged conflict, but the president's voice cuts through your thoughts. \"-an isolated incident, there has been no suspicious activity reported by our other border garrisons on the islands near Pelox or signs of a wider military mobilization in Olia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTuning back into the conversation \"So, I'm assuming you'll want us to investigate into why some of the Olian's decided to attack?\" You feel the President's gaze wash back over you, your cheeks heat up as you notice your leaky diaper is still on display. \"Captain, if you feel you're capable to do so, I won't stop you. However, if you feel that'd you'd be better suited returning to base and investigating later I wouldn't dare hold it against you. I'm sending the coordinates of the Olian Command Center in the affected region. The choice is yours, Captain, signing out.\" Gillian lingers a bit longer, her voice soft and pleasant, the telltale bulge of a thick night-time undergarment readily apparent, \"Skipper, whatever you do, please just make it back,\" giving you a loving smile she too logs off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning your chair towards your small team you broach the decision, \"Well guys, what do you think?.\" Lola is first to speak, an amused tone in her words, \"Well Skipper, I think you need a change, and that seat needs to be cleaned.\" You go beet red at the statement, \"but, in regards to the base I'd advise against it, looking at the coords the President sent us, we're a way's away, and these subs don't seem optimized for prolonged ops without a mothership to support them. We'll be cutting it close on fuel, real close.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, alright something to keep in mind, Amelxi what do y-\", you don't even get to finish your sentence before a pair of arms rear you off your seat and onto a freshly laid out changing mat. \"What do I think Captain?\" replying even as she wipes you clean with the practice of thousands of diaper changes and was soon unfolding a diaper. A marnic one, much thicker than the day ones you normally wore. \"Well, honestly I think we've had enough excitement for one day,\" replying as her hands lifted your ankles and lowering you into place in the center of the diaper, the garment soft and crinkly. The scent of powder followed with Amelxi finishing taping you up in your new diaper. \"But, you're still the captain, so it's your call.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, to adapt with the thicker bulk between your legs you make your decision, you</span></div></div>",

You feel at peace and content as your carried by Gillian your head resting on her chest and your diaper-clad bottom supported by her arm. Looking around you see the familiar gunmetal grey of the base in Rask but also the homely wood walls of somewhere else entirely. Gillian soon began moving passed a few decorations and into what you presumed was a kitchen going by the stove and ornate table. You shifted around a bit trying to find another comfortable position feeling Gillian's hand running through your hair stroking your back. You hear her murmur \"there, there captain, just relax a bit\" and sure enough you feel your limbs go slack and you relax in Gillian's arms as she moves to what you presume is a fridge and retrieves a bottle putting in a microwave and heating it up. \"What are you doing Gillian?\" You asked in a low voice \"shh, let it go skipper don't worry about anything\" she replied in an authoritative tone, and so you do keeping quiet as Gillian takes the bottle and moves to an armchair. There she adjusts your position cradling you. She gives a warm motherly look and you can't help but appreciate her beauty just in time for her to pop your pacifier out and replace it with the bottle, you soon start sucking tasting the warm sweet milk, soon enough you feel your crotch grow warm as your bladder released your thick diaper soaking up the urine. Gillian soon takes note of your diapers changing status  \"I see the baby isn't keeping her diaper dry\" she remarks and you feel your face blush all kinds of red. But, with your comfortable position and the warm milk, you soon fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come to feeling heat on your face and cold air on your skin. You eyes flip open and you see the room you were in torn and gashes ripped open in the walls. Through the holes, you see blackened figures racing through corridors while a fire erupted from a broken stove dying down due to the efforts of an automated fire suppression system. Your eyes frantically search for Gillian and see her rushing towards you. \"There you are, captain, the base is under attack we've gotta get out,\" she tells you. Scooping you into her arms she dashes through an open hole down through the corridor dodging debris and broken steam pipes Gillian manages to make it to an exit only to be found by two black hooded assailants. Drawing their weapons they order to surrender. Gillian moves to put you down only jump at the last moment and closing the distances the assailants. Caught off guard Gillian manages to get several hits in forcing one to the floor while attempting to seize the weapon for the other. You try and help but the bulk between your legs only leads to you comically falling onto your padded bottom. Gillian soon finds herself overpowered and is hit by the butt of a rifle crumpling hard down to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after both figures turn to you having just gotten back up to your feet looking very out of place with your lavender shirt and pink diaper. \"What should we do with her?\" one asks with a feminine voice the other also a female responds \"knock her out and keep going she's not much of threat going by how she's dressed.\" Both figures approach you \"how is this big baby girl doing today\" one asks her voice laden with sarcasm and hostility. Terrified and unable to effectively defend yourself you let out a quiet whimper and hear a loud wet farts escape from your rear and the sound of you filling your new diaper with a warm, sticky mush that bulged out the padding with an audible crinkle. Both the girls facing you burst out snickering \"Looks like this big baby just made a big poopie\" one remarks. You feel the heat rising in your cheeks as your himilation grows. One of the girls then kicks your legs out causing you to fall back to the floor mushing your mess against you while another goes for your face with the butt of a rifle just as it cracks against you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in cold sweat </span></div></div>",

She reassures and says \"You can start tomorrow after I discuss our options with my advisors and the Joint Chiefs but tonight you and your companions are free to do what you wish you can find some rooms in the Western Corridor when night comes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Meal concludes late in the night you retire to one of the rooms in the retreat and prepare for bed. Removing your dress uniform and stepping into the bathroom for a quick shower you return to find your clothes neatly folded in the wardrobe and sleepwear laid out on the bed.

However, as you experimentally attempted to lift yourself up from the floor, your cartoonishly bulky diaper decided otherwise, as you unwittingly lost your balance once more, plopping back down onto the floor with an audible *crinkle* and *parp* in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a tad bit embarrassed, you soon heard the Viceroy Caretaker let out a light giggle and chirped, \"*giggle* I shall take that as a yes, then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, she did a casual but brief clapping gesture, as if to call forth something. And call forth something she did, as what appeared to be a massive adult-sized baby hover-carriage automatically hovered it's way before the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, what do you say we escort you to Makila's room, my dear?\" The Viceroy Caretaker jovially quipped, as you nodded in confirmation, struggling a little to prop yourself onto the hover-carriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as you were about to seat yourself in, the Viceroy Caretaker briefly halted you and asked, \"Uh uh uh! What do we say, dearie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, this seemed like an attempt to make you sound like a toddler. But then again, you were enjoying this so far, so you coyly put your thumb in your mouth, then imitated a childish lisp and answered, \"Can I pwease see Makiwa now, Vicewoy Cawetakew? Pwetty pwease?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Of course, my little Baby Space Captain! Let us visit little Makila.\" The Viceroy Caretaker replied, letting you proceed onto the hover-carriage, your legs sticking up in the air a little due to the diaper's enormous bulk and padding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, it was rather comfortable like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the Viceroy Caretaker kindly escorted you to Makila's personal quarters, whilst you keenly listened to the hover-carriage's silent humming. It felt like hours had passed until you finally reached the two front doors to Makila's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the Viceroy Caretaker opened the doors, you could easily see Makila herself, who appeared to be...</span></div></div>",

Dressed in a bright grey onesie which scarcely concealed a rather voluminous pink diaper and with a pacifier in her mouth which was neatly tied to a string one could also deduce that she was rather deep into the whole idea of reliving childhood so idealized by the Marnic's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe notices the door opening and her eyes light up upon seeing you and the Viceroy. \"Who is this Kalyla? What have you brought in today?\" she asks her voice dripping with curiosity. The Viceroy responds in stride \"She's a visitor and not of this world Makila. Be kind and try and keep your questions reserved as I know you'll have many\". Turning to you she says \"I'm sure you'll come to adore Makila my baby space captain so I'll leave you two to know each other as I prepare some amenities for you two.\" The Viceroy Caretaker sets you down from the hover carriage near Makila and walks off to another room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Viceroy walks off Makila looks at you with interest. \"I'm Makila Hommertov daughter of Halicia Hommertov the current President, and who are you my dearest guest?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply</span></div></div>",

I'm from the planet Earth, the third planet in the Sol System. It is an honor to meet you, Makila Hommertov.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you were rather formal with your introduction to the babyish Marnic, Makila couldn't help but display quite a cheekily amused look on her youthful Elven-like face, doing her best to stifle her childish giggling. Of course, you were mildly confused from her initial reaction, where you raised a confused eyebrow whilst dismounting from your military salute and asked, \"...Is there something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Oh Goddess, there's nothing wrong, Angelina! It's just...\" Makila let out a mild yet childish snort, then continued, \"...I honestly never thought I get to meet an alien who likes to wear the same kind of diapers as me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon realize that she was referring to your current undergarments, which caused you to blush in mild embarrassment, as Makila calmed herself and reassured, \"I'm not saying it looks bad on you or anything. In fact, I think you look absolutely lovely with a Marnic diaper on you, Angelina.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But anyway, let's start over. Hi, my name is Makila.\" Makila said, skipping the formalities between you and her in order to maintain a rather casual yet very friendly introduction, extending her hand toward you as an offer of friendship. At first, you were rather apprehensive about this, especially since this felt like a crucial meeting between two somewhat different civilizations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, not wanting to make a scandal of things, you extended your own hand as well, grasping around Makila's, where you both began to shake hands in a friendly manner as you answered, \"...Its very nice to meet you, Makila. I'm Angelina.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? That wasn't so hard, was it?\" She coyly quipped, showing that it was apparently alright to let your guard down, even for a mere moment such as this, where you soon replied, \"*giggle* I guess not.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, shortly after such friendly chatting, you noticed how underdressed you seem to be, wearing nothing but a Marnic bodysuit and skirt, which honestly felt rather snug, especially with your now massive diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I don't suppose you have any clothes that feel more comfortable than what I have on, do you?\" You meekly asked, a profound blush displayed across your cheeks. In response, Makila easily took notice of your ill-fitting outfit and soon retorted, \"By The Goddess! These clothes can barely fit you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Don't worry, dear Angelina... Mind if I just call you Angie?\" Makila curiously asked, which seemed rather miniscule to you as you briefly answered, \"I, uh...I guess so.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Makila soon took you by your hand, casually waddling you along with her whilst she quipped, \"...Don't worry your silly alien head, Angie. I know just what sort of clothes you need for that big diapered butt of yours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like something out of a fairy tale back on Earth, Makila guided you deeper into her infantile quarters, where she led you to what you could only describe as...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While outwardly infantile and something that seemed more suited to a toddler than a young woman it had a strange air of maturity around it. The room possessed everything one would expect of a quarter meant for a child. A changing table, cribs, stocks of diapers, and toys are strewn about, but the cribs weren't cribs per se more like beds with folding rails on the sides, many of the toys and games while appearing deceptively simple actually came to look much more complex on a 2nd glance, and near her bed you could see a table which appeared to have all the modern necessities that a young woman could need (A computer, tablets, etc) while also containing things that wouldn't be out of place in a daycare like a grey pacifier and a rattle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was another thing grey. Makila seemed to have a thing for the colour with many of the objects and much of the room itself being painted the same colour as her eyes, though there was enough variety to keep the room from looking anything but drab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered the rooms peculiar aspects but even as you did Makila was guiding to her wardrobe. 'Here Angie, I'll pick out just the right thing for you.\" Makilat hen provided to virtually dive into her closet. As Makila went in you found yourself once again puzzled by apparel. Infantile garments mixed with professional clothes, onesies and lolita dresses were hung alongside suits and leggings, pacifiers and bows mingled with necklaces and what appeared to be expensive jewelry. It all appeared so strange to you like Makila was intentionally mixing Marnic ideas about relieving childhood with her professional life, but wasn't the idea of relieving your childhood was so that you lay back and relax?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were deep in thought Makila popped back out of her closet.\"Here Angie try this out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakila had presented you with</span></div></div>",

Try this out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Makila presented you with what appeared to be a rather infantile magenta lolita dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, the dress mainly consisted of this long but frilly magenta skirt with baby pink frills along the hem of the gown, which obviously wasn't meant to conceal your absurdly bulky Marnic diaper, as there was this massive button diaper flap cover in the undercarriage of the dress, possibly to add to the babyish cute factor in appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe upper body of the dress had these puffy white short sleeves with pink ribbons tied in a feminine bow on each sleeve, along with a downright massive baby pink bow jutting from the lower back of the dress, where the blouse and skirt connect. Overall, it was quite the infantile yet entirely adorable outfit ensemble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noted how the outfit stood out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of Makila's decor and ensemble, as you soon spoke up and asked, \"So, um...H-How come this outfit is different from what you're wearing, Makila?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this? Well, long story short, my Mommy, The President, wanted me to try on outfits that didn't come in grey, much to my chagrin. However, I couldn't simply get rid of something so adorable! *giggle*\" Makila elaborated, displaying the same giddy demeanor as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Well...that certainly explains a lot.\" You bluntly retorted, obviously feeling a little meek from such a situation, blushing lightly as you did so. Of course, Makila took heed of your blushing, playfully patting your bulky diapered behind in reassurance then said, \"...Don't worry on the specifics, Angie.Right now, let's focus on getting you all \"Dolled Up\", as you Humans would say. *giggle*\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as if you were tempted by some otherworldly entity, Makila guided you onto the changing table, as she then eagerly assisted you in equipping the dress upon you, putting your head and arms through the three main holes in the dress. At first, you seemed rather reluctant with being in an apparently submissive role currently. And yet, you felt quite at ease with Makila tending to you, as the President's daughter made sure the dress was properly equipped onto you without any creases or wrinkles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Angie. I'm gonna need you up on the changing table, so I can button up the flaps around your diapered tushie. Okay?\" Makila quipped, speaking with a loving yet sisterly tone in her voice. And so, you meekly did as she asked, which became apparently semi-difficult to perform, due to the comically absurd amounts of padding that your infantile undergarment bore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Makila was certainly eager and willing to assist, lifting and pushing your diapered butt up onto the adult-sized changing table, whilst the Marnic diaper crinkled loudly in response. And with you now laying upon the changing table, Makila soon prioritized on buttoning up the flaps of the diaper cover, as you heard several audible *click* *clack* sounds of the large metallic buttons click together, thus completely sealing you in the infantile lolita dress for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that all sorted out, Makila soon helped you in dismounting from the changing table as she chirped, \"There you go, Angie. All done!\" From there, Makila soon guided you toward her mirror wall, allowing you to get a glimpse of yourself in the dress as she said, \"*giggle* I must say, dear Angie. For a Space Captain, it certainly looks ravishing on you. *giggle*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, upon looking at your reflection on full display, you saw how form-fitting yet babyish and adorable you looked in the ensemble, as you gave a few experimental (albeit limited) poses in the mirror, briefly twirling around to see behind you, where Makila soon asked, \"...Well, what do you think, Angie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing up with said poses, you turned toward Makila and replied...</span></div></div>",

You see it doesn't really fit into my personal views on marnic regression and what not, it's too young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer personal views? Maybe you could discover the reason for her peculiar style and answer the question that had been nagging you since you entered the room. \"Makila what you mean about <i>your personal view</i>?\" Makila's eyes light up \"I mean my own view.

Soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, you quickly pressed your hands against the front of your diaper, hoping to hold it in, obviously out of avoiding to soak the Lolita dress you're wearing. However, it was there that Makila began to giggle to herself, easily noticing your hesitation on going in your diaper, stifling her giggles in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Wow. You really are new to using your diaper, aren't you?\" She queried, noticing your hesitation, as you were holding back the torrent of urine from soaking your diaper, but even that was becoming rather difficult, especially with how thick and bulky your diaper is. In response, Makila calmly approached you, waddling in the process due to her own equally bulky diaper, as she then placed her lithe hands upon your own and cleanly retorted, \"Here. Allow me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a swift yet gentle motion, Makila calmly grasped your hands and slowed pulled your hands away from your diaper. In turn, this opened the metaphorical floodgates, causing you to urinate into the cushiony padding of the Marnic diaper taped around your waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, whilst the padding absorbed the yellow liquid, making the undergarment feel just a bit heavier on you, you couldn't help but notice how... \"tender\", Makila's hands were around your own, as if her digits were caressing them with affectionate intent.

In turn, this also caused Makila to stumble backwards as well, losing her balance somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for the two of you, you both landed on Makila's King-Sized crib-esque bed, feeling the soft and cushioned impact in response. From there, the two of you continued to interlock your lips with one another, with Makila calmly extending her left hand toward the front of your diaper, while keeping her right arm wrapped around your lower back. Although it wasn't what she had planned today, it was certainly an unexpected situation that she was taking a substantial liking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>==1 Hour, 24 Minutes Later...==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey say that \"Time flies by when one is enjoying themselves\", and this proverb certainly yet ironically fitted with the current circumstances between you and the Marnic President's daughter, Makila Hommertov. Shortly after such a long makeout between the two of you, you both were currently now fully on top of Makila's bed, with you laying on top of Makila, as your thick Marnic diapered behind coyly pressed upon Makila's own crinkly undergarment, along with holding each other'shands in a tender embrace<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That...Th-That was--\" You instinctively blurted out, as Makila casually continued, \"--Beyond this world. E's, I agree with you, dear Angie, *giggle* I must admit; This has been rather...exhilarating-- No, YOU'RE exhilarating,  Angelina of Earth!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon confessing such provocative emotions towards you, Makila could see how beautiful you were as well. From your shimmering eyes, to your adorably voluptuous hair, she can understand why you had kissed her with such bravado, determination, and affection. It was as if a switch had flipped on in your heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you soon felt this noticeable twinge of regret and guilt on your part. After all, you were sent here as a covert operative to assist the Federal Republic of Resyka, not to scandalously makeout with the President's daughter! Of course, Makila soon sensed your concerns due to the Marnics having a special gland in their brains that detect emotional pheromones, as she looked at you with worry, squeezing your hands just a little tighter in response and asked, \"...What's wrong, my love?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh*...I feel so dirty. And not in a good way. I mean, what if the Viceroy Caretaker or your mother enters and sees us like this? With all due respect, I came to your country as a covert operative, not to make a scandal by sleeping with you.\" You reluctantly confessed, feeling a bit disgusted with yourself on what just happened between you and Makila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she understood your current feelings on what has transpired, Makila wasn't deterred by such negative thoughts, as she then calmly questioned, \"...Angie? Do you know when Marnic women choose their bondmates?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming mildly confused by such an off-topic question, you played along and replied, \"When, Makila?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When they have reached physical maturity, which is around 18 to 21 life cycles.

That is, until I first met you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you didn't know what she meant. However, your mind soon connected the dots, causing you to become wide-eyed in realization of what Makila was saying.

Isn't that correct, my dear?\" She elaborated, gazing upon you whilst she said her last sentence. Suffice to say, it definitely made you feel a tad bit guilty for neglecting your primary mission, just so you could go native with the infantile Marnic culture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInevitably, you hesitantly responded by nodding your head in confirmation and replied, \"...Yes. She's correct, Makila. I was assigned to aid in the resistance against the Autocratic nations on your planet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you subconsciously pressed your hand against your bulky Marnic diaper underneath your lolita onesie dress and continued, \"I mean, I really LOVE wearing these things!

In fact, if my hunch is correct, you'll most likely get to meet one of them, my dear Angie.\" Makila chortled, putting her lithe hands over the the hem of her blue onesie dress skirt and uppermost crotch of her Marnic diaper in a rather ladylike manner, despite the absurdly infantile garments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, you felt a tad bit envious at how easy Makila made wearing a Marnic diaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, another curious question popped into your head, as you promptly continued, \"...I'm guessing this Emissary will be wearing diapers as well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in the first year of the solidified alliance between Acturia and Resyka, no. However, when we first began trading with Acturia, the nation seemingly developed a sub-culture quite similar to our ideals on regression and such. Not to mention they host some rather extravagant galas in their homeland. *giggle*\" Makila elaborated, which elicit an amused yet surprised blush in response, which undoubtedly entertained Makila somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, as the two of you waddled down the hallway, Makila opened a pair of double doors, which led to a spacious conference room with adjacent balcony, complete with seats specifically designed for individuals wearing some thick, bulky Marnic diapers. And looking out at the horizon from the balcony stood the supposed Acturian Emissary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from her appearance, the emissary was, without a shred of doubt, female. Most likely the same age as you and Makila, maybe a little older by a few years. Though, as for the emissary's attire...</span></div></div>",

While the men dressed in fancy suits or military uniforms of varying formality the women wore a much more varied set of outfits; from outfits similar to the ambassador to infantile garments similar to you and Makila and to your surprise a woman wearing General insignia on a onesie concealing a Marnic diaper being breastfeed by a fellow officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe President noticing your presence cast a frown upon seeing the thick bulk between your legs before directing you and Makila to a pair of seats and before long the emissary was speaking. \"Greetings and welcome. I am Evelyn Rivera a senior operative in the Acturian Intelligence.  As you all know I have been sent by my government to discuss a matter of grave importance. A matter so important that it may tip the very balance of power on this planet.\" As Rivera speaks you watch the reactions of some in the room ranging from grim-faced determination to eyes full of hope. \"In 7 days the Order of Nations will be holding its annual summit on the future of Prienne. This time, however, another matter will be on the agenda. It appears that the OoN has discovered an extraterrestrial object and while we are uncertain of its exact nature we are certain that it holds great value for the Order. From information passed by our informants and agents, it appears that it may even be enough to finally overcome the damage the Order suffered from the Global War and finally subsume the last free nations of the planet.\" Rivera gives a grim expression before continuing \"However, not all is lost. Thanks to the efforts of a high ranking informant within the OoN we have information on the location of the object and if we can acquire it may be enough to finally deal the deathblow to the OoN and finally bring freedom to all of Prienne. The details of the proposed operation are have been provided all that is needed is the approval of the Resykan President. Questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRivera fields several questions about the operation and why the information was not shared earlier, but, all you could focus on was what possible extraterrestrial object could the Order have found and just how important it might be to secure it before the Autocracies could contact Prienne. <i>\"This mission has just taken a whole new dimension\"</i> you thought to yourself.

Of course, as you clumsily dismounted from the specially-shaped chair, Makila followed suit, as if she was seemingly psychic when it came to your next course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Rivera was about to leave the room alongside her varied subordinates, you spoke up towards her and lightly exclaimed, \"Excuse me, Ms. Rivera?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Rivera promptly turned herself around towards the source of such a voice, where she then noticed you and Makila waddling towards her. At first, she seemed a little confused upon seeing you, but soon showed clarity upon noticing Makila waddling alongside you, which prompted a reassured curve of her lips, whilst you and your equally diapered bondmate approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makila! It is so good to see you once more.\" Rivera chirped, where both parties promptly embraced one another in a friendly hug, despite Makila's Marnic diaper brushing against Rivera's legs. Shortly after greeting one another, Makila responded, \"*giggle* You too, Evie. Though, I must say, it feels odd to see you without one of our patented Marnic diapers around your adorable rear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makila, you know how I prefer not to mix business with my personal life. Unlike you, of course.\" Rivera retorted, displaying a cheeky grin upon her Elven-like face. However, not a moment too soon, Rivera soon took notice of you, eyeing at you with curiosity and asked, \"Oh? And who is this spry little lady?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evie: Allow me to introduce you to Captain Angelina Jackson. She's the alien I've told you about via Holo-Vid this morning.\" Makila cheerily quipped, eagerly showing you off to the Acturian ambassador. Although you felt a smidge shy about flaunting yourself off for now, Rivera soon promptly shook your right hand in a formal greeting as she said, \"Ah, so you're the one that Makila has been talking about, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* I must admit; I've never met an alien who so easily committed to the Marnic Regression culture before until now.\" She chortled, obviously rather amused at the prospect of you, an alien to her people, going all-in on the infantile customs of Marnic society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she soon noticed the Marnic diaper bulging out from underneath your green onesie dress, as she placed a calm hand onto your diapered crotch, then lightly pressed her hand into the padding, causing it to crinkle loudly in response, where she soon spoke up and continued, \"...Then again, judging by your choice of undergarments, Captain, I'd say that you appear to be going native. *giggle*\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. But...I have some questions for you, if you don't mind.\" You calmly chirped, in which Rivera soon stood back in a professional posture, hands overlapping the front of her skirt, where she soon retorted, \"Of course!

The demands of the war coupled with the damage suffered by the Order due to Alliance bombers and the final deployment of the AoDS nuclear arsenal meant that the resources devoted to studying the object were few.

I've already shared everything my government knows about this object. Whatever it is the Order thinks it's important enough to change the balance of power on the planet and that's why we need to secure it.\" You give Evie a grim nod before replying \"I'm inclined to agree Ms. Rivera. I'll try and get myself involved in the operation and do whatever I can to distribute advanced technologies to give Acturia and Ryeska the best odds of recovering the object.\" Evie gives you a simile and extends her hand \"I hope so Captain it's nice to know we have someone out in the stars rooting for us and please call me Evie\" You take Evie's extended hand and reply \"It's my pleasure Evie and please call me Angie\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn to leave you to see Makila giving Evie another hug and a quick peck on the cheek before joining your side.

Here, allow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Makila then revealed what appeared to be a specialized Ryeskan military jumpsuit uniform, adorned with Marnic Exo-Tech framework. However, you, Michelle, and Lola soon noticed that the lower half of the outfit was notably baggy, especially at the waist, butt, hip, and pelvic region of the suit, in which Lola jumped up and blared, \"Oh, I see! These are for us to use while we're wearing our diapers, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* You're correct, my dear.

However, she knew that wouldn't help matters, so after letting out some deep breaths, she looked back at you and then calmly retorted, \"*sigh* ...I suppose you're right, Cap. At least I'm not the only one in this stupidly weird getup.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she soon noticed your blushing cheeky grin, where she put two and two together, instinctively blaring out, \"...Holy Shit. You're totally into this, aren't you!?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty as charged, G. But I've got my reasons for wearing stuff like this.\" You cheekily retorted, turning so your back faced her, where you promptly unleashed a few hard playful pats upon your absurdly bulky diapered butt. And with that, you waddled off towards Makila's room, thus leaving Gillian to her own devices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, you weren't sure why, but you seemed to be in a surprisingly peppy mood. Maybe it was the decent amount of R&amp;R given to you and your squad, maybe it was because you can now spend some quality time with the lavish yet attractive Makila Hommertov. You weren't entirely sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, you were certainly going to make the most of this free downtime, as you soon arrived at the entrance to Makila's personal quarters, where the doors were, curiously enough, already open when you had arrived.

I'm sorry for disobeying, but...I really LOVE wearing these kinds of diapers. I mean, who wouldn't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* I am relieved to see such enthusiasm from you, Captain. Sadly, the Madame President recommended that you receive a...\"fitting\" punishment, you would say.\" Kalyla explained, as she pulled out two pairs of Marnic diapers in the process. But as she discarded the soiled diaper from your person, you put two and two together as to what punishment you'll be receiving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm guessing Makila is punished as well?\" You asked, as the Viceroy wiped your privates clean, then powdered them as she answered, \"...Indeed, my dear. Since you two seem to enjoy wearing them so much, the Madame President has decided that your punishments should be to wear double the padding. She figured that it would suffice as punishments go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you felt yourself taped into the first pair of Marnic diapers, as Kalyla soon began to equip the second pair upon your already padded tush, which caused your lower half to be forcibly lifted up some by the doubled padding. Once the two pairs of Marnic diapers were securely fastened upon you, the Viceroy then resealed your onesie dress, experiencing similar troubles with your garments, but not impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, Captain.\" Kalyla chirped, easing you off the changing table, where you soon felt the full gravity of your substantial increase in padding. You could easily tell that the diapers seemingly scraped the floor, as you felt your legs forcibly separated further, thus giving you an even more profound waddle than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, you weren't sure to be either mentally aroused or embarrassed, as you took a few experimental waddling steps, spreading your arms off to the sides as a way to balance yourself much better, with Makila trying to stifle her giggling on how utterly adorable yet silly you looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You're enjoying this, aren't you?\" You coyly remarked, as Makila popped her pacifier out of her mouth in response and replied, \"*giggle* What can I say? You look absolutely adorable, Angie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Makila promptly stood back up, her Marnic diapers giving her a more noticeable waddling gait. However, from what you've learned, she's most likely accustomed to such absurd amounts of padding. And as she approached you with a lovey-dovey expression on her face, both your diapers firmly butted against one another, with audible *Pomf!* and *crinkle* noises from such physical contact, where she then quipped, \"...Now then, what do you say we get going? After all, we have a playdate to attend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>=== 45 Minutes Later... ===</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after being escorted via Hover-Limo, you and Makila soon arrived at Evie's residence, which was rather lavish, considering her social and political status.

Which in spite of your actions so far it still made you nervous.

Her suit had been replaced a white onesie while her short skirt had discarded in favour of a large pink diaper whose bulk was further accentuated by a pair of grey plastic panties while her professional hair had been redone into a pair of pigtails and her earpiece discarded in favour of a pacifier which was strapped around her neck.  \"Hello Makila, hello Angie and welcome to my home.\" Evie takes another look at you two before erupting into a chorus of giggles \"Makila, Angie I expected to come diapered but,\" as Evie closes the distances and gives you a playful smack on your thickly diapered rear \"not this diapered. *giggle* by the goddess you two can barely stand.\" While you blush shades of red Makila takes it in stride \"Indeed Evie thanks to my bondmates love of our marnic diapers it appears both of us had gotten more than we had asked for in regards to padding. But, on the flipside\" Makila pops her paci in for extra emphasis \"awen't we abswoutely adworable?\" \"*giggle* Yes you are my two little diapered friends. Now let us go meet your playmates for this occasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie leads you into a spacious hallway towards a large set of double doors marked \"playroom\" opening it reveals four additional people all women but not all Marnics. One of the first thing that catches your eye is that of a familiar figure a woman in a camo onesie with general insignia who appeared to be conversing with another woman whom you recognize as the one who breastfeed her in the meeting dressed in little more than all to small camo T-shirt which didn't even cover her belly button and a pink diaper that while not as large as the Marnic ones which you, Evie, or Makila wore was still substantial nonetheless. Further along, you see another woman this one you vaguely recognized as one of the various Marnic maidens who saw around the Presidential Retreat this one was dressed in little more than a scarlet bra and an undergarment which appeared to be a simply an oversized baby diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you noticed the 4th figure yet unlike the other three she did not possess the pointed ears typical of a marnic which meant that she had to be human which meant that she was a member of your crew so who could it be?</span></div></div>",

Suffice to say, you were internally giddy at the prospect of seeing what this place had in store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the four of you waddled inside, getting a few glances from several random onlookers passing by, as the group then approached one of the employees, who had her hair in an elaborate bun, with her stretchy pants doing little to conceal the absurd bulk of her diaper, as Makila spoke first and chirped, \"Hey, Lakisha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makila!! Aww, it's so good to see you again!\" Lakisha retorted, hugging the Presidential Daughter akin to reuniting with an old friend, which caused them to unintentionally bump their thickly padded diapers against one another. From there, Lakisha soon spoke first and quipped, \"How's my favorite customer faring? And who are these strangers you've brought with you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh these spry diaper-lovers? Lakisha, meet Lola and my bondmate, Angie. I'm sure you're already familiar with my friend Evie here?\" Makila explained, to which Lakisha nodded in confirmation, but also becoming surprised at Makila finally having a bondmate, as she quickly hugged her favorite customer with glee while she squealed, \"Aww!! I'm so proud of you, sweetie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what can I do for you lovely ladies?\" Lakisha asked, just after she ended the embrace between her and Makila, to which you soon meekly retorted, \"Oh, um... W-We're looking to buy some inflatable bodysuits for ourselves. I, um... I-I don't suppose you have any in stock, do you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to such a question, Lakisha let out a rather childish giggle in response then promptly answered, \"Of course! Why didn't you say so sooner? This way, please!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the four of you promptly followed the diapered Marnic employee towards one of the largest sections of the store, which came with...</span></div></div>",

In appearance, it was a light lavender with neon pink patterns on the fabric, as the texture of the suit looked rubbery. Also, due to it being inflated, the Hisriting suit gave her legs a fatter appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, once she got herself acclimated to her new Hisriting suit, Makila positioned herself next to a mirror and pulled off a few poses in the process, giggling a little to herself from how silly she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she heard you speak up to her as you asked, \"Um, Makila?

You're allowed to use your hands and feet to move the ball or carry it, and the suits we've adorned are meant to expedite the other part of the game. Hisriting is generally played with about 8-12 people with 4-6 people per team.

Besides, there is a custom of taking a dare or challenge when wearing a diaper, this can range to you agreeing to go potty while in-game or when you lose, to trying tackle a certain number of people, this generally give minor benefits like additional minutes.\" Makila concludes her explanation, and after inquiring about any questions you or Lola may have you soon find out that you've arrived at your destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find out that you'll be playing against</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>EspAI was in charge of SigInt (signal intelligence) so he was all about tracking signals and breaking codes. You and Agent May Bishop were spies of the HumInt variety, you were responsible for actually infiltrating groups and capturing or killing targets. You had tracked your current target, Lady Irene to Neo-Sodom, a neon light encrusted space station full to the brim with perverted nightclubs, casinos, gladiator rings, drug dens, and all manner of depravity. It was a stronghold of Iron Star, and was the source of much of the rebel group's income.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the fact that you slipped a microscopic tracking device in Lady Irene's drinking water on an earlier mission. It had lodged itself in her stomach and hadn't dissolved yet, so it was emitting a tracking signal only EspAI could follow.<br>\r\n\"Captain, I've tracked Lady Irene's location to a nightclub on Neo-Sodom.\" The robot said.<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n\"Can you be more specific?\" You said.<br>\r\nMay was a little bit ruder.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that shithole station is full of nightclubs.\" May said.<br>\r\n\"Signals indicate she's in a bondage and infantilism themed club called the Neon Nursery.\" EspAI said.<br>\r\n\"Wait, Infantilism? Like when an adult dresses like a baby and pees in a diaper?\" You said.<br>\r\n\"Ew, gross.\" May said.<br>\r\nYou feigned disgust. Secretly, this made you very excited. Your loins burned. You were secretly quite a pervert and bisexual. You'd spent a decent amount of your free time as a teenager in The Academy masturbating to Virtual Reality porn and you'd even dated a girl a couple times. And it was a fair assessment to say you felt an attraction to your partner, Agent Bishop.<br>\r\n\"Affirmative, Captain. Scans indicate there should be a 60% success rate if you use this as cover to drug and capture Lady Irene.\" EspAI said.<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment about the huge bonus offered to any agent that could bring her in alive. You looked at May. She shrugged her shoulders.<br>\r\n\"Well, I've had better luck with worse odds. I say we do it.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspAI activated a machine that would generate synthetic clothes for your disguises. One was a \"Mommy\" outfit, a black party dress with high heeled shoes. The heels were detachable and held a potent drug called \"Slave Serum\" that made the user highly suggestible. It was very illegal, as it was basically mind control, but you had a free pass to use it on targets because you were a spy. The other outfit that was generated was a \"Baby\" outfit. It consisted of an adult diaper and a cute bib with a cartoon cat on it.<br>\r\n\"These disguises should help you blend in with the party.\" EspAI said.<br>\r\nYou laughed awkwardly.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm the captain, so...\" You said.<br>\r\n\"Oh hell no. I ain't wearing no diaper!\" May said.<br>\r\nSecretly, you found the idea of wearing a diaper exciting and had hoped May would say this. Your loins burned again.<br>\r\n\"Well... I don't know... How about we play Rock-Paper-Scissors? Loser gets the diaper.\" You said.<br>\r\nYou knew how this would go.<br>\r\n\"All right, fine.\" May said.<br>\r\n\"One! Two! Three! Go!\" You called out.<br>\r\nYou put up a closed fist, indicating \"Rock\". May put out her open hand, indicating \"Paper\". She won. you knew she'd do paper. She always did paper.<br>\r\n\"Woohoo! Looks like I win, Korri!\" May said, smugly.<br>\r\nShe began changing into the black party dress. Slowly, you stripped out of your clothes and put on the big thick diaper. You also slipped on the bib, which did nothing to cover your breasts. It felt rather humiliating to be next to your partner like this, but it was quite a rush.<br>\r\n\"Korri, your tits are hanging out.\" May noted.<br>\r\nShe poked your bare breast and let it jiggle lewdly. You laughed awkwardly and blushed.<br>\r\n\"Ah, jeez. So, when we capture Lady Irene and get that bonus, how about we leave this part out, okay?\" You said.<br>\r\n\"Right, right.\" May said, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspAI parked the ship in the Neon Nursery's docking bay. He would stay on the ship. You and May got past the doorman easy enough, you were a couple cute girls and May slipped him 100 Credits to jump the line. She didn't have to do that, though. Seeing your bare breasts was enough for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the club was a normal bar and a dance floor, but that was where \"normal\" ended. There seemed to be an endless network of corridors and hallways, each leading to rooms purposefully built for perversion. There were rooms for tying people up, rooms for sexy torture, rooms for changing diapers, rooms for bathing, rooms for breastfeed, an adult preschool run by a large breasted \"Nanny\", and all manner of rooms whose perverted purpose your could only imagine. You felt pretty hot and bothered like this, dressed so lewdly with your breasts exposed, crawling on your hands and knees in a diaper next to your crewmate you were secretly attracted to. Your loins burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe micro-speakers implanted in you and May's heads whirred with EspAI's voice.<br>\r\n\"I've hacked into the security cameras and scanned for Lady Irene. I've found her location.\" EspAI said.<br>\r\n\"Well, tell us where she is?\" You whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is Lady Irene?</span></div></div>",

Make a right at the end of the hallway with the green neon lights, fourth door on the left.\" EspAI explained.<br>\r\nMay looked at you, trying to get into character. You both had to stay in character so as not to arouse suspicion. Most, if not all, of the bosses and workers here were part of Iron Star and if your covers blew they'd probably kill you... or worse.<br>\r\n\"Come on, Baby, let's go to the Mommy's Corner.\" May said.<br>\r\nShe took your hand and began leading you down the hallways. You crawled on your hands and knees the entire time, feeling both excited and humiliated. Men dressed as \"Daddies\" ogled your body. Girls in diapers passed you by giving you jealous looks. A couple dominatrices even pointed and laughed at you. Your face was a crooked grimace. Your loins continued to burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay took you into Mommy's Corner, a cozy little room full of adult sized cribs, highchairs, sofas, and playpens. There was a wine bar in the back for the Mommy roleplayers as well a multitude of baby toys... and adult \"toys\".<br>\r\n\"There she is!\" May said, pointing toward the back of the room.<br>\r\nLady Irene, and an adult baby girl were on a sofa playing. A bodyguard was with them, standing nearby. Lady Irene, a tall and strong woman with jet-black hair, was dressed in an orange skirt and a pink button-up shirt. Her hair was up in a bun, and she had no makeup on. She didn't look anything like her Iron Star personality, the tough powerful woman who claimed she would one day fix the galaxy. Instead, she looked quite soft and motherly. To anyone not looking specifically for her, she appeared to be just another patron at the club. The adult baby that accompanied Lady Irene wasn't anyone special, but you recognized her from being in the background of several Iron Star propaganda and recruiting films. She was most likely an actor Lady Irene felt an attraction to. The adult baby girl had long blonde hair, fair skin, and small breasts. She was quite skinny, except for her chubby thighs. She wore a large thick diaper and a pink half-shirt that left her tummy exposed. She was sucking on a pacifier. The bodyguard was a tall, powerful man wearing a business suit and sunglasses. He was bald and was sipping on some kind of green minty alcoholic beverage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay went to the bar and ordered a chardonnay for herself and another to give to Lady Irene. She also ordered a couple small baby bottles full of milk. She would have put the Slave Serum in Lady Irene's wine if the guard hadn't been watching. Leisurely, the two of you made your way over to meet them.<br>\r\n\"Hi there! Mind if we sit next to you?\" May said.<br>\r\nLady Irene looked you both up and down.<br>\r\n\"Sure, not?\" She said.<br>\r\nMay handed one of the glasses of chardonnay to Lady Irene and motioned for you to sit on her lap. Lady Irene took a sip.<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is good stuff. My name's Irene, by the way.\" The rebel leader said.<br>\r\nShe wasn't even using a pseudonym.<br>\r\n\"Charmed to meet you! I'm Mommy May, and this here's my baby. You can just call her 'Baby'.\" May said, patting your head.<br>\r\nYou blushed and grimaced, unable to say anything. Here you were, a strong, smart, athletic woman forced in the line of duty to dress in diapers and humiliate yourself in front of the enemy. Your crotch oozed with pleasure.<br>\r\n\"Oh, she is a cutie. Mine's named Fiona. Isn't she adorable?\" Lady Irene said.<br>\r\nShe turned her diapered partner to face you. The girl was slightly younger than you, probably 17 or 18 years old, and looked to be on some kind of soft drugs or alcohol. She had a dazed, carefree look on her face and didn't speak, only babbled childishly.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Fiona! That's so sweet.\" May said.<br>\r\nShe bent over and gave Fiona a soft pat on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed as you sat on May's lap. May and Irene sipped their wine contentedly.<br>\r\n\"So, are you two... like... together?\" Irene asked.<br>\r\nThe thought of being May's lesbian lover made your crotch ooze even more. This was beginning to get overwhelming. May giggled at Irene's question, oblivious to your inner struggle.<br>\r\n\"Well, sort of. We like to keep it open.\" May said.<br>\r\nIrene smiled. She liked where this was going. You could practically feel her eyes looking over your tanned, athletic body, especially at your exposed breasts.<br>\r\n\"You want to trade babies for a little bit?\" Irene suggested.<br>\r\nAn idea must have snapped in May's head because her face lit up like this was some kind of lucky break.<br>\r\n\"Sure thing! Let's do this.\" May said.<br>\r\nShe nudged you off her lap and made your crawl over to Irene. Irene handed Fiona, too addled to move much on her own, over to May. May got out the baby bottle full of milk and Fiona happily began drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene looked down at you as you crawled on the floor, smiling.<br>\r\n\"Come on, Baby, up on Mommy Irene's lap!\" The rebel leader said.<br>\r\nGingerly, you climbed up and sat on Irene's legs. Given you were so short and she was so tall, you felt even more like a child next to her. She rubbed your tummy and fondled one of your breasts. You let out a pleasured moan.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Baby likes that? How about this?\" Irene said.<br>\r\nShe pinched your nipple. It hurt but it felt really, really hot. You wanted her to pinch you more. You wanted her to smack and spank you. You wanted her to degrade and humiliate you like the perverted little slut you were.<br>\r\n\"Ooh.. M... more.\" You moaned.<br>\r\nYou could hardly believe this. This was the most wanted enemy of the state and here you were doing really, REALLY weird and perverted stuff with her. It was like a dream and a nightmare both at once.<br>\r\nLady Irene pinched your nipple again, harder this time. You let out a moan expressing both pleasure and pain. You lost control and let your sexual juices flow freely into your diaper. You panted and closed your eyes. Lady Irene laughed and turned to May.<br>\r\n\"You sure do have a lewd baby here, Mommy May!\" Irene said, smiling.<br>\r\nMay looked at you, feeling smug. She knew what you'd just done and really realized just what kind of pervert you were.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's a dirty little slut. Aren't you a dirty little slut, Baby? Aren't you Mommy's little slut?\" May said, tauntingly.<br>\r\nYou were a laughingstock in her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Y... Yes, Mommy.\" You groaned.<br>\r\nMay mocking laughed at you. You weren't her Captain right now, you were just a filthy little creep. You felt totally humiliated, yet you couldn't get enough of this. Lady Irene laughed too. You frowned and couldn't bear to look May in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, unexpectedly, Lady Irene bent down and blew raspberries on your tummy. You couldn't help but giggle. This totally broke the mood.<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Baby. I still like you. You're all right.\" Irene said.<br>\r\nYou put on another crooked smile. Irene patted your head again and began reaching through her purse.<br>\r\n\"Now, I've got something nice for you, Baby, something you're going to love!\" Irene said.<br>\r\nIt was probably drugs. No, after seeing her take out a bottle of pills you knew it was definitely drugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of drugs does Lady Irene have?</span></div></div>",

When you ask her about what happened to Irene she laughs \"don't worry about it Captain I spiked her drink and get her to get aboard the ship right now she's in the Brig and doubtlessly pissed.\" As she talks, May takes a look at your diaper seeing its condition and states \"looks like you need a change skipper lets get you to the bathroom\" You try to lean on May for support but your legs are limp, and May ends up carrying you. You're lucky your ship is mostly automated and that the other two members of your crew were on another mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bathroom, May sets you on the floor and rips the tapes of the diaper dumping it in the trash before cleaning your crotch with wipes. To your surprise, however, May opens a bag on the counter and retrieves a diaper baby powder and oil. May sees your face and looks apologetic \"Sorry Korri thanks to that drug you're bladder and bowel incontinent plus you can't walk so you're gonna have to wear these plus you seemed to enjoy them\" May quickly powders and oils you up before sliding the diaper under you and tapes it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, captain, I know you don't like it knowing this is your first command and all but due to your condition I've had EspAi relieve of duty.

You let out a groan. You were totally helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay helped you into a chair and put your computer in front of you. You filled out a report of what happened, with a little help from May to fill in details you missed, like what time Lady Irene was caught, and how much Slave Serum was used. You were only halfway paying attention, though. You were more focused on your useless legs, once so strong and powerful, now flimsily dangling on the end of your hips. The muscles were still there but they couldn't do anything. You felt rather troubled, worrying when and if you'd be able to walk again. May seemed to take notice.<br>\r\n\"You look really down, Korri. Something on your mind?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Well... yeah... My legs don't work. I don't want to need a wheelchair forever.\" You said, wiggling your thighs.<br>\r\nThat's just about all you could do with them, a gentle wiggle. May put her hand on your back to comfort you.<br>\r\n\"It's all right, Korri. We'll get you to a nice physical therapist eventually.\" May said.<br>\r\nThen a devious smile lit up her face. She put her hand on one of your breasts and gave it a nice squeeze. You let out a cute squeak.<br>\r\n\"Or we could always cut them off and get you some cyborg legs. Those are cool, right?\" May said, jokingly.<br>\r\nYou really didn't want cyborg legs if you could help it, you were quite proud of your natural body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay sat on the floor and scooted you onto her lap. She gently cradled you in her arms and stroked your hair. You felt like a child being held like this, but it was oddly comforting.<br>\r\n\"You're a good agent, Korri. Too good to go to waste. I won't let High Command leave you like this forever, I promise.\" May said.<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes and tried your best to smile.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, May. That really means a lot to me.\" You said.<br>\r\nYou felt a deep feeling in your heart just then, a deep feeling of love. However, you didn't express it just yet. You weren't sure if May would be ready for it. But you wanted to kiss her, you really did. The feeling of your bare flesh against her arms, her soft silky shirt and pants against your back and your legs, it all felt very nice. Your crotch dampened slightly. Irene's drug very well might have made you hornier too. You wouldn't put it past her putting that kind of drug in you, Irene was a total slimeball of a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay helped you finish the report, it wasn't long since the whole mission had been completed in a couple hours, miraculously. May did her best to keep your spirits up, she knew it would be a rough few months for you without being able to walk.</span></div></div>",

Don't you, Baby?\" Irene said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" You said.<br>\r\n\"You want one too?\" Irene asked May.<br>\r\nMay thought for a moment but then shook her head.<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I'm fine.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Well, suit yourself.\" Irene replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Irene's breasts had swollen to a larger size. She unbuttoned her shirt, letting her big, bouncy, milky breasts hang loose. Even if your weren't drugged up, you would have felt a strong attraction to them.<br>\r\n\"You hungry, baby?\" Irene asked.<br>\r\nYou nodded. You never thought this kind of thing would happen, being breast fed by the leader of the rebellion you were being paid to stop, but here it was. And you couldn't resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Irene moved your head to her breasts. Without shame or fear, you began suckling like a newborn, stopping only to breathe and nuzzle her soft, wonderful breasts with your face. You let out a content moan every now and then. Once again, you were getting sexual juices in your diaper. Irene smiled. May did her best to hide her look of shock. Your perversion was beginning to disturb her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene would sometimes gently rub your tummy or your back as you suckled form her. She would coo and giggle when you tickled her sensitive nipples with your mouth. The two of you were loving every second of this.</span></div></div>",

Your mind still rests on the mission, and even if your secondary cover of not liking this kind of thing to May is blown, you still take some satisfaction in being able to justify your next move for the mission. You close your eyes and relax your bladder, your body doesn't need any convincing, and soon the juices of pleasure that already fill your diaper are met with urine, colliding in a warm mixture that has you begging for some physical contact. If your face doesn't give it away to Irene, your rapidly expanding diaper does. \"My my, looks like the baby has wet her diaper, does she like the feel.\" You can only nod. Fiona, who also noticed your situation, seemingly grows bored, and starts to look back toward May, you aren't sure if May has finished her work yet, but your aroused state and dedication to the mission lead you to hop towards Fiona, engaging her in a kiss. \"You really are on the end of your rope little one!\" Irene says, pleasantly amused at the fool you're making of yourself. \"Here May, take her back, you may want to help her with her situation. You look over at May, smugness and satisfaction fill her eyes, you see Fiona drinking on her bottle, eyes more dazed than they were before. May takes you back, and, maybe to encourage Irene to follow suit, maybe just to torment you, brings you in for a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet little one, mommy's still having fun talking to the adults.\" May says, pulling you out of a kiss and swatting a hand you didn't know was there from the top of your diaper. You look over, Irene has in fact copied you two, and is kissing Fiona. Her eyes immediately seem to lose focus, and she and Fiona sit there, still. \"Let's, the four of us, go back to my ship, where we can get to know each other better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene snaps out of her stare, seemingly as sharp as ever, though now devoid of that threatening demeanor that she always so subtly maintained. \"That sounds wonderful.\" Irene snaps her finger and her guard, as well as a few other mommy's and babies that were sitting near to her, all start to wander off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get back to ship, does May take advantage of the drugged girls and you?</span></div></div>",

Your soggy diaper was beginning to itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed May to the showers. It was a communal showering area with small stalls offering little privacy. May had already undressed and was getting out her shampoo from a cupboard. You'd seen her naked a few times before, and seeing her wonderful body now, in your already-aroused state, made your loins burn even more. You removed your bib and threw away your adult diaper. May took notice of he stench of urine and sex coming from it.<br>\r\n\"Aw, that's so cute. You even peed in it!\" She said.<br>\r\nYou blushed.<br>\r\n\"I... um...\" You stuttered.<br>\r\nMay patted your head.<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Korri. I can help get you cleaned up.\" May said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was rather unusual, since you two often showered in separate stalls, but you weren't one to pass up this kind of opportunity. The two of you stepped naked into the shower and were soon drenched with warm, steamy water. May began shampooing your hair and you started soaping yourself up, especially around your urine-soaked crotch.<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this?\" You asked as May rinsed you down.<br>\r\nMay slyly smiled.<br>\r\n\"Well, I can see how much you enjoyed being babied. I thought I'd indulge you a little.\" She said, with a giggle.<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what this meant, but you secretly hoped it meant May was going to do some dirty things with you. You went to wash her, putting a hand with a washrag on her strong, toned thigh, but she stopped you.<br>\r\n\"No, no. I can get that myself.\" May said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you finished showering and went to go dry off. You wrapped a towel around your damp, naked body.<br>\r\n\"Wait, before you get dressed, follow me.\" May said.<br>\r\nYou followed May, both of you clad in only towels, out to the living quarters. EspAI was there, interfacing with a computer.<br>\r\n\"Captain, Agent Bishop, I've set autopilot to take us toward Black Hole Bay for the prisoners. We should be arriving in one to two cycles.\" EspAI said.<br>\r\nA cycle was around 24 earth hours. It might be a while.<br>\r\n\"Well, that's great. Thanks, EspAI.\" You said.<br>\r\n\"All right, that reward is as good as ours!\" May added, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, May yanked your towel off, leaving you naked. Even though you' just been in the shower with May, you moved your hands to cover your breasts and genitals.<br>\r\n\"May! What are you doing! EspAI can see me!\" You said.<br>\r\n\"Relax, Korri. He's a robot.\" May said, shrugging her shoulders.<br>\r\nEspAI gazed at you without a single emotion. Still, you felt a twinge of humiliation being seen by him like this, and the accompanying rush that came with it. You had no idea how you got off on being humiliated like this, but it was powerful.<br>\r\n\"So, EspAI, got any more of those adult diapers from the costume?\" May asked.<br>\r\n\"Affirmative.\" EspAI said.<br>\r\n\"M... May, what are you...?\" You said.<br>\r\nMay smiled.<br>\r\n\"Why should Irene get to have all the fun with you? Come on, Korri, you're a deviant at heart, I can tell. We have a while before we have to get back to mission stuff. Let's enjoy it!\" May said.<br>\r\nYou blushed again. You couldn't resist this offer.<br>\r\n\"Ah... All right. But not a word of this to High Command, okay?\" You said.<br>\r\nMay clapped her hands together.<br>\r\n\"Awesome! EspAI, get us another adult diaper for Korri.\" May said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspAI nodded and procured a fresh diaper for you. May helped you into it. It was a much more comfortable one, very warm and secure. May laughed at you again.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're so cute!\" She said, patting your head.<br>\r\nYour crotch burned. This wasn't even for the mission, this was just having fun. Here you were now, dressing in only a diaper with your crewmate May. She seemed to understand your desire to be babied and humiliated, and seemed to enjoy exploring this new aspect of your relationship. Your tummy felt like it was full of butterflies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does May do next?</span></div></div>",

It was a golden staff of alien design, with strange sigils adorning it. Her own knowledge of xenoarcheology let her know that almost all species looked identical to humans (at least on the outside) and she also knew that magic was merely high frame equations. But the Staff of Karban the Strong Willed would allow her to finally be rid of the pesky Themis crew, an all female law enforcement taskforce with the purpose of bringing her and her crew to justice, and to allow her crew to finally have unchallenged reign. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis ancient staff belonged to a queen of a long dead species, and was brought to her attention by a trusted informant. He was a man Heather could trust, and he had revealed to her the story of Karban. According to the informant, anyone who wielded the staff could turn anyone into completely loyal minions, and like all his tips it was right on the money. What Heather didn't know was that this informant was a child of a family murdered during one of her own raids. The child had grown up, and now had finally taken his revenge upon the ones who had killed his parents. It had taken many years, gaining Heather's trust, but it had paid off. For the real story of Karban the Strong Willed is a strange one, and the curse is very real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarban was a queen with a \"romantic abnormality\" to put it politely. She loved seeing adult baby women, and had the staff formed to reduce any woman into a babbling overgrown toddler or infant. Karban was a powerful mage and ensured that her harem was always full of women who wore diapers and had baby minds and instincts. However, her reign came to an end when she carelessly left her staff lying around and one of her harem started playing with it, reducing \"mommy\" Karban into adult infancy. In her last moments before she became an overgrown rugrat she cursed the staff so that no woman near the staff would escape the fate she had loved seeing others fall to and that now befell her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather knew nothing of that however, and on the Freedom of Nobility, the flagship of this pirate fleet, the entirety of Catherine's Armada gathered to celebrate. As Heather got up, the staff started to take effect. She started to waddle a bit and said, \"Huh, me panties fweel weird.\" Then she saw herself in a mirror and gasped. Her crimison red hair was in pigtails, and the only thing she wore was a diaper with a skull and crossbones on it. She gasped, and her perfect teeth were soon obscured by her thumb, which she started to suck furiously (Karban didn't like seeing women without teeth or hair, so she didn't have her staff do that, even when she cursed it). She then lisped, \"Me in diapy?\" and fell to the floor, no longer able to walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon every pirate of Catherine's Armada was effected just like there captain. Bottles and cups of alcohol became babas and sippy cups of milk or fruit juice. Bras vanished and the most mature of clothing were pull ups and toddler dresses. No one on board could move better than toddling. and baby furniture replaced that of adults. Where once the Freedom of Nobility was awash with the sound of female pirates celebrating, now it was awash in the sound of women mimicking babies. Some crawled around, completely regressed, while others started to wail and throw tantrums, all too aware of what they had lost.</span></div></div>",

Often rife with violence and abuse from both guards and prisoners such ships are headed by hardboiled men and women whose strict attitudes and harsh prison regimes help maintain a semblance of order amongst the refuse of the galaxy. Taliah was one such Jailor, A-13 ran like clockwork Prisoners where kept in line with threats and brutality, and a rigorously trained and exercised guard force helped keep order on the ship one of the best disciplined \"black\" ships in the UFN. Yet, for all the rumours and exaggerations about A-13s Captain for those who've met her, she is a timid lady with blonde hair and pale skin from having spent to much time in ships with an affable if stubborn personality. Those who are close to her are always privy a fact that few are aware of; that the Black Lady of A-13 is dependant on diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Flashback-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecades ago in a dorm room at Comanche High School, Unity District, New Providence a young Taliah Black is embroiled in a strip poker game with Accelra Hawk. She is losing, badly Taliah is now stark naked while Accelra has only lost her blouse \"Come on Accelra a few more rounds? After I put on my back on clothes?\" Taliah asks. Accelra gives the young lady of the look of exasperation \"Taliah you know how the rules of the game besides you knew going into this that you were going to lose\". \"Yeah, yeah I know but please just these once\" Taliah pleads. Accelra opens her mouth to say no but an idea pops into her head \"Alright fine but for every piece of clothing and every round you lose is a day you have wear diapers\". \"Diapers? Why?\" Taliah asks, \"because it is going to teach you not to play stupid games that you know you're going to lose\" Accelra replies. Then they play and Taliah loses game after game after game after game and as Taliah keeps stripping and as the game keeps resetting Accelra is keeping track. When Taliah gives up after hours of playing Accelra tells her the tally \"So we played for what eight hours straight? In that time you took off your clothes 357 times and lost no less than 48 times which means that my dear Taliah you are stuck in diapers for 405 days\". \"405!?\" Taliah exclaims in surprise. \"Yep, hope you enjoy sitting in your own waste and remember you have to wear them at all times no exceptions and you must use for all their intended use.\" \"Bu-\" \"No butts in Taliah you are stuck in diapers now deal with it\". And she did for some 13 months Taliah Black went back to diapers full time as she completed her 2nd year of High School often leading to many embarrassing moments and humiliations for Taliah. By, the end, however, Taliah was a girl who had little control over her bladder and only slightly better control over her bowels while also finding a perverse pleasure in wearing diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow at age 43 as a young capable captain of a Prison ship Taliah faces many challenges including dealing with the ships Sarcastic AI Janet. Awaking from her slumber in a thoroughly used diaper Taliah hears her AI report \"All systems normal, no reports of suspicious activity among the prisoners and pee-yew Captain your diaper is at 95% capacity and needs an immediate change unless you want diaper rash to go with your diaper.\" Taliah only groans in response walking over to the bathroom to dispose of her diaper and to take a shower.

Yet, she has a secret, a secret that is known only to her parents and her pet Treecat Nimitz and a handful of her most trusted subordinates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecretly Admiral Lady Dame Honor Harrington, Duchess and Steadholder Harrington was a diaper lover and a partial adult baby, someone who loved wearing and sometimes using diapers and acting like an overgrown child. It was something Harrington always had, yet, she only recently had the confidence to act on those desires and now with her career temporarily on ice following the end of the Haven-Monticoran war Stephanie Harrington is taking a well-deserved rest from the political war raged in the Commons and House of Lords to relax at her home in Grayson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe welcome was gracious and friendly but, Honor didn't pay it much mind she had only one thing on her mind. Briskly walking through her Homestead to her quarter's Honor made sure to double lock the doors and informed her Armsmen to warn her of any guests. Unlocking a compartment in the bottom of her dresser Honor retrieved a stack of thick white diapers and some changing supplies, her hands caressing the soft plastic of the undergarment having changed little from its incarnation in the 21st Century savoring its feeling and smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly undressing her skirt and panties Honor gently lay down on her soft comparted floor and slid the diaper under her applying powder and oil Honor slowly pulled the front of her diaper over her loins and affixed the tapes for a time Honor was bliss she rarely had time to indulge in her interests and she was determined to make the most of her time, after what seemed like an eternity Honor took herself up from the floor and began rummaging through her secret compartment receiving a Onesie and pacifier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving the rest of her blouse Honor pulled the Onesie over her shoulders and attached the buttons with a sharp click. Plopping the Pacifier in her mouth Honor retrieved and few toys and began playing. Feeling a slight pressure in bladder Harrington simply released her bladder something she learned to do over the past few years and within moments a growing warmth spread through her crotch, it felt nice, pleasant even but Honor was soon torn from her moment of bliss by a message from Andrew the commander of her personal security detachment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to distrub you malady but, we have a visitor.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonor gave a mental sigh of disappointment before replying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can it not wait, Andrew, I'm kind of busy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Maladay it appears we are receiving _____ and they wish to discuss something with you \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
