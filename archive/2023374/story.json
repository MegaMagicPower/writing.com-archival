You tried to go to sleep again, this time successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dreamed that you and Tails were fighting Eggman.

Smiling, you put in the Sonic Mega Collection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got to the main menu, you told your new friend to open his eyes.

No insulting other races &amp; religions<br>\r\n          2. USE PROPER GRAMMAR, No TEXT SLANG<br>\r\n          3. I'll allow some toilet humor just no pee or scat(Fart jokes are fine IE: a character uses a whoopee cushion in a prank.) had to change rule 3 a bit for obvious reasons      <br>\r\n         4. No characters turning evil if they're nice normally (for example: Tails ends up being a jerk and makes you his slave after being nice to you. I don't want that.)<br>\r\n        5. I'll let you add in crossovers like if you wanted Coco from Crash bandicoot in this feel free to add her. as long as there's a sonic character in the story line it's fine<br>\r\n       6. Don't make an endless chain of other options because that just gets very repetitive, unless it's picking a character, a tickle tool or setting up a story line, don't create a endless next option chain.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNew rule: 7. Don't make the main character &amp; a franchise character have sex to fast build a friendship which turns into an actual relationship before that (BI, straight, gay etc. any types fine just run it by me first) I WILL let rouge be an exception to rule 7 'Cause this is rouge we're talking about.        <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs long as you all fallow rules 1-7 you'll be fine Have fun :) if you have questions go ahead and ask via email<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Don't forget that I'm here to help satisfy your feet related &amp; tickle related needs or anything else that comes to your head)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8/15/2019 update: I'm looking for additions to my interactives! I'll give gp as rewards for the adds, however I do have rules for this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. If you do a character choice chapter you'll get 100 gp<br>\r\n2. If you do a story chapter you'l get 500 or 1000+ gp depending on the chapter's length<br>\r\n3. Stick to the guidelines of the interactive you add to <br>\r\n4. Lastly DON't add choice chapters over and over if you think you'll get more gp for it! If someone does so they will only get 100 gp for the FIRST chapter because if they do that it's not fair to others that may want to add to one of the interactives!      </td>",
