You could try your luck with the girl nearby, or try and make the long trek to the sports area. Both of those could be dangerous though, so it might be best to walk around the school and look for a better chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">Health 100%</span> <span class=\"corange\">Hunger: 99%</span> <span class=\"clblue\">Status: Clean</span> <span class=\"cindigo\">Injury: None</span></span></div></div>",

Crawling under the bathroom door, you make your way over to the stalls, and see a pair of flats with leggings pulled down over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cred\">Health: 100%</span> <span class=\"corange\">Hunger: 98%</span> <span class=\"cblue\">Status: Clean</span> <span class=\"cplum\">Injury: None</span></b></span></div></div>",

Tara was known for being a tomboy bitch.  She had long, jet black hair she almost always wore doen, and was practically Playboy material, if she didn't use somuch dark make-up. Though she seems to be busy texting rather than actually using the bathroom, until you hear a long, wet fart echo in the bowl. \"That is the last time I steal someone else's lunch,\" you hear her grumble. Of course, getting caught would mean almost certain death, but how could you pass up this prime voyeuristic opportunity?  Looking around at how you could climb up to get a better glimpse of Tara, you only see two options.  Her leg, and toilet paper hanging close to the ground from the roll. Of course, climbing he rleg would almost certainly be suicide, but if you were successul the perverted reward might be better than you can hope.  Climbing the toilet paper would be playin it safe, as long as Tara was only gassy, that is. Alternatively, you could be in it for the long game. You noticed her purse is next to her. To sneak into it and follow her home would be a pervert's wet dream!  Plus, there would be a lot less risk involved than there is right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cred\">Health: 100%</span> <span class=\"corange\">Hunger: 98%</span> <span class=\"cblue\">Status: Clean</span> <span class=\"cplum\">Injury: None</span></b></span></div></div>",

The trek is a hard one, you were never much for the climbing rope in gym class, but your hormones drove you forward (1% hunger).  Each segment of the soft paper was like a milestone for you.  As you make it more than half way up, you hear a sound that makes your heart skip a beat.  <i>Plunk!</i> \"About damned time,\" you hear Tara say as she continues to relieve herself.  At once you try to abort the mission even as she reaches for the toilet paper.  You have climbed too high to just let go, it would mean almost certain death!  The paper shook as she tore it, but you manage to hold on.  She had grabbed the segment right above yours.  If you were fast enough, you could get to her hand before you were used for something very unpleasant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cred\">Health: 100%</span> <span class=\"corange\">Hunger: 97%</span> <span class=\"cblue\">Status: Clean</span> <span class=\"cplum\">Injury: None</span></b></span></div></div>",

The other interactives have been around for ages and starting a new one up is insane, unless you have a specific subject. But how can I bring new life into the interactive genre? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe by making it look more like a game\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><u><b><span class=\"chunter\">A First Day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Guide To Being Shrunk</span></b></u> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Intro</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither by intent or bad karma you have become the size of a bug. This guide will teach you how to survive in a dangerous world full of giant people, animals and randomly falling chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Stats</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start off with your stats. Your stats will be displayed on the top of a chapter and on the end. On the top will your stats from before the event in the chapter. While the stats at the end will show you the impact of the events that happened in the chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cred\">Health: 100%</span>   <span class=\"corange\">Hunger: 100%</span>   <span class=\"cblue\">Status: Clean</span>   <span class=\"cplum\">Injury: None</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cred\"><u>Health </u></span></b><br>\r\nThere is a slight chance you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get hurt. You will probably die instantly but if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in luck, that means you only lost a percentage of your health. Your health is displayed in red and shows how close to permanent death you are. You will survive until this health bar show a painful zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"corange\"><u>Hunger</u></span></b><br>\r\nHunger and dehydration are a dangerous thing you need to eat and drink in order to survive. Just like health, if this depletes you are dead my friend. So scavenge for food as much as possible. Eating once will restore the entire percentage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cblue\"><u>Status</u></span></b><br>\r\nThere are two types of people in this world \u00e2\u0080\u009cclean\u00e2\u0080\u009d ones and \u00e2\u0080\u009cDirty\u00e2\u0080\u009d ones. Some situations might drench you in unwanted fluids or dirt. It is best to get yourself washed up out of self respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cplum\"><u>Injury</u></span></b><br>\r\nIn case a really bad accident happens you might lose an arm or break a few bones. This will of course cripple you and make your survival that much harder. Your handicap(s) will be displayed in this section and can be anything the universe throws at you. There is no way to recover from injuries as there is no bug doctor, so be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Some more tips</b></u><br>\r\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t jump in shoes, Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look for food inside food and try to get one of the regular sized people to help you. This increases your chances by a billion. Unless everyone around you is a psychopath.
