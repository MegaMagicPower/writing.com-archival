He was really looking forward to later as Susanne had received two tickets to the black tie gala held by a local business tycoon, Mrs. Ileana Corrice. This would be an excellent chance for Harvey to get his name in with many of the town's top businessmen and politicians as well as be an excellent opportunity to suggest to Susanne that they get an apartment together and finally move out of their parent's houses. Since his mind was elsewhere, Harvey wasn't paying attention to the exact frequencies and amplitudes he was inputting for the fancy new laser he was working with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarvey! Can you come help me move this workbench?\u201d called out Dr. Phillip Hopscotch, Harvey's boss from across the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing\u201d, replied Harvey, jumping to his feet and walking across the test firing area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stepped in front of the laser, he felt a slight tingle and all his body hair stood on end. The laser then overloaded and the computer Harvey had been working at exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d shouted out Dr. Hopscotch, running over to Harvey, \u201cYou okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I'm fine,\u201d replied Harvey, \u201cBut the laser is ruined!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Hopscotch looked over at the smouldering mess of Harvey's workstation and the laser and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the important thing is that no one was hurt,\u201d commented Dr. Hopscotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarvey then helped Dr. Hopscotch try and rescue what was left of the laser before heading off to change for his evening with Susanne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Harvey know that within his body a strange power was building up that would allow him to  swap gender (name too), age, work &amp; school, relationships (family &amp; friends, etc.), or hobbies (any permutation thereof) with someone else by shooting them with a beam of light no more than once a week. The question is, when did Harvey's (your) power first activate?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You sigh, \"Like she'll ever get in looking like that,\" and then there is a brief blast of light as you fire a changing beam at the girl, forcing you to blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everything clears you look around for the girl, where she had been there's now a college age man out on the prowl.  Then the wind picks up and you feel a chill on your bare legs and quickly realize that you're wearing a pink mini-dress.  You quickly grab your skirts and stop everyone from getting a free view and then you start trying to understand how exactly you came to be wearing a dress.  As you start to think the you might have swapped with the girl, who then would have turned into the man, Susanne appears at your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harriet, are you ok, it's not safe for a girl your age to be alone on the street like this,\" Susanne says, not that you care because she is dressed to kill, tight black satin mini-dress, her hair done up nicely and the girls are on display.  Fortunately your transformation has left you about face level with her cleavage which makes this much less awkward.  \"But that's a real pretty dress you have Harriet, come on up to my apartment I'll do your make up before I drive us off to the event.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well,' you think, 'She definitely thinks I'm a girl and now that I'm walking I can tell Susanne isn't the only one of us in heels tonight... which goes along with that theory.  I can either just let this play out and act the shy little girl or throw a fit about my lost masculinity.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a weird day,\" you mumble as she leads you towards her apartment.</span></div></div>",

Her hair was now done in a tight bun and she carried a tasteful satchel.  Her heeled feet clicked as she walked towards campus.  Obviously headed to a night class or study group.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harvey? Hello, Earth to Harvey!\" Susanne was calling to you.  Snapping out of your daze you see her outstretched hand grasping for you, the other holding her building's door open.  \"come on honey, let's get ready for the party.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding your hand, you climb the flight of stairs to her apartment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susanne gets ready, you inspect her apartment.  Something is off.  Her fridge is covered with finger paintings and drawings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How as your day honey?  Learn anything new?\" Susanne asks as she slides into a very revealing black dress that gets you slightly aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Work was ok, almost had an accident in the lab today.\"  You reply.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love when you refer to school as 'work', so endearing and cute!  You said there was a problem in science class?  Did you mess up dissecting your frog?\"  She replies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you're really confused.  But suddenly it dawns on you, why the middle school girl suddenly changed outfits.  You reach for your leather wallet hoping you're wrong about what has happened.  When your hand grasps what should've been your wallet, your worst fears are realized.  Your nice leather wallet has been replaced with a velcro nylon wallet emblazoned with the local pro-football team's logo.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRipping the velcro seal, you frantically pull out what looks like an ID, only to discover a student ID has replaced your driver's license.  Digging further into your \"new\" wallet, you find only random pictures of you and Susanne goofing off at the beach, a library card stating that you are now in the 7th grade, and a punch card for what the Juice Stand known to be a kid's hangout.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\" you mutter to yourself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HARVEY BOLT!  You watch your language!\" Susanne yells at you from the bathroom where she's applying the final touches to her make-up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head to the fridge and inspect the \"artwork\", just as you suspected, all done by you.  Apparently Susanne has been dating you since around 4th grade, which would explain the progressing improvement of the work.  You crack the door and grab a beer, popping the top and taking a large swig.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Susanne's face change from panic over being late to anger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harvey!  You're too young to drink!  Give me that!\"  She says grabbing the bottle from your hand. \"you know how much trouble we could get in! What has gotten into you this evening?  Cursing and drinking?  Are you going to tell me you have taken up smoking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uh...I'm sorry\" you half-heartedly reply.  Apparently you really never had drank, the one swig you took hits you hard and you have a mild buzz going on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I forgive you,\" Susanne tussles your hair. \"Are you ready?  Where's your bowtie?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my bowtie?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"here, let me see your backpack.\" She says crossing the room.  Pulling out a back pack covered in colorful writing/graffiti, she pulls out a clip-on bowtie.  Before returning and affixing it to your shirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, all set, a perfect gentleman!\" she says with a tone of satisfied triumph.  \"Now! Let's go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusanne makes a move towards the door, heels clicking on the floor, grabbing her purse, phone, and opening the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you both walk down the stairs the thought dawns on you that you no longer can drive, so Susanne will be your adult supervision for the evening.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you check to make sure your bike is locked Harvey?\" Susanne asks, unlocking her car in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around, you see a BMX bike, complete with baseball cards in the spokes, with the name \"BOLT\" etched on the down-tube. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yep, I'm good.\" you say.  Distraught, you wonder how else this night could go worse.  </span></div></div>",

Heck you are their assistant team captain even. Now grab your stuff from the back and go get changed! I'll be back after the game to pick you up again!\" retorts the girl, her answer confusing you even more. \"Well, what are you waiting for Harvey? Let's go!\" With that she grabbed a duffel bag from the back seat and tossed it at you. Taking the duffel bag you confusedly get out of the car and watch as the girl drives off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stand there, thoroughly confused, you see an energetic teenaged girl run over to you from the other end of the parking lot. She is carrying a duffel bag that matches the one you were now holding. She comes right up to you just beaming and bubbling with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Girlfriend!\" she says, dropping her duffel bag and reaching out to hug you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure what to do, you return her hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Harv, you pumped about today?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" you ask her, hoping for a better answer than the ones the girl in the car had given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean girl? Its the big game! The whole school will be there to see us do our routine!\" she bubbles back, \"Come on! lets go get changed!\" With that she grabs your hand and picks up her duffel bag.

The girl was dressed in a plain white blouse and a pair of jeans. She was being very quiet and not moving much and maintained her sight fixated on a crack in the pavement directly in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour watching of the quiet little girl was interrupted when a 21 year old woman walked between you and the girl. This woman was wearing a white T-shirt styled as though it had newsprint on it. Below that she sported a nice leather belt that was holding up (barely as you could just make out the strap of a thong over her ass) a pair of tight designer jeans followed by a pair of pointed, heeled knee high boots. The girl's straight, streaked brown and blond hair ran down to her shoulders and she sported a few bracelets and a fancy watch on her wrist. Over one shoulder you saw a small black purse while the other hand held an iphone that she was furiously texting on. As the woman took a seat farther down the platform you turned your attention to other passengers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at the drop-off and pick-up zone you see a tired looking airplane stewardess waiting to be picked up. she had shoulder length dirty blonde hair and was still wearing her stewardess uniform. As a seat she was using her small flight bag. As she waited impatiently you could tell that she was fighting to stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next person you took the time to look at was a 30-something woman who had just arrived and was crying heavily. She was wearing a nice looking business suit and was holding a ring in her hands. The ring seemed to be the focus of her anguish as she turned it over and over, weeping loudly. Her sell phone then rang and she answered it with a loud and anguished \"I can't believe he cheated on me!\" She then continued to tell her woes, rather loudly, to whoever it was that had called. From what you overheard before the call ended, she had just caught her husband cheating on her with an older woman in the back seat of her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next person to attract your attention was a teenager having an argument with a bus driver. Based on the sound of things, the teenager was trying to get the driver to let her on without paying. The teenager was dressed in a bright pink spaghetti strap tank top and was wearing a pair of old and tattered looking jeans though by the shiny watch she was wearing and the designer bag she was carrying you doubted that she was at all strapped for cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while you looked back at one of the above mentioned people and swapped something with one of them.</span></div></div>",

As the two of you climb the stairs on your way to your first class Tim engages you with small talk. While the topics of conversation were far less detailed and game focussed than usual you felt that for the most part your friendship with Tim was unchanged. As you arrive at the class and take a seat in the back row, having not had time to grab your books from the locker you rented from the student's union.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the professor is off explaining something or other about Integrals. Though you usually tried to pay close attention in class you were far too curious to figure out more about the strangely different and yet similar life you now seemed to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Harriet!\" whispered Tim from beside you, \"I think today I'm gonna go ask out Candy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes, glad that Tim's crush on Candy Bean, one of your classmates, was still unchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

There is no way a girl that pretty would ever want to spend time with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look over at Candy and silently agree with Tim that she is quite beautiful. You then wonder what you look like and how well your new body compares to Tim's object of desire. Deciding to find out you look around for a mirror. Not finding one elsewhere in the class you remember that you now have a purse. Popping it open you find inside an iphone, stylish wallet, mascara stick, a small tube shaped package that you guess (cringing as you do) is a tampon and a little makeup compact. Turning away from Tim you pop open the compact and take a gander at your new face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you realize, as you look at your new reflection, is how much you still look like you had before. Your skin was smoother and your nose and jawline a bit smoother but it was definitely still your face.

He is a bit of a science nerd and enjoys learning new things and trying out new experiences. He has a girlfriend, Susanne Lockridge [21], who attends the same University and who works part time as a junior columnist for the City's newspaper. Harvey also has a pair of twin sisters, 18, who do everything together and are both on their high school's swim team. Harvey's Mother (Adrianna) left his Father (Thomas) just six months earlier only to elope with Harvey's Best friend's (Tim Yu [22]) Father (Paul). Since then Tim and his three younger sisters (Kaisha [11], Ani [17] &amp; Lily [20]) have been living with Harvey's family while Tim's mother (Kai) is in prison for assaulting her now ex-husband days before Adrianna Bolt and Paul Yu eloped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day Harvey is working at his job when he is struck by a blast from an experimental laser. This blast imbues Harvey with the power to, once a week, swap gender (name too), age, work &amp; school, relationships (family &amp; friends, etc.), or hobbies (any permutation thereof) with someone else by shooting them with a beam of light. Only Harvey is aware of the change. For everyone else, reality adjusts to make them think everything is normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasic Rules:<br>\r\n1. No personality changes for Harvey.<br>\r\n2. When Harvey swaps gender with a woman, he turns into a female version of himself.<br>\r\n3. Only 1 swap event per week (7 days).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE:<br>\r\nI reserve the right to delete or modify chapters that do not follow these above three rules. This does not mean I will but it does mean I might.</td>",
