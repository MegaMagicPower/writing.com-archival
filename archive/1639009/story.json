As she changed, she remembered the perfume bottle a customer had given her earlier. It had no name or sticker on it, but the person, an old man, told her that one just one spray would change her greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right\", Maya scuffed at the perfume bottle as she left it on her bureau. She then went downstairs to watch some T.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in a house with three siblings, word gets out fast about stuff you see lying around. It just so happened that Maya's sisters overheard their eldest sister talking about the perfume. They were curious about the description Maya mentioned and blew off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps one of them would spray the perfume onto themselves, or would Maya herself take back what she said earlier and do so instead?</span></div></div>",

In one instant, she had gone from the tiny, mousy little girl she always looked to being a curvy, slim, sexy young woman.  Furthermore, she actually finally felt like the older sister to Saya for once.  Ever since Aya had outgrown her, and then developed her more woman assets, Maya couldn't help but feel a little jealous.  Now that Maya was now Aya's height, and had even more pronounced but very proportional hips, breasts, and ass, all that vanished.  What made the situation even more joyous for Maya was that Aya was instantly excited for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can borrow some of my clothes until you get new ones,\" Aya said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya stopped on the stairs to look down at her body again, almost causing Saya to stumble over her.  Aya was right.  Maya's new height caused her shirt to reveal her trim stomach.  She had never shown her midriff before, never even thought about it, but situated between her new breasts and hips she decided she might want to start now.  He work skirt, cute and somewhat loose before, was now quite tight and showed off her new figure.  It probably showed off more leg than she was comfortable with, but then she had never really had the kind of long legs you show off before.  She would have a lot to learn about what to do with this new body, and the first thing would be how to dress herself now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Maya said, meaning it.  \"I guess we ought to go shopping later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, new boob girl,\"  Saya's squeaky voice ran from downstairs, \"I'm hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two older sisters giggled as they got the pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all made a big deal about how the pizza guy was obviously checking Maya out, which he was.  He gave Aya a glance, of course, but it was Maya's newly voluptuous body which clearly had his attention.  Maya blushed.  Having only changed so recently she still couldn't see herself in her new figure.  It would take some getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a filling meal, where all three sisters stuffed themselves with abandon, Maya wanted to explore the perfume again.  She wasn't considering trying it again.  There was such a thing as too much of a good thing, she knew, and the longer she sat with her new curves, her new taller body, the more she thought that she was exactly as she always wished she was and wouldn't change a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate most of the pizza, are you gonna' get fat now, too?\" Saya asked Maya, in that mix of youthful naivety and childish meanness common in her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya giggled, \"You wish.\"  Aya giggled at that, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her sisters cleaning up, Maya went upstairs to take another look at the perfume.  She entered the room, and immediately detected the subtle aroma filling the room.  The bottle was on the floor, still mostly full, but it was obviously that <i>somebody</i> had tried using it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Saya,\" Maya shook her head, sneezing just as she realized that she must have just now been hit with another dose.</span></div></div>",

Maya got up and turned to Aya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG, Aya! What happened to you?!? Why do you look pregnant?\" Maya yelled and gasp in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you get implants? Where the heck did this baby come from?\" Aya asked gesturing Maya's body and her own belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not implants.\" Maya said defensively.\" It's a perfume I got from a anonymous customer. I accidentally tossed it somewhere in my room\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait? A magical perfume? Well makes sense with all that's happening!\" Aya said, she crossed her arms beneath her now DD bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm sorry. Anyways I'm starting to think you're pregnant with Saya...\" Maya said nervously, pointing at Aya's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...Saya is in here? How'd the perfume do that? Did she spray herself?\" Aya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm.. no I accidentally sprayed her. Then she started to regress in age then disappeared. I didn't know where she'd gone so I decided to find the perfume and spray the spot she was last seen.\" Said Maya with guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya sighed, \" Well neither of us were expecting the results. I'm just surprised that a magical perfume existed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can't do anything till we find it so help me out!\" Maya pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem, I kinda doubt I'll be much help since with this belly in all. But I'll try. Hopefully perfumes will wear off and everything will return to normal!\" Aya said reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I hope so.\" Maya answered. But deep down Maya was hoping she could keep her changes but the important thing was getting Saya back.</span></div></div>",

Who the heck makes a perfume like that? It should be a repellent.\" Aya joked. Maya and Aya giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it is magical. So I guess whoever made it meant for it to be strong and lucky us the bottle as well.\" Maya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya felt a very strong kick just above her belly button. \"Looks like Saya is getting a kick out of the joke.\" Aya giggled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were searching for the perfume that was thrown somewhere in the room. To make matters worse, due to Maya's clumsiness, she couldn't remember which direction she threw it when she saw Saya changing. So the two sisters split the room in half to search with Aya on left and Maya on the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya was crawling on all fours near the vanity table while Maya was searching around her bed. Aya turned to see Maya's big butt and giggled at the site. Aya's hand came across something but she needed to lie as flat as she could. Turning and laying down on her left side as she stretched to reach whatever object it was that was within her reach. Saya moving within her wasn't making things easier being she looked to be at least 10 months pregnant with a large baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Come on! I hope this is it.\"</i> Aya thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she got a hold of it and brought it towards herself. A bit tired as she looked at what looked like the perfume they were looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt look like an old style perfume, with it's length to be estimated 4 inches. It seemed hardly used and the contents clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Is this it?</i>\" thought Aya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe examined the bottle as Maya was still searching the other side of the room. Aya could see words etched vertically in the front of the perfume, <b>Perfume of Change</b>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Looks like this is it...</i>\" Aya thought as she slowly pushed herself up and sat on her butt while watching Maya continue her search.</span></div></div>",

He has black hair that looks like bed-head (but was naturally like that), green eyes, and wore blue shirt with a brown jack whose sleeves were rolled up to his elbows. He has a silver watch on his right wrist, a blue bag that hang on his left shoulder, black shorts that reached a bit over his knee, and blue-black Converse shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to take my vacation. I've been working at the place for years,\" Nick thought with a smile as he thought of relaxing at his home.

He figure she must have dropped it when she took it to the cleaners or something. The black haired man picks up the clothes and notice that underwear was still there. Nick blushed as he felt like some dirty old man as he held it. He put the clothes in the bag he was carrying, hearing a small voice soon after in the alleyway. Nick thinks he's imagining things, but still went to investigate. When he slowly went into the alley, he saw a strange sight; a five inch tall nude Maya standing there talking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would take too long to walk home on foot and there-\" Maya talks as Nick stood there with his mouth open, pausing before he said anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya........!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick gasps as Maya stops in her tracks and looks back to see him. Nick blushes at seeing Maya in all of naked glory; Maya blushes at Nick seeing her nude and covers herself with her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you!? Stay away from me!\" Maya shouted, hoping for somebody to come to save her ,despite her voice being unheard-able to anyone else around. Nick stood there with a shocked expression on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know me......?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm your neighbor!

Maya blussh at Nick touching her breasts and butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do that again, please\", Maya said with a blush on her face. Nick also blushes, but turns away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Don't worry - I picked up your clothes that were laying in the street.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya blushes soon more at the idea of Nick seeing her underwear, but still blushed worst when he saw her naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep you head down, okay?

Maya and Nick were both shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;Now I have to deal with a shrunken women and two shrunken girls. Where did my normal life go?&gt;&gt; Nick thought to himself as Maya talks to her upset sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you told me the truth. When did you take a sniff?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We took a sniff after you went to bed,\" Aya replied, as Saya began to wonder life as a size a doll would work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would mean you're going to shrink soon!\" Maya replied, figuring that at the rate she herself, they would be small in a couple of hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's a good thing I got more doll clothes,\" Nick notes as he picks up a bag with more doll clothes in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on!\" Aya spoke up. \"Who said we would let you help us?! I don't trust you! And-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aya began to tell Nick off, the world starts to look different to the middle sister. Saya saw that the world was changing for her as well. They both blacked out as they started to shrink out of their clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take these, Maya,\" Nick said as he closes eyes and put the bag with clothes on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Maya replied as he took out the clothes and began to dress her shrinking sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ ____________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya and Saya start to wake up. They saw that the world was huge. The five inch tall sister they saw was now seemed really close to their normal height. And huge Nick there sat on the floor Indian style. They also see that they were wearing new clothes. Aya's glasses luckily shrink with her, so she could still see she was now wearing a black shirt with blue jeans. Saya had a white shirt with a sleeve strip that was red and yellow, a white skirt, and black shorts underneath said shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it. I can't believe we shrunk,\" Aya said as Saya looked around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick saw that Saya looked a bit sad. He still had the red ribbon and cat doll as he took their over size clothes and put them in their room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Maya, could you cool down your sister?\" Nick asks as he thought stream was coming out of the middle sister's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya went to Aya as Saya went over to Nick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya couldn't believe at how big the young man was now. She was still shy but saw that he had the gifts that her sisters gave her in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um...could you please give me those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nodded as he put the cat doll near Saya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here. I'll help you put this on,\" Nick offered as he untied Says' red ribbon. She was still nervous, but slowly went near the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you put yours arms up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya did as she was told as Nick ties the ribbon around her waist. He asked if he tied it too hard, but she shook her head. Saya has a bright smile on her face as she got on top of her cat doll and hugged it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you,\" Saya said with a bit of blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem at all. Besides you looked a bit sad without it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick felt kind of weird at saying that, but he felt that Saya really liked the ribbon as much as the cat doll. Saya gave a friend small smile at Nick. Nick smlied back at the tiniest girl.  Meanwhile at the other end. Maya and Aya were fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aya, please calm down!\" Maya asks the taller girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't! We're only inches tall! How can we survive this way?! Mom and Dad will not be back for months! And what if we get robbed or something!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya sighs as her sister listed out the negatives of being small. After Aya was done, the oldest sister saw Nick and Saya talking and him even helping put on her ribbon around her waist, seeing her smile. Maya was shocked - she rarely saw her sister smile outside of her own family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..Aya..I don't have the answers, but I can solve at least some problems.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya was shocked that her sister said that as the oldest shrunken girl went near Nick. Nick saw Maya coming and wonders what she wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, I know we haven't known each other for long, but could you please stay here and help us?\" a blushing Maya requested. Nick was shocked at her request, as if she was asking her to move in with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! We can't trust him!\" Aya yelled with her arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looks at the shrunk sisters and then decides..</span></div></div>",

Aya, however, grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a good thing it's summer or we would be in trouble,\" Nick says as look at the time. It was around 5:00 pm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time for dinner,\" Maya says as she wanted to make something for her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Maya. Could you help me with dinner?\" Nick asks as Maya agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two stay here,\" Maya requested her sisters to do, who did as they were told. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick picks Maya up and places her on his shoulder. The two went into the kitchen. He had to admit that it was a nice kitchen. Maya made a gesture to the boy that he wanted on the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I think I want to make some spaghetti and meat balls,\" Maya says as Nick nods alongside her. He looks around the kitchen's cabinets for what they need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing you had some angel hair and regular noodles,\" he smiled as he placed the packages beside Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Maya cheered. \"I'll make the meatballs while you take care of the noodles and tomato sauce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick kind of chuckled at the thought of the shrunken Maya making meatballs. Maya saw this and gave him an angry pout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick got all the ingredients out. as well as gave Maya the meat so she could make the balls. While she makes them, he starts to boil the water and make the sauce. It would only take a little bit of time for those ingredients to warm up, so he looks at what Maya was doing and saw that she was making a mess. The oldest sister was now covered in meat as she made some meatballs for Nick and small ones for her sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my. The oldest looks like a little kid,\" Nick says to Maya as he smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny. Stop making fun of this situation,\" she pouted in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. You're just easy to talk to. I mean you remind me of this one girl..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick almost starts, but stops with an sad expression on his face. Maya noticed this and was worried about him. She walked a little closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I'll cook those meatballs now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya watches as he tales her small and giant meatballs and put them in a pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, could you get me some clothes?\" Maya asks as she was dirty from making the meatballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick picks Maya up and put her near the sink. The sink was safe as the shrunken Maya wouldn't fall down the sink, especially with the plug put in the bottom center. Nick ran off to get Maya new clothes as Maya herself got the sun dress of and ran some of the water. Luckily her bathing suit was still clean so she took a clean off in the sink. Maya had to admit it was fun to use the sink as a bathtub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"La la la\", Maya began to sign with out realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sang, Nick came back with the clothes and saw that Maya was singing and now taking a bath with her bathing suit under her clothes. Nick blushed at seeing the sight - Maya was a cute girl, and her voice was very nice. Nick didn't want it to stop; he wanted to watch the shrunken older sister to sing some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really is just her...\", Nick thought...but then he remembered he was cooking. \"Crap! The food almost burnt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya heard Nick and turned around, seeing him taking the food off the stove and put it on the table. She looked at Nick with a question look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, how long were you there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya blushed at the thought of the giant seeing her in the bath (even with a bathing suit on) and singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're very cute, and you have a nice voice,\" he admitted. He knew he was trapped, so he might as well be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya blushs at the comments. It's been a while since anyone really said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, just give me my clothes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nods as he gave her a new black sweater, blue shorts, and a new swim bra and panties. He put the food on the table after completing it as Maya got dressed. After that, he placed her on his shoulder again and took the food to the living room, where Saya and Aya waited on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner's ready,\" Maya said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya and Aya smiled as they saw food they could eat. Then even had some small little forks. The shrunken sisters started to eat as Nick himself also ate his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Maya, do you remember what that old man looked like?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\", she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're looking for him?\" Aya asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nodded but stop when he heard \"we\". The young man looked at the shrunken middle sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said you were going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be separated from my sisters. Plus, I still don't trust you. Make sure you have one eye open tonight,\" Aya threatened him. She then took off her clothes and stared darkly into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aya!!\" Maya scolded her as she slapped her with a noodle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her tiny size, Aya's glare at Nick gave him the creeps a bit. It looked like she was serious..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the meal,\" Saya says as she finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" Maya and Nick said together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith dinner done, now the trio had to wonder about where they would sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we're so small, let's sleep together,\" Maya suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but I don't want to sleep near him,\" Aya notes, eyebrows lowered as she points to Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll sleep far away from you\", he sighed, Aya nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, it was now bed time for the three girls.</span></div></div>",

Nick also gave the shrunken sisters a blanket as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll be in the kitchen,\" Nick said to the shrunken sister trio as he left the room with their dishes as well. When Nick was out of the room, the sisters staredt to talk with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's nice,\" Saya says with a smile as the youngest sister put her head on the cat doll. Aya, however, was still angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya, could I talk to you for a moment?\" the middle sister asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya saw that Aya had somewhat a blush on her face. Maya wonders what her sister was so embarrassed about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya and Aya slowly got off the chair. The shrunken sisters made it far enough so that Saya couldn't hear them. The little sister was already dozing off, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what was it that you wanted to talk about, Aya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya did you shrink out of your clothes?\" Aya asked point-blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Maya lied, hoping it would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lair! Saya and I shrunk out of our clothes! So the only logical pattern is that you shrunk out of your clothes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya stood there wondering what should could say. Aya was very smart, so she would figure out what really happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Maya began until Aya cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm also guessing that Nick found when you were shrunken and naked as well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya blushes as the oldest sister remembered that incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it. I think I'll have a talk with him,\" Aya said as the small middle sister ran for the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AYA!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya saw that Saya was coming down the chair near her, looking a bit tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with Aya, biggest sister?\" Saya asks her older sister as she walks over next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's being over-protective again. I wish she would just let me handle things.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya watched Maya cry a bit from her outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go get Aya before she makes trouble,\" Maya told the youngest sister, who nodded and followed her sister as they chased her to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ _______ <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya was surprised at how far she had to run; the way to the kitchen was much further away than she expected at her size. (Aya really didn't like being small.) The shrunken middle sister saw that Nick was sitting at the kitchen table. He had a sketchbook and and pencils beside him. He was wearing a white shirt with a skull on it with a straw hat on the top of the head, as well as a pair of black pants. From what Aya could see that when she was original size, he would be about 5'9\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was he doing?\" Aya thought as she went near Nick and pulled his pants leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAHHHH!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick jumped up in shock at the feeling of something on his pants leg. He then looked down and saw that it was just Aya, and he sighed a bit in relief. Though he wasn't too pleased to see her. Nick watched as the usually angry sister laughed at Nick's earlier screaming like a little girl. It made him feel a bit embarrassed..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, you little brat?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya stopped laughing as soon as she heard him call her a \"little brat\". Before she could yell, Maya and Saya made it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aya, did you say anything?\" Maya asks with a worried look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I was just going to ask him what he was doing before he called me a little brat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya only sighed as as she knew somehow Aya must have made Nick mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you two need to say sorry to each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and the two other shrunken sister looked at the tiniest sister. Maya smiled at her lovable little sister and how well she knew that fighting would not get you anywhere. So Maya hugged her sister as Nick and Aya both said at the same time,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya smiled at their apology, even if they only did it to make Saya happy. Maya then looked up at Nick and saw that was drawing, walking a bit closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Nick, what are you drawing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just show you,\" he shrugged as he picked up the sister and put them on the table. The sisters saw the giant sketch book and saw a huge drawing; a replica of their kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're pretty good,\" Maya says as Nick felt a little happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\" Nick asks while scratching his head and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya then flips the page and saw more drawings. It was nothing but doodles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. You found my one of my doodle ideas\", Nick notes. Aya turns around and wonders what Nick was talking about. Saya saw a doodle of a cat and smiled as she stood on the giant sketch book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really like cats, Saya,\" Maya says as she looked at the picture. Saya nodded as Nick saw Saya looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have some materials. So I'll make a doll of that for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya lit up at Nick's selfless request, nearly hugging his hand. Aya was still skeptical, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know how to make a doll?\" she wonders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be amazed at how much a costume doll goes for at an convention. But it does pay for the bills for the trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want to be an artist?\" Maya adds to the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very much so. I practiced a lot to get this good. But I'm still a beginner and there's still much for me to learn.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-C-Could you draw us?\" Saya asks, blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll draw you. But first I need to get something for you three to pose on..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick went out of the room really quick to get something. The shrunken sisters all sat down, perplexed by what Nick was up to. He soon came back with Saya's cat doll and placed it on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll use that as a base for you three to sit on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters got off the giant sketch book and were now near Saya's giant cat doll. Nick turned to a new page and was ready to draw. He waited for the three shrunken sisters to pose before proceeding. Maya picks a simple pose as she stood in the middle. Saya was on the right and Aya was on the left. Maya put on a normal smile as Aya did her best at a sexy pose/ As Saya was still shy, she only blushing. Nick nods as he began to draw the shrunken sisters while they sat on top of the cat doll. It took about an hour before Nick was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three did a good at sitting still\", he admits to them. \"I'm impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters sighed as they wonder how the drawing went. Nick shows them the drawing; it was really good. He really got the sisters' good side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to admit, you drew us pretty good,\" Aya says with a smile. Maya was happy that Aya was lightening up on Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you color it?\" Saya asks as Nick nods and closes the sketch book. There was a little piece of paper taped on the cover of the sketch book. It a simple drawing of a girl that was waving and saying \"Love Ya\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this from you girlfriend or something?\" Aya asks as Maya had a angry look on her face. Nick had complemented Maya, so she was a bit jealous at the prospect of him cheating on her with another girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that...but we never really became an item,\" Nick sighs with as he crosses his arms. Aya looked at Nick, wondering what he was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Saya ask the giant. Nick looks at the youngest shrunken sister and stops to think about his word carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was an accident when I was sixteen. She passed away, while I got a scar on my right shoulder.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick then showed a bit of the scar on his shoulder to the girls. It reached down near his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before the accident, she put the doodle you see taped on my sketchbook in part of the jacket I use to wear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that,\" May says with a saddened face. Aya and Saya also looked sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but let's not get too sad. We need to find a cure for you three,\" Nick smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\", all three sisters replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for you three to go to bed. We're going to have a big day tomorrow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya and Aya look at Nick with a bit of annoyance, wondering if he just made a pun. Nick stood there looking at them and starts to sweat at them not talking to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, could you help us go to the chair?\" Aya asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick did as requested and picked up the three shrunken sisters (plus the cat doll) and put Aya and Saya down on the chair as Maya went to say something to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things will get better. Don't worry, we'll help you,\" May says as she kissed Nick on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Thanks\", Nick replies, blushing a bit from the kiss. \"I'll be on the couch if you three need me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick then turned off the lights as he headed for the living room couch. As Saya made her way to her giant cat doll, Aya whispered something to her older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, you're bold at kissing a guy you just met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya blushed from the comment and looked at her sister with one of her cold stairs. Aya turned around and went to sleep. Saya went to sleep the instant she landed on her giant cat doll. Maya sighed as she was long overdue for sleep. Today was a surprising, long day for her, and tomorrow would probably long for her as well. She closed her eyes and wondered what tomorrow would bring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

He then turned his head and saw that in the next room the three tiny sisters were sleeping near each other. He smiles at the sight of how close they were to each other. As an only child he never understood the whole sibling thing, but he knew when siblings were close when he saw them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;I better take a shower before they wake up&gt;&gt; Nick thought as he got some of the clothes he brought over when Aya and Saya were knocked out and made his way to the first floor bathroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya was waking up now and saw that world was still huge and that she and her sisters were still shrunk. Maya sighed as she didn't want to wake her sisters, so she carefully moved as to not wake them. Maya safely got off the chair and was still amazed by how small she was compared to the world. Maya walked around the giant living room and saw the bag that had the doll clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;I might as well try to take a shower&gt;&gt; Maya thought as she picked a white shirt, black sorts, a blue bra, panties, and a swim suit. Maya began to walk her long climb to the first floor bathroom when she heard running water. Maya figured that it was Nick taking a shower, so she thought of just waiting at the door for him to finish. However, when Maya finally got to the first floor bathroom, she saw the door was still open. Just then, Nick came out of the shower, and Maya's face was as red as a tomato. Maya saw Nick in all of his naked glory! And although she tried to cover her eyes as best she could, she admitted in her head that he looked quite handsome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, nothing like a hot shower in the morning..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick turns his head and sees that the door was still open. Not only that, but Maya was standing there, her face wide open and red as a beet. Nick's face soon become as red as hers as he closed the bathroom door. When Maya saw him open it again, he was now wearing a blue shirt with a milk carton that said \"Drink strawberry milk\" on it, as well as black shorts. again Nick was wearing a Blue shirt with a milk carton that said drink strawberry milk and black shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Nick apologizes, still with a red face. Maya slowly nods with her face still red as well, but then comes with a smile and giggles. Nick was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're even now,\" Maya says, still smiling with a blush on her face. Nick knew that she was talking about him seeing her naked. Nick chuckles about it was well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Do you need help getting to the sink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, Nick. Thanks for asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick helps Maya get to the sink and left her to take her bath in peace. However, he stays close by the door to help her out when she finishes. When Maya finishes, Nick put her on his shoulder and helped her out of the bathroom. Soon after, though, they were greeted by the younger sisters, who also had clothes on them for a bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to be taking a bath with Saya. So could you help get there, Bedhead?\" Aya asks the sighing Nick, whose wet hair already dried and became the bed head hair he unfortunately was born with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Nick helps Aya and Saya in the sink, he and Maya get ready to make breakfast. The duo made blueberry pancakes, as well as scrambled eggs with orange juice (strawberry milk for Nick). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're done!\" Aya yells as loud as she could, Saya parroting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick hears them quite clearly as he places Maya on the table. He then quickly heads up the stairs and helps the sisters out of the sink. Aya was now wearing a black sweater with a pair of short jeans, while Saya wore a white dress (her ribbon still tied to her waist) and black shorts underneath said dress. The four enjoy their meal, and when it was done Nick put the dishes in the sink and put on his socks and shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we go, do any of us have to use the restroom?\" Nick asks as the shrunken sisters shook their heads. He then put on his jacket and put the girls in his pocket. Maya popped her head out, despising the idea of being a keychain for him..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and the shrunken sisters searched the town to find any clues any where the old man could be. The group kept on talking to people as Nick used the description that Maya gave him. But nothing was turning up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter four hours of searching, Nick was now sitting on a bench, wondering how hard could it be to find a old man. The sisters were getting cramps from being in Nick's pocket for so long. They started at 8 a.m. and it was now noon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, can we take a break?\" Maya asks with a sweet smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Let's just ask one more person first,\" he smiles back as he points to an old woman. He soon walked up to her to ask her as well about the perfume.</span></div></div>",

Thanks for answering,\" Nick replies, looking distraught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman left as Nick and the three shrunken sisters wonder what they could do. They continue to search the entire town for some sort of clue, but nothing come up. Maya felt sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya?\" Aya asks as the middle sister felt her older sister's sadness from her body language. Saya was worried about her eldest sister as well, as she thought that Maya blamed herself for what happened to her sisters and herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine!\" Maya beams with a smile. Nick looked down and saw that something was wrong with Maya but didn't want to talk to her in front of her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go home. Let's play a game,\" Maya adds. She thought that maybe having fun with her sisters and Nick could lighten up the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" the other three replied back with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya smiles and hopes that a game would work to cure her depression. Nick walked over to their house and gently put them out of his pockets and onto the ground. He then opened the door for them, closing it as soon as they all got inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who's going to be it?\" Aya asks as Saya smiles at the thought was playing with her sisters and Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be Nick\", Maya decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I get the hard job\", he sighed. \"...since you guys are that small. ARGH this is going to be tough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken sisters laughed as they got ready to hide. Nick closed his eyes and counted to one hundred. And that's how a day of games started.The group kept on playing games all day. (Nick lost every time when the shrunken sisters were to hide.) They even played bored games, The shrunken sisters loved it when they were playing Pictionary; Nick drew so good they could always tell what they were. Maya and Saya laugh as Aya had competition with Nick in some of the more intelligence-based board game. Sadly Nick lost near the end when the questions became impossible to answer for people who were not super smart like Aya. Nick had better luck when he was playing Battleship against the sisters. Saya beat everybody in SORRY. Maya won most of the card games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now it was getting late, and Nick &amp; Maya made dinner for everybody. The dinner was just a simple sandwich, as they were low on food. (As such, food was slim pickings.) Aya and Saya were surprised at how tired they were after dinner. Nick picked ip the shrunken younger sisters and put them on the chair to sleep. Nick then looks for Maya so she could put her aside her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick finally found Maya in her room on the second floor. Not just in her room, but on her bed. She had her knees up to her face and arms on her legs. Nick swore that he could see tears coming down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya?\" Nick asks. \"Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Nick. I'll be down in a second,\" the jumpy Maya replied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya..I'm not going anywhere.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick then slowly sat down next to the shrunken Maya. She looked up the giant, resisting the urge to cry in front of him. But Maya couldn't hide the tears anymore. Soon enough she was crying on his knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm nothing but a stupid big sister! I couldn't even help my sisters to grow back to normal! W-what if Aya is stuck at the size for life and can't go on with her life?! Saya will never to be able to make friends at her size, too! They don't deserve this! I do, thought. I'm not as smart or cute as Aya, and I always make things worst for this family. It would be better I just shrink until I faded away!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick couldn't believe what he just heardl Maya was blaming herself for the shrinking that it making the worst coming out of her. Nick thought that Maya was shrinking more now - she certainly looked smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya, it's not your fault,\"  Nick tries to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is my fault! If I hadn't brought it-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick put a finger on Maya's lip as he explained,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya, you're one of the kindest people I know. Without you, your sisters would never be as close as they are. You're the glue that holds together; they would never blame you. They love you too much. Maya, you're smart and you can get people to like you for you trying to do the best for them. Everyone makes mistakes, heck I made a lot them and still do. And by the way Maya, you're beautiful. And any guy that doesn't see that is an idiot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya looks at Nick and saw that he was serious, even blushing a bit. Mary smiles at Nick's kind words and made his red face even redder with her next action - she hugged his stomach. Nick smiled back as he put both of his hands across Maya's body. The two felt each other's warmth.</span></div></div>",

Nick looked down at her and saw that she was growing in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya, you're growing!\" Nick exclaims as Maya opens her eyes and saw that she was getting larger. Maya felt happy until she heard ripping - her doll clothes were ripping apart! Before Maya could say anything to Nick about closing his eyes, her clothes were done. Nick's face was bright red once more as he saw Maya in her naked glory. This time he had a better view of her, and he would still say that Maya was beautiful. Maya blushed more and felt her heart was beating faster. To Maya it felt strange for her heart to beat this way. The two were still hugging each other as Nick felt her nude body press against his. The two stood there until they both let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, there's still some of my old children's clothes in Saya's room. Could you get them for me?\" Maya asks with her face still red. Nick nodded and went to get Maya new clothes. Nick come back with a light blue shirt, grey skirt, and black shorts. Maya put them on as Nick turns away to give her private time to put on her clothes. Maya was full clothed when Nick turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought some more measuring tape,\" Nick said with a blush still on his face as he still felt Maya's warmth. Maya nods as she wonders what her height was. Nick measured the taller Maya and told her her new height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your 2'6\". So half of your original height,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya was so surprised at how big she was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think made me grow?\" Maya asks Nick. Nick was wondering about that as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I still had that power I could tell you. But I'm as stump as you are.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Power? What do you mean, Nick?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked at Maya and he found it best to just tell her the whole story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When my friend Trucy and I had the accident with a helicopter falling on us, I gained a strange power. I got more o anf explanation when Trucy came back as a shrunken angel. I gained the power to look for people and fix their problems. If I didn't help with their problems, my flesh would rot. That's one of the reasons I made many friends in high school. But I lost the power when I solved one last problem.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was the one who had the problem?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did. I didn't accept Trucy's death. I just kept thinking that we could always to be together. But I learned to move froward and knew that I had friends that would help no matter what.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick finished and didn't hear Maya talk for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I understand if you don't believe me..,\" Nick added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're talking to a girl who has been shrunk. I think I can believe you having that kind of power,\" Maya replied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time for bed. We're going to have a long day at tiring to figure out how you grew,\" Nick said as he tried to get up. But Maya stopps him with a hug. Nick blushes at the half-sized girl hugging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, would you stay with us? Even if my sisters and me were still small?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. We're friends, and friends don't leave each other.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya smiled as she liked the thought of Nick just staying with them. The two then went back downstairs. Nick said goodnight to Maya as he soon fell asleep on the couch. Maya was about to sleep along with her sisters but went over to Nick and crawled under the covers with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;I'll wake earlier than anyone and go where my sisters are&gt;&gt; Maya thought as liked Nick's warmth.</span></div></div>",

She smiles as she crawls out of Nick covers, and walked slowly over to where her sisters were. When she got to her smaller sisters, she felt weird being taller than Aya. It's been many years since Maya was taller then Aya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how my sisters are going to react when they see that I grew?\" Maya whispers as she heard a yawning Nick in the back. Maya turns to look at the young man with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Maya,\" Nick says to her with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Nick,\" Maya happily replied back, blushing a bit. Nick smiled at this sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll go to my house and get some food. Why don't you take a bath?\" he asks as he puts on his shoes and a brown jacket. Maya nods as she hugs Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Be back soon, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiles and hugs her back. The two of them let go after a long hug as Nick went to his house to pick up food. Maya smies as she turns around and sees her sisters waking up. As expected, they were surprised that she grew over two feet since they last saw her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya, how did you get that big?!\" Aya gasps, Saya hugging her oldest sisters' leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but with this I know we can return back to normal,\" she replies with a smile as she hugged both of her sisters. They proceeded to hug her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three sisters proceeded to take a bath. With Nick gone, Maya chose their new set of clothes for the day after she placed Aya and Saya in the sink for their bath. Aya pondered in the bath to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;How did Maya return to normal? It can't be a time thing, or else Saya and I would be growing now. Maybe she ate something, or perhaps she's secretly a magician? Nah, that's silly. I think I need to ask her point-blank about this. I bet it has something to do with Mr. Bed Head.&gt;&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the bath, the shrunken sisters got their clothes on. Maya had on a white shirt and gray shorts, Aya a black dress with white underwear, and Saya a blue shirt, white shorts, and her red ribbon tied around her waist. When they were all out, they entered the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Nick get's back, he'll help me make us all breakfast. What do you guys want?\" Maya cheerfully asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mayam what did you do last night after Saya and I went to sleep?\" Aya interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything. I just talked to Nick last night. Then I grew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you two talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya blushed a bit at her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was down in the dumps and he helped me out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya was shocked to hear what Maya had said. Sure the oldest sister had kissed Nick on the cheek, but Maya's face was fulling blushing. Maya had fallen for Nick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya, have you fallen for Nick?!\" Aya yelled in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have, yes..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya stood there a minute. Maya had other crushes and dated them, before but this felt strange. She just thought Maya was being nice when she kissed him on the cheek. It's what little girls did to show they had crushes on boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just met the guy two days ago! How can you say that you love him?! You're just rushing in this! You need to take time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aya, I think I can handle this myself! Just because you think all the boys at your school are perverts doesn't mean that every guy is! Who I date is none of your business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya watched her two older sisters bickering; not an uncommon thing for her to endure at home. The baby of the family ran away on impulse at this point whenever the two started shouting at each other. She decided to escape outside, crawling underneath the door on all fours to get out. In the process, though, she left her ribbon undone in the kitchen, as it came off her waist as he crawled under the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ _____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time Maya and Aya stopped fighting and simply looked at each other. After a final stare contest, they both stopped. Their eyes softened up as they looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Maya, but you always get hurt when jerks dump you,\" Aya explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, Aya. Thank you for looking out for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya picks up the tiny Aya and hugs her. Aya hugs back, feeling comfortable around her older sister. After they were done making up, they looked down and noticed that Saya was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did Saya go?\" Maya asks, looking worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think she went outside? Like she typically does when we fight?\"  Aya replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But at her size, she'll...! SAYA!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Maya horrified ran for the back yard door. Aya followed her far behind as fast she could at her tiny stature. When she made it to the door, Maya saw Saya's ribbon right next to the door on the floor. She then showed it to Aya when she caught up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to go out there and find her!\" Maya proclaims as she opens the door. It didn't help that their backyard was huge even at their regular sizes.</span></div></div>",

As he worried whether or not he got food they like, he had a small dog barking, walking behind the house to see it chasing something in the backyard. At first Nick thought it was chasing a squirrel or some other small rodent, but a second look revealed long, dirty blonde hair in the tall grass. He quickly remembered that it was probably Saya! He dropped his bags and hopped the fence to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya was still running as the dog neared her closer and closer each time she ran. Saya stopped after a while, crying as the dog came for her...until it was stopped by a giant hand in front of her. Saya looked up and saw that the giant hand was Nick's. She smiled brightly at the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog then quickly bit Nick's hand. He writhed in the pain of the small dog's sharp teeth, hitting it on the head. This caused the dog to whine and run off to another yard. With that done, Nick looked down at the tired, red-faced Saya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Saya?\" Nick asks with a smile. But all he saw was Saya crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Saya! Did I scar you? I tripped back there. So I'm sorry if I scared you..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he asked the crying girl, Maya and Aya ran up to her as well.

You're not hurt, are you?\" Aya asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but Nick got hurt because of me,\" Saya replied as she pointed to Nick's left hand. There were quite visible teeth marks, and blood also dripped from his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saya, I had worst. It's just a bite,\" Nick replies, trying to mask the pain from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you didn't have to do that. Why did you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we're friends, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya was shocked to hear Nick say that. The young girl didn't really have friends outside of her family, mainly due to her acute shyness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-do you mean that, Nick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet. Who wouldn't want to be friends with you? I know that your a bit shy, but you'll get over it. You have the same friendly personality as your sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya smiles brightly, Aya and Maya also smiling soon after.

After breakfast was over, Nick and Maya did the dishes, while Saya held on to Aya, the latter proceeding to ask her questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saya, what do you think of Nick?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya stopped and blushed a bit as she replied,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya figured that Saya had a crush on Nick now. She figured it was puppy love for her. She was more concerned as to why her older sister Maya seemed to have fallen for a man she barely even knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saya, can you take me to my room. I'm going to study. I want to be alone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Aya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya did what her smaller, but older, sister told her, heading up the stairs much easier now that she was taller. It still was a fairly long climb, though. She opened the door for her to her room, watching Aya walk back into her room on her own. After she was done, Saya walked back downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saya, where's Aya?\" Maya asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's up in her room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright. I guess she's studying now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do now?\" Nick asks Saya as he placed some bandages on his wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to watch a movie?\" Saya cheerfully asks, Nick nodding in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls pick something and I'll watch it with you. It sounds fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya and Saya nodded happily in reply as they looked through their DVD collection. Meanwhile, with Aya..</span></div></div>",

Nick was enjoying the animation and artwork in the movies they saw. Maya enjoyed any aspects of their movies that had happy endings. The young Saya simply enjoyed any movie that had cute cats in them. It was 7 p.m. before Nick looked at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's late. No wonder why I'm hungry,\" he said as he got up and saw that the half-size sisters were also quite hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll cook us something,\" he tells them as he gets up, Maya following him. Saya stayed on the couch and continued watching movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help, too\", the cheerful Maya says, standing close to Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Maya. Though could you get your sister Aya out of her room for dinner, possibly?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just Saya to get her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighed as he placed a hand on the tiny waitress' shoulder. \"I think there's something troubling your sister. I'd talk to her myself, but I would only make things worse. Please, Maya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya knew that Aya was having trouble with Nick being here; she was not a fan of her falling so easily for him so soon. Maya sighed as she nodded at Nick and walked out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll go and have a talk with her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smile as he watched Maya go up the stairs to the middle sister's room.

Her bedroom not had TWICE the papers it did since Maya visited her! Aya was growing frustrated from not being able to find the answers for restoring her size. When she finally took a breather, she turned her head and saw that her electric clock said it was 3 a.m.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to take a break. There's no way I'm giving up,\"  Aya says to herself as she stretches. She then figures it would be best to get someone to get the the normal sized coffee cup out of her room. Aya started to move under her door and heads down the stairs to get one of her sisters. When going down she saw that Saya was asleep in her room, her snoring visible to her tiny ears. The 5 inch tall Aya soon made it to the ground floor to search for Maya. It didn't take long for her to find her half-size older sister at the table in the kitchen beside Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya, you got to go to bed. I'm sure everything with Aya will be fine,\" Nick says as he nudges Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I can't yet. I have make sure she's alright. I'm worried about Aya. She very stubborn,\" Maya explains as she drinks some coffee Nick left out for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's really lucky to have sisters that care for her. I think Saya would have stayed up late if she was a bit older,\" Nick said as Maya nods with a little blush on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please\", Aya moans. \"What a cornball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just being kind...say if you still had your power, how would you help Aya?\" Maya asks as she takes another drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first I would need to see a black aura around her. Then, by force from that power, I'd have to draw her heart in my sketch book or any piece of paper.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like a heart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I would draw what I thought of the world of her heart. I would then dive in the picture and solve the problem. The problem with is that my counselors only enter the picture, while my body is dead a like a door knob. If my body get's hurt I'll be feeling the pain, and if I feel the pain in the picture it will go away when I go back to my body. Now if the picture or my body get destroyed, I'm gone. It also is true if the person I enter their heart dies; I die along with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya looked at Nick and nods. She wondered herself what it would be like to enter another person's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You also said that Trucy come back. Did she go with you when you entered a person's heart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She did. Without her I think I would have died a couple of times. Even when I knew their problems, I still couldn't fix them on my own. So I was, or still am, kind of an idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya looked at Nick and smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not an idiot\", she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighs as he thinks about the first time he tried to help someone, he ended up accusing the woman of an abortion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I am. But I think your sister can find the way to make you guys bigger.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya perked her ears at hearing what Nick just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\" Maya asks as she saw Aya in the distance, listening to their conversation. She decided to let Nick keep talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister has incredible love channeling from her. I also think she might be the smartest person I know. If anyone's going to get you guys back to normal, it will be her. She'll do so through the sheer power of her drive. It's a good thing to have in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiles as Aya hears every word of what he just said about her. It's true that not every body said that about her - most accused her of being smarter than her, or that she got \"lucky\". Her teachers said she was smart, but those were just the teachers being teachers. Aya blushed deep red at Nick's kind words. It was the first time someone outside of her family or her friends said she was smart. The blushing Aya comes up and looks up at the two, about to apologize about last night.</span></div></div>",

I'll being sleeping in my room. Good night,\" Aya sighs, her face still red. She turned around so Nick couldn't see her red expression, while Maya giggled at Aya being shy around a boy. She then looked over the area Aya punched him at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that\", she says as she places a Band-aid on the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it\", Nick replies, shaking his head. \"This isn't any worst than any getting hit by fastballs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya wonders what Nick was talking about look on her face. He replies with an \"another time\" look on his face. Leaving the kitchen, Maya went upstairs to check on Aya, who was now in a black shirt and blue shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll say thanks later. I think I'll say it when I'm back to normal,\" Aya says as she goes to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya nods as the oldest sister goes to her bed room to go to bed.

He also told her that the reason why he brought the sketchbook was to draw some of the fish, or anything else that caught his fancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d Nick and Saya heard Maya say from upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Saya watched as the haft-sized sisters come down the stairs. Maya had a shirt on that had a cartoon white cat head on it, a cute, little black skirt, and brown shoes with pink socks on. Aya had on a pink shirt with a cartoon black cat, a white skirt, and black shoes with white socks. Maya also had a camera in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like everybody is ready,\u201d Nick says as Aya goes up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, it was time to get ready to leave. Maya informed Nick of where the keys to the house were as he made everything was locked before they left. Nick let the girls go out in front of him as he searched the house one more time. When he was certain that everything was locked, he then locked the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get walking,\u201d Maya says as she starts forward, only to be stopped by Saya when she walks in front of everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I thought you were going to act like a little kid?\u201d Saya reminded her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're right. She did say that, didn't I? Okay Saya, what do you think we should do?\u201d Aya asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya thought about it for a moment. She then grabbed Maya and Aya\u2019s hands and went over to Nick. Nick put all of his stuff in his bag as Saya put her two older sisters' hands on Nick\u2019s. Aya right hand was being held by Nick\u2019s left, while Nick\u2019s right hand held Maya\u2019s left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go. I always see that little kids have to hold someone hands,\u201d Saya says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya and Aya blushed as they held hands with Nick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. Saya, stay close okay?\u201d Nick tells her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be careful,\u201d Maya adds, a blush on her face from holding Nick's hand as the four headed to the aquarium.</span></div></div>",

Nick paid for the tickets as the four go inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun with your kids, sir,\u201d the young, attractive lady clerk says as she winks at him. Maya felt a bit jealous at this, while Aya just felt strange being called a kid again. Nick, meanwhile, was wondering what to draw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll pay you back for the tickets,\u201d Maya says, as she didn\u2019t like that Nick had to spend his money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Just think of as my gift to you,\u201d Nick replies as Maya blushes a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya picks up a pamphlet to see what exhibits were new. Her eyes automatically locked on to the new events, with Saya hovering above her. Nick got his sketchbook and some pencils out, looking ready to draw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the first exhibit,\u201d Saya says as the baby sister wanted to look at every exhibit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Maya nods as the group went to the first exhibit. There Saya watches as the fish were swimming in tanks, dazzled by what she sees. Aya looked around for videos or fact sheets abut the fish to check if there were any new ones. Maya was watching the fish, but she was also looking at Nick time to time drawing. She walks closer to him to see what he was drawing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you drawing there, Nick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell..some fish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick lowers his sketchbook so that Maya could see the fish he was sketching. They seemed so life-like; even the water seemed real, despite being in black and white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour drawings are amazing, Nick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you get from drawing all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick quickly froze shortly after the compliment, only picking up a finger and pointing it. Maya had no idea what he was doing until he turned around and saw what he was pointing at. Turns out it was the old man who gave Maya the perfume, and he was on the other side of the fish tank!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s here. Nick let\u2019s go and talk to him,\u201d Maya says as the oldest sister turn her head to see Nick agree with her. But Nick had flip to the next page of the sketch book and started to draw at ridicules speeds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaya, what\u2019s wrong with Nick?\u201d Aya asks as she and Saya went over to where Maya and Nick where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe found the old man. Let\u2019s go get him,\u201d Nick informs the clueless middle sister as as he walked to the right side of the tank and was still drawing. The sisters wonder how in the world he could draw like that. But the sisters walked around the other side;  if the old man ran away from Nick, they could at lest block him from that side. As he drew, Nick wondered what was going on with him. He hadn\u2019t drawn like since when he had his power. He figured he got his power back when he saw the black aura around the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s not dive in right away,\u201d Nick says. \"I don't want to faint in the aquarium.\" He finished the picture as he was in front of the old man. \u201cHello, Sir. I was wondering if you could answer some questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello young man. My name is Wyllt. What kind of questions would you like to ask me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would like know why you would give that kind of perfume to my sister?\u201d Aya asks from behind the old man. The old man turns around and sees the shrunken girl, as well as the half-size Maya and Saya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaya, is that you? Looks like that perfume worked,\u201d Wyllt says with a smile as Maya got angry at the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean it worked?! Do you even know what you made me and my sisters go through?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople around started to stair and watch the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould we go somewhere private for this?\u201d Nick asks everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. We are drawing a crowd\", Aya nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. But don\u2019t think you can run, old man,\u201d Maya informs the man with a serious face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise I will not run away, little one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya didn't believe him, but she had to for now. The group then went outside and found a small, grassy area to talk at. Saya stays behind Nick, as she was afraid at what Maya and Aya were going to talk about with the old man. Nick watches and wonder at how this would end. Saya saw that Nick was sweating a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think the biggest question here is; why did you gave that perfume that made me shrink?\u201d Maya asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seemed like you need to be have a little bit of help\", Wyllt replies. \u201cSo I figured that the perfume would work well for any troubles at home.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya and Aya were shocked to hear that. Did Wyllt really mean it when he said he meant to shrunk them to make them solve some of their problems?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?! Who give you the right to \u201chelp us\u201d!\u201d Aya yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I did help you. You see, for each problem you solve, you grow. And it seems like your baby sister solved all of her problems.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;What is he talking about?&gt;&gt; Maya thought to herself. Sure, Saya got over her fear over meeting new people. The other problem...could it be that Saya want to spend more time with her family?&gt;&gt; Maya looked over at Saya, who was still a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat still doesn't make up for you shrinking us,\u201d Aya replies, still sounding enraged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll make it up with you when you two grow back to your normal size. Besides I can\u2019t un-shrink you. You have to solve your own problems\", Wyllt sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;I can\u2019t hold on much longer&gt;&gt; Nick thought as he felt the picture of Wyllt\u2019s heart pulling him in. He tries his darndest to open his sketchbook to the picture of Wyllt\u2019s heart. There he saw terrifying shadows standing around a coffin. The shadows didn\u2019t care about the coffin as they started to reach for the gold above their heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOld man, can you do me a favor and take me to place nice and quiet?\u201d Nick asks as he closes the sketchbook, as well as his eyes. Soon after the man fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNICK!\u201d Maya and Aya gasped. Maya ran over to Nick as Aya talked again to the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry and get a wet towel. Or somebody to help him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaya...can you keep the sketch book safe for me?\u201d Nick asks as Maya nods. \u201cThanks, Maya.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick then fainted on top of the sketchbook. Maya and Aya were shocked to see that Nick had his eyes closed, with a bit of drool coming out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick?\u201d Maya asks with a worried look on her face. \"Nick?! Nick?!?\" Maya shoved him several times, but nothing happened. Wyllt then picked up Nick and put him on a nearby bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go and get him some help,\u201d he tells the girls as he leaves the group. Maya, Aya, and Saya just stood beside Nick, hoping for any kind of response from him.</span></div></div>",

Aya and Saya also saw it, wondering what it was. They soon found out that it was a five inch tall woman with angel wings, now sitting on Nick's stomach. She looked to be about 19, with a small head of nut brown hair, average-sized breasts, and olive green eyes. She wore a white shirt with a brown jacket that was buttoned up, its sleeves rolled up to her elbows. Herer brown shorts reached a little bit over the knee, partially covering up her white socks and brown shoes. Soon after landing on Nick, she began to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this. How did we get back here? Oh well...looks like I\u2019m going to help you again. Just like old times, huh Nick? Now where is that sketchbook?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters couldn\u2019t believe what they were seeing. They were watching a small angel walk on top of the fainted Nick. Maya eventually broke the silent mood with a question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...are you Trucy?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small angel stopped looking for the sketchbook and gasped as she looked at the larger sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes. You can see me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters replied with a nod as Trucy flew over to them and noticed the sketchbook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see Nick made more friends. But it seems like two of you are a lot older then your heights tell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya and Aya were surprised that Trucy could tell that from just looking at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d Aya asks her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s just say I've had good interaction of these kinds of things. Now can you open that sketchbook and help out Nick, please?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will on one condition\", Aya says. \"Could you somehow get me in there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya was shocked to hear Aya say that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I can try\u201d, Trucy replies. \u201cBut why would you want to come with me?\u201d She looks at them with a confused expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick helped us, so we want to help Nick,\u201d Saya explains, the baby sister feeling safe talking with Trucy. The small angel saw Maya and Aya\u2019s determination on their faces; they really wanted to help Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. But can you at lest tell me your names?\u201d Trucy sighs, but then smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaya\u201d, the eldest, half-size sister replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAya\u201d, the younger, other half-size sister says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaya,\u201d the youngest replies with a blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quarter of girls saw some people from the aquarium applying First Aid. Some of the staff talked to the sisters as they picked Nick, asking if they would want to meet up with him later. They agreed, and soon Nick was in the hospital, the three sisters (and Trucy) by his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Saya. Be a good girl as your older sisters help this idiot here,\u201d Trucy giggles as Saya nods. Maya and Aya felt bad leaving Saya by herself. They then saw that the old man from earlier was waiting in the room as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that. My son is kind of useless. He was born with a weak body and every time he overexerts himself, this happens,\u201d Wyllt explains to the nursing staff. Though it seemed to be an excuse moreso than a reason why a healthy guy like Nick would just suddenly faint. The nurse nodded as she put Nick on a bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you three like to visit the aquarium while your Daddy gets better?\u201d a nurse asks Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s alright. I want make sure that Dad is okay\u201d Maya replies, feeling weird calling Nick her \"father\". The nurse nods as she got chairs for the sisters and Wyllt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaya, take care of the sketchbook while we\u2019re gone,\u201d Aya whispered to her baby sister as she hands over the sketchbook to her, making sure it was open to the page with the drawing of Wyllt\u2019s heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you two. Since people think you two are kids, they'll just think you fell asleep waiting for your \u201cDad\u201d to wake up,\u201d Trucy says with a giggle as she thought it would be years before Nick would have kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Aya whispers as Maya nods, ready to return the help that Nick gave her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Close your eyes and breathe in and out slowly,\u201d Trucy explains as the two older sisters did what they were told. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sisters soon black out as they dream, feeling like they were being pushed underwater. The two woke up and saw that they were still half their size, as they noticed from some of the scenery was still pretty big to them even when sitting down. They were looking at huge shadows, which seemed to be trying to take the gold above them. They were on a long highway that stretched out as far as they could see. It looked normal enough, except for some odd colored backdrops, as well as some places floating in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care about the person who died,\u201d Aya frowns. Maya looks really upset, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s our job to fix that,\u201d a voice from behind the sisters said. Maya and Aya turn around  andsaw that Trucy was now much bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you grow?\u201d Aya asks Trucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI usually grow back to my normal size in these dreams. I'm about 5\u20198\u201d in real life\u201d, she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya and Aya nod as they stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick\u2019s not here,\u201d Maya notes. \u201cWhy is that, Trucy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think Nick\u2019s looking around. You're going to have to really look for him if you want to find out the problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters nod at the explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go find Bed Head,\u201d Aya says as the group looks for Nick.</span></div></div>",

It was a long time since he had entered a person's heart, and it felt strange to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow to find a clue or something that could help solve Wyllt\u2019s problem.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick has been looking around the place for something to aid him, but to no avail. Just when he thought he had looked everywhere, he saw a picture on the ground. It was a picture of a boy with blonde hair, and a younger Wyllt. Wyllt looked like he was in his 30's, so this picture must have been from long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould this be the problem?\u201d Nick asks as he picks up the photo. As he did, he saw in the sky a memory being played as if it was a video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now, son. It\u2019s going to be alright,\u201d a young Wyllt says as he puts on a bandage on the boy from the photo's knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Daddy,\u201d the boy says as he stops crying. The sky grew dark again afterwards, as the memory was now over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of his heart, Wyllt had this memory rushed into his mind. Saya saw that Wyllt looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Mister?\u201d Saya asks as Wyllt replies,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just thought of something that I haven\u2019t thought of for years.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Wyllt\u2019s heart, Nick heard what Wyllt was saying on the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is something connected to his family,\u201d Nick gathers as he looks for more photos. Since they were six giant shadows in his sketch, that meant Nick had five more memories to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick continues his journey, finding more \"photos\" along the way. Each one was a memory involving Wyllt and his kids, and he had already found five of them. In addition to the blonde boy, he also another blonde boy, a red-head girl, a blonde-haired girl, and a red-head boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I just need to find the final one and I'll be done,\u201d Nick smiles as he soon finds the final picture. It was located across a broken tower. After a long climb up it, Nick went over to the edge of the top of the tower and slowly reaches for the picture. As he didn't want to fall to this death, he was very careful in reaching over to it. Nick did eventually get the picture...but he also lost his footing and fell down the hole below him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap!

That is, until he looks behind himself and saw the half-sized Maya holding his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaya! What are you doing here!?\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not the only one here,\u201d Aya adds as she was trying to help Maya pull Nick back up. Even together the half-size sisters struggled, so Trucy left them a third hand and manged to pull him in. Afterwards, the three rested on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrucy, you're back!\" Nick gasps. \"But why are Maya and Aya doing here?\u201d He really wanted to know why a girl who died three years ago was back and seemed to age, much less why she was with the half-size sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Nick. I came back when you got your power back. And those half-size sweeties wanted to come in here to help you\u201d, Trucy explains as Nick looks at Maya and Aya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks guys. I really owe you one\", he tells the girls, who blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem,\u201d Maya says for the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last memory ten appeared in the sky. Before it plays, Nick looks at the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you seen these?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. It\u2019s kind of hard to not see them in the sky,\u201d Aya talks for the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nods as he looks up to watch the memory. The memory had a orange haired young boy of ten, and a really young version of Wyllt, who looked no older than his late 20's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, do you mind if I follow in your foot steps?\u201d the boy asks as Wyllt had a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, my boy. You can do whatever you want,\u201d Wyllt says with a smile as he picks up his son and gives him a piggy back ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory ended and suddenly a new memory comes up. There stood the six children from the earlier memories, now adults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFather is getting older. Since Mom passed away, he seems more depressed\u201d, the blonde-haired man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to think of plan to split the accesses\u201d, a red-haired woman adds. As the adults kept talking, the sky went totally black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that Wyllt\u2019s last memory of his children?\u2019 Aya asks Trucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems to be that way. Looks like the children were discussing what they would do after their father passed away.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya knew that Wyllt must of felt like his children didn\u2019t want him around anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not true. Wyllt seemed to love his children! From all of the memories we seen, they truly loved their father\u201d! Maya says, Nick nodding in agreement.<br>\r\n___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWyllt sat there in silence as he had this rush of memories coming back into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;Why am I thinking of those things? My kids only care about that they get after I die&gt;&gt; Wyllt thought as Saya continued to look after him.</span></div></div>",

Then it hit him; he already had the tools to fix Wyllt\u2019s problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI solved it. Let\u2019s go see those shadows!\u201d Nick shouts as he starts to run back to where he first dove into his heart. Trcuy and the sisters chase after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick what are you planning?!\u201d Aya yells to get Nick, hopping to get to hear his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see\u201d, Nick says as Aya only sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think he can solve this problem?\u201d a concerned Maya asks Trucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\", she replied with a bit of hesitance. \u201cHe's solved problems on his own as well before. I think this might be one of those times. Besides, no matter what I said, you would still believe in him, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya nods with a smile. Maya believed that he could fix the problem in Wyllt\u2019s heart. The group soon made it to where they all first landed. The shadows were still fighting over the gold as Nick went up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;Okay. Time to do this&gt;&gt; Nick thought as he took out a pitcure of one of the children and placed it on the face of a shadow. The shadow\u2019s face soon turns into an adult version of the blonde-haired boy from the first memory. He stops reaching for the gold above him and instead looks at the coffin below him. The blonde-haired man then started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe shadows are his kids. So putting on the pictures on the shadows will turn them into there true faces,\u201d Maya gathers as she watches Nick continue to make more shadows into the adult versions of Wyllt\u2019s children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems to be working,\u201d Aya adds, watching the gold above them disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy was proud to see that Nick to solve this problem. After Nick was finishing turning the shadows into the adult versions of the kids, a memory appeared in the sky.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, we\u2019re just worried about you. We don\u2019t want you to alone any more\u201d, a red-head woman says to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Dad. Let us take care of you\u201d, the orange-haired man adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Wyllt was tearing up. He remembered how much of a pain he was to his kids.They tried to help him when he was sad and alone, but he thought they were only after his money. Suddenly Nick pops right back up from the bed, blinking as he stood up. Maya and Aya open their eyes as Trucy came out of the sketchbook and landed near Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m out,\u201d Nick says with a bit of sweat coming down his brow. Wyllt looked at Nick, Maya and Aya, knowing that they helped him from within his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. Are sure your going to be alright?\u201d Wyllt asks as Nick. He felt a bit stiff, but soon manages to walk around a bit. It was then that he saw Trucy was sitting on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019m going to be fine. Thanks for looking after Maya and her sisters,\u201d Nick says with a smile. Wyllt nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dMaya, Aya...when you grow back to normal size, I\u2019ll give you something really good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWyllt then leaves without another word. Saya waves him good-bye as she soon turns her attention to Nick, who was holding out his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaya, can I have my sketchbook back?\u201d he asks the littlest sister. She nods as she does so. After<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya nods with a smile as she gives the sketch book back. After getting the sketch book back, Saya hugs Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you're all back,\u201d Saya says as she walks up to hug her sisters next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like somebody became a ladies' man,\u201d Trucy said as she sat on his shoulder. Nick sighed as he looks at the shrunken angel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery funny. So I guess your back to stay for a bit?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. Looks like you got your power back as well. You'll be either helping people, or you'll rot\u201d, she says in a harsh though also playful tone. Nick only sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you're back up, can we continue to look at the aquarium?\u201d Maya asks as she still saw Trucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Saya. We still have plenty of time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figure you\u2019ll tell me everything about what happen to you two when we get to your house?\u201d Trucy asks the older sisters. Maya and Aya nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they talked, a doctor came in the room. He held up a folder in his right armpit, and had short, black hair and blue eyes. He was fairly tall and a bit lanky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, we\u2019ll let you and your kids continue your tour of the aquarium, but you must have a assistant with you,\u201d the doctor explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, dear,\u201d the clerk lady from earlier says as she comes thought the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm. I think I\u2019ll be fine by myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. You must do it, or you'll stay here for the next 22 hours\u201d, the doctor replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick agrees to the extra assistance as they all head back to the aquarium. Maya, Aya, and Trucy enjoy looking at the exhibits and sights, while the clerk tried to hit on Nick as he drew. Fortunately, Maya was there to get her from doing so. Trucy giggles as she watches from the sidelines, enjoying her aquarium trip as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the aquarium closed, they came back home, where...</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll right back,\u201d she tells everyone as she excuses herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Nick says as he thought that Maya had to do something. Saya and Aya sighed as Trucy shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be back. We just need to get Maya back,\u201d Aya says as the half-size sister and Saya ran after their half-sized older sister. Trucy followed the sisters, hoping to get Maya down for dinner at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiles as watches the girls run up the stairs. It soon fades as he looks at his sketchbook, looking at the new drawing of Wyllt\u2019s heart. There stood a smiling Wyllt with his kids and grandkids. Nick pulls the soup off the stove and pours it in the bowls for all five of them. When he was done, he took his seat as he got out some color Copic markers and started to color the drawings of the sisters he drew from earlier. As he colors them in, Nick begins to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;When I got this power the first time, Trucy wanted me to be able to make friends, since I was a dark person according to her. But why do I have these powers again? Why in the world would I get them back? Why is Trucy back? There\u2019s got to be a reason behind this. And I\u2019ll figure it out once Maya and Aya return to normal size. I hope that my arm doesn\u2019t start rotting..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick stops thinking and shivers at the thought of seeing his body rotting. After that unpleasant thought, he looks down and sees that he's done the first coat of the coloring for the sisters\u2019 pictures; the young man put it on in a safe place so it could dry faster.  Nick then saw that the girls were back from downstairs. Maya\u2019s face was a bit red for some reason...and Aya and Saya puffed as it seemed like they were talking a while as Trucy floated and lands on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick...thanks for cooking for us,\u201d Maya says with a smile as she digs in. The two younger sisters sigh as Trucy giggles at the oldest sister's inability to get her feelings across. She remembers that Nick only found out Trucy loved him after she died, so he hoped he would noticeably faster with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're welcome,\u201d Nick replies as he eats, continuing to wonder why he has his powers back. After the group ate their dinner, it was time for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll be sleeping near Maya,\u201d Trucy says with a smile as the small angel sat on Maya\u2019s shoulder. Maya smiles at the small angel wanting to talk more to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNight, Nick,\u201d Saya says as she goes back to her bed room. Aya waves to him as well as she goes upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNight, Nick. Sweet dreams,\u201d Maya and Trucy say at the same time as they go upstairs as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNight, girls,\u201d Nick says to all four of them before he soon crashes on the couch, wondering what will happen tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

He picked up his new clothes and went straight for the shower. Nick was washing his hair when he feels something strange coming down from his head/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;What the heck is that?!&gt;&gt; Nick thought as he open his eyes and looks in a mirror. He notice that black ink seemed to be mixed in with the water! Nick was shock to see Ink on his hair, looking at his hands he saw that his indexed figure\u2019s tip become a brush that was tipped with black ink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;What the hell!?!&gt;&gt; Nick though again as he shook his head and saw that his figure tip was back to normal. Nick cleans off the black ink and quickly finishes his shower. He then put on a blue and white striped shirt and a pair of shorts. Nick then went to the kitchen to fix breakfast for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Nick,\u201d Maya says as she comes down the stairs first. She seemed to just gotten out of the shower, as her hair was still wet. The half-sized half was wearing a white shirt with red hearts on it, as well as a black skirt. Trucy the brown-haired angel wasn't behind, resting on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, Maya and Trucy,\u201d Nick says as he finishes a batch of scrambled eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for cooking for us, Nick.\u201d Maya says with a cheerful, thankful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou used to be so useless. When did you become so dependable?\u201d Trucy teases Nick. Nick had somewhat of an annoyed look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have always been dependable.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya and Trucy giggle at the sight of his face. Aya and Saya soon came down the stairs as well. Aya was wearing a black shirt with a cartoon fish on it, and blue pants. Saya had pajamas that had cat heads on them, the girl still looking half-sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaya, could you at lest get dressed first?\u201d Aya asks her baby sister as she ate her breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter breakfast,\u201d Saya says as she sits down and eats her scrambled eggs. Maya nods as she starts to eat as well. Nick also eats as Trucy watches the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrucy, would you like some food?\u201d Maya asks the small angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t need to eat. But thanks for asking me anyway.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya saw that the flowers in a vase, which the baby sister collected weeks ago, were now fading away. The flowers used to bright yellow with fluffy buds. Now, thought, they seem to be dark and withering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we go on a walk today and pick more flowers?\u201d Saya asks, pointing to the wilting flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure we can. It\u2019s nice out and we need to go out more,\u201d Maya replies, Nick nodding in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go upstairs and pick out something cute for you to wear,\u201d Aya tells her sister as she finishes her breakfast. Saya soon finishes hers as well and follows her. Maya was also done eating and was putting the plates together with Nick so they could be washed. Trucy watches as Aya takes Saya upstairs to get the baby sister dress for the walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Maya, let\u2019s help Saya get dressed!\u201d Aya yells from the top of the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want Nick to do all the work!\u201d Maya yells back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Maya. Go help Saya pick an outfit. I\u2019ll clean up,\u201d Nick tells her, rubbing her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem\", Trucy replies. \"Let Nick handle things.\u201d The small angel then grabs the tiny woman's hand and pulls her up the stairs. Nick waves at Maya as she waves back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick soon began cleaning the table, as well as the dishes and pans, as he got ready for the walk. He got his pencils, markers, and sketchbook - everything he needed to draw anything on the walk. He put his stuff in the blue bag and places it on his right shoulder. He then sat on a chair in the kitchen as he waits for the sisters to come down. Nick saw the dead flowers in the vase. As he did, something in Nick\u2019s head told him to look at his indexed fingers. Both fingers had brush tips with black ink on them..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;This again? Wait, maybe I\u2019ll try to redraw the flower&gt;&gt; Nick thought as he uses his right index finger as he would use a regular pen as he drew a black ink version of said flower. Suddenly after the flower comes back to life. It even had the bright yellow color and fluffy buds back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid that happen with this?! I didn\u2019t have this power like this when I went into people\u2019s hearts. Is this a bad mutation?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick continues to think until the half-sized Maya snaps him out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick! Before we go, I\u2019ll be making our lunches.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looks behind him and saw the girls right in front of him. Saya was now wearing new clothes: her trademark red ribbon in her hair, a rainbow color sundress, and brown shoes for her feet. Nick re-looks at his fingers, which looked normal again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaya! I ca-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Nick. I\u2019ll fix lunch. Just go and relax in the living room,\u201d Maya interrupts the young man. Nick saw that he wouldn\u2019t be winning this fight and followed Maya\u2019s orders. Aya and Saya help Maya fix the lunch as Trucy watches the sisters make sandwiches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n__<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick began to experiment with his index finger brushes. Nick was able to turn on and off this power apparently; and if he made a slash with them on, it could cut something in half, as he learned when he sliced in half a broken pencil. He turned the power off as soon as he saw the sisters comes out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go for that walk,\u201d Maya cheerfully says as Nick gets up. Trucy then lands on Nick\u2019s shoulder as he let the sisters out first. He then locked the door behind them. Now that they were all standing up again, Nick was still amazed that Maya and Aya were still half their size. Maybe that would change today.</span></div></div>",

As they walked, Nick somehow manages to find the time to also draw the things around him. He smiles  as he looks at the clear sky and fast moving. To Nick, this was paradise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes he always have that look on his face when he draws?\u201d Maya asks as Trucy had moved to the haft sized oldest sister\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. He even makes up songs,\u201d Trucy sighs as he starts singing to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeaceful water, peaceful water...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya couldn\u2019t believe that a grown made was singing about a river. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeaceful water, Peaceful water\u201d, Saya sings along with Nick as she approaches him. Maya giggles at the sight as Aya couldn\u2019t believe the baby sister had joined with the signing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like hanging out with him again\u201d, Trucy chirps as the small angel thought about the times Nick just drew and she bugged him. She then starts to reminisce in her mind about her youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think we can solve a problem of ours and grow back to our normal size in this place?\u201d Aya, in a whisper, asks Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope so. But it\u2019s nice to have a lunch near the river bank\u201d, Maya beams in reply, showing the lunches she had more in her basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maya set up the lunches, Saya picked flowers, while Nick drew some more. It was nearly noon by the time they ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime for lunch, everybody!\u201d Maya calls out with a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick gets out a blanket and lays on the ground for them to eat on top of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere! We brought some home-made sandwiches, drinks, and desserts for everybody\u201d, Aya explains as they sat down the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya picked what she wanted to eat and starts to dig in. Nick picked up a sandwich and took a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis tastes great. You\u2019re good cooks\u201d, Nick compliments the sisters. Maya blushes, Aya nods with a smirk on her face, and Saya smiles brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now that we're eating, would anyone like to talk about anything?\u201d Trucy asks, wanting to help the other two sisters grow back to normal.</span></div></div>",

A strawberry-blond haired woman was on the ground, apparently fallen out of a wheelchair that was near her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss, are you alright?\u201d Nick says as he gets up and helps the woman. The woman was about 35. Along with aforementioned starwberry blonde hair, she had blue eyes and a hospital patient uniform on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. Thank you every much, son,\u201d the woman smiles as Nick helps her up back on the wheelchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Nick, and these three are sisters that I\u2019m babysitting,\u201d Nick introduces himself. The three girls then introduce themselves as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;Looks like the younger sister is teller then the older ones. Odd.&gt;&gt; \u201cMy name is Zoe\u201d, the older woman says as Trucy bows to her, feeling the need to be polite to an older woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you here, Zoe? Shouldn't you be inside?\u201d Saya asks, getting better with talking with new people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, little girl, it's the day I go out for fresh air\u201d, Zoe explains. \u201cIt\u2019s my walking time from the hospital.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, she most be really sick if she has to be at the hospital,\u201d Trucy says on Aya's shoulder, her nodding in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we were about to have a picnic. Care to join us?\u201d Maya offers her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe was about to reply when a nurse from the hospital came by. She did not seem happy, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Zoe, you know that your not allowed to be this far!\u201d  the nurse scolds her as she takes her away from the girls and Nick. Before she leaves, she bows at the girls. \u201cThank you for looking after her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext time, my dear. Thank you again,\u201d Zoe says with a smile as the nurse rolls Zoe away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you four made a new friend,\u201d Trucy says as Nick seese a deep aura surrounding Zoe. Nick turns the next page of his sketchbook and starts to draw Zoe\u2019s heart. When he finished, there was a smile child crying in the middle of the page, darkness sounding her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like we have another one,\u201d Nick notes as he cracks his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo soon, too. So when are Maya, Aya and, me going to dive in with you?\u201d Trucy asks with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I can handle this myself,\u201d Nick replies. Trucy's expression slowly went from a smile to a giant frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick, you have to let us help you!\u201d Maya asks. \u201cI don't want you to have to travel alone..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Nick. With us around, it can really help you,\u201d Aya agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI SAID I can do this myself!!\u201d Nick repeats himself, hitting a tree with his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that tree hitting, there was an awkward silence. Nick then gave everyone a cold, dark glare like the sisters and even Trucy never saw before. Saya and Maya were too scared to reply, and Aya was too pissed off at him to say anything. It was up to Trucy to be the voice for all four of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid Nick! Why are you being so annoying now?!\u201d Trucy shouts as the giant young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c'Stupid!'?! You\u2019re the one that\u2019s stupid! You're always getting into other people's business, even when you're not wanted!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy couldn\u2019t believe what Nick said to her. Saya was kind of scared at the idea of Nick and Trucy fighting. Aya wonders what to do as she hadn't really seen this side of Nick or Trucy before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease calm down, you two!\u201d Maya cries. \u201cI don't like fighting!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Nick soon was in the same room as the blond strawberry women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you again. Where are those sisters you were babysitting?\u201d Zoe asks with a bit of sweetness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTheir mother picked theme up. I came here for a quick visit.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh is that so?\u201d Zoe asks as she sees the nurse comes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, could you please go out for a few minutes? Zoe needs to take a nap\u201d, she tells Nick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease come back when my nap\u2019s done,\u201d Zoe requests of Nick. She then grumbles a bit at the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be in the waiting room,\u201d Nick says as he leaves the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick went to the waiting room as he said. As he sis, he was getting to dive into her heart. Since his body became stiff, he put the sketchbook in front of his face so passersby would just think he was looking at a picture. He soon dives into it.<br>\r\n__ <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was standing in a park, looking for a little crying girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;I wonder she is?&gt;&gt; Nick thought as he then saw a little girl crying. He walks over and listens to what she has to say. The little girl turns out to be Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my fault. It\u2019s my fault. It\u2019s happening because of me,\u201d she cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick couldn\u2019t understand what the young Zoe was crying about. He decided it would be best to look around. He then saw two giants in the middle of the two of them. One giant was an adult man with blond hair and wore a suit, and the other was a women with red hair and wore a pink dress with black high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;Are those her parents?&gt;&gt; Nick thought to himself. He then looked and Zoe and asks her this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my fault. They don\u2019t love each other. They don\u2019t even live together anymore,\u201d she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was shocked that Zoe still blamed herself for her parents\u2019 separation. He had to find a way to fix this problem. Nick notices that there was a piece of paper on the ground. He decides to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZoe, what\u2019s this doing here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI drew that, but that wouldn\u2019t solve anything. I can\u2019t do anything to help them. It\u2019s my fault.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick then brought his index figure out and turns the tip of his finger into a brush tip with black ink. He starts to fix the picture as he begins to see a picture colored with crayons. It was the young Zoe in the middle of a picture, with her father on her right and her mother on the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZoe, your parents need to see this\u201d, Nick tells the crying girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re to busy fighting to notice me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighs as he looked upward again at the two giants. Afterward he got an idea of to get them to see the picture. He decided to pelt them with rocks to get their attention. Although he was hesintatn of the consequences, they got results; the giant parents looked down and saw Zoe crying. Both parents lie down on the ground to see her better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZoe you have to show them the drawing you drew. Come on show them and they\u2019ll listen to you because they love you,\u201d Nick says to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick put the picture in Zoe\u2019s hands as Zoe stops crying for a moment. She nods as she raises the picture and shows it to her parents. The giant parents saw this and had a sad look on their faces. They then lit up a bit as they patted their child's head. Zoe stops crying and begins to smile instead.<br>\r\n__<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick woke up. He was sweating a bit, but he had solved Zoe\u2019s problem. Nick looked at the clock and saw that it  p.m. now. Nick went over to Zoe's room and saw that she was awake. Zoe was smiling with tears coming down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZoe, are you all right?\u201d Nick asks as he has a strange felling about this. This was quite different than when solved a person\u2019s problem typically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe turns her head to see Nick standing in the door way. \u201cI had a dream where I figured out that my parents sill loved me when they separated. And you were there to help me out. Thank you. At lest I can apologize to my parents before I pass on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it was- Wait! When you pass on!?\u201d Nick gasps, looking devastated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m dying right now. And I have a feeling that you helped me out a bit. So thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019re dying. I can\u2019t even save you,\u201d Nick barely musters as he cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you did. You made sure that I can say my goodbye to my parents and apologize at how rotten of a kid I was. But Nick, you're still young, so learn from your mistakes. Be happy, be sad, cry when you can\u2019t hold it in any more. Keep those you cherish close to you and cherish those memories.\u201d Zoe smiles as Nick began to draw in his sketchbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I have a power that can draw a person's heart,\u201d Nick says as he finishes and hands it over to Zoe. Zoe looks at and saw that it was a replica of what she drew as a kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Nick. For everything,\u201d Zoe says as she hugs Nick. Nick hugs back as Zoe let go. Visiting hours were over as Nick left the hospital. He stood at the same river <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrawing always helps me\u2026\u201d Nick says as he tries to draw. But instead of a drawing, tears were found on his sketchbook. Nick cries so much from the anguish from earlier, snot started running down his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI\u2019m such an idiot. I made Trucy cry, and Maya, Aya, and Saya hate me. Zoe is also going to die and I couldn\u2019t do anything to save her. I'm a weak, pathetic jack-assjust a jack ass and I\u2019m still weak,\u201d Nick laments as he set his sketchbook on the ground and let out a good cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around 6 p.m. now. Nick was still sitting still, with his eyes puffy and red and his snot hardened. He just sat still, thinking about what do.</span></div></div>",

Going shopping, playing games and watching a movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n__<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group was walking back to the river bank to get back their things. It was around six pm.

So we\u2019ll talk to him then,\u201d Maya explains as Aya wanted to argue but the middle sister wanted to know what\u2019s going on with Nick as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group walks to the river bank and saw the young man sitting still. Trucy notes that the sketch that he was drawing in was now next him. Trucy flew off Maya\u2019s should and was about a foot away from Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick are you alright?\u201d Trucy asks as Nick replies with out turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrucy\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for what I did earlier. I\u2019m just an idiot,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick words sound heart broken. Maya went over and stood besides Trucy. Aya followed to make sure that Nick didn\u2019t try anything funny. Saya followed Aya so she could hear what the group was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick, did something happen when you help Zoe? Maya ask as she saw Nick head straiten up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaya. I\u2019m sorry as well. Zoe was happy,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya was confused at Nick was trying to say.

Trucy got on Maya\u2019s shoulder to see what Nick was talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya didn\u2019t want her sister to go near the young man but felt like it was best that the older sister went over as Aya was still comforting Saya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya and Trucy saw Nick\u2019s face as it seemed like he has been crying for hours. The also notice that his index finger\u2019s tip was a brush with black on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick when did this happen?\u201d Tucy asks as leaps off Maya\u2019s shoulder and examines the finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis morning, I don\u2019t know it happen. I just woke up with it on my finger,\u201d Nick explains as Maya was still looking the brush finger tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was Zoe after you fixed her problem?\u201d Maya asks as Nick says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe said she was happy. Zoe said she could apologize to her parents,\u201d Nick explains still a bit sadden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut she was happy before she passed on. You made death easier on her,\u201d Trucy explains as Maya says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. You made her happy before she died. And we\u2019ll help you get use to this power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya hugs Nick as Trucy hugs Nick\u2019s hand. Nick felt a little lighter for some odd reason.

She had long red hair, brown eyes, and wore a black shirt under a red sweater, black jeans, and blue shoes. Wren was taller then Aya but had bit of a smaller chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what Aya told her about her friends, Meinir was a very nice girl that kept group of three level headed and Wren was strongest girl in school.

So they kind had to push me out the door for three months,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy sighs at Nick\u2019s nonchalant manner of just taking breaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s been a week since the sisters grew back to normal size. Nick with sketch book in hand, as well  black, green-eyed cat doll he made for Saya, was meeting up with the three sisters, Wren, Meinir, and Trucy. Nick was wearing a blue and white strip shirt with brown cargo shorts and blue and black Convers. Nick wonders why his body wasn\u2019t rotting away. The first time he had this power his arm would be rotting away right now. Nick sighs as he was glad to be able to see the others again after a week of doing nothing but draw, watch TV, playing video games, and taking walks in the city.

Meinir had on a pink shirt, white cargo pants, with pink socks and black shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you finally made it,\u201d Aya says as Nick took his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Yeah. Sorry about being late,\u201d Nick says as he hands the black cat doll to Saya.. Saya smiles and takes the doll and hugs it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Nick.\u201d Saya says with a smile as Nick nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where\u2019s Maya?\u201d Nick asks as he question was answered as the oldest sister was wearing a waitress outfit. Nick had to admit that Maya did look cute in the waitress uniform.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi guys. Sorry about that I had to do an order before I took my break,\u201d Maya explains as she sits down next to her sisters and Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Now I want to know if there\u2019s anything new with Nick\u2019s powers,\u201d Wren says as Nick sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing new, ever where I looked I didn\u2019t see any one with a single problem,\u201d Nick explains as he drinks the strawberry juice that was set out for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally. That\u2019s a surprised. You figure that a lot of people would have problems,\u201d Meinir says as she figured that Nick must have solved a lot of problems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe the power only works when the person problem is too much for them to solve by them selves,\u201d Maya says her two cents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat does make since. Well maybe we\u2019ll find a person with a problem,\u201d Trucy says as Saya notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick drawing funny again,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls look and saw that Nick was drawing again at fast speeds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, we already hook one.

It\u2019s\u2026.\u201d Turcy says as she looks around for the black aura. She sees the person and points at the them.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maya knew the person that Trucy was pointing to, it was Aki Adhara. Aki was a new waitress that started about a month ago. Aki had long black hair (That reach down to her back), brown eyes, medium size breast, and skinny legs. Aki is five feet tall. Today she was wearing a red waitress uniform the same as hers. When she was off work, Aki would wear a pink shirt with a purple coat, black skirt, pink socks and black shoes. Aki wasn\u2019t really getting along with the other waitress. Aki always seemed cold towards everybody even the boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was finish drawing the picture of Aki\u2019s heart. He saw it was a broken mirror in female hands. There was an image in each broken piece. In one piece was a shard with a bunch of flowers, an afternoon sky, the ocean, a wedding ring on ring on a hand, and finally rainy day with a dead man lying down on the highway. The man was wearing blue jeans, red and black jacket and had brown hair. Nick felt bad at looking at the picture. He closed the sketch book fast before even Trucy could even see it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey did you finish the drawing?\u2019 Maya asks as she saw Nick finish the drawing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I did. But I think I\u2019ll try to get to know her problem first,\u201d Nick explains as Wren looks at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Let us see it,\u201d Wren tried to grab the sketch book. Nick grabs and struggles to keep the girls of seeing the picture. Nick couldn\u2019t believe at how strong Wren was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d A voice comes from behind the two. Nick and Wren look to see an annoyed Aki standing tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d Nick says as he saw the black hair girl grab the sketch book from two. Aki was much stronger then Nick and Wren. Aki looks through the book and saw some of sketches of the area\u2019s around town, people and then see saw the picture of the broken mirror. The black hair waitress\u2019s face turns into anger at seeing the brown hair young man in one of mirror\u2019s shards. She then grab Nick by his coiler and lifted him up in the air. Aki knew that Nick drew this as she heard Maya told to her friends about a Nick the week she came back to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the hell did you know about this?\u201d Aki asks young man she was holding up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAki please calm down,\u201d Maya pleases with black hair women. Saya was scared at seeing Nick in trouble. Aya, Wren, and Meinir were ready to go into action just in case Aki did something funny. Trucy got on Nick\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook Nick you have to play it cool,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighs as he tries to think of a way to calm the angry women in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just something I though-\u201c Nick begins but Aki already threw a punch at Nick and hit him with her free hand with the sketch book in her hand. Nick didn\u2019t feel the pain as he felt his soul going into Aki\u2019s heart. Aki threw Nick\u2019s lifeless body on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m taking my break!\u201d Aki yells as the black hair women threw the sketch book on the ground. Maya couldn\u2019t believe that Aki hit Nick so hard that he passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is bad,\u201d Trucy sweats at seeing Nick drooling a bit. He was already in Aki\u2019s heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s already in Aki\u2019s heart?\u201d Meinir asks as she picks up the sketch book. Aya was ready to go in and help but felt that an extra thing must be also put on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaya you have to go after Aki. Try to calm her down before she does something stupid,\u201d Aya explains to Maya. Maya wanted to help Nick until she saw her boss come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaya please listen to your sister. I\u2019ll look after them while you try to calm Aki down. You seem like the only one she seems to listen to,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya knew that her boss was right. Aya looks at Wren and Meinir would be going along with Trucy and herself to help Nick solve this problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya knew what plan Aya was making and knew it was good one.

The group looks and see that there were four other waitress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne waitress who is twenty-five years old wore a yellow waitress uniform, with her hair in a pony tale, pink hair, and sky blue eyes. The second waitress who is twenty-one years old wore a pink waitress uniform, short dark violet hair, black rim glasses. and amber eyes. The third who is twenty-three years old wore a purple waitress uniform, long hair as white as snow, and violet eyes. The last one who is nine-teen years old wore a black and white waitress uniform, gold short puffy hair, and flame color eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you four,\" The boss says and Maya smiles at the friends she work with. The pink hair ones name was Poppy, dark hair violet's name was Lilaca, the one white hair was Eira, and the lat one with the gold like hair was Oria. Poppy was a energetic women that was always up to the task of making any customer happy. Lilaca was quite the serious type even going as far making sure each waitress did their job right and did the time they needed. Eira was the calmest of the group never worrying about what happen and always stayed cool in hectic situations. Oria was very much an air head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry the boss and us will get Aki back.

Wren grabs the other and help lifts the body up. The two took Nick over to a bed and lie him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's see if you can get out of this one bead head,\" Aya thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n______<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick open his eyes to see he was standing the middle of dirt patch area. The young man then rubs his check from where Aki had punch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man she could throw a punch,\" Mumbling to himself then he saw the mirror but it was being hold by a one hundred foot naked Aki. Nick blush a bit from see the sight but stop. He had to get rid of getting embarrassed about seeing a women's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of artist can't even stop being an idiot,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick slow goes over to the giantess and saw that Aki was looking down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um hello,\" Nick says as Aki just grunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave here. Just leave me alone. No one understands me,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick felt like he wasn't going to get any where with Aki. Suddenly Aki's broken mirror starts to fall apart. Nick runs away and was lucky enough to doges it. Nick looks at it and sees a flower patch and then a young boy with brown hair with a yellow shirt, black shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Aki you look as pretty as these flowers,\" The boy stumbles in dry sound voice. Nick figured that this was Aki's memories and was seeing everything out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Cen, I forgive you a little bit. But your still going to have to buy me a new hat after the one you threw up in,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick wonders if Cen was the reason behind Aki's problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki was walking down the street with the picture she took out of that weirdo's sketch book. She held it close and open it again and look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know about this. No one should. I never told any one of this,\" The twenty year old thought as she remembers Cen and how he threw up in hat. Aki shook her head.

Trucy flew away to sit on Aya's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya, Saya and Trucy watch as Nick and the half-size Maya stood still. Nick was wondering what Maya wanted as shethought about the words she would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn't Nick just say that he likes her?\u201d Aya whispers to Trucy. Trucy sighs and replies with,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I was the one who had to confess to Nick when we dated. He's really an idiot when it comes to the love department. He didn\u2019t even notice when a classmate of his, a gorgeous supermodel, fell in love with him after he solved her problems. Nick only cared about art back then.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya couldn\u2019t really comment on what she just heard. Could there be guys as dense as that in this world? Saya was still watching Maya, waiting for her to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaya, are you alright?\u201d Nick asks as Maya sighs and asks him a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick...If you liked somebody a lot, what would you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...I think I would just say it to the person.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya then closes her eyes and, without thinking about it, kisses Nick on the lips.

You got a girlfriend,\u201d Trcuy congratulated Nick in a somewhat mean-spirited tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick only sighs; he hated that nickname.

Since, you know, Trucy is dead and everything.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes that mean you're going leave, Trucy?\u201d Saya asks. She knew that Trucy still, even now, loved Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t be taking him away from your sister.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya forecasts a smile as she went upstairs to see what Maya would be wearing. Aya, meanwhile, sighs. It seemed that the once tallest sister (despite being the middle sister) was the smallest sister again. After she sighed, she went upstairs as well, with Nick and Trucy smiling at the sight. Soon after, dinner was made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDinner\u2019s ready,\u201d Nick says as he gets the food of the stove. Tonight he had made some soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great. Say Nick, did you draw Wyllt's heart again after you fixed his problem?\u201d Trucy asks him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nods; he always drew the person\u2019s heart again and sees its happy side. The sketchbook from that day was on the kitchen table. He made a gesture for Trucy to look at it herself, which she helped herself to. The new picture of Wyllt\u2019s heart. It was a picture of him smiling, his kids and grand-kids surrounding him all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what a heart looks like after you fix it,\u201d a voice said from behind. Nick and Trucy saw that it was Maya. She was now wearing a white shirt and a black skirt. Aya and Saya were close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. It was thanks to you we got this drawing. Thanks again, Maya and Aya,\u201d Nick says as they flash him a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be bad if my sister\u2019s boyfriend had died,\u201d Aya says as they all sat down for dinner. Nick sighed, but with a smile on his face; Maya smiled as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner meal was a short one, since it was only soup. Still, it allowed everyone to reflect on everything that had happen today, which was quite a lot: a trip to the aquarium, an old man's heart fixed, Maya growing to normal size and gaining a boyfriend. It was the most excitement for Maya and her sisters in a long time. After they ate, it was time for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight everybody,\u201d Nick says as he starts cleaning up. Trucy stays with him on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. Night, Nick,\u201d Saya says as she hugs him and goes up to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNight, Bed Head,\u201d Aya says in a joking tone as she went to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya, meanwhile, stays in the kitchen to help Nick with the dishes. After they were done, then they finally went up to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll be sleeping near Maya,\u201d Trucy says with a smile as she floats down to Maya\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNite, Nick,\u201d Maya says as she gives him a quick peck on the lips. She then went up to her room as Trucy and Maya start to talk on the walk up the stairs. Nick hoped that Trucy wouldn\u2019t say anything about what he was like in in school...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow alone, Nick then went to sleep on the couch. Having gained both his power back and a girlfriend; it was a long day for the young man. As he drifted to sleep, he smiles as he thinks about what happened today. The next morning would be a interesting one. </span></div></div>",

Carefully he walked out Maya's bedroom while carrying her in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he reached the living room where the he and the three shrunken sisters spent their nights in, He was noticed by Aya and when she saw her older sister sleeping and being carried by the giant she quickly got the wrong idea and shouted at Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MAYA?!?\" Nick quickly shushed her as he felt Maya move and grunt at the noise, he laid her down the chair where the three sisters slept and then he signaled Aya to move a bit further away. She glared at Nick before reluctantly moving a bit further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighed at Aya's stubbornness and then he looked at the sleeping older sister, checking to see if all the noise woke her up, after confirming that Maya was still asleep, he went to Aya preparing himself from an loud,overprotective middle sister smaller than his hand. He was quite surprised to see Maya still asleep after Aya shouted with all her might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going near the hallway where Aya went he sat down in cross-leg fashion and awaited Aya loud outburst and he was not disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind explaining to me WHAT YOU DID TO MY SISTER?!\" Aya shouted her lungs out as she scolded the giant. Nick sighed and then he proceeded to tell her how Maya was blaming herself for being the cause of their shrinking problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw Maya on her bed crying herself to sleep as she blamed herself for bringing the stupid perfume and how it ruined your lives, she...even told me that she deserved to shrink until she fades away because she failed you guys. Though I tried my best to comfort her and she stopped crying but I'm pretty sure she is still blaming herself for bringing that perfume and shrinking you guys...It might be best to stop our search for tomorrow and just help Maya out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...sorry for...umm...blaming you so suddenly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya was shocked to find out that her big sister was blaming herself for a mistake that she and Saya did in their own accord, she agreed that they should stop their search for tomorrow and just spend the day relaxing and comforting Maya. She still doesn't trust her giant neighbor but she knows what's best for her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya then apologized on her quick accusation and then she asked Nick to help her go to the kitchen as she told Saya to stay there. After helping her to the kitchen, Saya asked where her big sister was Aya then told her that Maya was very tired after playing and that she couldn't eat dinner after further explaining she, Saya and Nick quietly ate dinner and afterwards he helped Aya and Saya to their chair where Maya was sleeping and they proceeded to sleep to welcome the next day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick washed the dishes and then he sat in the kitchen continuing to color the drawing of the three sisters while he was thinking if there is really a way for him to cure the three sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards he went outside to feel the cool summer air while looking at the night sky filled with beautiful stars. He then sighed until he noticed  a shooting star streaking through the clear night sky. Nick was then remembered how he and Trucy did the exact same thing while she was still alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(sigh) I'm so useless huh Trucy? I can't even help three girls get back to normal...I know if you were here we could have helped them get back to normal faster than I can say 'I'm an idiot'...(sigh)Good night Trucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said to no one as he went back inside, then he stared at the three girls. Saya hugging the gigantic cat doll (for her size) while breathing silently, Aya sleeping in what seems to be a very uncomfortable position and Maya sleeping like an angel while snoring quite softly. Nick looked at the three and promised himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to help you guys grow back to normal\" before proceeding to the couch and quickly falling asleep as he was also tired by the constant walking around and the long gaming period with the three siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis day has ended with disappointment will the next day be better or will there be more problems?   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Unsnapping the top snap to her designer jeans, she wiggled the tight material down to her thighs, as then slipped down her silky panties, leaving her rather bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiss, hiss, hiss, hiss, hiss,\" the sprayer sounded as the infectious spray soaked her feminine privates, she lifting one leg to let the spray go where she never sprayed any perfume before then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs yet another urge suggested she take off her jeans and then her shoes, socks, to laying bare her feet ans spray then her toes.

She was thrilled by her ears and how they had changed; telling much about what she might expect her body to become more like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya her age then as having had that eighteenth birthday just the previous month. She was four feet and eleven inches, as not bad for her age, she might grow another two inches to a sexy 5'1\" by the time she was twenty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brown hair and eyes were not a raving beauty, but if the perfume did work, as it had on her ears, she might well make a handsome doe goat for some hearty buck to show her his idea of love. She stood there invigorated with an ill want to become as something she was not born; but that seemed as an adventure compared to how she was treated at school or at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough her mother said Maya was short, and clumsy a girl, her job as a Dog and Suds waitress would have had paid her way through  junior college. She  stood there naked, smiling, her clothes discarded, as she held dear a great wish that she would not need to concern herself with fashions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was at the quick and ready to be of help to anyone, friends, foes, or her disgruntled family, her heart was in the right place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya had to see herself in a full length mirror every morning she awoke, and what looked back at her was a near flat chested young woman, petite in many features, her fingers worked well to play the piano, but that seemed the best essence of her abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meanwhile of her day dreaming, she had not so noticed her skin changing of hue, it growing darker, as brown fur began to sprout. Some of her new fur was like peach fuzz and in other places the fur grew thicker. She began to feel at her face, what her mother said was the face of a homely girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya noted her vision as different, she could see wide panned views as her eyes moved while her skull changed, as nose and mouth grew to merging to form a muzzle. Her mother said she had not enough money to pay for braces on her daughter's teeth, but from the re-contouring of her head and face, the human teeth feel free, replaced by teeth suited for a herbivore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya shivered, feeling a odd chill rake down her torso, as fur thickened into a dense pelt, and her breasts began to rise, looking more like mountains with perky pointed peaks. The fur grew to cover her breasts, but not a hair grew on those black, pucker nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maya felt her body changing and with it did her ideas about being beautiful change as well. She hoped to be as something very different, and as much more animal than her being a human. As the perfume changed her body, it began doing something  in her crotch, as covering her privates with fur. Her legs then felt the waves of change, and as she gained an urge to hunch her stance, was when her tail bone sprouted, giving her a whisking six inch tail to keep the dust away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen what were her heels became as new and strong hocks, she watched her feet grow longer, narrowed, and toes became as black cloven hoofs. As then all her changing ceased, and Maya stood as still uprightly, she more a doe goat than a human girl. She remained enough as a girl with large breasts, and her petite, as fur covered hands and arms. What she was in her ideal essence was a female satyr, \"I am a Satyress!\" Maya tried to exclaim, only instead to here a goat bleat four times.</span></div></div>",

Hey, you walk as if those were hind legs like on a goat, your heels as in the hocks, and some stilts to extend your foot length to make those cloven hoofs to working, as if having fetlock joints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWild of a looker, your costume body fur, it covers you so nicely, while enhancing your body in an erotic fashion statement. The headpiece, as how it fits not showing any gaps; yet how did you tuck your hair under it..., or did you cut your hair?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tail, how neat as it wiggles when you take a step..., what was, it moved and you did not step a stride, how could your fake tail move on its own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya then moved, she turned where she stood, giving Aya a fuller realization that what she was, was not a costume but her real, as changed new self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya fell to kneeling, as she set looking up at how her sister Maya stood before her, as she, Aya was in aw of how Maya looked. \"You move so well, as not a wrinkle do I see, your body fur covers you so well, but what will you wear over you, your privates, they are in plain view?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya smirked a slight smile across her muzzle lips before she raised a leg, foot, and hooves to set upon her dressing desk chair. The move made of Maya as an offered view for her sister to see the furry lips to a then very goat form of a vulva. If her showing her sister how the fur set snug to her body, by becoming in part a goat, Maya gained the ability to make her nether lips to wink, animal fashion for attracting of buck goats to come close and mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"NO, no, that move is not possible...,</b> how did you learn to do that..., Maya, your changing into being, becoming a doe goat!\" Aya exclaimed, as she set looking and wondering about how it all felt to Maya. </span></div></div>",

Your body fur has encompassed most of your bodily self, with your head as not yet showing any signs of change.

Her two best friends sat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeinir was shorter than Aya, but she had a bit of an extra in the chest area and was cuter then her. She had short blonde hair, bright blue eyes, and wore a black vest with a white shirt underneath, blue jeans, and red shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya's other friend name was Wren.  She had long red hair, brown eyes, and wore a black shirt under a red sweater, black jeans, and blue shoes. Wren was taller then Aya but had bit of a smaller chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeinir was the nicest girl in the school and would do anything for her friends. Wren was the strongest girl in school and would always try to protect her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Aya, could you help me with my homework?\" Wren asks her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you. Just come over to my house and we'll hang out when we do our homework,\" Aya says with a smile as Meinir said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to see your sister, Aya. She's so cute,\" Meinir adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya smiled but then felt a bit strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back in a moment. I have to go the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she went inside the girls' bathroom, Aya splashed water on her face. She felt weird, even moreso than when she left for school in the morning. She looked up to the mirror and noticed that she was shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Aya whispered, noticing that her voice was higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya looked nervous as her body changed. Her breasts disappeared, as well as her long model-like legs, as she shrunk down to 6 years old, her clothes now baggy on her. Only her shirt still covered her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;I'm six again!&gt;&gt; Aya cried in her mind.</span></div></div>",

Aya stops to think and thought about the perfume that Maya brought back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya got some perfume. I smelled it and I got felt strange. The next thing I know, I'm a kid again!,\" Aya explains, adjusting her glasses as she does so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Let's just get help from your sis.

She undo her twin braided hair so it fell at the back of her chair. Fixing her glasses, she took out the one nearest to her which was history. She needed to research on her assigned figure on history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya! Could you please get my laptop? Its on my bed.\" Saya said turning to her younger sister, the youngest of the three, Maya. She left the stuff toys she was playing with and ran over to get Saya's laptop. She carried it back to Saya who took it with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Maya! You're a big help!\" Saya said as Maya smiled then ran back to her stuff toys. Saya adjusted her glass as she placed her laptop on her desk and powered it up. She began to search for the information she needed. Aya had already left for her job leaving Saya the duty of babysitting Maya till their parents got home. Unaware of the effects of Aya's perfume as its smell began to wear off and Saya was able to concentrate more on her homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya was wearing a white body fitting tanktop and volleyball shorts. Her body was made many girls in her school jealous of her. A hourglass figure of C-cups, small waist, slender thighs and nice butt. All adding to her metabolic rate made the boys want her more, the girls even more jealous of her. For freshman it wasn't likely to be seen a girl with her figure. Saya was so busy concentrating on her homework, she failed to notice her breasts were growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts slowly stretched her tank top as they filled the cups of her bra. Since her chest was underneath the table, she couldn't see them growing. Slowly but surely they were gaining heft. After she finished her 2nd assignment they had stopped growing. Saya pushed herself from the table to stretch her arms outward and thrust her chest forward. Her breasts visibly bigger but was dumbfounded by it. She adjusted her bra a bit as she looked at Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's grab a snack shall we?\" Saya said as Maya went to her. Saya held her hand as they went to their kitchen to fix a couple of sandwiches. Maya all the while looking at her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Maya?\" Saya asked as she bit her sandwich,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They look bigger.\" Maya said, staring at them. Saya looked down to see a bit of cleavage showing. She waved her hand at Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your just imaging things Maya. Boobs just don't grow that big so quickly.\" Saya giggled as they walked back to her room. It didn't take long for Saya to finish her homework. Saya looked at Maya to see her asleep in her bed. Saya yawned and placed her homework in her bag. Then she went to sleep with Maya who cuddled with her. Her head resting in between Saya's new D-cups. Saya awoke the next morning as their mother was cooking breakfast, The three sisters got dressed quickly for school. While running downstairs, Saya began to feel the added weight of her breasts but scoffed it off as she approached the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That new perfume you had really stinks. Who gave it to you?\" Saya asked while eating cereal with Aya and Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody gave it to me but I don't know who. Is it really that bad?' Aya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Smells like expired milk with mustard!\" Saya said sticking her tongue out in a stink gesture as did Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww. But its a shame to get rid of it. I'll just keep it as a souvenir from a customer.\" Aya said as Aya put their dishes in the sink.</span></div></div>",

I thought you'd were working late again!\" Aya said nervously. Aya's sweater covered her belly but the curve was as visible as the light of day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The owner let me off early. Said I shouldn't be overworking myself.\" Maya answered while eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya fridgeted in her seat. Since Maya couldn't see over the couch as Aya's back was against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Please don't come in front of me!</i>\" Aya thought over and over in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heard from Saya , you forgot to pick her up.\" Maya said in a serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry.. I had a lot of homework to do...\" Aya answered nervously once more. Sam moving in her wasn't making things easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird. That's so unlike you.\" Maya said in a puzzled tone. \"Just don't forget next time okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure...\" Aya answered while pulling her sweater in a futile attempt to hide her belly. She heard footsteps go back into the kitchen the sound of a plate hitting the sink and coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm. By the way, Maya. Did you see the perfume that was sitting here?\" Aya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I put it back in my room. You didn't go through my stuff doesn't you?\" Maya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! I saw it sitting on the table, near the front door! I remembered it was yours.\" Aya lied. She felt guilty about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya felt a pat on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They said it was a magical perfume but who believes in magic?\" Maya joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>You have no idea..</b>\" Aya mumbled.</span></div></div>",

Magical perfume.. So lame.\" Derek said in a mocking manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya slowly got up and the two began searching. Aya unaware that Derek was checking her out. Aya struggled since she couldn't bend over and Sam being active wasn't helping either as either hands was cradling or on top of her belly.

Aya struggled in doing so as she had to find new ways of bending over. Her clothes which were a white tube top with a plaided button shirt, jeans and shoes which her upper clothes struggled to hide her new form.</span></div></div>",

This wasn't supposed to happen!\" Aya yelled loudly as her belly and breasts began to shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya then felt her hips widen a bit, her thighs gained heft as did her butt. Hearing her pants stretch to accommodate them as she began to feel tight in her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Weird, I think it's shifting it's weight elsewhere. That's good.\" Aya said as she observed her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes, Aya began to noticed her belly and breasts stopped shrinking but were very large. She was confused a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well, it'll be easier for me to move around but hiding this...</i>\" Aya thought as she explored her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly still stood out of her clothes, more oval as her breasts which were near the size of her head before were more like F-cups. Her hips were on par with her shoulders now as the perfume gave her a more distinct hourglass body plus her large belly. Aya tried standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Aya yelled as she fell back on her bed. Startled that it was hard for her to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I feel lighter yet this is still heavy!</i>\" Aya thought in frustration.\"<i>Some help you were..</i>\" Aya said to the perfume that laid on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few attempts, Aya got up and slowly walked to her full lengthed mirror. As she rubbed her belly, she began to feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? It should be squishy... But this feels more firm and taught. It's like I'm pregnant.\" Aya said to herself as she laughed at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squealed when she felt something move in her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You're kidding me!</i>\" Aya thought nervously as she quickly took off her sweater hoodie that Sam had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely her clothes somewhat fit her body. Like she was like that before. Aya placed both hands on her belly. There she could feel something move about within her. She was in a bliss until she shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, it's just Sam as a slime not a..\" Aya said as she was caught off guard when she felt a strong kick on the left side of her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya quickly unbuttoned her blouse and lifted her tank-top to reveal a stretch free belly. She looked 40 weeks ready as she saw Sam poke about. She played wacko-mole a bit till she came to a conclusion. Aya pulled her tank-top over her belly and rebuttoned her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Great, the situation got even worse. The perfume made me pregnant with Sam!</i>\"Aya thought as she cradled her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I'll pick her up so you go rest.</b>\" Maya texted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya sighed in relief. She felt hungry so she slowly got up to the kitchen. She used an entire loaf of bread to make several sandwiches, using an assorted spreads. Took out a quart of milk and began eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya now found the pains of being pregnant. Her belly bumped into tables and furniture. She moved a lot slower than usual. Her breasts swayed at the slightest movement and she was hungrier than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her meal and placing her dishes in the dishwasher. Aya slowly went back into the living room and picked up her bag as well as the perfume. She struggled up the stairs and into her room, already exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought being pregnant would be this hard!\" Aya pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya took a bath and changed into more loose clothing. Aya was surprised to find all the clothes were stretchable  or maternity wear. She struggled with her undergarments as well as her tank top and shorts due to her large belly. Looking at herself in a full view mirror, she looked 36 weeks with twins. She slowly lowered herself on the bed as she rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I reverse this. I know perfumes wear off but when.\" Aya pondered. Thinking of the possibilities that could happen and if she were to spray herself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.. can't do that.

I guess I was lucky when I sprayed Sam and Sandy.\" Aya said as she looked at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well better to be unborn fetuses than to be an all devouring slime.\" Aya smiled as she said that. Luckily she didn't have homework. Aya placed the perfume on her bedside table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm sure those girls are going to do something to humiliate me at school.</i>\" Aya thought as she undid her blanket covering her body.

Why am I so heavy?</i>\" Aya thought as pushed with all her might so her back was against the bed. She reached out to her glasses with her left hand. She hurriedly put then on to see what was so heavy. Her eyes went wide as she looked down to see her breasts have grown significantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?!?\" She said to herself as she saw the expansive cleavage from her pajama. She cupped them underneath to assured herself that they were indeed hers. They were a bit wider than her chest but they didn't say a bit. She placed her right hand on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This can't be the perfume's doing. I didn't spray myself!</i>\" Aya thought as looked at her endowments. Was knocked back into reality when she heard Maya's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aya? You up yet? Breakfast is ready!\" Maya yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Be right there? Just need to take a bath!\" Aya yelled. Aya slowly got up. Mumbling to herself as her breasts swayed. She nearly fell toward as she arched her back to counter. Her back already aching as she noticed that she couldn't see her feet. She got into the bathroom and took her bath. As she was wrapped in a towel and was looking for clothes. She was surprised to find bras that fit her! Through her clothes remained somewhat unchanged. She quickled dried her hair with a blowdryer. She changed into her underwear. She choose to wear denim shorts that extended to cover her thighs and a sleeveless white sweater. She changed her hairstyle to a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's useless trying to hide these!\" Aya said to herslef looking at her new endowments. Blocking her thighs as she sat on her vanity stool. Her phone chimed. She struggled with her new balance to see it was from Maya saying she took Saya to school and they left already. Also told her not to be late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank gawd they're gone! I don't know how they'll react to me now!\" Aya said as she gathered her stuff and made her way downstairs. Annoyed by her new bounce as she used her arms to keep them in place. She ate breakfast now knowing the annoyances of her breasts getting in the way. She made sure she locked the door as she went to the bus stop. Soon enough she was at school where she met Cindy and Amanda, covering her new assests with her backpack as her friends looked at her confusingly as to why she was like that.</span></div></div>",

When she opened her locker, it was filled with letters and notes in which hee friends helped her throw in the trash bin. Walking around was hard since her breasts were so heavy and then bouncing despite her wearing a bra annoyed her even more. The stares were unnerving as well as the whispers. Aya was also startled that Cindy's and Amanda's breasts were about E-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Did the perfume changed them too?</i>\" Aya thought as they went about there day. It was soon lunch as the three friends bought what they wanted and went to their usual spot. Aya seemed to stack her tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. You're that hungry?\" Cindy asked as she bit into her tuna sandwich. Cindy was strawberry haried girl who was a bit shorter than Aya. Her hair was wavy and was slim till the perfume changed her body giving her boobs. She wore a plain white T-shirt with a red skirt and brown boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lugging those weights around are quite a chore.\" Amanda teased as Aya looked at her disapprovingly. Amanda had a salad. Amanda had short brown hair and was a bit on the chubby side. She wore purple blouse with denim skirt and low cut shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It's so weird. It's like everyone knew we were this well endowed. Did the perfume change reality too?</i>\" Aya thought as she opened her third hotdog sandwich. The lunch break continued with the three chanting as Aya began to wonder what happened to Jennica and her group. Aya went alone to the bathroom to freshen up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well. Fancy meeting you here boobzilla.\" Said a familiar voice as well as a group of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of all the days..\" Aya mumbled as she slowly turned to see Jennica and her group. Her jaw dropped at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennica and her group of 5 were flat chested! They still wore skimpy clothes and still had their boorish attitude just like with Amanda and Cindy who didn't change in personality either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Did the perfume steal their boobs and gave them to me, Cindy and Amanda?</i>\" Aya thought as she looked at her breasts which were the size of volleyballs then at Jennica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How odd to find you all alone. I haven't forgotten what you did yesterday.\" Jennica said angerily as she pushed Aya to the end of the bathroom. Aya was now surrounded by Jennica and her group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl.. That was the most awful smell ever. We had a hard time getting it off!\" Yelled Aubrey. A ditz if you ever saw one. Platinum blonde bimbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked smile crept upon Jennica's face as she said, \"Girls, what do we do to <b>those</b> who pick fights with us?\"  In a proud manner as they snicker. Aya gulped. Then she remembered she had the perfume in her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Good thing I still have the perfume with me. But if I spray them. Who knows what will happen to them. Still it's better then to be humiliated by them...</i>\" Aya pondered her options as she reached into her bag for the perfume in which she grasped tightly as the group came closer to her.</span></div></div>",

But she could see the streetlight shine from the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have I been a sleep.\" Aya said to herself. She saw her cellphone above her head. She check the clock and it read 9:00pm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya will be home soon. How am I going to explain what happen.\" Aya thought as she laid there for a few moments. She looked up once more to see the empty clothes of Wally and Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I wonder what happened to those two.</i>\" Aya thought. She pushed herself up only to be met with something heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gives? I didn't think I was this heavy!\" Aya said to herself as she struggled to get up. It was dark so she crawled her way to Saya's bed and with all her might, she was able to sit on it. The bed creaked and sank as she sat on it. She reached for the lamp and froze at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way... They can't be..in there...\" Aya stuttered as she now saw her belly even bigger than before! It was wider than her hips as she felt it's weight on it as well as her thighs. It covered more than half her thighs. Her bra unbelieveabley tight as her breasts grew even larger, stretching her T-shirt. Her T-shirt could only cover her bellybutton. She placed her right hand on her belly as looked at the perfume, sitting on the table. Only a small amount had been used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I can't believe this is happening. I'm pregnant with Saya and now Wendy and Wally.</i>\" Aya thought as she rubbed her belly. \"<i>Well at least I know they didn't go back into their mother. But now I'm in trench like trouble.</i>\" She thought. She slowly got up and waddled to her room, grunting at her new weight as she had trouble with balance. Her breasts jiggling and swaying as she reached her room and got dressed. She changed into a light gray long sleeved T-shirt that revealed some cleavage. She then slowly made her way to the kitchen and made herself dinner. After doing the dishes, she went back to her room and sat on the bed. Exhausted from what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a lot of work...\" Aya mumbled to herself. \" I hope you guys return to normal before Monday...\" Aya said a sshe stroked her belly. \"Not that don't enjoy this..as much.. It's still just wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her phone rang! Startling her, she fumbled with until she caught it and answered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Aya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, Maya. How are you guys doing?\" Maya said as she sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's fine... Sort of.. I'm babysitting some kids as well.\" Aya said nervously as she made circles around her belly, feeling them move from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's great but sorry. I have to work double shift. I won't be home till morning. Is it alright?\" Maya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! No! It's fine! I can take care of things!

Don't overwork yourself!\" Aya said cheerfully as Maya laughed and they hung up. Aya threw her phone near her pillow and cuddled up to it. Cradling her belly with her knees and left hand. She pulled her covers.

Her breasts followed soon after as they increased a cup size. Her butt and thighs grew a bit thicker as her hips widen a bit. Her shirt started to ride up her belly as a bit of under belly could be seen. Aya leaned on the counter, dazed at what had just occurred. Looking at her now, more pregnant form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things can't get any worse.\" Aya mumbled as she struggled to stand straight. Placing one hand on her back and the other beneath her belly.

Looking up she saw the ship's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">Aunt Milly's Magically Shop</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya slowly pushed the door as a bell chime was heard and slowly walked in. There were shelves of jars with things in them. On the both far sides of the store were shevles of books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Looks like the magic shops you see in movies and TV series.</i>\" Aya thought as she walked through the aisle. She cradled her belly with both hands as the scent of mint lingered through the air. It wasn't until she noticed the high counter where someone sat, reading an old time of sorts. Aya approached the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere she saw a teenager just like her sat. She had purple hair that was long with a pale complexion. She had red glasses, wearing black eye shadow and lipstick. She seemed to be chewing gum. She also had several silver rings on and piercings on her lower lip, left side of her nose, and both ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Typical goth girl.</i>\" Aya thought as she looked up at the girl who didn't seem to notice her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm.. Excuse me!\" Aya said in a polite manner as the girl turned her attention to her. She seemed rather surprised at Aya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Its not everyday you see a pregnant teen come in here. What are you looking for?\" Asked the girl. Aya pulled out the perfume and showed it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this is from your shop? It was a gift from to my sister.\" Aya explained as the girl squinted as she adjusted her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A perfume? No we don't sell any of that.\" The girl said as she sat back into her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. Maybe you can help me find out where it came from.\" Aya said in a polite manner. Trying to fight her eagerness for answers. The girls sighed as she stood off her chair and walked towards a door in which she opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in.\" The girl said as Aya walked in. Aya followed the girl to a back room. It looked like a fortune telling room except without the crystal ball in the middle. There stood an old woman in her 60's wearing a red turban with a crescent moon and a long red Egyptian dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats seems to be the problem, Nadia?\" Asked the old woman. Aya handed Nadia the perfume in which Nadia handed it to the old lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pregnant girl wants to know where this came from, Grandma.\" Said Nadia. The old lady examined the perfume as she looked at Aya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how did you get this?\" The old lady asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.. I'll tell you...\" Aya said nervously as she began her story. Nadia was in disbelief but the old lady seemed serious. Aya took a deep breath as she continued her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old lady began to speak, \"Well this explains how you got pregnant. This here is called the Perfume of Change. I didn't think it exist till now.\" Aya and Nadia stared in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfume of Change? What do you mean?\" Aya said cuiorusly as she placed her hands on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to put it simply. Whoever sprays the perfume, changes the person who used it. Let's say those two in you wanted to become your babies.\" The old woman said, pointing to her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's absurd! Grandma, there's no way a perfume could do that. Spells and potions? Maybe but perfumes? Yeah right!\" Nadia scoffed. Aya was a bit taken back by Nadia's sudden out burst. The grandmother stroked her temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Nadia? Would you like to spray yourself?\" The grandmother said. Giving her the perfume to Nadia. Nadia took and looked at it nervously.</span></div></div>",

She just lived down the street as Aya walked her way there. She was allowed to sleep over as the project needed to be done by Monday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya wore her usual glasses but kept her hair untied. She wore a red plaided long sleeved blouse which had her white tank top underneath, skinny denim jeans and flip flops. She had a backpack, hoisted over her left shoulder as she texted her friend she was nearby. With the perfume in tow of course. Maya had the day off so Saya was spending time with the eldest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya finally reached her friend's house. A two-storey house similar to Aya's. She rung the doorbell and found her friend answering the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,Aya!\" Her friend said as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here!\" Aya said as she smiled as well. She followed her friend inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Charity. They've known each other since middle school but were now classmates. She was a brunette who stood 5'2 and was chubby. She had short hair that extended to her chin. She had a simple red t-shirt and shorts on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started on working on the project in the living room. Charity told her about her family. She had two older brothers, both married but come to visit every now and then. Her parents were out on a date, leaving her with some money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA 2 hours later.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharito was walking in with a plate of cookies and quart of milk with two cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing that's over with!\" Aya said as she stretched causing her blouse to creak in protest with her enlarged chest. She saw Charity looking at her in amazment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Aya asked in a confused tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It surprises me that you grew boobs that big. What's your secret?\" Charity asked as she sat next to Aya as they ate the cookies and drank the milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll tell you.\" Aya smiled as she cleared her hands off crumbs. She grabbed her backpack and opened it then pulled out the perfume and placed it on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's thanks to that!\" Aya said as she pointed at the perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like an ordinary perfume.\" Charity said confusingly as she picked it up and examined it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, put when I tested it out on myself. It made my breasts grow a cup size.\" Aya said as she strut her chest out. Charity looked at hers, a sub-par b cup at best. She was having doubts about Aya's story but having some boobs would be a confidence booster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sister got it from a gift from a customer. Said it was the <b>perfume of change.</b>\" Aya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfume of change, huh? So it changed you giving you a cup size.\" Charity said in a curious manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I don't know what else it does. It might affect different people differently. Mind you, it has a horrible smell though.\" Aya said in a relaxed as she leaned on the sofa. Charity began to think on what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's hard getting used to this size.\" Aya said as she put the dryer down and lifted her breasts with both hands. Each breasts visibly bigger than her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>She has to be in between G and H cups by now! She's so lucky!</i>\" Charity thought even more envious as she hugged her pillow and biting into it. \"All thanks to the perfume, I presume?\" Charity said teasingly as she watched Aya sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well. I didn't want my boobs THIS big. Its starting to strain my shoulders and hurt my back.\" Aya said as she rubbed her shoulders. When she stretched, it caused one of the top buttons to pop off startling the two as it bounced around a bit. A small amount of cleavage now seen as Aya pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you need new clothes now!\" Charity teased once more, sticking her tongue out at Aya in a teasing manner as she saw a disgruntled look on Aya's face as she got up and walked towards the large bed they were sleeping together in. Charity watched Aya's melon sized breasts, nearly as wide as her chest, bounce as she walked towards the bed and as she sat an email down, pulling the sheets over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Charity!\" Aya said as she yawned and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Aya!\" Charity said as she clapped her hands and thus the light in her room turned off. Though she noticed Aya was already fast asleep, she couldn't help think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I can't believe she grew from a D cup to those! She's so lucky though she seemed agitaed by them.</i>\" Charity thought as she turned to see Aya, asleep on her back. She could see the outline of Aya's chest underneath the blanket as she breathed. Charity sighed...</span></div></div>",

As the night went on, one by one the buttons on her pajama blouse popped off leaving the two bottom ones intact. The sounds were muffled by the thick blanket they slept with as Aya groaned and shifted to her left side, her back turned at Charity. Aya's breasts steadily grew during the night as they slept on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was morning as Charity yawned and stretched. She looked at her clock as it read 7:00 am. She rubbed the sand off her eyes as she looked to see Aya was already up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Sundays! Which is why I never set the alarm.\" Charity said as she got up. She saw Aya's pajama neatly folded near her back pack and saw a wet towel meaning she had already taken her bath. Charity soon stripped herself and took a warm bath. After drying her hair, she put on a simple T-shirt and shorts as the last her glasses as she kept her hair down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I wonder how Aya is handling her breasts. Wish that happen to me.</i>\". Charity thought as she looked down at her washboard chest. Measuring her bust to Aya's. She made her way downstairs for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered the kitchen, she saw Aya sitting on a stool with coffee and a toast on a plate. She seemed to be reading a book, unaware that Charity had entered the kitchen. Charity saw Aya wear a body fitting T-shirt that was blue sleeved and white. The sleeves stretched to just past her elbows. Along with denim shorts that were knee-lengthed and flip flops. Aya kept her hair down as she adjust her glasses a bit, her forearms bumping into her breasts. Charity eyes went wide as saucers as she saw Aya's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Holy Crap! She grew even bigger!</i>\"Charity shouted in her head as she saw the curve of Aya's chest in her shirt. She could see Aya was wearing a sports bra as the outline was visible. Aya's breasts literally sat on the table as Aya was reading with her arms extended forward. Charity found Aya's reading position quite awkward if not comical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Geez! Those are huge! I bet her back hurts worse now than if did yesterday.\"</i> Charity thought as she saw Aya arch her back a bit causing her T-shirt to groan. \"<i>If I'm right l, her boobs are about the size of...</i>\"</span></div></div>",

Charity took out some milk from the fridge and cereal from one of the cupboards placing it on the table. Aya seemed to have some earbuds on totally oblivious that Charity was there. Charity then took a bowl and poured milk and cereal into the bowl. Grabbing a spoon she began to eat as Aya took notice of Charity and took off her ear buds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? You just woke up?\" Aya said as she placed a bookmark on a page she was reading then closed her book. She placed it aside as she began to eat her toast, squishing her boobs once more making Charity both envious and happy at what she's witnessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was surprised you woke up earlier than me especially on a Sunday.\" said Charity as she ate her breakfast. Aya was finishing her toast as they talked about their assignments that they finished. Aya didn't notice Charity's eyes darting back and forth between her breasts and face. Charity could see them sway with the slightest movement. It didn't take long for breakfast to finish as they moved into the living room. Charity turned on the TV for the morning cartoons. Aya sat on the sofa with Charity. Charity was just itching to ask the question so she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Aya?\" Charity asked nervously as Aya turned to her, adjusting her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what is it?\" Aya asked with an imaginary question mark appearing above her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it hard to handle those?\" Charity said as her eyes directed to Aya's breasts. Aya looked down at them and shrugged causing them to bounce a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A day at a time, Charity. I thought we talked about this?\" Aya answered with a tone of confusion. Charity looked at her the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Wait.. What? I've only mention this yesterday and now.. How?!?</i>\" Charity thought as her mind trailed off and thus remembering the perfume. \"<i>It must be the perfumes doing! It altered reality believing she was always like that.... But to test first.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forget... Just how long have you had those?\" Charity asked, gesturing Aya's breasts. Aya hefted them in front of Charity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just grew into this from a D cup in one summer. I was surprised I grew so fast!\" Aya said with a depressed tone. It seemed she didn't want them BIG.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Macromastia?\" Charity asked as she hugged a coach pilllow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that.. I haven't visited the specialist to see if I'm still growing. If I'm still growing then it would cause problems.\" Aya frowned as she crossed her arms beneath her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'd bet you'd grow even larger if someone sprayed you with the perfume again</i>.\" Charity thought as she smiled a bit. Aya had a slim body with outrageous boobs like those fitness models she sees on the net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're used to them?\" Charity asked again in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, some back and shoulder exercises but the bounce is what annoys me and whatever I wear, cleavage alert!\" Aya said as Charity laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's the price to pay for a rack like that.\" Charity said making Aya laugh as well causing her breasts to bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get me started with bras.\" Aya said in an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must mean airbags or parachutes.\" Charity said as she laughed louder, Aya looked at her and shook her head. The joking continued for a bit till they calmed down. It was around gen in the morning when Maya came to pick up Aya. The two friends hugged in an awkward way with Charity teasing how soft they were. Maya laughed as Aya made a distraught face. Soon enough Aya was back at home with Saya who immediately slammed her face into Aya's chest. Aya shaking her head as she hugged her little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a month since Charity had sprayed Aya thus giving her unbelievably large breasts. Charity still couldn't believe that the perfume had changed reality that Aya had grown into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring school, Aya would do her best to conceal them. Though it never worked as the curve of her breasts could be seen and most of the t-shirts, sweater, whatever upper garment did little to cover them. They always stuck out which annoyed Aya but Charity seemed to enjoy it, not that she's that type of girl. She was the cause of all this due to her experimenting on Aya in the 1st place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity also saw that Aya had a hard time bending over. Quite comical as she would almost fall on her hands and knees. Kneeling to pick something up caused her knees to bump into her breasts. Aya's breasts pretty much sat on the science table during science class. Aya always sat on the bleachers during PE sinc she always did her exercises at home. Aya also had a hard time writing due to her new position. Aya couldn't see her stomach or feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most annoying part for Aya as Charity saw was the attention she got. Mean words such as a cow, boobzilla, boys mooing, occasionally getting bumped to see them sway (which Charity did often but claiming it was an accident.), being called implants or fakes. At least Charity was there for her along with Cindy and Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Friday evening as Charity was over at Aya's house for a sleepover. They were doing their assignments as Charity took repeated leaks at Aya. Aya had worn a body fitting t-shirt that was blue and black jogging pants. The outline of her two bras seen through the right fitting clothes and swayed at the slightest movement as Aya either typed or writ something on paper. Aya kept her hair long during periods at home. Saya who was with them was watching TV, hugging her stuffed animal. They just about finished their work as they stretched. Charity watched Aya's shirt stretch with stretching noises as Aya out her arms back at her sides causing them to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been through a lot since having those.\" Charity said, pointing to Aya's endowments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's either you love them or hate them. I've gotten used to it.\" Aya sighed as she leaned on the sofa, crossing her arms beneath her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So which?\" Asked Charity curiously as she sat across from Aya. Adjusting her glasses as she waited for Aya to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither. Saya loves using them as a pillow, Maya teases about them and they seem okay though I'd wish they were a bit smaller.\" Aya answered looking down on her breasts. Lifting them a bit as she got a small view of cleavage from beneath the neckline of her t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How heavy are they?\" Charity asked, intrigued that she got Aya to talk about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Never weighed them.\" Aya answered with tone of annoyance. \"4lbs maybe?\" Aya hefted them once more causing them to bounce again as she released them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Same weight as a bag of sugar. Didn't think they were that heavy. Thanks to the perfume though it seems that her body had gotten used to them.</i>\" Charity thought as she observed Aya throughout the month. Aya grabbed the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's for dinner? I'm ordering take out.\" Aya said with the phone ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PIZZA!\" Charity and Saya yelled as the three laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're paying the delivery guy, Charity. I'm not confronting them.\" Aya said seriously. Charity sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay!\" Charity said, defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPizza arrived as Charity went to the door to pay the guy. The ate it while watching TV as something came to mind for Charity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, Aya. Where's the perfume? The one your older sister Maya got from an unknown customer.\" Charity asked while looking at Aya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's in Maya's room. Why? Thinking of experimenting again?\" Aya answers giving Charity a stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wondering! Like it did anything wrong!!\" Charity answered in defence while holding both hands up. Aya shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they were in their sleeping attire. Saya slept with them wearing a long white dress. Aya wore her white tank top with shorts, it showed a lot of cleavage. Charity wore a red checkered pajama. It didn't take long for the lights to be turned off. Aya and Saya slept together as Saya somewhat buried her head in Aya's cleavage. Charity slept in her sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was past 1 in the morning when Charity slowly got up. She saw Aya and Saya fast asleep as she got up and went downstairs to drink a glass of water. She went back upstairs as she passed Maya's room. There she saw it was slightly opened as she peeked in. She saw Maya asleep in her bed and on the vanity table, sat the perfume of change. Charity slowly crept into the room and swiped the perfume and slowly went outside to the hallway. She grasped the perfume with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it's still here. I'd thought they'd gotten rid of it due to the bad smell.\" Charity quietly murmured to herself. Examining the perfumez she began to search her mental notes for the perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see. It seems the sprayer of the perfume is immune to whatever the effects the perfume does. Well I hope.\" Charity said to herself. \"But who to test it on?\"</span></div></div>",

Stairs..\" Aya mumbled. One step at a time, she slowly making her way downstairs. Holding on to the railing while annoyed of her belly constantly bumping into the railing.

The two looked at each other and thus the three began watching as if nothing ever happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie, they cleaned up their mess, did the dishes with the help of Georgia. Aya and Charity placed their assignments away as the two git ready for bed. Charity enjoying watching Aya's chest sway and bounce with a bountiful of cleavage showing. Aya unaware of what was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity's room was medium sized with a large Queen sized bed and two lamp tables with lamps. It had a drawer, closet, bathroom, PC and study desk. Their school stuff on the study desk with the perfume of change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two got ready for bed as Aya stretched, undid her twin braids and placed her glasses on the lamp table beside her. Charity placed her glasses on her lamp table. Charity looked at Aya as Aya got tucked into bed. Then Charity slowly tucked herself into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night Aya.\" Charity said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood night, Charity.\" Aya said as the two turned off the lights and soon were fast asleep. Unaware the smell of the perfume lingered into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was midnight as the changes occurred. Both were fast asleep as the the perfume's smell covered the room. Aya and Charity slept with their backs turned against each other. Aya fridgeted in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya's body began to change. Her belly groaning as it began to grow, slowy passing the months. When it reached 6 months, her butt and thighs began to thicken as her hips popped and grew a bit wider. Her breasts gained a full cup size as the bed creaked with her weight gain. Slowly going to full term with one, it was then only her belly growing. It slowly grew to full term with triplets as her breasts gained another cup size. The bed creaked and leaned a bit towards Aya as she sank into the mattress. The perfume had also changed her clothes to fit her. The night went on as the two were fast asleep, unaware of what had happened.</span></div></div>",

Both not noticing Aya turning red even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna take a bath.\" Charity said but was ignored by the two who were in awe at Aya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity went upstairs to her room and stripped. Took a long bath and changed into a similar get-up as Sandra. She finished drying her hair and as she exited. She saw Aya, sitting on her bed with her arms crossed beneath her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least we now know what happened to Georgia's pregnancy.\" Charity said. A distraught Aya only sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just how far was Georgia into her pregnancy?\" Aya asked as she placed her hands on her belly. Movement visible from Charity's POV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I remember correctly, she was supposed to go to the hospital soon. Do you feel any symptoms of giving birth?\" Charity asked nervously as she waited for Aya's answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Though they move a lot. Georgia asked if I felt anything drop to my pelvis and I answered no. It's just really heavy.\" Aya answers as she looked at her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thats good. It would be chaos if that'd happen.\" Charity sighed in relief. \"But you might right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya couldn't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was surprised when I woke up like this. Never thought this would happen. I guess the possibilities are endless with the perfume.\" Aya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe if you sprayed yourself again..\" Charity but was cut off by Aya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Who knows what will happen next! I hid it for the time being. We need to figure out how to reverse this.\" Aya said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity was split on her thoughts of it. Aya had a point but the perfume could revert things back to normal. If not something worse might happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well perfumes wear off right?\" Charity asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But my boobs didn't shrink and I hope I don't get stuck like this.\" Aya said in a worried tone. \"Let's just play along for the time being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity agreed. Soon they had dinner and discovered some changes that had occurred thanks to the perfume. They already know everyone thought of Aya as pregnant. Which was a safe note for Aya as she didn't have to explain how she suddenly got pregnant. It was time for bed as Charity changed into a pajama while Aya wore a sweater dress with shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It so weird.\" Aya said as Charity looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is?\" Charity asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This whole scenario. Not only did change everyone's perspective of me. But my clothes as well.\" Aya answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Charity said in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, not only that. But my body seems used to this. Though my mind isn't.\" Aya said. She rubbed her belly. She soon laid down next to Charity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least were not in that much trouble then we thought we would be.\" Charity said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Aya said. They said their good night's and turned off the lights to get some sleep.</span></div></div>",

Neither Aya nor Charity were expecting the results or the changes that had occurred with it. So they agreed to go along with it for the time being while they try to reverse this. They had also had hoped that the perfume would eventually wear off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring school, Aya got more attention than she wanted. People were nicer but most were interested in her pregnancy. It was bizarre to both of them that Aya could still go to school in her state. Of course, Charity,Amanda and Cindy were there to help Aya out when needed. Aya couldn't do any P.E. since the teacher's were afraid that she might give birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Friday evening. Day one of their winter semestral break. Charity decided to sleep over at Aya's place. Maya was at work while Aya had to babysit Saya as Charity would help Aya with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity had just finished changing into a pajama as she exited Aya's bathroom. Aya had worn her usual white tank top with shorts. Aya sat on her bed with her hair down with one hand on her belly and the other on the bed. Saya was fast asleep in a long dress, hugging her stuffed animal.Charity could see the cleavage from any angle she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anything new that the perfume did?\" Charity  asked. She sat on the study chair in Aya's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing really new since then. Besides my wardrobe changing to fit me, everyone's perspective including my family that I'm pregnant, there's just one thing that has bother me these past two months.\" Aya answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is it?\" Charity asked as she was curious. Aya gestured her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's this right here. My belly hasn't grown at all.\" Aya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is weird. Well Georgia was ready to give birth before we sprayed her.\" Charity said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I got the feeling that the perfume put me on a loop. And what's worse I feel like I'm gonna be stick like this.\" Aya said in a down tone. Drawing circles with her right hand on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did the obygyne say?\" Charity asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's even more strange. The doctor couldn't figure out my due date. Just said my babies are healthy and I should be all right when the time comes which hasn't.\" Aya answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creepy. Your belly doesn't have any stretch marks or veins which should be on an ordinary pregnancy.\" Charity noted, pointing at Aya's belly. \"It's like it plugged Georgia's pregnancy to you. You didn't want to give birth right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That too. The skin is also my skin tone. But I could feel and see them move like it was ordinary.\" Aya added. \"It's not that I haven't gotten used to it. It just isn't right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then test the perfume! Maybe it will set things straight.\" Charity said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. We didn't know it would do this.\" Aya said as she rubbed her belly.\" We don't know what it'll do next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a point. But unless you wanna be stuck like that, your gonna have to take a chance.\" Charity said. Charity left her seat and slowly entered her sleeping bag. They said their good nights and turned off the lights. Aya slowly maneuvered herself in and tucked herself near Saya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>She has a point. Not that I don't enjoy this and I've gotten used to it.</i>\" Aya pondered.</span></div></div>",

She quietly went back to Aya's room and slowly closed the door. Charity saw Aya's body out of her blanket. She moaned as she rubbed her belly.

It's heavy. My back hurts! My knees and ankles are sore. I'm also waddling you know?\" Charity said as she slowly made her way to her bed. Aya was already in bed as Charity struggled to get in.

One hand on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.. Oh yeah! Um..due to an accident that made you a surrogate right?\" Charity said. She nervously smiled.

Sorry.\" Aya answers while scratching her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I understand so I need to catch up with Charity's mom since she went grocery. You'll have the house to yourselves. We'll be home before lunch!\" Sandra said. She took a brown shoulder bag and exited the house, locking it as she left. The two sighed in relief once more. Charity angerily hit Aya on the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You crazy? You know how much I hate lying!\" Poured Charity as she saw Aya rubbing her left arm with a look of disconcern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That hurt. Well can you explain how I got this?\" Aya answers pointing to her belly. Charity blushed red a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I sprayed myself last night, hoping everything would go back to normal. I guess it didn't.\" Charity said as she laughed nervously. Aya placed her right hand on her forehead while placing her right elbow on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we all can hope. I was thinking the same thing but at the same time the possibilities of some other change.\" Aya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do in the meantime? We could spray you again with the perfume and hopefully everything goes back to normal.\" Charity said as she hoped to give reassurance to Aya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if it doesn't? We dig a deeper grave than we're in just so you know.\" Aya answered. \"It's risky and we don't know unless we try but who knows what will happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Better than doing nothing. I mean you don't wanna give birth now don't you? You are carrying my niece or nephews in you.\" Charity said. Placing her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know that! No need to rub it in. I wouldn't mind carrying them around til we figure something out.\" Aya said as she continued to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats why we need to test the perfume again!\" Charity answered. Aya looked at Charity since she seemed so enthused with using it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>She has a point. I'm thinking she's enjoying experimenting the perfume to see all the possibilities that can happen.</i>\" Aya thought. She was in conflict on what to do.

Maybe the perfume takes longer to wear off then we thought?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity yawned and rubbed her eyes, finally opening them and realizing that she was quite noticeably bigger now then she recalled when she went to bed. She covered her mouth in shock, muffling the scream that was about to escape her mouth. \"W-what's going on. Sandra  wasn't this big! Aya, what's going on... aya?\" It was at this point that Charity realized she was alone in her room. 'Did Aya spray herself last night?' Was her first fear fulled thought. She had to find out! The teen groaned as she struggled to move herself, trying to get her feet off the bed was a chore. And she was making no progress!</span></div></div>",

Bleh!\" Charity said mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy's pregnancy quickly deflated and was soon enough an infant. Charity then picked up the baby, Nancy and cradled her as she made baby noises. Nancy soon reached the stage of new born and then soon enough vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So long, Nancy. It been nice knowing ya. Hope in your new life, you wouldn't be such a snob.\" Charity said mockingly.

No need for mood swings!\" Charity said taking an voluntary step back as Aya struggled to keep balance. Aya felt guilty.

Placing both hands on her belly,  movement visible as she rubbed the spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm gonna make us a snack. Be right back okay?\" Charity said. She exited the room as Aya struggled to turn on the PC. She was having a hard time leaning or bending over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled herself to the desktop. Pushing the keyboard a bit to make room for her breasts to rest. Her belly hidden underneath the table as she began to use the PC. She put on the headphones that were hanging and began listen to music while surfing. The smell of the perfume still lingering as the changes were taking place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly groaned as it began to move forward. Slowing gaining girth and minimizing the space between the table and her belly. Aya adjusted herself on her chair, feeling her breasts sway and adjusted her glasses. Unaware that the changes were occurring. Her belly slowly grew to its size, making her heavier and heavier. Her thighs grew a bit as well as her butt. The chair continued to creak at her gaining mass, the music Aya was listening too drowning any noise her body or clothes made during her growth. Her breasts then joined in. Her right elbow on the desk, her right hand on her chin for support while her left hand was on the mouse. Slowly her breasts began to cover the table, gaining tissue, fat and mlik from Nancy's pregnancy passing on to her. As the growth stopped, a blink of an eye, Aya's clothes fit her making her forget the feeling of discomfort she felt a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly now nearly covered her lap, overlapping them and we're wider than her shoulders. Her breasts were nearing the size of her head, kept intact by her bra, blouse and vest.</span></div></div>",

How will we convince our parents that our 8 year old sister has magically turned into a young woman?\" Aya brought up the two biggest concerns they had.  Her older sister Maya unfortunately didn't have an answer to that question.  Nor did her now oldest sister Saya.  Though Saya had something to say none the less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, our parents are still on their business trip for another week, so we have plenty of time to come up with someway to fix this..\" Saya said, before adding, \"or....\"<br>\r\nBoth Maya and Aya were curious as to what their formerly little sister was about to suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could start living as a grown up alongside Maya\" Saya innocently suggested with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saya it's not that si-\" before Maya could finish, Saya interrupted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last I checked, I'm the oldest here now, so that makes me the boss\" Saya firmly said to her younger sisters, Maya not looking that pleased with the prospect<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu-\" Maya's mouth was shut closed by Saya's hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts lil' sis\" Saya said, \"lil sis\" clearly annoying Maya and Aya alike - however knowing how stubborn Saya was, Maya and Aya realized that they had no real choice but to recognize Saya's newfound authority as their big sister (for the time being).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are we going to tell your school then Saya, and what will you be doing in the meantime?\" Aya pointed out, \"It's not like you have a driver's license or anything to allow you to do much as a grown up\".   Maya agreed.  Much to the two's surprise however, Saya responded with a rather reasonable response<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well do you know who gave you the perfume Maya?\" Saya asked, which was then Maya pulled out a business card given to her by the customer who had left her the perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first Maya can just call the school saying that I am sick and can't attend class.  And then we can call the owner of the perfume and see if we can drive up there to meet up with them.  That way we can learn about how the perfume works and what we can do about this\" Saya explained her plan.  Maya and Aya had to admit that this was a surprisingly well-planned out for coming from their formerly little sister.  Not that Saya wasn't smart, but the fact remained that she was an 8 year old girl stuck in the body of a 24 year old woman.  However Maya wondered if there was even a guarantee that the mysterious owner of the perfume would remember her or answer any random call.<br>\r\nDoes she go along with Saya's plan or suggest something else to her big sister?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">18 year-old Maya comes home from work one day from her job as a waitress exhausted and tired, heading back to the house she takes care of while her parents are away during long periods of work. What she doesn't know, though, is that she is also carrying in her purse a little bottle of perfume given to her by one of the people she waited on. She was told that whoever smells it would change before their eyes. Maya, not believing in that sort of stuff, leaves it on the top of her bureau in her bedroom. Will Maya eventually check it out again, or will one of her little sisters stumble onto it instead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBios of the three sisters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Maya<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nHeight: 4'11\"<br>\r\nHair color/length: Short, brown<br>\r\nEye color: Brown<br>\r\nDescription: A short, slight clumsy girl who works as a waitress to pay her way through college. She's always smiling and willing to help others, though she resents her tiny, flat body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReference pic: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tsuyoshi-kun.deviantart.com/art/Waitress-commission-by-F-AYN-T-142494525\" target=\"_blank\">http://tsuyoshi-kun.deviantart.com/art/Waitress-commission-by-F-AYN-T-142494525</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Aya<br>\r\nAge: 15<br>\r\nHeight: 5'6\"<br>\r\nHair color/length: Long, black in twin braids<br>\r\nEye color: Green<br>\r\nDescription: A tall, pretty, popular girl in her first year of high school, Aya also gets really good grades. She wishes for a boyfriend, but wants one that's interested in her mind and not in her curvy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReference pic: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tsuyoshi-kun.deviantart.com/art/Waitress-little-sister-comm-151302505\" target=\"_blank\">http://tsuyoshi-kun.deviantart.com/art/Waitress-little-sister-comm-151302505</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Saya<br>\r\nAget: 8<br>\r\nHeight: 3'10\"<br>\r\nHair color/length: Dirty blonde, down to the middle of her back<br>\r\nEye color: Blue<br>\r\nDescription: A petite, adorable little girl, Saya is the youngest sibling in her family. She wears a big ribbon in her hair, a gift that Aya gave to her when she was 5. She also carries around with her a stuffed animal, a gift from her oldest sister Maya. She loves her sisters very much, but is shy around other kids her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReference pic: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tsuyoshi-kun.deviantart.com/art/Waitress-baby-sis-commission-151302833\" target=\"_blank\">http://tsuyoshi-kun.deviantart.com/art/Waitress-baby-sis-commission-151302833</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) No sexual scenes/nudity for the sisters aside from Maya, as the other two are under 18. (Yes, this means even if the other two sisters are age progressed, you can't do this.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) No killing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) No \"other choice\" option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) No giantesses, as it's been done to death already. (Mini-giantess is fine.) If you want them to grow, stick to the \"getting older\" option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.) This story is written in the first person. If I see ANY contributions that start with, \"You walk into blah blah blah\", I will edit them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6..) All entries must be at least a paragraph long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, have fun!</td>",
