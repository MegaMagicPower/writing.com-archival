She was in her home country of Orb, and looked down at her surrondings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 1000 feet tall, none of the buildings made it past her knees. The people looked positivley ant-sized compared to her. Dressed in her Orb officer uniform, with her long blonde hair flowing freely, and her bare feet planted firmly on the ground, Cagali was causing quite a stir among the people below. They looked up at her towering, monothilic-like figure and some were frightened. Others didn't believe the beloved daughter of Orb would hurt them, no matter how big she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunatley for them, whatever was in that strange mushroom Cagali had eaten didn't just make her grow. It also gave her new desires, new thoughts and feelings she never knew were there. As she looked down at the tiny Orb city and its ant-like inhabitants, Cagali became overcome with the desire to test her incredible power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an evil smirk on her face, Cagali slowly raised her gigantic right foot upwards. The people below began panicking and running for their lives, but given how unbelievably huge Cagali had become, it was no use. She slowly brought her foot down, still grinning, as buildings were crushed underneath the monolithic foot, then slowly people as well. Her huge toes even crushed multiple people at a time, her big toe coming down hard on an entire car full of people before settling into the ground, cracking the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagali couldn't help but laugh at her incredible display of power. With just one step, she had flattened tons of people! She was the most powerful thing ever known, and she loved it. The Gundams themselves bowed before her now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the Gundams, her Coordinator boyfriend Athrun watched from the royal palace in shock. Able to get a view of his huge girlfriend's backside from the palace and nothing more, Athrun rushed from the room, knowing what he had to do.</span></div></div>",

Athrun moaned a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our inihibitons have been removed, Athrun.\" Cagali said as she continued to rub his chest with her hand. \"I can feel it, and I'm sure you can too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sexy smirk, she moved her hand.....downwards. A shocked Athrun caught her at the pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cagali!\" he yelled, more than a little embarassed. After all, they were a thousand feet tall- everyone could see them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled sexily, locking eyes with the giant. It was new to her, being the same height as Athrun, and she thought it was nice. Suddenly, she pushed backwards on his chest, knocking his massive body to the ground and crushing the castle. Athrun barely felt it as he looked upwards at her as she leaned over and onto him, smiling at him. Finally, gazing up at his gigantic girlfriend, Athrun smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's more like it.\" Cagali said as she leaned over and kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny people below reacted with fear and shock as they watched the two unbelievably huge giants kiss and grope each other so high above. Finally ending their sexy embrace, Cagali pulled backwards, leaning over him and panting, and suddenly shot a glare towards the tiny crowd that had gathered below Athrun's flowing hair. Athrun turned and saw what Cagali was looking at, and smirked at the tiny people, scaring them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the people knew what was happening, Cagali brought her huge left hand down to the earth and scooped up the entire crowd in her palm. At least fifty people were now held in her huge hand, and she quickly dumped the ant-sized people down onto the chest of her giant boyfriend. The two giants smirked as they watched the panicked people run around on his massive chest like ants whose anthill had just been flattened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people were panicking- above them, they saw Cagali's smirking face and her heaving breasts, as well as Athrun's smiling face as well. Below them was Athrun's rock-hard chest and stomach, the ground seemingly vibrating with each breath the giant took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the little people, Athrun.\" Cagali said, amused. \"I think they're scared of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're so insignificant.\" Athrun remarked, brushing some of his long purple hair out of his eyes. \"I think they should start bowing to us if they want to live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the tiny people began bowing, but most of the confused and scared captives simply continued running around like chickens with their heads cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagali's expression suddenly changed from amusement to anger. She lowered two of her massive fingers towards Athrun's chest and managed to grab one of the ant-like people (one of the ones not bowing, of course) between them, holding him there. He cowered between the massive fingers, before Cagali simply brought her fingers together, squashing him easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better listen to my boyfriend, because you're starting to make me mad!\" Cagali roared as she wiped her fingers clean on Athrun's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not nice when she's mad, is she?\" Athrun taunted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them quickly began bowing, but that wasn't good enough for Cagali.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ON YOUR KNEES!\" Cagali roared, the force of her voice even knocking a few of the people over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, all of the tiny people dropped to their knees and continued bowing to Athrun, which caused his smirk to widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really know how to take charge of things, Cagali.\" Athrun said as he moved his right hand upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am......ooooh.\" she began, but was cut off by Athrun's hand groping her left breast, and began moaning. \"Athrun.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny people who chose to risk looking up as they continued to bow towards Athrun got quite the show, as Athrun massaged her breast through the fabric and she moaned in pleasure. Suddenly, Athrun stopped, and that didn't please Cagali.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you stop?\" the giantess whined as he pulled his hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cagali, look...\" Athrun said, pointing towards something off in the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess turned her head around to see.....</span></div></div>",

With an air of obvious superiority she looked down at the ground far below. \"And what do we have here?\" thundered the giant woman.<br>\r\nThe two teenage giants and the ace mobile suit pilot stood in awe. Murrue's size was incredible and only served to further accent her stunning body which was eye-catching enough at normal size. There was no doubt the tables had turned. \"I suggest you let the 'Gundam' and it's pilot go\" spoke Murrue, her booming voice both exhilarating and terrifying at the same time. Cagalli gritted her teeth \"Who the hell do you think you are, giving orders to me?! I don't care how big you are you'll pay for this! ATHRUN!\" At the call of his name, Athrun sped towards the titanic Murrue. It was in defiance of his usual character but that clearly wasn't present right now. For her part, Murrue watched the charging boy with a smile on her face. As he neared her mammoth toe, the Archangel captain pulled a small thin glass container from her cuff. It housed an odd, dark green liquid. Removing the lid from the container she quickly poured it's mysterious contents over the raging Zala boy. Athrun's response was one of shock- confused as to what exactly had hit him he froze. The mystery did not last long as Athrun quickly dwindled back down to his normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to normal, Athrun sat in a crater which had once been a footprint \"Wh...where I am? What's happening?\" The growth now over, Athrun's true personality began to re-emerge. Before he could gather his bearings, the ground shook and a loud BOOM filled the air. Turning swiftly, Athrun's view was engufled by what appeared to be a gargantuan stocking-clad toe. \"GO.NOW.\" With a mix of fear and confusion, Athrun obeyed the immense voice and ran for his life.<br>\r\nWatching Athrun scurry away, Murrue turned to once again face down Cagalli. \"Now then, 'Princess'...\" Anger rising, Cagalli threw the near-crippled Gundam aside. A lesser pilot would be done for but Kira was able to pull off an ace manuver and hobble away. \"Thank you, Captain...\"<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

All the information was being viewed by one man, a tall looming figure with a metallic mask over his entire face, unlike a similar mask worn by Rau Le Crueset that just covered the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander Ronah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to his subordinate, the man turned to the lieutenant, an air of superiority surrounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sir, Central just asked when this operation would be concluded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, the lie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we can figure out the full effect of the mushrooms on the human population.  I must admit however, I never expected the Orb Princess to eat them.\"  Ronah capitalized the last part of his sentence with a smirk, leading the lieutenant to wonder exactly if Cagalli's eating the mushrooms was in fact, unintentional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then members of the Three Ships alliance and even the famous Lacus Clyne!  What are the odds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, what does this have to do with our operation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's simple.  Giant monsters running amok in the major neutral Earth settlement, and the Alliance forces moving in to save the populace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But sir, we don't know how violent the mushrooms will make them.  If anything, they may end up attacking our forces instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Objection noted Lieutenant.  And ignored.  Is Gerzu-Geh ready for departure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lieutenant nodded as he watched Cagalli rise to her feet and attack the giant Lacus.  \"Gerzu-Geh and five Windam mobile suits are all ready for departure, all with the mushroom antidote you've created.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.  Prepare for sortie.  Have the helm move the &lt;i&gt;Tomino&lt;/i&gt; right outside of Orb's oceanic borders, then launch on my signal.  I want to strike the monsters at their weakest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, the lieutenant left the room while Ronah continued to monitor the screens, occasionally chuckling to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love a good brawl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on Orb itself, Cagalli had already returned to her feet and ran right for Lacus, attempting to pull her hair and strike Lacus. However, as a natural, Cagalli soon found herself overpowered by Lacus and sent to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give up?\" shouted the pink-haired Coordinator.  Cagalli didn't respond, but took one of the smaller buildings and threw it at Lacus' face, the stone structure crumbling to dust and blinding her.  Wasting no time Cagalli tackled Lacus to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrue, on the other hand, was simply forced to watch the ensuing brawl from her vantage point high above as more and more of the city was destroyed.  Soon the entire city would be destroyed.  But did she dare move her monolithic body into action if it would mean raising the death toll tenfold?</span></div></div>",

Their intentions were not entirely noble, as the higher-ups hoped to use the incident to take over ORB and use it's resources and technology to increase their own military power. As the ships got closer to the island, the officers and crew-members began to realize the scale of the threat they were facing, particularly in the titanic Murrue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Admiral,\" The XO of the Alliance Flagship asked,\"do we have anthing that could possilbly take something like that down. Nukes may work, but the radiation would make the island useless to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer in charge of the operation nodded in understanding, seeing the younger man's point of view before smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we can do it. We have a weapon specifically made for this exact scenario. Those missiles we have are board aren't nukes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe XO nodded, satisfied and went back to preparing for the attack on the giantesses. The Admiral leaned back in his seat, confident that all would go according to plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, neither he nor anyone knew exactly what the compound in those missiles was. It had a mysteriously appeared at the naval base just before the madness in ORB happened. The note with it told how to place in onto missiles and that it would act as an antidote to the giant women, reversing their growth. After a brief meeting, the leaders of the Alliance decide that the risks of using the compound were worth it to take control of ORB. And so the fleet moved into attack range and launched their missiles at Murrue, Lacus and Cagalli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the much larger target and threat, the majority of the missile barrage was concentrated at Murrue. She looked up from the two brawling women just in time to see the missile flying at her. She raised her hands to protect her face before realizing that their weren't hitting her. They were exploding around her and releasing some kind of pink dust. The remaining missile had detonated lower, just above Lacus and Cagalli. The two women stopped their fighting as the pink dust floated down and covered their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three began to cough as they breathed in the dust, Murrue coughs shaking the whole island. The dust covered most of Murrue's body and all of the two smaller women. Then suddenely, the dust began to be absorbed into the women's body through their clothing. The three began to shake in pain as the compound went to work inside of their bodies. Both Lacus and Cagalli fell over, crushing both buildings and people while Murrue was doing everything to not do the same and thus crush everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the spasms began to to subside and the women began to breathe easier. It was then that something began to happen and the Admiral realized that the mysterious compounds was not doing what it said it would do. The giant women were not shrinking back down. Instead, they were....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, if she even moved her feet just a little bit, she would crush what remained of the city and kill all those people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why should that stop you? You should use you power, show everyone! I bet crushing them will feel great too.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrue shook her head, banishing those thoughts. She needed to stay focus or she would turn into what Lacus and Cagalli had become, violent and destructive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the fighting titans, the two were still rolling on the ground, not caring about all the buildings and people they were crushing. Lacus may have had greater strength due to being a Coordinator, but Cagalli had military experience and training. She made use of this, throwing Lacus off of her and quickly following up with a series of quick strikes. Lacus was forced back, stumbling and destroy in several buildings. The two women stared back at each other, Lacus straightening up while Cagalli gave a cocky grin. The two were evenly matched and seemed unable to seriously injury each other. At this rate, the battle could last for hours and by then, the entire city would be obliterated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrue was frantically think of what to do. She had been able to stop Athrun, but that had been because of the black formula she used. Murrue eyes widened as she remembered. When all this chaos had started, she found the strange black mushroom next to two small jars, one with a black substance and another with pink. A small note next to it had explained that the mushroom could make her grow and that the two formulas could be used to shrink others back to their normal sizes, black for males and the pink for females. Seeing that it would be impossible to get substances onto the giant Cagalli and Athrun at her normal height, Murrue ate the mushroom to even the playing field. She didn't expect to grow to the colossal size that she did, but luckily the two jars that she had grown with her. The black jar had proven it worked, so the pink one should as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrue reached for the pink jar, unscrewing the top and holding it out over the two fighting giants. She tilted the jar, sending a large amount of the pink goo falling to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli and Lacus were once again locked in combat, grappling with each other when the pink goo hit them. The force of it falling from such a height stunned the two and the fell back away from each other, collapsing to the ground and covered in the pink substance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrue looked down at the scene, waiting for the substance to take effect. After a couple of seconds, she began to worry that it wasn't working. At that moment, the two smaller giantess began to stir and Murrue noticed something was different. She saw....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thanks to him her Zaku had been destroyed. Thanks to him so many crew members of the Minerva had been killed. And now, she held him firmly in her grasp. Her gigantic fingers slowly constricted, putting pressure on the Gundam, causing the metal to shreik and bend. Finally, she closed her fist completely and finished it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrue stood towering high above watching in shock as the red-headed girl wearing a ZAFT uniform crushed Kira slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Dont!\" She thundered, but her words were unheeded as Kira met his end in the fist of the massive Coordinator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Lunamaria turned her attention to the raging Cagalli, who seemed more angry from the fact that she hadn't been able to crush Kira, rather than the fact that her brother had just been killed. She faced off with the blonde, who threw herself towards Lunamaria screaming, \"Think you can stop me? Ha!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCagalli had obviously taken leave of her senses. She had known Lunamaria during her short stint on the Minerva, but seemed to be forgetting the fact that Lunamaria was a Coordinator. And not just a Coordinator, but one who wore ZAFT's elite  red uniform as a product of the best training in PLANT. Lunamaria smirked as the Princess charged, calling out to her, \" Just less competition for Athrun-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was it. The towering Cagalli throwing herself towards Lunamaria, giant bare feet throwing pieces of buildings as she sped forward, then one single blindingly fast bare foot attached to a long leg wearing a pink skirt lanced out and struck Cagalli straight in the face. Giant foot met giant head, sending Cagalli flying backwards from the power of the Coordinator soldiers kick. It was a clear K.O., Cagalli never stood a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Lunamaria looked upwards towards the massive Murrue who looked downwards with anger but was still too afraid to move. She would search for  Athrun later, but now she had an obstacle to tackle. </span></div></div>",

The puddle of goo was shallow but wide, making it more then easy enough for her to scoop up a good amount. Suddenly, the heavens trembled- \"DON'T!\". Lunamaria casually looked up and faced her attacker \"And you think you can stop me? Foolish as she was, that Orb girl got one thing right-you've used a really half baked strategy. Did you honestly think a scare tactic was going to win this battle? I honestly expected better from the captain of the legendary Archangel\". Murrue scowled in response. True, this hadn't been the best of strategies but then this situation had never occured anywhere else in history. Perhaps if she was her departed second-in-command Natarle she would have no problem making the choice to move her juggernaut of a body to end this madness, but there was just far too much risk in doing so. But then...<br>\r\n\"Oh well\".

She suddenly remembered how it had just been poured over Athrun and assumed that she'd be best applying it a similar way. Raising her hand just above her head, she poured the considerable scoop and massaged it into her hair. It seemed to evaporate, leaving her scalp in the same condition as before she poured it. Nothing else happened. For a moment, she wondered if she'd applied it the wrong way or if the Minerva's findings were wrong but these thoughts were cut short by a sudden feeling in the pit of her stomach. It had begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth was steady. Her frame expanded upwards and outwards, consuming more space with each passing moment. The ground beneath her massive feet began to crumble and flatten under the stress. Lunamaria enjoyed it. This was her second time growing and the power was rather intoxicating, perhaps even more than she realised. She had been used to seeing things at a higher perspective when piloting an MS, but to actually be that big, to have that power...there was nothing else like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrue watched with fear and dread as the young girl before her grew higher and higher. If this continued than she'd have absolutely no choice but to act as she'd be the only thing big enough to be a match for this power crazed teen. She'd have to make her move soon, when they were on equal fitting or the smaller size would enable her to escape Murrue's grasp.<br>\r\nWithin a few moments, Lunamaria had surpassed Murrue's knees....her waist...her chest. The moment came when she was staring the older giantess right in the face. Lunamaria grinned. Murrue glared. The moment she hadn't wanted was here. The time to strike was now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, something terrible happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunamaria didn't stop growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Murrue a moment to realise what was happening. She had tried to restrain the girl who was now her equal in size but had quickly found that her arms had grown too thick to keep a grip of. The next thing she knew, her vision was filled with a view of Lunamaria's expanding chest. It continued to grow larger and rise higher with each second. The sight near terrified Murrue. Throughout this madness, she'd kept the slight advantage of being bigger than anyone else but now she faced an opponent of even more titanic proportions. Murrue's current size was by no means small, but the new scale being exhibited by this ZAFT girl dwarfed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunamaria's growth finally came to a halt at a height where Murrue was level with her waist. The Coordinator beauty stood there in all her glory, like some goddess from Olympus. Placing her hands on her hips, she surveyed her new domain. \"HMMM...\", she purred, a voice powerful and sexy, surpassing speakers at a rock concert, \"NOT BAD...FOR NOW\". She shot a devilish grin. Her new size would undoubtedly make her ZAFT's most valuable asset. Why send hundreds of MS into battle when one soldier could level the playing field with ease? The war would be over in no time and she'd bring peace and stability to PLANT. She once again looked far down below. The city was nearly in ruins from the fights and further stress caused by the giants who appeared this day. She might as well finish the job now and silence the traitorous Orb for good. A grin escaped her face as she thought of the destruction she could cause on this island nation. Of course, she could have some fun with her 'playmate' Murrue first...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her presence was one of a great chance. Miri rarely visited her former homeland these days, but a tip from a usually reliable source had informed of her of some activity that just had to be caught. The tip had proven false but something even more amazing had occured. Miriallia was on her way to visit Kira when Cagalli's rampage had begun. Luck had been on her side and she'd managed to escape most of the carnage, hiding as she often did when needing to get shots from battles. But on this occassion, she'd been too scared to even consider taking any shots. She had watched in fear and horror as this whole mess had unfolded, from Cagalli's initial attack right up to the gargantuan Murrue facing off an even larger ZAFT soldier. Her eyes wondered from the latter and came to rest on the former- the gigantic Cagalli, sprawled out on the ground. The blonde had taking quite the beating and Miriallia was unsure if she should be concerned or overjoyed. Cagalli's behaviour (like most everything this day) had been bizzarre. Miriallia knew her has a hot blooded protector of the people and yet here she had attacked them for her own pleasure, even Kira! What the hell was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the heavens rumbled again \"WELL, I GUESS I'D BETTER MAKE MY MOVE, EH?\". It was the ZAFT girl. \"I THINK I'LL START BY FLATTENING THIS ENTIRE ISLAND, FOR ZAFT!\". A look of terror crossed Miriallia's face in a snap. Was this giantess serious?! The way the day had been going she most likely was. Not like anyone could stop her. Captain Ramius appeared afraid to move and Cagalli seemed out for the count. What to do, what to do...<br>\r\nMiriallia's thinking was broken by an attractive scent. Following it to her feet, she noticed an odd mushroom. The smell was overpowering, almost like it was crying out to be eaten. NO! There was no time for such nonsense.

Despite this tactical error, there was no doubting the Orb ruler would make a powerful ally. Certainly more than the seemingly simpering Murrue or the ZAFT titaness. Miriallia chuckled to herself softly, reflecting on how once again Cagalli and herself were allied against the odds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knelt down and firmly shook Cagalli by the shoulder. The blonde giantess slowly opened her eyes. \"Get up\", spoke Miriallia, \"We need to move\". Cagalli groaned. \"Where's the red head bimbo who knocked me out? I'm not leaving without taking a shot at her!\" \"I wouldn't advise it\", replied Miriallia, pointing. Cagalli followed her direction...her eyes became like saucers, eyeballing the immense Lunamaria.

Picking herself up off the ground, the Captain sized up her opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrue was no fool, knowing that if she simply charged in she would end up like Cagalli, but even worse. Her opponent was twice as tall as her, stronger, faster, and better trained. She didn't have much hope in a direct confrontation, but at such a massive size there was little she could do to even the odds. Even if the Mariana Trench and Mount Everest were right next to each other, she would have to duck to hide herself, if she could even fit more than her foot inside it. She had no weapons and no way to get a real tactical advantage, the only thing going for her was her smaller size that, hopefully, would give her a speed advantage againt her massive opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in a massive breath, Murrue charged forwards at the red headed Coordinator, who stood watching her with a smile on her face. As soon as Murrue closed within striking distance, a massive bare foot shot out in a slashing sideways kick that would have probably taken Murrue's head off, if Lunamaria's heel had made contact. But all that the massive blow struck was air, the several mile long foot meeting no resistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVia a feat of agility that she never knew she possessed, Murrue ducked under the blow, throwing herself into a tackle, and launching towards Lunamaria's supporting leg. With enough force to destroy a small country, Murrue struck the Coordinator's thigh, knocking her off balance. Slowly, the nearly 30 mile tall Coordinator girl toppled over while the 15 mile Murrue clung onto her leg. With the force of several nuclear weapons, the massive pile of female flesh struck Orb's giantess-torn main island,  doubtlessly wiping out any survivors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lunamaria wasn't that easy an opponent. Only minorly fazed by the impact, the titanic girl spun herself upwards, raising herself on her hands with her legs held overhead, split apart. Her pink skirt hung downwards, the massive clothing pulled by gravity, revealing the not quite as large but still massive Murrue who was still holding onto Lunamaria's legs. With practiced precision, the Coordinator girl began spining herself around, titanic hands pounding the ground as she picked up speed. Faster and faster she spun, the pounding of her hands shattering the island below her while her legs produced winds moving at speeds unheard of. Still, Murrue clung onto the Coordinator girl with a grip of steel, but her grip began to slip as the massive thighs to which she clung spun faster and faster. Finally, she lost her grip and was sent flying. Like a rocket, Murrue shot over the ocean surrounding the islands of Orb before slamming into another island, nearly knocking her out cold. Shakily, she rose to her feet as the massive footsteps of Lunamaria drew slowly closer, the confident Coordinator's face grinning as she closed in on her prey.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was only a minute or so into the fight, but Murrue could already see that she didn't have much of a chance to beat her gigantic opponent. Her best bet, getting in close and trying to subdue Lunamaria while too close for the larger girl to land a strong blow had been repulsed as easily as an adult tossing aside a petulant child. Battered by her impact with the island, Murrue shakily stood in the ankle deep, to her, water, her uniform now wet and ripped all over. Shaking her head to clear her vision, she looked forward as the red uniformed Coordinator girl came closer. She didn't want to use her final trump card, but it seemed like she had no choice. It was now do or die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile on her face, Lunamaria walked through the ocean towards the battered Orb officer. Behind her the island on which this had all begun lay broken and smashed by her hands and feet, shattered into a myriad of ruptured parts. The water barely cleared the toes of the 30 mile tall Coordinator girl as she felt the ocean floor crumble under her weight like so much sand. She could already tell that this fight would not last much longer, and was eager to move on to her next target. Maybe she would destroy the Atlantic Federation, piece by piece? If she walked northeast she could likely reach Panama or California in only a short time, and then the fun would really begin. She smirked as she walked forward, but the smile disappeared when she noticed Murrue reach into her sleeve and produce another vial from the same place she had kept the one she used on Athrun, that Lunamaria had then exploited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this vial was not was not the same as the dark green liquid she had produced earlier. It's color was pitch black. Although Lunamaria had to squint to see the small, to her, vial, her enhanced eyesight could tell that this liquid was far thicker than the one from before. Worried by what Murrue might be up to, Lunamaria began running towards the smaller woman, but was too late as the Natural lifted the vial above her head and poured about 1/4th of the thick liquid over her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrue hadn't wanted to use it. But she had no choice. She winced as the thick liquid of the Prototype serum fell onto her hair, with an unpleasant feeling, like having crude oil poured over you. The dark green formula she had used earlier was the refined and adjusted form of the growth substance, which had been culled from the special mushrooms. It was adjusted for normal uses. This formula, however, was unrefined and unsafe. It was her last ace in the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe liquid only stayed on Murrue's head for a few seconds before it was absorbed. Almost instantly, Murrue bent over and clutched her chest. Then her body began rumbling. Lunamaria was still about 20 seconds from her, but those 20 seconds would seem to last an eternity. With a speed that surprised both giantesses, Murrue shot upwards, growing frantically. In a mere 5 seconds she was as tall as Lunamaria, her growing feet pulverizing the ocean floor beneath her. In another 5 seconds, she had doubled in size. Now the tables were turned as the 60 mile Murrue Ramius looked downwards in surprise. But she hadn't even seen the beginning of it. Another 5 seconds passed, and Murrue soared up to a massive 120 miles tall. Without even moving, she had crushed a multitude of Islands, and now stood towering far, far over the red uniformed Coordinator who now had a panicked look on her face. But Lunamaria was goign too fast, and was unable to stop. The final 5 seconds passed as Murrue shot upwards into the heavens. Standing at 240 miles tall, Murrue was a behemoth unlike anything ever seen before. Below, forgotten, Lunamaria crashed into Murrue's monstrous shin, which knocked her backwards so that she was sprawled on top of the massive woman's foot. But that was not the end of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of worry was on Murrue's face. She simply would not stop growing. She had surely by now crushed half of Orb's islands without even taking a step. Until finally, her upwards movement stopped. She was now huge beyond belief, her body towering far into space at a massive 480 miles tall. Luckily, it seemed that one of the side effects of the unrefined formula was that the subject no longer needed to breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgotten, laying on a foot larger than she was, Lunamaria looked upwards at the towering Captain, preparing her counterattack.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laying on the flat expanse of flesh, Lunamaria gazed upwards at Murrue's towering form. Annoyingly, she was back to where she started, tiny and insignificant compared to the massive Natural. Despite being gigantic in every sense of the word, the 30 mile tall Luna was only 1/16th the size of the Captain. Noticeable, but hardly a threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so she hoped Murrue thought, if she even noticed the (relatively) small girl below her. Trained as an Elite during this era of Mobile Suit combat, Lunamaria had at least some training in Infantry anti-MS countermeasures, and comparatively, Murrue was small in scale compared to a normal person and a Mobile Suit. More than anything, she had been trained to find solutions to tough situations, and she knew what to do. It wasn't much of a plan, but it was better than nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above, 450 miles above, to be exact, Murrue stood, breathing slowly, although she could tell that she didn't really need to. If Space could kill her, it already would have. A bigger worry of hers was ZAFT retaliation, 480 miles above the surface of the Earth is at the edge of the atmosphere, so space based Mobile Suits and Battleships could easily be on an even orbit with most of the parts of her body above her waist, and she didn't exactly want to get shot in the eye with a Lohengrin or other heavy beam weaponry. In the distance she could see one Orb's space stations, Ame-no-Misashira, moving by while orbiting the Earth at an elevation roughly equal to her breasts.  With her uniform torn and dirtied by her earlier encounter with an island, the soldiers aboard doubtlessly were taking in the view of their lives as they passed by the fleshy mountains that put Mount Everest to shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar below, Lunamaria ran quickly through the toe-deep  water, running towards a nearby island. The giant towering far above her was paying her no heed, so Lunamaria made the best of the situation. Bending down, she scooped up the small mountainous island in her massive hands, compressing the dirt with her hands with such intense force that the loose dirt around the stone of the mountain fused into rock and glass. Then, opening her uniform jacket, she stuffed the balllike   object into her shirt so that she didn't have to hold it. Then, moving carefully now, not wanting to attract the behemoth's attention, she moved behind Murrue's legs. She stretched for a second, picking up a mountain and rubbing it between her hands for extra traction. Then she backed up a dozen steps or so and assumed a sprinter's position. At some unheard mark, she launched herself forwards as fast as she could, her massive feet throwing water dozens of miles behind her as she propeled herself forwards. And then, she leaped as high as she could. The massive coordinator girl soared through the air, impossibly high, until she impacted her target: The back of Murrue's knee. With the force of a million tons of TNT, Lunamaria struck the fleshy pillar, knocking it forwards and bringing the titanic Murrue down to one knee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight of even 1 knee of a 480 mile woman is immense beyond belief, and when all that weight struck the ground it caused a tremor that likely smashed the Pacific continental plate. Lunamaria, who had thrown herself quickly aside in order to avoid being crushed between Murrue's thigh and calf, was knocked off her feet by the impact. But she quickly got back up, and ran around in front of Murrue, who was looking around in surprise. Before her unbelievably gigantic nemesis could react, Lunamaria jumped and climbed on top of Murrue's leg at the knee that was on the ground, and ran on top of the massive thigh that was longer than her until she reached Murrue's waist. She ducked to dodge one of the Natural's gigantic hands that swatted at her, then grabbed onto Murrue's shirt and pulled herself upwards, ripping the already torn cloth under her weight but gaining valuable altitude. Then, she pulled the island-projectile out of her shirt and threw it as hard as she could... at the vial of unrefined growth serum in Murrue's hand, which was not fairly close to her. The rock struck the vial and cracked the bottom of it, which was still made of only glass no matter how big it was. A precious few drops dripped out of the cracks, and again demonstrating her superior speed Lunamaria jumped off the surprised Murrue and caught ran under the drops before they could hit the ocean, making them all impact the top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few drops hit Lunamaria before the crack spread on the bottom of the vial, the near vaccum around it causing the liquid to boil and shatter the glass, which sent the growth liquid flying outwards in all directions to land all over the world. But what the effects of that might be didn't worry Lunamaria or Murrue, as suddenly the smaller Coordinator girl began to scream at the top of her lungs. The unrefined serum had been labeled \"Unsafe\" and Murrue now saw why, as the smaller girl dropped to the ground and began rolling about in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it happened. Tears rolling down her cheeks, mouth open screaming in agony, Lunamaria never noticed her chest swell outwards to the point of bursting. She didn't notice her muscles begin to swell and become more defined, or as she began to grow in spurts, her huge body covering islands as she expanded.</span></div></div>",

Murrue could only watch as the Coordinator girl reacted to the formula, a sad look crossing her face. She hadn't wanted to kill the girl, but this was the result of her own actions. The serum was dangerous in it's unrefined form. When tested on a Male Coordinator, it had caused the man's flesh to liquify, so further testing had been forbidden. Murrue had no idea what was happening inside the Coordinator girl's body as she stood up, solemnly watching and listening to the young girl's screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep inside Lunamaria's 30 mile tall body, a change was taking place. Unlike the previous test subject, the red uniformed girl's body was not reject the serum. Instead, it was accepting it in ways noone had ever imagined. The pain was immense as the serum reacted with her altered genes, tearing apart her DNA piece by piece and reassembling her body. Lunamaria's eyes ran with tears, her mouth open as she flailed about, not noticing as her breasts began to shake on her chest. Her red uniform went taunt as the ample orbs enlarged, expanding outwards until the wet red cloth stuck to her flesh, pulled so taunt that it was like the clothing was painted onto her body. Rips formed in the clothing as it was pulled and stretched, top of her shirt pulled apart revealing her collarbones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes were not limited to her breast, the rest of her body beginning to shake as Lunamaria's DNA was altered, her body changing. Her legs stretched, proportionally gaining another 4 inches. All over her body her muscles tensed and released, tensed and release, growing larger and more defined each time. Her muscles did not grow to any extreme extent, but unknown to anyone, her muscles grew far more dense, granting her strength far beyond what she had before. All over her body it was as if her clothing was painted on, it was pulled so tight by her expanding body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, she began to grow. In stuttering spurts Lunamaria began to cover more and more ocean. It was a far cry from the steady, even growth of before. Slowly, her body expanded. Another 5 miles. Another 10 miles. Still, pain wracked the girl's body. Another 20 miles. Another 30 miles. Her flailing limbs obliterated islands by the dozen. She expanded again, doubling in size. Murrue could only stand back and watch. Lunamaria expanded again, and again. She stretched out to 100 miles tall. Then 200. Her kicking legs stretched out, her massive heels now smashing downwards into Australia, pulverizing the continent and destroying cities left and right. She exploded in growth, the uneven surging of her body carrying her outwards as she cried out. She doubled in size. Murrue looked downwards, the writhing girl at her feet nearly equaling her massive size, but still sprawled out on the ground. Then, Lunamaria grew again. In a massive rush of growth, she doubled in size, shooting up to a massive 800 miles tall. Then again, 1600 miles. Even lying down, the girl's flailing legs reached high into the air, a stray arm struck Murrue in the waist, sending the 480 mile woman sprawling from Lunamaria's new, unbelievable strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurled backwards from the impact, Murrue crashed into Japan, her massive body wreaking destruction on a large part of the island. Shaken, she slowly sat up and watched as the red uniformed Coordinator expanded again. And again. Her flailing legs had obliterated Australia now, wiping all traces of life from the continent and leaving it cracked and shattered as her feet reached over into the Indian ocean, stirring up Tsunamis of unbelievable proportions. Her screaming lessened, but it was unlikely that a single piece of glass was still intact anywhere in the world as the deafening noise rendered most of the Western hemisphere deaf. Then, the screaming stopped. Lunamaria's movements slowed and she became still. Far above sea level, her beautiful face lay still, eyes closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a smile formed on her lips. Her eyes opened, a confident look on her face. She was probably the most powerful being in existence, and she knew it. Slowly, she stood. She brought her feet under her, lifting her massive body upwards. Her massive, even on her, breasts jiggled in their tight confines, their unbelieveable size and shape the stuff of legends. Her uniform was skin tight, soaked with ocean water and sweat. She rose upwards, towering higher and higher. Her head soared far outside the atmosphere. Finally, she was standing straight up. Her lips parted as her body began to shake slightly as she began to chuckle, then began to laugh out loud, her voice inexplicably carrying through vaccume and reaching the ears of everyone on both Plant and Earth. She had been altered by the mysterious liquid, the unbearably beautiful Coordinator girl now standing tall, practically a Goddess, standing at 8,000 miles tall.</span></div></div>",

She could feel it pulsing in her veins, power unlike anything she had ever imagined. And this was only the beginning. Intuitively, she could feel her body yearning to expand outwards again, hungering for more growth. But she held it in. She was, for all intents and purposes, all powerful, but she was not letting it get to her... too much. She knew that she needed to deal with her rival once and for all before she could move along with her new desire, the desire to become more. Her very DNA shook with the need to become greater, larger. It whispered in the back of her head, urging her to grow more. And she planned to do exactly that. But first, she looked downwards. Far below her she could make out Murrue standing, gazing upwards in awe, at her titanic form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile appeared on Lunamaria's lips. Her beautiful face gazed down confidently at the smaller woman, elated with her new power. She licked her lips, then began to move. Slowly, she lifted her massive left foot upwards, moving it towards Murrue. With startling speed, the massive fleshy object disappeared from where it had sat, crushing the remains of Orb. Millions upon millions of gallons of water poured off the bottom of her sole, and mountain sized chunks of islands were sent flying by the mere movement of her extremity. Slowly, she moved it over the Pacific, until she brought it down. It was merely taking a step to her, but billions of tons of female flesh came pounding downwards, throwing ocean water outwards so high that the resulting tidal wave decimated everything that had once been China and the United States. The Pacific plate cracked underneath her foot, causing massive earthquakes around the entire Pacific rim, and causing hot magma to rise up from the ocean floor. But the collosal Lunamaria did not even notice the heat. To her the ocean beneath her was nothing more than a fraction of a milimeter of water beneath her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of her, Murrue turned and began to run. She needed time to think of something, anything to bring down this newborn Goddess. But she didn't have that time. Behind her, Lunamaria lifted her right foot upwards, already within striking distance of the 480 mile woman. With a speed that most people would not believe possible, she brought her foot forward and swept it sideways at the fleeing natural. A massive wall of female flesh nearly as high as she was tall struck Murrue from the side, sending her flying yet again. Tumbling head over heels, Murrue crashed into China, her giant body flattening millions and millions of people as it continued rolling. She swept over the country, leaving a massive swathe of destruction in her wake, until her 480 mile form struck the Himalayan mountains. Naturally, these minute (to her) mountains put up hardly any resistance, her mammoth body sweeping the massive piles of rock and dirt away, leaving flatlands in it's wake. She kept rolling, crushing Pakistan and afghanistan under her body, then Iran and Iraq. Still she rolled. Nothing was left of the Mediterranean coast of Africa as she plunged into the Atlantic, causing massive tidal waves to sweep the relatively untouched Atlantic coast of Europe and Africa. Finally, her forward motion ceased as she crashed into Florida, crushing most of the southern parts of it's peninsula. Murrue lay sprawled out, unconscious as earth shattering footsteps closed on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinding southern Mexico under her foot, Lunamaria walked over to the knocked out Natural and lifted her up. She was only about 1/16th of her size, barely even the size of a doll. She held the woman for a second, debating what to do with her. Finally, she decided to take the smaller woman along, as a plaything. She searched her uniform for a pocket that could fit the unconscious Murrue, but her enhanced body drew the clothing far too tight. So instead, Lunamaria closed her eyes for a second. She bit her bottom lip as an expression of immense pleasure appeared on her face and she began to grow. In her hand Murrue became smaller and smaller as Lunamaria expanded upwards. When she opened her eyes again, she stood towering at 12,000 miles tall. With a smile on her face, she pried open one of her pockets and dropped the smaller woman inside, although the cloth was still so tight that you could make out the form of the 480 mile woman inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmensely pleased with herself, Lunamaria looked about. She wanted to grow. Her body ached for it. But she needed fuel for her growing body, and she had nearly run out expanding to fit Murrue. She cast her gaze downwards at the country that formerly was known as the United States. Only a few steps away, to her, the Atlantic seaboard glowed with Earth Alliance controlled cities. Lowering herself onto her hands and knees slowly, she licked her lips as she crawled forwards. She lowered her head to the ground and, with a flash of an at least a hundred miles wide tongue, the city of New York was gone. A moan of pleasure escaped Lunamaria as she expanded and grew, adding a hundred miles to her frame. Next, she targeted the capital of the Atlantic Federation, Washington D.C., hovering her massive face over the city. She flashed her teeth as she grinned down at her enemy's capital, relishing in what the Blue Cosmos and other extremist Anti-Coordinator factions that lived there must be thinking. But Lunamaria was no longer a mere Coordinator. She was without a doubt the Ultimate Coordinator, not like those failures from Mendel. She had already proven her superiority to those insignificant bugs. With that thought on her mind, she licked up Washington D.C. and moved on to decimate the rest of the Atlantic coast, growing larger and larger with each city. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nothing remained in what used to be the United States and Canada. Every city of any size had vanished, replaced by massive tongue shaped craters that grew progressively larger as the massive face of Lunamaria lowered itself above it and then licked it up. With every city she grew larger and larger, her body eagerly turning the ingested material into fuel for her growth. Now, her face hung over California, wiping out the last bits of cities and significant military installations. She was on her hands and knees, her massive fingers extending into the Pacific ocean before her like massive pillars that could hold the world. Her fingernails were lodged deep, deep inside the Earth's crust, the molten magma below giving them a pleasant warm feeling. Her knees were planted on top of England and Spain, placed so that she did not endanger Gibraltar, which was owned by ZAFT. Above Eastern Europe her feet hung menacingly, only kept from coming down and obliterating every living thing there by the curvature of the Earth. The people below could only watch in fear as her massive feet and legs grew larger and larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh! Delicious!\" Lunamaria smiled, content now that she had finished off every city worth noticing below her. Her mouth was posed in a smile, her lips that could kiss an entire country only a half a foot or so off the ground, to her, but actually far outside the atmosphere. \"Now...\" She looked about, then began to crawl forwards. Her massive hands thundered down on the already cracked and destroyed Pacific plate, pulverizing it even more. Her knees smashed the Atlantic seaboard, then America, the impacts annihalating anyone who might have survived her city eating spree. The thunderous impacts rang out as she crawled over the Pacific ocean, stopping to devour the the larger islands of Hawaii and a large chunk of Japan. Then, she began to eat China. A large amount of it had been destroyed earlier by Murrue's impact, but it didn't matter to her massive mouth that consumed everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she worked her way around the Earth, devouring everything that she could find that wasn't a known ZAFT territory. She had more than enough fuel for her growth by now, but was holding it in, stocking it up. She could feel the power stirring in her body, the increases in size from eating merely being what she couldn't hold back. But they were still far from inconsequential. Finally, after an hour of so, she reached the Atlantic coast of Europe. Her world consumption tour ended with eating the entire British Isles. Little remained in her wake, the massive Coordinator girl had devoured everything. She purred contentedly, proud of herself. Slowly, she stood up. To her, the Earth was little more than an overinflated Beach Ball. She perched atop it comically, taking a second to get her balance right, then crossed her powerful arms across her chest. The moon orbited directly over her head. Slowly, she lifted herself onto her tiptoes, looking upwards as she stretched out. She slowly extended her tongue... and licked the Earth Alliance's Arzachael Moon Base and Copernicus city off the surface of the moon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she lightly pushed herself off the Earth and floated into space. As far as she was concerned, Earth no longer mattered to her, but her first act as a self proclaimed Goddess had been to wipe out the Earth Alliance completely, so it was likely that now ZAFT would seize control and bring these senseless wars to an end. She smiled, proud to have finally accomplished what everyone had thought impossible singlehandedly. Truly, she was a Goddess of Victory. With that thought on her mind, she floated away from the Earth. Finally, when she reached Martian orbit, she took a deep breath and began to release the storming energy inside her. With a cry of pleasure, she grew. It was a far cry from anything before, far dwarfing those \"minor\" spurts. She expanded tenfold, then a hundredfold, then a thousandfold. The Earth was nothing to her now. The Sun was nothing but a speck that she could hardly notice. She left the solar system far behind as she cried in pleasure from her growth.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lunamaria grew, expanding larger and larger. She was locked in a cycle of pleasure, her body rejoicing in it's expansion. Every once in a while, she opened her mouth and spun herself about, the gigantic maw sucking in dozens of solar systems. She squealed in delight at the feeling of power that filled her body with each bite. She grew and grew. Earth was just a distant memory now, the entire Sol system was practically microscopic to her. If you were looking at the Milky Way from outside the galaxy, you would see a most peculiar sight. Extending out far underneath the galaxy a pair of legs and feet reached out, occasionally kicking in the vast gulf of empty space around the galaxy. From the top a pair of mammoth breasts appeared half submerged in stars, the rest of Lunamaria's gigantic upper body extending out above. Her face smiled down at the galactic core with teeth the size of a hundreds of solar systems. Slowly, she bent down, her legs bending at the knees as she leaned forward, the pivoting motion bringing her massive feet up into the star soup. The massive extremities smashed thousands of stars upon their soft flesh, but the heat was nothing but a pleasant glow to the mammoth girl. Her breasts plowed downwards, taking out just as many solar systems themselves, the stars and planets smashing upon her massive uniform covered mammaries. Slowly, her face closed in on the galactic core, the thick white bundle of a basketball sized treat to her. Her massive jaws opened as her face reached forward, scooping the incredibly dense gas into her mouth. Then, she breathed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt shouldn't have been possible in the vaccum of space, but she did it anyways. The entire ring of gas, millions and millions times more dense than the Sun was sucked down her throat, causing instantaneous expansion unlike anything ever experienced before. Larger and larger she grew as she took in the gas, her mouth zooming wider and wider, so large that the ultra massive black hole at the center of the galaxy became bite sized to her. And then she closed her mouth. Technically, the black hole should have sucked her in, but it didn't. Instead, her body reduced it to just more fuel for her growth. Lunamaria zoomed upwards, leaving the Milky Way galaxy behind. When it had been reduced to fingernail sized, she turned and produced a small vial she had swiped from Murrue earlier, and calmly scooped everything that remained inside it, then put it in her pocket with Murrue for safekeeping. It was her good deed of the day. A self satisfied smile on her face, she resumed her growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she saw something. She couldn't tell if it had just appeared or had always been there, just too large to be seen. A tan wall sat in front of her, extending as far up and down as she could see. She was clueless as to what it really was, but something inside her body urged her to find out. It told her that this was what she had come here for. Her smile returned as she poured on the growth, expanding quickly towards the massive object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------- Two and a Half Years Earlier--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeams flashed. Explosions rent space as people died by the dozens. The battle of Jachin Due raged outside the viewport. Inside, Fllay Allster watched the carnage that raged outside, shivering in fear. The launch was packed with the crew of the Dominion, overloaded and cramped. The smell of sweat and fear rolled over her like a steamroller as the small, fragile escape vehicle slowly moved through the chaotic battleground. Outside, a flash of motion caught her attention. It was a Mobile Suit! More specifically, the Gundam that Kira piloted! She cried out, although there was no chance he could hear her outside. Then, the world exploded around her as the launch was vaporized. She watched as her body was hurled out into space, a wordless cry on her lips. She bid her farewell to Kira and the world as everything turned black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFllay's eyes snapped open. She breathed in, taking a ragged breath, but no air entered her lungs. She gasped, her hands shooting to her throat, trying to breathe. She struggled for a few seconds, and then realized: She didn't have to. She slowly calmed down. Her diaphragm expanded as if she was taking a breath, but it was only by force of habit. She glanced about, examining her surroundings. Everything was black, besides for tiny dots of light spread about. Throwing out her arms, she slowly turned around. She looked down at the closest of the lights, stunned to find out that it was actually a myriad of lights. She squinted her eyes, looking  at the swirl shaped group of dots, wondering what it was. The answer popped into her head as if she had known it all along: It was a galaxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, a galaxy? That's impossible...\" She began to say, and then was hit by a wave of noise unlike anything she had ever experienced, but for some reason she could understand and listen perfectly to every sound. Then it struck her; they were voices. She was hearing the thoughts of every creature living in that galaxy. A bewildered look crossed her face. How was this possible? The information popped into her head: She had been chosen. Saved from death, spirited away from her demise. And then, a switch flipped in her head. Her face turned into a confident smirk as she looked down. She had been stripped naked, but with a thought her body was clothed in a fresh new pink Earth Alliance uniform. Slowly, she lifted her hand and reached out to the group of dots, still listening to the thoughts of the trillions of living beings inside it. With a smirk, she closed her fingers, snuffing out the lights.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Larger and larger Lunamaria grew, every part of her expanding with unprecedented force. Her massive hands scooped whole galaxies into her mouth to fuel her growth.  Still, the wall before her extended in every direction as far as she could see. She had no idea what it was, but somehow it's presence urged her onwards in both awe and anger at the concept that something could be larger than her. New waves of growth shook her body as she grew, still watching the wall before her. She noticed something peculiar now. It seemed that the wall had ridges. Before, it had appeared to be a solid, flawless object, but now she could make out miniscule imperfections. Her curiosity was piqued, and she new that the only way to find out was to grow larger, so she scooped another handful of galaxies into her mouth and willed herself to grow as fast as she could. Now, far above her she could make out something white overhanging the wall, covering the space above her as far as she could see. It was like a massive ring of ice, flawless in it's smoothness and shape. Lunamaria looked up in wonder as she grew larger. Behind her a giant green netting had appeared, the holes between each link large enough for a hundred people her size could have walked through it side by side. She was having trouble finding new food now, having grown so large that your standard run of the mill galaxy was hard to see. In the distance, however, she could make out larger objects, and pondered the discovery. Was the Milky Way really that small compared to other galaxies? She could only wonder whether there was intelligent life out there on one of those nearly microscopic dots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she could see the end of the white overhang above her. It was perfectly rounded, Lunamaria couldn't even make out a single imperfection in it's curve. The tan wall ahead of her was now displaying rows of large ridges, although Lunamaria could easily fit in the valleys between them. She expanded more and more upwards, floating herself backwards through the green netting because she wanted to see what was beyond the white overhang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she moved, clearing the overhang. She saw only trillions more galaxies floating above her. She continued floating backwards, until suddenly she gasped. Something was there. Something big. Her eyes looked upwards, trying to recognize the ridiculously immense object before her. A massive tower extended above her. It possessed a weird green color up a good distance, and then turned to a different, bronzed color. It took her a second to look beyond it's massive form, but she noticed that it was not alone, another, similar tower right next to it. The towers were thick and perfectly smoothed. High above they joined together under some type of large black object. Above that she could see some type of pink object that was larger than large, unbelievably massive, extending upwards, evidently covering or taking the place of the green and bronze towers. High, high above the pink substance bulged outwards in giant mountains that could possessed the size of thousands and thousands of galaxies. And above those two humongous spheres, Lunamaria saw something that made her blood run cold. Looking over the mountains was a face. An unbelievably huge, but undoubtedly human face. It's huge eyes were looking directly down at Lunamaria. Red hair, each strand as thick as a dozen galaxies framed it.  It's massive mouth was locked into a smirk as the female features struck her with a realization. Those weren't towers, those were her legs. That huge pink object was her clothes, and now that Lunamaria knew that she could see the details of an Earth Alliance recruit uniform. Those huge mountains weren't some unbelievable swell of galaxies, they were her breasts! And the the tan wall before her was... her big toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunamaria was shocked. That huge object that towered millions and millions time larger than her home galaxy, was the toe of this woman. The size was inconceivable. A million questions popped into Lunamaria's mind. Then, an unbelievably loud voice rang out through the vacuum of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been waiting for you.\"</span></div></div>",

There was probably no help available to the two of them within a days journey on foot.  A wicked grin grew over Pirotess' face, it was the perfect opportunity for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were currently at rest by a stream, preparing to head back to the village the rest of their party was at.  Pirotess had no intention of ever letting them see their comrades again.  Without any further hesitation, she reached in the bag and pulled out the orb.  Then she turned around repeated the spell exactly how Wagnard had instructed her.  Because of her turn, she didn't notice Deedlit's ears twitch slightly while she spoke the incantation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a feeling enveloped her.  One of power.  As someone used to dark elven magic, the feeling wasn't entirely new, but just the same she had never experienced something quiet like this before.  A shudder ran through her, the feeling intensified and for a moment she was afraid she had gotten the spell wrong and she would be ripped apart.  But that subsided, opening her eyes again she gasped in surprise that the ground was moving away from her.  No, she was growing bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wicked grin reappeared on her face.  She thought to herself, <i>maybe I really will crush that pathetic high elf beneath my foot.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kept growing her head reached halfway up the trees, she turned and started walking towards the knight and his elf, it was time she showed them what real power was.  By the time she got the to clearing, she was as tall as the trees around her, somewhere around 30 feet in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParn and Deedlit looked up in shocked at the growing dark elf, but that faded as they picked up their weapons and prepared to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the pathetic bugs who thought they could oppose her, Pirotess began to let out an evil laughter, nothing would stop her.  She could conquer the entire land with her still growing power.  By now she was up to 100 feet in height and still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle began, but there was little Parn could do, his sword couldn't penetrate the skin of the dark elf.  As she passed 150ft tall, Pirotess simply kicked him away knocking Parn in to the stream. Deedlit was in a fit of rage and channeled the strongest magic she could, releasing it all in one great rush against the giant.  But even this couldn't slow Pirotess down as her growth topped off at 200ft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>As strong as a dragon?</i> she thought, <i>I could probably rip one in half!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down, but after her last spell, Deedlit had sense enough to hide herself.

It was so much different than when she piloted her Gundam- not only was she even bigger than her Gundam was, giving her an even greater view than she would as a pilot, but she was the one stepping on things and blowing things up, and she could feel everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStellar began to realize what a one-sided battle this would be as she stomped down the streets of the town, her gigantic feet crushing cars and people alike. People threw themselves to the ground, waving their hands up and staring up at the gigantic bare sole in fear, but no matter what they did her giant feet would not be deterred. She had a mission, and it was to cause havoc on this town. And she seemed to find it fairly amusing, giggling every so often as she crushed more of the tiny people, and even some of the tiny buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, inside the Minerva a few members of the crew had gotten wind of the gigantic Stellar's attack on the defenseless town.

Specifically one Shinn Asuka recognised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinn clenched his fists as he remembered the masked Alliance officer's promise to protect Stella...a promise that was apparently hollow. Unable to contain himself anymore, Shinn sprinted out of the room. Lunamaria called out his name but he didn't here. Right now his focus was on getting to the Impulse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Minerva crew weren't the only one keeping tabs on the amazing scene. From the safety of a land battle ship, Neo watched his young charge bring chaos and destruction. \"Amazing, isn't it?\", he said to the officer next to him, \"I think Lord Djibril will be most happy with the results. At this rate, we won't need the Destroy project\". The other officer nodded. \"Of course\", Neo continued, half jokingly, \"We might have to use the budget for that on wardrobe. I dare say her current outfit isn't very modest\". He chuckled to himself and resumed watching the action unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella's rampage knew no bounds. She obeyed her orders exactly, continuing to bring fury down onto the town. Suddenly however, she sensed something. Spinning around (and crushing some houses at the same time), Stella saw a tiny speck flying towards. As it grew closer she was able to recognise it- the blue and white enemy Gundam...Enemy. That word stood out in her mind. She would crush this Gundam like the ant it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice suddenly emerged from the Gundam over speaker- \"Stella! Stella, can you hear me?

As she lifted the bar above her head she began to get more and more angry. Suddenly she began to grow! She screamed as the bench collapsed under her weight.

After she got over the shock she smiled, ''whoo hoo! this is awesome! i'm the biggest girl in the world!'' She lifts her feet out of the ruins of the house and plants them down on the front yard. she raises her arms and stretches her whole body, and boy did it feel good after being so cramped in there. By now a crowd had gathered at her feet. As she stretched her arms up towards the sky she got a wiff under her arm, she then stuck her head under her arm and took a big sniff. As she soon as she got a wiff she recoiled, ''pee u! man my armpits stink! i wish i had some deoderant'' she waved her hand in front of her face to wave the oder away. She began to sit down, the crowd of tiny people scattered as her titanic butt decended on the grass upon them. She let herself fall on her butt. ''*sigh* I'm so big, i cant think of anything to do! the possibilities are endless!'' as she sat there thinking her dad Hercule came out of the mansion, not noticing the house had been reduced to ruins, he had just got out of the shower and was drying his hair off with his towel. He went out to the front yard, and wasnt looking where he was going and bumped into something. He fell back on his butt and rubbed his head. ''ow! what the-'' hercule opened his eyes and found himself looking at a mountain! as his eyes traveled upward he realized it wasnt a mountain! it was a giant shoe! he looked up and up and saw, Videl's face looking down at him! he was in shock for a moment and then smiled, ''yeah right! it's videl all the way up there! i gotta get some sleep! i'm seeing things!'' Videl looked down at her tiny dad, she was still mad at him, and then almost immediately Videl grinned as she knew what she wanted to do.</span></div></div>",

Videl grinned ''yep. so dad, how do you like the new me? am i still a little weakling like you said?'' Videl laughed evilly. Hercule suddenly remembered ''Oh uh heheh s-sorry Videl, um your not still sore about that little joke are you?'' Videl frowned ''yes as a matter of fact i am dad! and ya know what? now that i'm so big i think that it's time for a little payback!'' Hercule gulped. Videl grinned. ''hey dad. i've been working out all day. and i've gotten real sweaty!'' She said as she sniffed under her arm. She faked a disgusted face ''pee u! man i really need some deoderant.'' She looked at her tiny dad in her palm. She grinned ''so dad whadda ya say that you be a stand in for my deoderant?'' Before the shocked hercule could answer he felt videl's fingers tighten around him and he saw videl lift up her arm. She pulled up the sleeve of her short sleeve t-shirt so that it was nearly up to her shoulder and thrust him down the sleeve of her short sleeve shirt. Then she with two fingers holding him by his feet she shoved his face into her pit. The minute hercule got into the sleeve he immedietly got a wiff of her armpit, it surrounded him and the fact that she had been sweating in this shirt for so long and the fabric of the armpits of her shirt had been drenched with her foul armpit sweat it made the smell even worse. Now she made sure to mash his face into her armipit and swirl his face around coating his face with sweat and making sure he smelled and endured all of her armpit B.O. Videl laughed evilly ''yeah dad how do ya like that? you like that smell? yeah you like the smell of my stinky armipits dont ya daddy? well since you like it so much, just to make sure you get all of the stink out of there, why dont you lick them?'' Hercule's eyes bugged out, and he immediately closed them when the flesh of videl's armpit poked him in the eye and her armpit sweat dripped into his eyes. ''i dont feel any licking daddy! Now start licking my armpit sweat up or else!'' That was all Hercule needed and slowly he put his tougne on videl's armpit, he tasted her B.O and nearly puked, he quickly pulled his tounge off and wiped it off. Videl chuckled ''yeah daddy! how's that taste? you like the way my armpit tastes? well then if you like it so much have some more!'' And with that videl ground hercule's face into her pit and commanded him to lick up her pit sweat and drink it. Hercule reluctantly did as he was told. He was but a toy to his new goddess. Forced to lick his gigantic daughter's smelly armpits. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Just so you know....this story is focusing on the females for the growth process and SAO: Reboot is not involved with the series at all. It's an Original. And this VRMMO is in-between the end of SAO to SAO 2 [Fairy Dance Arc to Phantom Bullet -XU3].)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey, the name is ___________ and I'm a 17 year guy that living in [insert country or state/continent and city here] and plays video games. 2 years ago, I was playing a VRMMO, the newest kind of video games in history. Invented in Japan. The one that started it all was a game called <i>Sword Art Online</i>, but something was wrong when I first played it....players cannot get out of it! They can't log out! It was all a trap! Made by the creator itself! Everyone was freaking out, except for myself. I kept my cool as I believe that someone was gonna fix this, but I can't just sit around and do nothing the entire time, so, I just did a simple thing....playing the game. I just played to not die. The floor that I got up to was floor 31 out of the 100 floor tower called Aincrad, before it got changed for ALO, ALfheim Online and at that point, I was a level 46 at the time from beating monsters and looking for level up items. I had to waste time until we can all leave when someone beats the final boss. Every time a boss of a floor was cleared, people can go up or stay at that floor if it's nice enough but we weren't all sure. The whole thing was just nothing but a Death Game. Days later, the final boss...which was the creator himself, Kayaba Akihiko, or as players call him,\"Heathcliff\". But he was defeated by a player in the username called, \"Kirito\" and everyone was free. I personally never met the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut here, I bring you to right now....ever since SAO shut down from the incident and trouble has spread to other VRMMOs, I couldn't do anything at all but focus on school as it was my 2nd focus besides games. But it wasn't until I saw people at a store window and I checked it out to see what was going on and what I had saw, shocked me. It was SAO.....<i>AGAIN</i>! It said, \"Sword Art Online: <i>Reboot</i>\" on a poster on a piece of cardboard. I thought this game was over and done with! But apparently when I looked it up, the name and company was bought by another and changed everything! Well...almost everything. But I was talking about the changes from what was horrible in the original SAO. They had it stopped from being the death game to the VRMMO that we all <i>needed</i>! The hype was too great as some of us went for it and some of them kept their word of never playing a VRMMORPG ever again, As I was waiting for the game's release, a knock came in my uncle's apartment door and I peeked through the hole to see two men in a black and white suit and shades. I was frightened by this as in what did I do wrong but I decided to say who are they and they answered that they worked for the new company that is making the reboot of SAO! I opened the door and they told me an offer that I can't refuse....being a Beta Tester! I soon remembered that the first 1,000 beta testers were already trapped in the game before the original SAO's release and I asked them that too and they answered that nothing like that will happen. Not while they are making the game. I trusted them and went for the deal. One guy went downstairs and back and brought in a mechanical looking box with   the words <i>\"Sword Art Reboot\"</i> in a futuristic design in Japanese. Since I taught myself Japanese while studying before I got the first game, it was easy for me. In it was the game and a newly redesigned NerveGear. I told them that are they sure that it won't have me trapped in the game and they told me that ever since the original creator was gone forever, they made every precaution to make sure that they have a lively game for every gamer to enjoy in the VRMMO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went for it. I made a Beta account/official in the name of *insert avatar name of choice here* and a password and I took the old NerveGear from my closet to the trash and I inserted the newer one. It looks more a headband but mobile and lighter. I asked what is the properties of the new NerveGear and one of the men said that this new NerveGear has a small battery chip that can store a lot of power, making it long-lasting and it has the same thing as the old one but it was made possible to not to kill anyone while in-game while wearing the NerveGear, when it's game over when you die, you come back to reality and getting all of your senses back and whenever you want, you can get back in the VRMMO and logging out is made possible now. I just hoped he was right. I put in the game, I turned on the NerveGear as I lay on the bed and put it on and closed my eyes. In the process, I doing a sword, now with some newer designs, which I liked and it gives you the options to either have one, two, or three swords max. I created 3 swords, one's a dark knight battle sword, one's a red high-powered ninja sword, and one is big high-tech greatsword. I chose my design of having a sliver necklace, a red t-shirt with a red fire symbol, a black vest, two belts for the first two swords by my waist, a long black hooded jacket cloak, black slim cargo pants, red wrapped gloves and black strapped sneakers for running and a sword carrier for my greatsword that is going to be on my back. I pressed \"enter game\" and I was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy first experience to a new SAO was breathtaking! Instead seeing an Aincrad tower, I see a cool looking, high-tech tournament/1v1/team arena! I found myself in the forest, somewhere below that floating island in the sky, it feels strange to not be on that island the first time you play...yet it felt great! It feels free! I soon began to see a sign saying, \"Cybernetic Central: 3 Miles\", I didn't know what that is but I followed the sign and as I got there I see a bright a city, filled lights because it was under the arena island which replaced Aincrad, the blue lines on the walls of buildings must mean that it is high-tech, and there were shops and things I couldn't even tell you if you have to see it yourself! Soon a guide came up to me and told me to follow and the next thing I see is more players, maybe more beta testers and they all formed a line. They all looked psyched to play! Soon a screen popped up to show a middle aged man with glasses on and a white suit and a black and red tie and mixed grey and black hair showed up and began to speak with a nice smile, \"Beta testers, I am the new owner of <i>Sword Art Online</i> named, Daisuke Hara, and I will congratulate all of you to be the chosen gamers to participate for the beta of SAO. For we feel the sympathy for the people that have died from the previous version and that is why once that nightmare was over, we at my company, at Hara Technologies Corporation bought the game out and made new ideas and also fixed the errors made in development over the last 2 years and we want <i>you</i> to see what we have done for the enjoyment and safety for gamers everywhere in the world. The game will come out in 1 week prior on Monday. I will as well tell you the modes we have:<br>\r\nWe have the design customization mode, we have made new items, we made new weapons for our custom skill mode, we have even made special vehicles of your choice to travel and explore lands in the game that you have never saw before in the original, called \"HaraV\" mode. We made new cities, we made villages, we even made castles and foreign lands where enemies or ally NPCs are found. We have even given you the option to making your own homes anywhere you like! It could be near here in Cybernetic Central or it could even be elsewhere! But, I won't tell you what level areas it would be. But I will tell you this, once the game is launched, in the center if this city, is a mechanical portal where it will open to reveal \"Adventure Mode\", where you will go on a quest to defeat the final boss and complete the game in YOUR perspective or a group if you have a team. Unlike the original Sword Art Online, everyone's perspective is the same but you can decide that if you pick, solo, team, or full perspective, meaning it's everyone's game. As well you can team or be alone with our Battle Stadium, which has replaced the floating fortress of Aincrad.<br>\r\nThis year, NOT a single person will die on my watch. I care for my consumers for our products. The new NerveGear will make sure of that as of the game as well, when you die in-game, you don't die in real life. You can just find a save point in the mode as you find a new area or field and if you die and go back to the real world, just find a button that says \"to last save point\" and there you go. Now, go and enjoy your new game, <i>Sword Art Online: Reboot</i>!\"</span></div></div>",

Accidentally made a 2nd \"a\".)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI played the beta until Thursday as it's final beta day was on Friday and they could do the final adjustments for the 3 day weekend. Before that, I already gave my approval with the guys in black and white, whom were still in my room observing for my safety and they left. Everything before Thursday was a blast! It was a lot of fun! Now I waited until Monday, and the guys that came last week let me keep the game that they brought in as a present and sooner than later, players were everywhere in the game! People were running around, people were having sparring duels, talking to each other looking at the tutorials in Cybernetic Central and as I went to the center of that city, I head on to the \"Adventure Mode\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed since it's release and by the time of May, I was at a level 53 for my avatar and from a number weeks, still haven't made it to the final boss yet but I already defeated at least 9 or 10 of them. Quite different from the last version's. I already made a save point and got out of the Adventure Quest and went from solo POV to full POV so I can see everyone else. Soon before I was going to log out, me and everyone else, even in Adventure Mode heard a digital bell and all our menus popped up to show the creator once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello New SAO players, it is I, Daisuke Hara, the new owner once again. I will be glad to inform you that all of us at Hara Tech Corp. have formed a partnership with the makers of New ALO, Alfheim Online to form a new free DLC, downloadable content for SAO: Reboot!\" hearing that announcement got my full attention, \"Right now, in 2 days time, we will activate \"SAO Avatar GTavel!\" and what is that you may ask? That my dear players is a way to cross through games! It will go like this and it will only be available to those that are playing <i>this</i> game. You have made your avatar for SAO, and with a press of a menu and clicking on the options menu, it will give you the choice to transfer to stay here or travel to ALO and back! You also may ask, \"But wait, I don't have an account to there!\" No worries, the SAO account you have here is transferable to ALO thus creating <i>two</i> accounts at the same time with no charge! Just only the DLC and you are set! History has now been made with VRMMO game travel! Now you can experience two different kinds of games! As well, on the first day of you appearing to an ALO world, you can choose your race and make your avatar once more and skills. Enjoy your day!\" A free DLC is sweet and this must be the best time of my days! We now truly begin where it all began.....ALO.</span></div></div>",

She takes the game very seriously and is determined to clear it before someone tells her to enjoy the game itself a bit. Asuna is also somewhat proud and despite her kind personality, she will not hesitate to get physical with those that challenge her authority or make fun of her abilities, such as cooking. She is not afraid to act out on her own and will take matters in her own hands from time to time. She also cannot handle seeing others die in front of her, such as when she recklessly attacked The Gleam Eyes after seeing the Liberation Army players getting slaughtered. In ALO, after being saved by her friend to current in-game husband to future and current boyfriend, Kirito, Asuna's personality had not changed a bit except that she was not as proud as she was in SAO. Her personality began to develop further still after meeting Yuuki in the events of Mother's Rosario. Seeing how Yuuki still moves forward, despite knowing her death is inevitable, Asuna takes after her and resolves to keep moving forward, no matter what happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 18</span></div></div>",

Suguha was raised along with him as his sister. She is an accomplished kendo practitioner, following her grandfather's wishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuguha has short black hair and dark grey eyes, almost blackish. Her breasts are also much larger than the rest of the female characters shown so far although the novel mentions that she has grown a lot recently. She also has a cute childish look and is often seen with an embarrassed expression, especially when around her cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to her kendo training, she has strong and defined muscles that show up even when she makes small movements. In one volume, Kazuto has described her as monstrously muscular and although he claims he is exaggerating, he does state that she is heavier than she looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 16</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Added Bio to Suguha/Leafa: Unlike her cousin Kazuto, Suguha is upbeat and outgoing. She is much more social and converses easily with others. Even when Kazuto began to push her away after finding out they were not really siblings, she still treated him with good spirit and tried to get back in his life. She can be very aggressive towards those that annoy her or cross her and can easily lose her temper. This is demonstrated in one case when Recon attempted to kiss her after confessing his love to her and she punched him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her positive outlook and slightly aggressive behavior, Suguha can be somewhat fragile and delicate due to her young age, especially when her cousin, Kazuto is involved. After seeing Kazuto in a comatose state due to being locked in SAO, she broke down crying for the first time in years. In addition to this, once she found out that Kirito and Kazuto were the same person, she locked herself in her room away from her cousin and went into a slight depression. Most of the time she is quick to rebound from these moments and return to being the same upbeat girl.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------<br>\r\nLooks: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MoWpJWknuEY/ULt0zxWGz4I/AAAAAAAAAqk/RUSxnX26dSk/s1600/Leafa+Magestial+Cute+HD+Render.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MoWpJWknuEY/UL...</a> / <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.milsims.com.au/sites/milsims.com.au/files/imagecache/product_full/prodimg/sao_-_leafa_figure-443531397873387d.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.milsims.com.au/sites/milsims....</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 16<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She also has a deep attachment to Pina (her pet feather dragon) and was very sad to see it die, but was overjoyed when she had the opportunity to revive her beloved pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is also easily embarrassed and flustered, especially when it comes to a romance scenario, such as grabbing Kirito's hand or spotting many couples around her.

She is hardworking and takes great pride in her abilities as a blacksmith. She will become very defensive and aggressive if someone were to challenge her pride as a blacksmith much like Kirito did after accidentally breaking the best sword she had created. She, also similar to Sinon, has a bad temper and can get somewhat violent, such as when she grabbed Kirito by the collar after he broke one of her best swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisbeth is very teasing as well, almost always teasing Asuna about her relationship with Kirito despite having feelings for him herself. She cares for Asuna very much, and despite having a chance to tell Kirito how she feels she backed off because she knew that Asuna already had feelings for Kirito, before she met him. She does not hold anything against Asuna, despite being depressed that her friend and Kirito formed a strong relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 18</span></div></div>",

As Daisy stood with awe at her new size, the toads and residents of the mushroom kingdom weren't feeling so amazed. Panic struck out quickly in the streets of the city; people mowed each other down to run into the subway stations in hopes that they wouldn't be stepped on or tortured. Daisy bent over the city and tried to calm people down, but she didn't make any steps, in fear of stepping on citizens<br>\r\n      She stood motionless in her position, arms crossed, when she noticed a \"small\" plane flying toward her. Daisy instantly took this as a threat to slash her neck, and held her hands up to crash the plane and catch it. The propeller cut up her hand a bit, but she was fine otherwise. The plane had fallen into her hand right side up only missing a wing, but it wasn't flaming. The pilot of the plane stepped out of the plane and gazed up at the worried look of Daisy.<br>\r\n      \"Oh my god, are you alright? I had to stop you, but I was afraid if I caught you I'd crush you and you were coming for my thought, and...I, hope I didn't hurt you, are you alright?\" Daisy panicked, for she feared she killed an innocent life.<br>\r\n      \"I'm fine\", the pilot said, as he took off his helmet, \"I was sent to give you a message from Princess Toadstool\"<br>\r\n      Daisy was surprised the pilot didn't suffer any serious injuries, but needed to know the message from her cousin. \"What did she say? did I hurt anybody when I grew?\"<br>\r\n      \"No,\" the pilot said reassuringly (but he didn't know for sure), \"she said to meet her behind the castle for safety measures, and the area around the castle was cleared of people.\"<br>\r\n      \"Oh, thank you.

Any kind of growth- female or male- is allowed, just don't get too much into the toilet stuff and we'll be fine. I'm going to focus at first on anime that I don't see covered in any other of these types of stories, but if you want to try a more traditional one, be my guest. Just please make sure to leave open the Other option at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUPDATE (5/7): Since apparently the word \"growth\" in the title rather than generic GTS/GT story wasn't enough of a hint to some people, this is strictly a growth-only story. THERE ARE NO SHRINKING ENTRIES ALLOWED, PERIOD. Any shrinking entries will be deleted by me personally as soon as I see them. I don't care if you think I'm a control freak, I hate shrinking and don't want it in my story. If you don't like that, tough, go make your own story and include all the shrinking you want. If you want to write in my story, it's gonna be growth only, and that's all there is to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollow the rules and we'll be fine. Thanks.</td>",
