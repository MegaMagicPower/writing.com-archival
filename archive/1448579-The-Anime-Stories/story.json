You saw all the business and happy faces all around, almost bringing a smile to your face. But a young red haired boy, who need seemed to be the same age as you, standing in an alleyway all by himself. He was carrying a large gourd that looked to big for his body. The boy looked lonely, so you went up to him hoping to make a new friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hi, there. I'm Tenmaku.\" You told while holding out your hand. \"What's your name?\"  The red haired looked up at you with large icy blue eyes. His face showed no emotion. The boy looked as if he wanted to kill you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm Gaara.\" Gaara didn't shake your hand, but he continued to stare at you. \"I've never seen you before. Where are you from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You grinned. \"Don't worry, I'm just a traveler. Just passing through the village.\" Gaara then turned away from you and walked into the busy road. But not wanting to end the conversation, you followed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gaara kept looking back, but he didn't say anything. You wondered what he was thinking about. \"Why are you following? Don't you know who I am? I could kill you if I wanted to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know who you are, I just don't care about titles. Your a potential friend. And I like having friends.\" You smiled goofily. He stopped dead in his tracks, turned around, and looked you directly in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You remind me of a bo....no friend, I made in the Hidden Leaf. He always had a goofy grin on his face and was able to make friends quickly.\" He then turned around again and continued on his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, Gaara, I'll be taking myself to the orphanage.\" And you started walking away. \"Tenmaku, if you don't have a place to stay, I'd be happy to have you over. My siblings won't mind.\" <br>\r\n\"I accept. Thank you, Gaara.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Gaara's home<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The home was modest. Not too large or small. Currently, Gaara and his siblings were talking. You didn't hear what they were talking about, but it definitely was about you. Within 20 minutes, they came out of the room, solemnly. The girl that Gaara that identified as Temari spoke first,\" We understand you don't have a place to stay or go, but you must prove yourself useful to some degree to stay any longer than a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\" I can cook and clean, if y'all want.\" They then murmured amongst themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You can stay for now, but Temari wants to talk with you in private.\" Gaara told you, monotonous. \"Gaara, the new kazekage wants us,\" Kankuro told him.Temari then grabbed you by your shirt. \"Temari, don't hurt him too bad.\" And Gaara and Kankuro, walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You first task is to service my feet, any objections. None okay, you may begin.\" Temari then went sat on her couch. \"Hand me that footstool in the corner over there.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You never would have suspected that such a normal day would take such a drastic twist very soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are in the middle of watching an episode, the TV screen suddenly turned completely black. You wondered what had happened, and you were shocked when a symbol that resembled the curse mark on Anko Mitarashi's neck appeared onscreen. Monents later, what appeared to be an enormous snake's tail shot out of the center of the screen and wrapped around you! You panicked and began to struggle, but the snake was too strong. It then proceeded to drag you along with it back into the TV screen. After that, you blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you came to, you found yourself tied to a wall and staring eye to eye with one of your favorite characters: Anko Mitarashi herself! Anko was smiling at you deviously as she stoked the head of a snake that was coiled around her. You could only assume that it was the same snake that pulled you into this world in the first place. The look that Anko was giving you scared you deeply. You didn't know exactly what she had planned, but you did know that it probably wasn't going to be enjoyable for you. You decide to question her about why she brought you here, among other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I demand some answers! Why am I tied up, where am I, and why did you have your snake drag me here in the first place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well... Aren't you the feisty one? Just regained consciousness and already you're asking questions... Fine, I suppose I'll answer you. Your tied up because it makes it easier for me to deal with you without any resistance, You're currently in a little hut of mine not too far outside the hidden leaf village, and as for why I had my pet bring you here...\"</span></div></div>",

I can't find any more good pictures. But maybe you'll find some)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was able to get a tour of the Titan Tower with some of my friends. Our tour guide was Beast Boy. I honestly thought he was trying too hard to be funny, but I still laughed at his jokes and whatnot to keep him in his good mood. We met Robin, who was real busy working on the computer, but I was fortunate enough to shake his hand and get his autograph. Then we went to the garage, where I saw all their cool gadgets and vehicles. Cyborg was there working on his car which had the same designs as the robotic parts of his body. <br>\r\nNext, we headed to the other floors, where we were greeted kindly by Starfire, my second favorite teen titan. She was floating in front of us in her bath robe as she had just finished taking a shower. She had a towel wrapped around her hair. I was able to get a good view of her bare feet without being caught staring at them. She had green nail polish painted on her nicely shaped toenails. I could tell right away that they were soft and clean. I wished I could become her butler or foot cleaner or something, just to be able to look at those nice feet of hers all day. I sighed. She came down to shake our hands and give us her autograph, which she must have been taught recently, as her signature didn't really look like a real one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy then led us to the rooms. I was excited since we were going to see Raven next. But before we could go to her room, Beast Boy showed us his room, which was a complete mess. There were clothes, food, and comic books scattered everywhere. A horrible odor emanated from inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, you can see the best room in the Titan Tower.\" He said with a smile. I couldn't tell if he was serious or not. Me and my friends smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, we headed to Raven's room. It had a \"Go Away\" sign on the door, but that didn't stop Beast Boy from banging on the door and yelling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Raven! The tourists are here!\" Beast Boy said. \"Don't you wanna meet them? I know you want toooooo!\"<br>\r\nThe door slowly slid open. Raven revealed herself, but only showing half her face. She wore her usual outfit and had her hood on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... hi.\" Raven said to us quietly, quickly glancing at me and my friends. Then she gave Beast Boy an angry look and slid the door closed. <br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Beast Boy replied. He gave a little pout before leading us to the other rooms. But I couldn't follow. I wanted to talk to Raven one-on-one. I also wasn't able to see if she was barefoot or not. So as Beast Boy made a turn in the hallway, I slowed to a stop and went back quietly to Raven's door. I was completely nervous but I managed to knock on the door softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Raven must have known it wasn't Beast Boy since there wasn't any banging on her door. She opened it slowly again. <br>\r\n\"...May I help you?\" She asked in her usual monotone voice. <br>\r\n\"Uhh.... yeah.\" I stammered. \"I was... uhh... just wondering if we could talk? You know...me being like, your biggest fan and everything.\"<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not.\" Raven said to me as she began turning away. <br>\r\n\"Please, Raven?\" I desperately begged. \"I've been wishing my whole life to be able to talk to you!\"<br>\r\nShe turned to face me again and sighed as she rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Fine. But make it quick. I've got some meditating to do.\"<br>\r\nShe opened the door all the way and let me in.<br>\r\n\"But do NOT touch ANYTHING.\" She warned. \"Is that clear?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhh, yeah! Of course! Don't touch. Got it.\"<br>\r\nShe closed the door as I walked inside. I was pretty creeped out by all the freaky figures with their evil-looking red eyes coming from all parts of the room. There was a round bed at the opposite end of the door, with a mirror on the left wall. She sat down on the end of her bed and placed her right foot on her left thigh. I sat on the small bench in front of the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....,\" she started. \"Are you going to interview me or something?\"<br>\r\nI caught myself staring at her right foot. I didn't know what to call her footwear. Was it a shoe, a slip-on, or a boot? I decided to just call it a boot. They were loose around the ankles and were pretty soft and flexible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... uhh....\" I thought. \"Could you explain where you came from?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" She said plainly. She didn't say anything else. She began removing her right boot. I found myself staring again. The boot slid off smoothly and gracefully. The whole event seemed to go in slow motion. <br>\r\nThen, I finally saw it; her amazingly perfect foot. It was gray(obviously) but I didn't care. I could tell how soft they really were just by looking at it. She scrunched her toes a bit and I quickly saw the wrinkles it temporarily made on her sole. She placed her boot on the ground and then removed her left boot. I turned away right before she looked back at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\" She said, slightly impatient. <br>\r\n\"Uhh.....\" I thought hard. \"Uhh.....Oh yeah. Could you explain your powers?\"<br>\r\nRaven sighed. \"I suppose....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began talking about her ability to move objects and people with magic. I tried listening attentively, but couldn't stop making quick glances at her feet which were flat on the floor. She must have noticed, since she crossed her legs, concealing her feet under her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must've been a while since she last talked about herself. She started talking about this one incident where a part of her broke loose and she had to control it. She said she had to go inside a mirror to fetch Beast Boy and Cyborg and said that the mirror was a portal to get inside her mind, but not literally. It was more like another dimension with her \"other selves\". The thorough detail of the dimension made me shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no idea how I was going to be able to get another look at her feet, much less taste them or something. But then I had it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" I began. \"It must be real tough being a superhero.\"<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\" Raven replied, still keeping the monotone voice with her arms crossed. <br>\r\n\"Are you tired?\" I asked. <br>\r\n\"Right now?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course. And my feet are killing me.\"<br>\r\nThe famous foot-massage line, I thought to myself. <br>\r\n\"Really? Why?\"<br>\r\n\"We just caught some bad guy. The sneaky guy captured the rest of the team and led me into his gravity lair. I was forced to fight him without levitation. I'm not used to running.\" She explained. <br>\r\n\"Ahh I see. Well, I suppose that the least I can do is massage your feet.\" I surprised myself. I was actually able to get those words out of my mouth clearly. <br>\r\n\"No thanks. It'll heal during my meditation.\"<br>\r\nI had completely forgot she mentioned that. I recall her saying something about meditation, but I was too busy staring at her feet. <br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" I asked. <br>\r\n\"Yes. I don't want it to be such a hassle.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, no. It's not. Please. In fact, it would be an honor if I could.\" I said with a smile. <br>\r\nShe sighed but agreed. \"Suit yourself.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's no problem at all.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you any good at massaging at least?\"<br>\r\n\"I was told that I am.\" I lied. I've never had the opportunity to massage a girl's feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see.\" She said. She un-crossed her legs and placed her feet on my knees, one foot at a time. I picked up her feet and examined it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. You really do take care of your feet, huh? They're the prettiest feet I've seen yet.\"<br>\r\n\"...Thanks, I guess?\" She said awkwardly. <br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. You know, there was this one time--\"<br>\r\n\"Uhh...could you just massage my feet already?\"<br>\r\nI frowned a bit but obeyed. \"Ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Raven gave a big sigh of relief. <br>\r\n\"Ahh, that feels goooood.\" She said. I was surprised to see her crack a little smile. <br>\r\nShe laid back with her hands under her head. Then she closed her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued massaging the arc, or middle, of her foot. Since she had her eyes closed, I leaned forward and took in a few quiet deep breaths, exhaling away from her foot to not give myself away. It didn't have a bad smell. It actually smelled like a mixture of the inside of a shoe and sweaty palms. I loved the smell, but I kept my tongue to myself and leaned back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then massaged her heel a little longer, since it seemed to feel good for her. It was obviously slightly harder than the other parts of the foot, but I was amazed that it wasn't rough like most peoples' heels. <br>\r\nThen I massaged the middle of her toes. She would occassionally scrunch her toes when I slowly ran my fingers between the toes, allowing me to feel the warm toes quickly against the back of my fingers. <br>\r\nI finished the massage of her left foot by massaging the ball, arc, heel, and toes again. Then I repeated the same massage on the right foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven had surprisingly fallen asleep during the massage of her right foot, but I still finished the massage. <br>\r\nI didn't know what to do next. So many ideas began popping in my mind as I looked around the room, imagining all the possibilities. Should I wake her up? Look at the stuff around her room? Wait until she wakes up? See how deep she's fallen asleep before I try to undress her or worship her feet? Steal her boots and socks for souvenirs? Smell her boots? Go back to the group?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to first see how asleep she was, just to be safe. I tapped her shoulder. She didn't wake. I said hello in a normal volume. She was still sleeping. I took advantage of this time to quietly go through her dirty laundry. Her socks were thin and white. I took four of her socks, putting two in my backpack and shoving two in my mouth. Then I looked in her closet and found three extra pairs of her boots, so I took the ones she was just wearing and replaced them with new ones. I dug my nose and mouth in her loose boot and took plenty of deep breaths. They were fantastic. I took the socks out of my mouth and put my face in her boot again, this time licking the insoles. When I was done with the boots, I put them in my backpack, along with some black bras and panties I sniffed from her laundry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I sat there, thinking of what to do next. Raven was curled on her bed, palms together and under the side of her head. I stared at her feet. I didn't know what to do. A part of me felt the urge to start licking and sucking, another part told me it was too risky, and the last told me to undress her. I became frustrated, for I knew I was running out of time. <br>\r\nIf I worship her feet, she might wake up, call me a freak, tell the titans what I did, and kick me out. If I leave or wait for her to wake up, the tour would be over and I would most likely end up regretting not taking the opportunity. But if I undress her and record or take pictures.....well, let's just say I would be able to see the best thing I ever saw, ignoring the deadly consequences that would inevitably fall upon me. I would consider it worth it, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to make my choice.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nIt was now or never. I couldn't resist the temptation, so I approached her sleeping body, looking at her face. <br>\r\nI straightened out her body then reached for her chest area and touched it first to see if she'd wake up. She didn't. After feeling much relief but still sweating, I slowly and very carefully peeled her clothes off. It was like deactivating a bomb; one screw-up and you're dead. I knew it was only a matter of time before she wakes up. <br>\r\nI finally peeled down the clothes off her torso, revealing two huge, nicely placed breasts. Her tits weren't huge like the size of a gatorade bottle cap, like I've seen in a few pictures on the internet. I thought those were just disgusting. Raven's were about the size of a quarter. The perfect size for my taste. I didn't risk squeezing them, but I did poke it gently to feel how soft they were. My dick instantly grew from seeing such perfect breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't want to waste any time taking pictures yet. Instead, I did the unthinkable. <br>\r\nSeeing as how deep of a sleep Raven was in, I decided to do it. Like before, I slowly and gently pulled down the clothes that covered her lower area. I didn't whether to call it a superhero speedy or a superhero underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was finally removed, revealing a thin, black panty. I removed it too. <br>\r\nI finally exposed her pussy. I was full of excitement that my dick had already grown. I fixed my pants so it wasn't as visible and leaned in to get a good look. It was moist, but not sweating. Then I remembered that I was supposed to be taking pictures on my phone, which took pictures in good quality. So I began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before I switched to camera on my phone. I set myself up for the best angle and got the best focus for it. Then I pressed the button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ka-CHOOK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!!!\" I whispered. I had forgot to put my phone on silent. The click of the camera was really loud. I looked at Raven. She was rubbing her eyes with the back of her hand and sat up. Then she saw me, with my phone pointed at her body. She instantly knew what was going on and gave a huge gasp as she used her right arm to cover her breasts and her left hand to cover her pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing?!\" Raven exclaimed. <br>\r\nI didn't know what to say. My face was red and I was sweating a lot more. To me, the room seemed to be incredibly hot. <br>\r\n\"Uhhh.....\" I glanced to my sides as I slowly walked backwards, away from her. She had already pulled her clothes back up and was furiously waiting for a reply. I still didn't answer.<br>\r\n\"I thought you were worth being trusted! But you proved to be just another perverted criminal!\" Raven said. <br>\r\nI had no explanation. She walked towards me and muttered her magic words while pointing her palm at me. Black magic surrounded her hand and burned from her eyes. My body was then encased in the black magic, squeezing me tight. I thought that these were the last moments of my pitiful life. Raven quickly pointed her palm down, and I was slammed into the ground at her bare feet. My head was laying on its side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid her feet under my chin and raised my head up.<br>\r\n\"I'm.....sorry....Raven....\" I managed to say, with her foot still lifting my head up to face her. She gave me a mean look and stopped the black magic. <br>\r\nRaven turned my head with the back of her foot to face my left. She had her left foot next to my head and placed her right foot firmly on my cheek, then put her right hand on her right knee as she bent down so I could see her face, which was tilted left to be near parallel to mine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say?!\" Raven said, still extremely furious. <br>\r\n\"I shed I'm shaw-rry\" I tried to repeat, but her foot on my cheek didn't allow me to say it clearly. But Raven understood. <br>\r\n\"Hmph.\" She replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I managed to lean on my left forearm and got a good view of Raven. She had her back turned and was facing the mirror that was against the wall. I saw her reach for something on the table. It was a small, scary-looking oval mirror. She held it in one hand and walked back to me. <br>\r\nRaven bent down and grabbed my cheeks with one hand. With the other hand, she held the mirror up to my face but I turned away. I knew exactly where it would take me. Raven slapped me hard in the face and grabbed my cheeks again. This time I decided to look into the mirror. But instead of seeing my own reflection, I saw a demon staring at me. It opened its mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven let go of my face and I was instantly sucked into the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up in a daze and a bruise on my head. I must've fallen. I stood up and looked around. I was in the dimension that was \"in Raven's head\". It looked like space, but mixed with red. I was standing on a wide, floating strip of gray land. There were black ravens cawing at me from dead trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there!\" said a voice from behind me. She made me jump and I spun around to see who it was. <br>\r\nIt was Raven, dressed in a pink robe with a hood, exactly the same as the Raven that sent me here. But something seemed odd about her. For one, she was wearing pink instead of blue. And two, she had a huge smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raven?\" I asked to make sure.<br>\r\n\"Yup! And who are you?\" she said. <br>\r\nI still had a puzzled look on my face. Then I remembered what Raven told me. This place is her mind, with all parts of her. This girl in pink must be one of her \"parts\". I wasted no time. I asked the pink Raven how to get out of here. She said to the other end of this strip of land and warned me by saying she wouldn't recommend going if she were me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I had no other choice. Though worried of what I knew what was in store for me, I walked with pink Raven through the first portal: the garden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were only flowers all around, and pink trees. There was one dirt path to follow. Pink Raven was skipping around the field as I walked to the other end. Once I passed the end of the portal, everything went back to the way it was. <br>\r\nI continued walking until I came across another Raven wearing gray. I tried to say hi but she gave me a timid look and turned away. I walked towards her and introduced myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there. You must be Raven.\" I said. She nodded. <br>\r\n\"Do you know the way out of here?\" I asked. She nodded again. <br>\r\n\"Could you show me the way?\" <br>\r\n\"...I can.\" She finally spoke. \"....But you won't like me once we reach the end....\"<br>\r\n\"That's alright.\" I tried to convince her. \"There's no where else to go, anyway.\" <br>\r\nI already knew what was on the other side. The real Raven also explained that. Anyway, gray Raven walked with me towards the Forbidden Door until we were stopped by a gray wall that spawned in front of us. More walls came out from the ground, surrounding us from all sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a maze, right?\" I said. \"And I'm guessing you know how to get out?\"<br>\r\nGray Raven nodded a third time. <br>\r\nShe showed me the way, which didn't take too long. I tried having a conversation with her, but whenever I did, her face would turn red before she turned away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe reached the end of the maze, where I was greeted by two tall stone statues that moved out of their place to try and kill me with their swords. I threw myself to the side, where I had to dodge the other one coming at me. They were slow, but I knew I would die if I got hit. Luckily, a war cry came from behind me and I turned around. A figure in a green cloak jumped over me and destroyed one of the statues. I tried to catch a good view of what was going on, but it was too much of a blur. Then I saw the other statue crumbled. <br>\r\nThe green figure ran towards me and stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! Yeah! Woo-hoo!\" She exclaimed. It was green Raven. She stuck her palm out and I gave her a high-five. I felt her soft, warm hands against mine. It made me think of how soft her feet must be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, you must be Raven.\" I repeated. <br>\r\n\"Sure am!\" she replied. I wanted to leave then, so I walked to the Forbidden Door. But I was stopped by a mean voice from behind me. I turned around. It was yet another Raven, but in red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop. You can't leave.\" she ordered.<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" I asked impatiently. <br>\r\n\"There's a reason why it's called the 'Forbidden Door'\", said a Raven in yellow from my right. She was wearing glasses. <br>\r\n\"Exactly\", said an orange Raven from my left. She burped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man. So many Ravens....\" I said. The pink Raven giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the real Raven entered the scene from above. She had her arms crossed and still looked mad at me. <br>\r\n\"This is your punishment.....for now\", she said. <br>\r\n\"Huh? What is?\", I asked. She ignored me and turned away to speak to the other Ravens, who had gathered around behind her. I guess they were brainstorming on what my \"punishment\" should be. I heard pink Raven giggle at the plans, and she jumped around excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha! That sounds like fun!\", I heard her say. <br>\r\nThey broke up and the real Raven gave me an angry look before going through the Forbidden Door. <br>\r\nI frowned. I didn't want her to be so mad at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ravens gathered around me. Red Raven kicked me to the ground. I was on my back, looking up at the Ravens that were looking down at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should explain what Raven told us\", gray Raven suggested to her fellow Ravens. <br>\r\n\"I suppose so\", yellow Raven said as she pushed her glasses up with her finger. \"I don't see the harm in doing so.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok. You explain it, then.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright\", yellow Raven said. \"Master Raven told us what you did, and honestly, I think that's so disgraceful of you. Anyway, though not exactly punishment, she said she wanted to test your capabilities for her experiments. You're going to be our guinea pig until she comes back.\"<br>\r\n\"Hehehe. Shall we get started?\" red Raven asked sadistically.<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" yellow Raven said. \"There are three experiments she told us to do. One: test your balancing abilities. Two: test your running endurance. And Three: test your service abilities. Any objections?\"<br>\r\n\"I have a choice in this?\" I asked. <br>\r\n\"Nope!\" pink Raven said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Let's see how balanced and strong you really are.\"<br>\r\nPink Raven placed one book on my head and gave me the rest. I was holding four textbooks. <br>\r\n\"Hold the textbooks in one hand like a waiter, dumby!\", pink Raven said. I obeyed. It was a lot harder for me now. My hand was shaking. <br>\r\n\"Wow. You can't even keep it steady!\", green Raven said. \"You fail!\"<br>\r\nYellow Raven seemed to agree and told her to remove the books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like you're not good to be a waiter for the titans\", she said. \"For the next test, we'll see how long and fast you can run.\"<br>\r\n\"What kind of tests are these, anyway?\" I asked. \"Am I gonna be some sorta butler?\"<br>\r\n\"Duh\" orange Raven answered. I sulked. <br>\r\n\"Run from here to the other end and back. Now!\" red Raven commanded as she pointed to where I was supposed to go. Pink Raven giggled again, and I was forced to run. I was shocked to see how out of shape I really was. I walked back, trying to catch my breath. <br>\r\n\"Failed again?!\" green Raven exclaimed. \"You're really pathetic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well\", yellow Raven said. \"I'm sure he can get the last test right. It doesn't require any physical strength.\"<br>\r\n\"What now?\" I asked, still panting.<br>\r\n\"Well, Raven gave me a list of what you're supposed to do for the last test.\"<br>\r\nShe looked a little confused and analyzed the list. <br>\r\n\"Hmm. Interesting.\" She said. \"All of them pertain to foot service. Hmph. Maybe she wants you to be her personal foot slave.\" She giggled at her own comment. <br>\r\n\"Such as...?\" I curiously asked. <br>\r\n\"She told me that she noticed you staring at her feet, so she figured you have a foot fetish, which means you'll most likely be good at anything that has to do with feet.\"<br>\r\nI was surprised to hear this. I could've sworn she didn't catch me staring at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha!\" pink Raven laughed. \"You like feet?! That's so weird.\"<br>\r\nI blushed. <br>\r\n\"Raven\", yellow Raven said. \"You have to respect other peoples' opinions.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, ok.\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, if Raven is correct about your foot fetish, then you should have no problem with the final test. Shall we get started?\" yellow Raven asked. I didn't know what to say.

We already heard that you're good with massages, so first we'll see how well you can paint toenails.\" yellow Raven explained. She summoned pink Raven over. She had a pink nail polish bottle in her hand. Yellow Raven told us to sit down. Then, pink Raven extended her legs towards me and told me to remove her boots, so I took them off. <br>\r\n\"Ya know, the smell of the nail polish is pretty strong. Wanna cover your nose with something?\" she asked. <br>\r\n\"With what?\" I asked. <br>\r\n\"Uhh....I don't know\", pink Raven replied. <br>\r\nYellow Raven came forward. <br>\r\n\"Oh! I've got just the thing.\" she said. She grabbed one of pink Raven's boots and used a rope to tie the boot on my face, the mouth of the boot covering up my nose and mouth. I was relieved. I would be able to paint pink Raven's toenails while smelling the inside of her boot the whole time! It smelled just like the real Raven's boot. I licked the insole of her boot while I painted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finished the job, proud of my work. I was complimented by pink and yellow Raven. <br>\r\n\"Wow. Impressive.\" yellow Raven said. \"You pass this part of the experiment. Next....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was told that I was to be tested on how good of a chair and footstool I could be. I went on the ground, similar to the push up position but with my forearms rested on the floor. Green Raven sat on my back for twenty minutes and would sometimes ruffle my hair or stroke my back. I endured only ten minutes of holding her up. <br>\r\nAfter giving me a disappointed look, yellow Raven told me to sit down in front of a tall stone. It was about two feet high. I sat down and crossed my legs. <br>\r\nNext, she sat on the stone and positioned my face so I would be looking up. She opened my mouth and placed her heel into my mouth with her other leg crossed on top of the other leg. She said I would have last one hour in this position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was actually pretty easy. I looked at her sole most of the time and she often scrunched her toes. I accidentally licked her heel, but she said it felt kinda good, so I licked her heel through the remainder of the time. <br>\r\nOnce I was finished, she removed her feet and I was free to stretch out my neck. It was extremely stiff and it took me a while to stretch it out completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that wasn't too bad.\" she said. \"I bet you enjoyed yourself.\"<br>\r\nI blushed. <br>\r\n\"Now, for the final experiment of the Third Test, you'll have to clean one of our feet by using some materials for the first set, and your tongue for the second.\"<br>\r\nMy tongue?! Did I just hear what she thought I said?! This was truly amazing. I didn't think it could get any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll start by cleaning green Raven's feet.\" yellow Raven said. <br>\r\n\"Ok.\" I answered. <br>\r\nShe sat on the stone and I was given a rag, soap, and a bucket of water. She removed her boots and I instantly smelled a bad foot odor. <br>\r\n\"Uhh....\" I said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" green Raven asked. <br>\r\n\"If it's not a big deal....could you tie pink Raven's boot on me again?\"<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha, why? Is it the smell of my feet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't want to answer, so I blushed and turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if my feet smell THAT bad....\" she said. \"But why not someone else's boots? Lemme see....\"<br>\r\nShe looked around at the others. Then she spotted Gray Raven sitting down with her knees up and arms wrapped comfortably around her legs. <br>\r\n\"Hey, Gray!\" Green Raven called. \"Could you give me your boot for a sec?\" <br>\r\nShe removed her boot, slowly stood up, and give Raven her boot. Then Green Raven shoved the mouth of the boot onto my face and used a rope to tie it in place like before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Now start cleaning!\" she demanded with a small smile on her face. <br>\r\nIt was pretty boring. I simply used the rag to clean her feet. No good interactions with her feet, besides the occasional kick to the face when it tickles her, leaving some suds on my cheek and nose. <br>\r\nBut as I scrubbed, I couldn't help but long for the original Raven. And for some reason....gray Raven, too. <br>\r\nI would often glance at her timid self. There she sat on my left, hood on and drawing on the dirt with her finger. She would also give me quick glances but would turn away when we made eye contact. I wanted to talk to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was done cleaning green Raven's feet and reflecting on my degraded life as I cleaned, yellow Raven came up to me. <br>\r\n\"Well done.\" She told me. \"Now for the last test, which shouldn't be a problem for you, I want you to use your mouth and tongue to clean one of our feet.\"<br>\r\nThe words blew away my mind. After a boring and tedious test, I was finally going to get with some feet. <br>\r\n\"And since you did so well on cleaning green Raven's feet.....I'll let you choose who's feet you want to clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. This was the moment I've been waiting for since I got here. The only hard part was deciding who to pick. I thought about it pretty hard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Then, I chose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, I guess I'll pick.....gray Raven\" I said. She looked at me with a blush and had her fingers loosely placed on her lips. Then she looked away but still faced me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gray Raven it is, then\", yellow Raven concluded. Gray Raven seemed to reluctantly walk towards me. She sat down in front of me and went back to the same position she was in before, with her knees up and arms around her legs. She wasn't looking at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, Raven. I don't bite.\" I tried to comfort her. She finally looked at me. <br>\r\n\"...T-thanks....\" she whispered. \"....I'm sorry that I have to do this to you...\"<br>\r\n\"No no no. It's ok. Really. I don't mind.\" She gave me a tiny smile and took off her remaining boot.<br>\r\n\"....Uhh....what do I do now...?\" she asked yellow Raven. <br>\r\n\"I think you know what to do.\" she said to me. I gave her a slight nod, then I reached for gray Raven's feet as she slowly moved it towards me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave it a quick but thorough examination before I placed both of her soles on my face. She had her fingers on her lips again. I held her right foot on the left half of my face as I licked her left foot. Her feet were silky smooth and very soft. It had the smell of sweaty palms. I rubbed her foot against my face while I licked the other. Then i put her toes into my mouth and began sucking all the small sweaty moisture from her feet. <br>\r\nI started getting really into it. I removed her foot from my face for a while. I slowly turned my body while still sucking her other foot until I was laying on my back so that she would be facing the right side of my head. After she firmly rested her left foot on my forehead, I turned my head towards her and held the other foot with both of my hands, sucking her toes and heel and licking the bottom of her foot. I was delighted to feel her foot slowly rubbing my face and forehead. <br>\r\nI began licking her ankle and slowly worked my way up to her thighs, but she was too timid to tell me to stop. She had her leg fully extended for me. Red Raven saw this after a few moments and slapped the back of my head, telling me to stay on the foot, so I obeyed. <br>\r\nI laid on my stomach and put both of her big toes into my mouth. I ran my tongue around both of the toes, then I licked the soft underside of her toes, also getting in between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as soon as I was getting comfortable, Yellow Raven stopped me. I was dismayed, but I slowly placed her feet down, put her boots back on, and gave her a weak smile, and she returned the favor. When none of the Ravens were looking, she gave me a quick kiss on the lips before I stood up. She gave me occassional smiles after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I stood up, I was slapped on the cheek. It felt familiar. I looked and saw that it was original Raven that slapped me. <br>\r\n\"So....are we done here?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\" yellow Raven said. \"I believe he did....exceptionally well today.\"<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear. I suppose I'll be taking him back now.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\" she repeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe original Raven grabbed me by my arm and pulled me with her to the exit. I stumbled as she pulled me since I was looking behind. There she was, still sitting down, but this time she was looking at me. Actually, she was waving good-bye. She had a sad look on her face. I managed to wave back at her before going through the portal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nSo back we were into Raven's room. Nothing's changed. I stood, unable to speak in her presence. I was now ashamed of what I did. I've embarrassed my favorite heroine and I wanted to make it up to her....somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on your knees\", Raven commanded me. Not wanting to upset her any more, I quickly obeyed. She turned around and looked down at me. <br>\r\n\"Why did you do it?\" she asked me. But yet again, I was speechless. She shook her head and sighed. <br>\r\n\"Well, I don't even know if I should let you back out of here, now that you've exposed me.\" She thought for a little bit, then seemed to remember something. \"Where's your backpack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pointed to my backpack, which was next to the door. She picked it up and looked through it. She found her boots, the two pairs of socks, a bra, and a panty. She gave me a disgusted look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe this....\" she said. \"You were planning on leaving here with my clothes?! And why are my socks wet?\"<br>\r\nI didn't know what to say. No matter what I said, it would just make me look bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what am I going to do with you, huh?\" she asked me. \"Maybe I'll just publicly announce it. I'll tell the press that you 'attempted' to undress me, permanently ruining your life. All the girls will be disgusted by you. They won't listen to your pathetic attempts to tell them that I was wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI absolutely did not want that to happen. She was right. Doing that would ruin my life forever. So I had to beg her not to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please, Raven! Don't do that! I'll do anything if you don't!\" <br>\r\n\"I knew you'd say that. But what could you possibly do for me?\" <br>\r\n\"I don't know. Just think of something. Anything. I'll do it.\" I pleaded. But inside, there was only one thing on my mind, and I was just waiting for her to say it. Why else would she have made me go through those tests?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to make you my slave. Is that correct?\" <br>\r\nBingo! I thought to myself. <br>\r\n\"Even if I wanted you to, I still don't see what you could do for me, or for the titans.\"<br>\r\n\"Uhh...I could just be your luxury slave.\" I suggested to her. <br>\r\n\"How so?\" she asked. She seemed to be curious as to what I had to propose. <br>\r\n\"Well....I don't know. I found an article online saying that a girl likes it when a guy licks her feet. They say it feels good.\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm.... I'm still not convinced.\"<br>\r\n\"Foot massages?\"<br>\r\n\"Still not enough.\"<br>\r\n\"What if I just do anything you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n\"That's so vague.\"<br>\r\n\"Anything.\" I repeated. <br>\r\n\"Anything?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\nShe thought for a few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long are you willing on doing this?\" she asked me.<br>\r\n\"However long you think it'll take me to repay you. And I promise I won't mention what I did to anyone.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it'll take a very long time to make up for what you did.\"<br>\r\n\"So it's a deal, then?\"<br>\r\nShe paused.<br>\r\n\"Fine. I suppose you're basically the titans' pet now. But I think it'll be awkward if you're human.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"I mean, it's not typical for a human to have a human pet.\"<br>\r\n\"But what am I supposed to do about that?\"<br>\r\n\"I can transform you into a dwarf. At least then we'll feel more superior when we look at you.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's a good idea. I like my body.\"<br>\r\n\"Well I don't. And we're gonna have to fix that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven went to her bookshelf and began running her finger through the books. Then she grabbed what she was looking for; a spell book. She flipped through the pages. <br>\r\n\"There. The shape-shifting spell.\" she said. \"Such an easy spell to cast. Ready?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhh, not really. Can we talk this over first?\" I pleaded. But it was too late. Pink light glowed from her hand. Slowly, the room seemed to be getting bigger. I looked at my hands and feet. They were becoming smaller and smaller. Then I looked at Raven. She was looking down at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooo!\" I screamed. \"I didn't want this!\"<br>\r\n\"You said you'd do anything.\"<br>\r\n\"But.....but....\" I couldn't argue. I promised I'd do anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven put the book away. I stood on the small bench to see myself in the mirror. My whole body seemed slightly wider proportionally. I was a skinny midget. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should ask Robin for his consent on this.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?! Don't you think you should've done that before you shrunk me two feet tall?!\"<br>\r\n\"I could've. But your chances of becoming my...or our, slave pet, is better when you're small and inferior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess that was kind of true. Raven grabbed a leash and collar, put it on me, and yanked me as she opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tour should be over by now. Your friends most likely already left, but that would mean that Beast Boy is wondering where you are....if he remembered you were on the tour.\"<br>\r\n\"I doubt it. I was pretty quiet the whole time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, I should re-introduce you to the team now.\" she told me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nBut it was then that I actually thought about it. It would be very embarrassing and tiring if I were a pet slave for ALL the titans. Being Raven's personal slave would be an easier job for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Raven.\" I said. <br>\r\n\"What now?\" <br>\r\n\"I seriously don't think I could be a slave for the whole team. It's just too much for a little guy like me.\"<br>\r\nRaven sighed. <br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. Your pitiful form right now is too weak to handle even the minor work we need a slave to do.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. See?\"<br>\r\n\"But I guess that means....you're pretty much useless around here.\" she said. I thought I detected a hint of playing around. I pretended I didn't notice. <br>\r\n\"No wait! I still want to be your slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOops. I think I exposed my true feelings. <br>\r\n\"Did you say....you WANT to be my slave?\" she asked. I blushed and scratched the back of my head. <br>\r\n\"But wouldn't that be beneficial for both of us?\" I negotiated. <br>\r\n\"Hmm\", Raven thought. \"But this is supposed to be punishment, not an honor.\"<br>\r\n\"I guess it's both....in a way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven thought again. <br>\r\n\"Well, maybe five titans is too many to serve, but one is also too little.\"<br>\r\n\"Where are you getting at?\"<br>\r\n\"You may have your own opinions about me, but I have a heart (lucky for you). I won't degrade you any more by being a slave to the guys.\"<br>\r\nI gave a big sigh of relief. <br>\r\n\"But I'm still going to have to introduce you to the team. I'm not going to make it a hassle by trying to hide you from everybody.\"<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" I agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she took me to the main room where they usually hang out. There was a huge curved couch with a big television in front of it. Cyborg and Beast Boy were sitting there, yelling as they played their video game. Starfire stood behind the couch, watching. Robin stood in the kitchen, eating a sandwich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven came in. I stood hiding behind the wall. She coughed to get her attention. Cyborg and Beast Boy paused the game and turned around. Everyone was looking at her. She called me to come to her, so I walked to her and sat at her feet. Then she explained to everyone that she found \"this creature\" that was willing to be her pet. She said that she would take care of me and in return I would obey her every command. Though Starfire seemed excited to have another pet, Robin didn't seem to approve. But Starfire annoyed him so much, just like she did with Silky, that he eventually gave in. But he warned Starfire and Raven that if I don't behave, I would get kicked out permanently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven grabbed a sandwich, gave it to me to eat, and pulled my leash as she walked back to her room with Starfire. She was talking to Raven about how fun it would be to have another pet, but Raven didn't seem to be listening. When we reached her room, Raven turned to Starfire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starfire\", she began. \"How about we just alternate taking care of him instead of having both of us taking care of him at the same time?\"<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, that would be wonderful!\" she exclaimed. \"Who will take care of him first?\"<br>\r\n\"I think we should talk about the rules and schedule in my room.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were about three to four feet away, and I sat on the floor between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starfire, there's something you need to understand about this pet of mine. This particular.... creature.... likes serving females, especially their feet....\"<br>\r\nRaven took off a boot and slowly pushed her bare foot on my face down to the floor and allowed me to worship her as she explained to Starfire what a foot fetish is. She was very interested about the whole situation and was able to get a good grasp of what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, this 'foot fetish' of which you speak is quite common back on my planet. Royal servants would always tend to Blackfire's feet, as well as mine.\" Starfire said. She took off her boots, revealing her beautiful feet that I saw earlier in the day. She put her boots next to me. I grabbed one and took deep breaths as the opening of the boot covered my nose and mouth. It smelled so good to me that I laid back down and continued inhaling the intoxicating smell. Starfire placed her foot on my chest and rocked me side to side like a baby in a cradle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, Raven? It's easy to keep servants such as him busy.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I was wrong. It seems like you know how to handle boys like him more than I do.\"<br>\r\n\"Indeed. I shall teach you some simple techniques I know that would easily please him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire told Raven to place both her feet on me. She had her feet on my torso. Then she rocked me side to side like Starfire did. She told Raven to give me her boot, so she tossed it to my face. Luckily her boots are soft. I sniffed and licked the inside of her boot. Starfire rubbed her feet on my face as I sniffed Raven's boot. Raven continued rocking me as they talked. After a while I put the boot down and worshipped Starfire's feet. She didn't seem to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce their conversation about life was over, Starfire grabbed her boots and walked out the door, thanking Raven for having the conversation while sharing her pet.<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Raven said. \"while you gorged yourself in Starfire's feet, we decided that we'll alternate taking care of you every two days. So it looks like you're mine for now.\"<br>\r\nRaven seemed reluctant to take care of me. I was still laying on the ground. She walked towards her bed, stepping on me on her way. The pain was excruciating, but it felt good at the same time. <br>\r\nShe sat on the edge of her bed again and called me, so I crawled to her feet, awaiting her orders. She removed my leash but kept the collar on me. Then she laid on her bed, reading a book. She had one knee pointed up with her other foot resting on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here.\" she summoned. I struggled to climb onto the bed. \"Now worship my foot. I'll tell you when to tend to my other foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly amazing. I never knew my life could get any better than this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still, I stared at it for a few seconds before I went on my knees in front of her feet. It was comfortably rested on top of the bed. I started off by kissing the top of her huge feet. Her skin was like silk. I rubbed the side of my face against it, then I bent down lower to lick the top of her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dug my face into the bed at the side of her foot so that my head was buried under. Her sole was warm and slightly moist. Her foot was now covering my whole head and neck. Raven slowly moved her foot back and forth to get the feel of it. Then she pressed her foot down a bit and made circles into the bed. Her soft sole rubbing against my face felt absolutely wonderful. Whenever her toes passed my head, she would flex them to squish me. Her toes firmly wrapping around my head felt even better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was now laid flat on my back, my feet facing her and my face under her toes. My whole body was under her sole. I placed my hands on the sides of her foot and sucked on her toes. They tasted so good to me that I didn't pause to rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Raven flipped me over using her toes so that I was on my stomach and turned my body perpendicular to hers. My head was now on her left, and her right foot was placed on my body. She put her left foot on its side, in front of my face. She slid her toes into my face, and I gladly licked them one at a time. She would position one toe in front of me to lick, then would move her foot again to give me another toe to suck and lick. I worshipped her feet for about thirty minutes without rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her feet smelled incredibly good. I sniffed it another time, and another, I couldn't stop, it was too good. I couldn't handle myself anymore, I approached more and I slowly licked her sole. It was amazing. But after that, Raven moved a bit, and by fear, I go back. After realizing she was just changing position, and she was still asleep, I restart licking her soles. After 7 minutes of intense licking, just when I was deeply licking her toes, Raven woke up and caught me licking her feet. \"What are you doing ?!\" She said while shouting on me. I couldn't say anything so I just stayed silent. My heart was beating at the speed of light, I thought I was going to die until I don't know why, I answered her \"I couldn't resist\". She stood there for 10 seconds and then said \"What ? You couldn't resist to the tentation of... Licking my feet ? Well, do you really think that this will make me calm ?!\". I didn't know what to say, I just sat on my knees, put my face on the ground and asked her to forgive me. \"Uhh... You are pathetic.\" She said while putting her barefeet on my head. I couldn't get up and asked her another time to forgive me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes, she then told me \"Why do my feet look so good to you ?\".

I immediately answered her \"What ? When ?\", \"When you were staring at my feets.\" She then told me. We two stood silent for a couple of minutes, Raven was hiding her feets, I couldn't admire them. I thought about them once again and had a HUGE boner. With the position I had, it was hidden and Raven couldn't notice it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to choose what to do.

Joe slowly opened his eyes, his vision blurry. He tried moving around but found that he was tied up from shoulder to ankle. His hands were tied together behind his back. Joe was sitting upright with his back against a wall, his head hung down due to drowsiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I said wake up!\", the voice yelled. Just then, Joe felt a sudden pain in his left cheek from a soft hand. The mysterious person in front of him had slapped him awake. Joe looked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe examined the figure from bottom to top: Black high-heel boots that went more than halfway up her shin; Purple skin-tight nylon around the thighs; Black clothing around the torso; And....green/aqua hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally. First you put up a fight and now you waste my time waiting for you to wake up. How inconsiderate of you.\", said Joe's female captor. <br>\r\n\"Where....am I....?\", Joe mumbled. <br>\r\n\"Heh heh. Doesn't this place look any familiar to you?! It's YOUR house. Specifically, your living room. And don't think you're leaving anytime soon.\" She turned around and walked away a few steps. \"So.....slave. What's your name?\", she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing called a slave threw Joe off. 'Slave?!', he thought. 'Since when have I become this woman's slave?'. He was confused and looked down again. <br>\r\n\"Joe\", he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen things started coming back to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(a few hours ago...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe was walking down the suburban street late at night. The street lights were on but no one was outside. No cars passed by. Everyone was asleep. He enjoyed how quiet it was. After all, he wanted some alone time to gather his thoughts and escape his troubles for a while. But that soon died when he heard footsteps. Joe stopped and looked in front of him, where he saw a figure slowly walking his way. He slowed down but continued walking. The figure seemed to have come out of nowhere. It was a lady with green hair, wearing glasses. She had a white shirt and black pants with black pumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. I've been looking for you\", she said in a calm voice once she had approached him. Joe could now see that she was very beautiful and near flawless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? You've been looking for me? What for?\", he asked her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have something that I want.\", she said. She came closer to Joe, her body touching his. She ran her index finger down from his lips to his chest. \"I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. Having sex with random women isn't really my thing.\", he replied and stepped back. She laughed quietly.<br>\r\n\"Oh please. That's not what I meant. I know you have the staff.\", she said. Joe then knew right away what she was after. She came closer again. Joe was scared now and slowly reached for his pocket knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't going to fight me, are you?\", she said in a seductive manner. \"Do you really want to hurt me?\" She lazily put her index finger on her bottom lip and gave him the look. Joe gulped. Despite her looks, Joe knew that she was a dangerous woman. But Joe had too much confidence and thought he could get away from her. He quickly pulled out his knife and tried to attack her. He was able to make a deep cut in her arm before she could jump back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! That hurt!\", Morrigan said. She crossed her arms up above her head, fingers outstreched. Just then, a swarm of bats flew in from the darkness and surrounded her. Joe gasped and tripped backwards. The woman walked out of the darkness of bats. Her appearance was completely different from before. She now had small bat wings on the sides of her head and another larger pair on her lower back. She wore black high-heel boots and purple nylons with bat designs on her thighs. Light brown nylon covered her arms and hooked around her middle finger. The black clothing she wore around her lower torso only went halfway up to her boobs, with a heart-shaped hole between them. She pointed at Joe, who was in too much shock to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna pay for that!\" she threatened him. Her feet came off the ground as she hovered swiftly towards him and kicked Joe in the chin, knocking him to the ground. Then she stepped on his wrist and twisted her foot, forcing Hoe to let go of his knife. The woman, now showing her true form along with her power, picked him up from his neck and threw him no less than 10 feet away. Joe landed on his feet but tumbled backwards, ending up on his back.<br>\r\n\"Give me the staff.\" she commanded. Joe got up and tried to run away but she easily pursued him. She quickly flew in front of him with her hands on her waist. Joe tried to stop but he bumped into her floating body, his face pushed right into her boobs. The woman gave him a disgusted look before slapping him. When Joe pulled away, female demon swung her body and kicked Joe on the side of his head, rendering him unconscious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked at her but she smiled and turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you were sleeping, I took the liberty of looking through your wallet to find your address. I broke in here and found the staff perched right on top of this bookshelf like some sort of trophy.\", she summarized. \"Hmph. You made me do soooo much work in finding your house, and I had to bring you here too\", pretending that she tired from it all. She walked back to him and pushed him to the ground with her foot. Joe struggled to get back up but Morrigan kept her foot on his stomach. Joe yelled in agony as she began twisting her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why must you always make things so complicated?\", she asked, still twisting the heel of her boot into his stomach. Joe tucked in from the pain she was giving him.  <br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this? Who are you?\" He questioned. <br>\r\n\"Oh that's right! I haven't even introduced myself! How rude of me......My name is Morrigan Aensland. It's a pleasure to meet you!\" She said with a smile. <br>\r\n\"Well you have the staff now, Morrigan. Release me!\" Joe demanded.<br>\r\n\"Release you? Hahahaha!\" she said mockingly, knowing that Joe thought he had some kind of authority over her. Joe felt embarassed after saying that. To think that she would actually listen to her prey, especially in the state he was in, so tied up and helpless. \"No, silly Joe. I think I'll keep you here for a while as a pet slave. After all, you owe me big time\". She laughed some more. Her reasons were just excuses to torture and have fun with him, but reasons nonetheless. She wanted to see how much fun it would be to have a pet slave of her own to serve her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe knew that there was very little chance of escape, if any. But he kept his pride. <br>\r\n\"I'll never be your slave! Or your pet!\", he said. <br>\r\n\"Hmm. If you put it that way, then I guess I'll have to test this staff on you first, as a guinea pig.\" Morrigan said before laughing sadistically. Joe shook in fear. He knew exactly what that staff was capable of. The wielder would be granted the power to control others, as well as other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan lifted her foot off of him and went to get the staff which was leaning on the side of the couch. Joe wasted no time. He looked left and saw the door. He squirmed like a caterpillar in a desperate attempt to escape the life of a slave-pet. But his attempts were futile when Morrigan slowly turned to face him, staff in her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww! You look so cute trying to run away from me.\" she said. \"It makes me feel all the more powerful over you.\" Morrigan walked to him and stomped on his back. Joe grunted as his stomach was forced to the ground. Morrigan pointed the staff at Joe. He tried to turn his head to see what she was doing but he could only see her and the staff through his peripheral vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to give you a simple choice, Joe. Give in to my superiority or be forced to do it.\" she said. Joe knew that he couldn't fight her, especially in his current state. All he could do now is decide whether to accept being Morrigan's pet slave and obey her every command or just be forced against your will to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You win.\" Joe reluctantly admitted. Morrigan gave Joe a smile and put the staff on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy. Now I better not see any more bad behavior from you.\" Morrigan said. \"Now....I think I'll have some fun with you. But first, you'll have to promise me that if I untie you, you won't do anything... stupid. Are we clear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo ashamed to talk anymore, Joe nodded. Morrigan was delighted to see him obedient. She pointed her finger to him. Blue light started to come out of her index finger. All the ropes around Joe turned into blue light, then disappeared. Joe sat up and stretched. Morrigan went to the couch and sat in the middle. Joe stared at her as she slowly began taking off her boots. She smiled when she caught Joe staring at her and her feet as continued to seductively remove the black boots. Joe turned away but found himself staring at her again. He was amazed at how beautiful and irresistable she really was. Morrigan finished sliding off her left boot, revealing her amazingly beautiful foot. Green nail polish on her perfectly shaped toes and toenails. They weren't short, nor were they too long. He could tell her whole foot was incredibly soft and clean. The purple nylon-like clothing that covered her legs only stopped above her ankle but wrapped around the middle of her foot, exposing only the front half of the foot and her heel. She stretched her leg upward, moving her foot in circles. Then she placed it back down to repeat the same to her right foot. Once she had both of her feet exposed, she extended them across the floor, crossed with her right foot over her left. Morrigan stood her boots at the foot of the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, Lil Joey.\" she said in a sweet voice.<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh.\" Morrigan shook her head. \"Stay on all fours like the pathetic animal that you are.\" Joe reluctantly crawled to his master, much like a scared dog. Morrigan giggled at his appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Closer. Right in front of my feet.\" she said. Joe crawled closer. Morrigan lifted her right foot only inches away from Joe's face. He moved his head back, expecting them to be incredibly smelly. But to his surprise, it had no bad odor. Joe could only detect a small hint of some kind of fruit he couldn't name, as well as the moisture from her foot sweat. He assumed that Morrigan takes good care of her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan saw Joe slowly leaning towards her feet, smelling them. Joe caught himself unconciously doing so. He blushed and turned away.<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! The soap I use has a little bit of a fruit from another planet. It has a long-lasting odor that sticks to the skin for a couple of days.\" she stated. \"But anyway, back to business.\" Morrigan placed her right foot back down on her left foot. Then she pointed her toes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As your first job as my slave, I want you to worship my feet.\" she commanded. Joe was shocked to hear this. He thought that he was going to simply massage her feet, but what she had just commanded was simply out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are you waiting for?\" she said impatiently. Joe didn't want to upset the beauty that sat before him. He slowly crouched lower, his face coming closer to her beautiful feet. But Morrigan couldn't wait. <br>\r\n\"Oh for the love of God, hurry up! My feet are killing me!\", she told him. Morrigan quickly lifted her foot right into Joe's mouth. He gagged at the sudden movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooo, feels good in there.\" she said, suddenly very relaxed. She gave a sigh of relaxation and wiggled her toes in Joe's mouth, playing with his tongue. She moved her foot back and forth against Joe's tongue, thoroughly brushing her sweat on it. Joe was ashamed that he had been reduced to this. But at the same time he felt that it was an honor to be able to even touch such a gorgeous woman such as her. Morrigan slowly let her head fall back against the couch in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh yeeeah. This feels fantastic! Keep at it. Remember: I want it all clean.\" she said. \"So you better do a good job.\" But Joe knew he couldn't disobey. He knew that the consequences could be dire. He placed his hands on her ankles and held her foot up. Joe felt her leg becoming heavier after that and he realized that she was no longer holding her leg up for him. He didn't know how to properly \"worship\" her feet until he got the hint when Morrigan started circling her toes around his tongue. Joe put a toe in his mouth one at a time, doing both circular and back-and-forth motions with his tongue. After that, Joe began licking in between Morrigan's toes, where much of the foot sweat is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's it. Get all that good stuff in between there.\", she moaned. Joe obeyed his master. He licked each crevice thoroughly. Once he was done, Morrigan put her sole on his face. He moved his head back and gently pulled down the thin nylon strap that covered her arch and put it behind her heel. Then he started licking her sole, making his tongue wide to cover most of Morrigan's foot for every stroke. It wasn't as bad as he expected since her foot was so soft and it didn't give off any bad foot odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was completely done with her right foot, Morrigan examined his work. She smiled and pet Joe on the head. She placed her right foot on the carpet to let it dry off a bit and raised her left foot to Joe's face.<br>\r\nHe repeated the same thing he did to Morrigan's right foot. Slowly he sucked and licked her toes and in between, tasting the flesh of her foot. He removed the strap off her sole and licked it clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! You're such a good little foot cleaner, aren'tcha?\" she said after he was done. \"And since you're so good at it, expect to be doing it more often. Nooooow, what shall I do next....?\" She outstretched her arms out onto the top of the couch on both sides of her and put her head back, thinking....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She turned on the t.v. across from her and started flipping channels. Soon she looked back at Joe, who was blankmindedly waiting for the next command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. I need a footrest.\" she said like a spoiled child. \"Kneel down in front of me. Put you chin up and keep your mouth open\" Joe obeyed yet again to his master's needs. He went on his knees and placed his hands on his lap. He raised his chin up and opened his mouth. Once Joe got in the position she wanted, she raised her left foot and placed her heel on his open mouth. then placed her right foot over the left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you get comfortable down there cuz I'm going to be watching for a while.\" she said mercilessly. Joe, unable to see, stayed in place only able to see Morrigan's toes and the ceiling. She occassionally flexed her toes and moved her feet around. She would laugh at what she was watching. She told Joe that he should've seen what she was watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one hour, Morrigan changed positions. She put her feet down. Joe stretched his neck to loosen his stiffneck. Morrigan laid on the couch with her feet over the armrest. Without looking at Joe, she pointed at her feet. Joe went to pamper her feet while giving a big sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Joe kneeled down in front of her dangling feet, Morrigan placed both on his face and began rubbing. She played around with his facial features with her toes, pinching his nose, massaging his eyelids, squeezing and meshing his cheeks, and grabbing his tongue to use it as foot floss. The whole time, Joe reluctantly sat still, grimacing at what's being done to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another hour....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She thought of how to torture him next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Joey. Let's play a game.\" she said. Joe wondered if it was another mischevious plan or a fun game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of game?\" he asked. Morrigan smiled at his curiousity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a game of endurance. I'm going to trample you and whoever gives up first loses.\" she explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound fair.\" he replied. \"What happens after?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well if I win, I get to punish you more. Probably doubling the punishment.\" Morrigan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I win?\" Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...... Hmm. I don't know. What would you want?\" she said, giving Joe a seductive smile. Joe knew she wouldn't give him his freedom. If I'm going to be here for a while, I might as well make the best out of it, he thought. He started to remember how sexy and attractive she was to him when she was taking off her boots. Then he came up with the most outrageous, stupid, and almost impossible idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. If I win, maybe.....uhh, you know. M-m-maybe we can-\" he said, but Morrigan interrupted with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious? Do you honestly think I would have sex with you? You must be kidding.\" Morrigan said. Joe blushed. But then Morrigan examined him. To her, he wasn't that bad. She thought that maybe it wouldn't be as bad as she first thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then again....You are kind of cute. And its probably a one-time reward for agreeing to be my pet slave. Hmph. Fine.\" she concluded. Its not like he's going to win anyway, she thought. Joe hid his excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let's begin. Lay on your back.\" Morrigan commanded. Joe obeyed and laid on the carpet in front of her. He lifted his head to see Morrigan put on her boots. When she was done, she stood next to Joe's head. She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan lifted her left foot and stroked his head with her boot.<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna have fun with this.\" she said. Then she walked ontop of Joe's chest and he winced. Not surprisingly, Morrigan was able to balance perfectly on him. Probably because of her supernatural powers, Joe thought. She marched in place on his chest. Joe thought that this was too easy, but pretended it hurt. But Morrigan knew it didn't hurt him, so she started trampling Joe's stomach, facing him. Joe curled up at the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. I'm not stupid, Joey. I know this hurts.\" she said. She turned around and put her left foot on his chest with the other on his stomach. Morrigan lifted the tip of her right foot and twisted her heel into his stomach. Joe screamed and squirmed, but Morrigan just laughed and pressed harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to win, Joey. Give up.\" she said. But Joe was eager to win his reward. He had much lust for Morrigan, and she was able to see that. She simply smiled at him and continued her trampling. Joe tried to resist Morrigan by flexing his abs, but he couldn't hold it for long. She applied as much pressure as she could onto his stomach. Joe was getting tired and slowly reduced the resistance. She turned to face him and trodded on his chest. She raised her left heel above Joe's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suck my heel.\" she commanded. Though not part of the rules of the game, he reluctantly obeyed. He opened his mouth and Morrigan lowered her heel into his mouth. Joe began sucking her boot, moving his head up and down. He circled his tongue around her heel. Morrigan laughed. Once Morrigan decided he was done, she switched feet. Joe groaned but opened his mouth to begin sucking her other heel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Morrigan lifted her heel out of his mouth and placed it on his forehead. Joe was now too tired to struggle at anything she does. Morrigan twisted her heel on his forehead, leaving a circular mark. Joe muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan noticed that Joe wasn't struggling anymore. She sat on his crotch and removed her boots. Joe was surprised at where she decided to sit. But his pleasure faded away as she stood up and marched around him again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make this more interesting.\" she said. Morrigan became more violent in her trampling. She repeatedly lifted her foot and stomped down as hard as she could. She stomped on his stomach, then his chest. Joe strained at every stomp. Then Morrigan started trampling his face with her bare feet. She slapped him with her feet really hard. She pressed her foot against his face and moved his head around. She scrunched her toes in his hair and tugged hard. Joe was able to take the beating. Then Morrigan tried to put her feet into Joe's mouth, but Joe kept his lips closed. He knew that if she's being violent right now, most likely she's going to be violent inside his mouth too. But Morrigan wiggled her toes inside and grabbed his bottom lip with her toes. She yanked it up until Joe finally gave in. Morrigan shoved her foot into his mouth. She grabbed his tongue and moved it left, right, forward, and back. Then she put her foot in as far as she could, making Joe gag. She shifted her weight onto her heel, which was placed on Joe's chin and stomped on his stomach with her other foot, causing Joe to cough and gag even more. This is too much, Joe thought. If I try to endure this, she's going to mess up my whole mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Ghmph Uhhp!\" Joe tried to say. Morrigan gave her foot a good circular movement inside Joe's mouth before taking it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I didn't catch that.\" she said as she wiped her foot on his face. Joe coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I give up. You win. I can't possibly beat you.\" he confessed. Morrigan laughed at his submission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did better than I thought you would. Good job, Joey.\" she said. \"And since you did a good job, I suppose I can give you a little consolation prize.\" Morrigan smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nv v v v Semi-explicit. Skip to the next chapter if you think you're not ready for this. Lol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe tried to sit up, but his stomach was too mashed up to let him. Morrigan stepped off of Joe's body and stood at his feet. She bent down and unbuttoned his pants. Then she unzipped his pants. Joe was shocked that a blowjob would be his consolation prize. But like before, he tried to hold in his excitement. Morrigan pulled down his pants a little and took out his thing from the opening of his boxers. Then she stood up and sat on the couch. Joe looked up at Morrigan and she smiled at him. She placed her left foot on his thing and began rubbing left and right. <br>\r\nOh well, Joe thought. Better than nothing, I guess. At least her feet are soft and sweaty.<br>\r\nJoe relaxed his head back as Morrigan made his thing grow. She placed her tender left foot into his balls, and used her right foot to continue. She massaged and played with his balls with her toes while rubbing his thing. Morrigan occassionally lifted her right foot to let Joe's thing spring up and then she would gently rub her foot against his head. Joe was close to climax. Morrigan heard Joe moan in delight when she put his thing in between her left foot's toes and rubbed up and down with her right foot holding it in place at the base with his thing in between the toes. Joe shut his eyes in sheer pleasure as his thing began to throb. When Morrigan felt the throbbing with her feet, she squeezed his thing with her toes and moved it up and down more. When Joe finally released the stuff, Morrigan used her left foot to press his thing against his hips with her right foot turned to the side. Her right sole covered the head as the stuff was going out hard against her sole. Joe bit his bottom lip. Morrigan rubbed the tip of the head while Joe was still releasing. When he finally stopped, Morrigan stood up and walked on him and then went to get a rag. She came back and wiped the stuff off Joe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, 'master'.\" Joe said. After that experience, he felt that he should call her by 'master'. Morrigan smiled and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're very welcome, Lil Joey.\" Morrigan said. \"And since I kind of enjoyed it too, maybe we should play games more often.\" Joe nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. I think we're done with your consolation prize.\" she said. \"Now it's time for your punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe gulped. He was hoping she would have forgotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Joe frowned slightly. <br>\r\nMorrigan walked a few steps away, then raised her arms up, fingers pointed outward. Then her whole body was covered in blue light. Joe raised his arms in front of his face but watched in amazement as he could see the light splitting into two forms. The other was a little shorter than the other. The light started to dim. Joe was Morrigan from the taller form, but in the other was a younger girl whom he did not recognize. They both approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my other half; my sister, I suppose.\" Morrigan explained. \" It's a long story.\"<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" the girl said as she leaned forward and smiled. She didn't seem to care that he was naked. \"I'm Lilith.\" she introduced. <br>\r\n\"Lilith, this is my new pet slave. He just lost a game right now and I need to punish him.\" Morrigan said. \"And I'm going to need your help.\" <br>\r\n\"Oooo, sounds fun!\" Lilith exclaimed. \"Let's start!\" Morrigan smiled at her.<br>\r\n\"I believe 20 minutes is long enough for punishment.\" Morrigan said. Lilith giggled.<br>\r\n\"But don't you think that's a little too easy?\" Lilith said. \"Let's make it a real punishment.\"<br>\r\n\"I think you're right, sis.\" Morrigan replied. They lifted their hands up, palms facing the other succubus. They placed their hands together and started glowing. Joe figured it must be another spell. Once they were done, Morrigan turned to Joe. <br>\r\n\"The spell we just cast upon ourselves made our bodies have stronger gravity, making us about 3 times more our normal weight Thus, you will feel more pain.\" Morrigan explained. Joe thought she was bluffing because both of their bodies didn't seem to change.  <br>\r\n\"Teeheehee. Pain!\" Lilith exclaimed. The two demons in disguise walked towards Joe's laying body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince they had supernatural powers, they would have no problem balancing on a weak human body. Lilith sat on the floor next to Joe's head and started taking off her boots while Morrigan trampled on Joe's chest. He then realized how heavy she really was. He thought his ribs were going to snap under her weight. Morrigan stroked her hair on the side so it was behind the ear while looking down at Joe. Once Lilith was done taking off her boots, she stood up and marched in place on Joe's stomach. Gravity was his worst enemy right now. Luckily for Joe, the girls' initial weight was very light, so even 3 times their weight would not break any of his bones. The excruciating pain had Joe at a loss of breath. But the girls didn't seem to notice, or care. Morrigan began playing around with Joe's with her foot, while keeping the other foot on his chest. She forced her foot into his mouth, pushing it up and down along his tongue. She also used her toes to play with Joe's nose and lips. Meanwhile, Lilith was alternating between twisting her feet into Joe's stomach and using one foot to play with Joe's exposed \"thing\". Both of the succubus' laughed as they enjoyed their sadistic, playful torture. Joe had no strength to resist, so he laid there, allowing the full weight of them trample his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the 20 minutes were over, they summoned bats on both sides of Joe. They sat on the floating bats as they placed their feet on Joe's face. He was too tired to even move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They rocked his head left and right, also slapping his cheeks occassionally. But the two succubus' began to yawn as the morning light slipped through the blinds on the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow. I'm getting really sleepy, sis.\" Lilith said. <br>\r\n\"Me too. I think its time we get some beauty sleep.\" Morrigan replied. <br>\r\nIn fact, Joe was also getting sleepy as well. He didn't know how long he's been awake, and he wasn't given the chance to sleep. <br>\r\n\"Hey, Lil Joey.\" Morrigan said. \"We're going to get our sleep now. Come. Follow us to our bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three walked to Morrigan's bedroom. It was dim, with a small chandelier on the ceiling to light up the room with an orange color. The bed on the opposite side of the door was big enough to fit three people. There were also many dark and evil-looking objects around the room. Joe was intimidated. <br>\r\nThe two succubus walked to the bed, Morrigan on the left side and Lilith on the right. They used their powers to remove the bat wings from their heads and backs. Then they undressed right in front of Joe. He couldn't turn away. He instantly started to grow a bulge in his pants. The two succubus had perfect and smooth bodies. They didn't seem to care if Joe was there watching them naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan and Lilith simultaneously flipped the sheets and sat in the bed. <br>\r\n\"Hey, Joey. Come here.\" Morrigan called. Joe snapped out of being hypnotized and walked to the left side of the bed where Morrigan sat. He couldn't stop staring at her huge boobs and tight vagina, but he managed to listen to what she said to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to keep you bored the whole time we sleep\" she said. \"So instead of waiting for us to wake up, you'll be worshipping our feet as we sleep. The whole time.\"<br>\r\nJoe didn't refuse, as he was too busy staring at her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith.\" Morrigan said. \"Go tie his wrists on the poles of the bed.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, sis.\" said Lilith. <br>\r\nShe went out of bed and hugged Joe from behind to pull his zombie body to the foot of the bed. She got some rope and began tying Joe to the poles. He was still staring at Morrigan's perfect body. <br>\r\nWhen Lilith was done, she went back to her side of the bed and pulled the sheets over her and her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for?\" Morrigan snapped. \"Our feet won't clean themselves, you know.\"<br>\r\nJoe was kicked lightly in the face by Lilith. He snapped back to reality. <br>\r\n\"Well?\" Lilith said. \"We're waiting.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Joe said, confused. <br>\r\n\"Ugh.\" Lilith groaned. \"Sis, I thought he was smarter than this...\"<br>\r\n\"I thought so, too.\" Morrigan replied. \"Oh well. At least he could get the job done.\"<br>\r\nMorrigan stuck her left foot's big toe into Joe's mouth, and at the same time Lilith stuck her right foot's big toe into it as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now start sucking, for crying out loud.\" Lilith said. Her words were harsh but her tone was sweet and innocent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Joe was relieved to be able to move after two hours. He massaged his stiff neck and turned to see Morrigan. She had the staff in her hand again. Joe started to fear again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joe. Do you know what this staff can do?\" she asked, waiting for the answer she already knows. <br>\r\n\"It....controls other people.\" he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha. Well, that's not all it can do.\" she said. \"Stand up.\" <br>\r\nHe obeyed and stood up. Morrigan walked up to him. With her staff in her left hand, she gently wrapped her arms around Joe. Her left arm hooked the back of Joe's neck and her right hand slowly rubbing his chest. She raised her right leg bent on his stomach, her foot behind his leg. She looked him in the eyes and smiled innocently. Joe was completely seduced by Morrigan. She giggled at how mesmerized he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like me, don't you?\", she said while continuing her act. Joe was too confused to say anything. Morrigan giggled again. \"I thought so. Since you do....you don't want to leave anymore, right?\" She wanted to see how much Joe can resist. She had won from the start.<br>\r\n\"Good boy.\" she said as she played with his hair. \"But you did something I didn't like. You hurt me. And no one hurts me and gets away with it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tip of her staff glowed a bright red next to Joe's head. She grabbed his face with her right hand, thumb on his right cheek, index finger on his left. Keeping her innocent face, she gently placed the tip of the staff on his head. Suddenly, Joe felt weird. He looked at his hands. They were shrinking. Then he looked down, watching the floor get closer and growing. He looked back at Morrigan, who was smiling down at him. <br>\r\nShe laughed. \"Not only does my pet slave clean my feet, it also shrinks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe was now two inches tall. \"Morrigan! Please, change me back!\" He screamed as loud as he can. Surprisingly, she was able to hear him.<br>\r\n\"Change you back? But why? I haven't even played with my new toy yet!\" she said. \"Don't you want me to have fun?\" She gave him a sad face. Joe's heart beat faster. His sudden feelings for Morrigan made him have second thoughts. He became silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked him up with her thumb and middle finger, then put him in the palm of her other hand. She put her hand close to her face to see him. Even though gigantic compared to his size, she was near flawless. Her face was clean and her hair like silk. She smiled and kissed him, which to Joe was like a wall of soft skin pushing him off his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, seeing that you're so good with feet, I think i'll put you to good use.\", she thought aloud. She made a fist with Joe inside, almost suffocating him. She walked to her closet and found some flip-flops. She went back to the couch and sat down, placing Joe on the foot of the couch. He stood in between her two feet. She bent down, lifted her right foot and gently placed her foot on him. Joe was on his back, his head sticking out in between her big and index toe. Morrigan's foot was covering his mouth and plugging his nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Lil Joey. I have flip-flops and I have my boots. You decide which one you want to be in.\" she said. Joe couldn't answer so Morrigan lifted her toes slightly, her foot still crushing his body. He gasped for air. <br>\r\n\"So what'll it be?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She put her right foot on her left knee and rolled up the nylon to the bottom of her knee. She did that same to the left foot. Then she bent down and grabbed the flip flops. Morrigan placed her left foot on Joe, leaving him in the same position. She scrunched her toes, which were wrapped around his shoulders. She lifted him up and put the heel of the sandal against her toes. She relaxed her toes, releasing Joe. Then Morrigan slid the sandal down. Joe was rolled in between Morrigan's soft feet and the insole of the sandal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan laughed. \"That tickled.\" She slid her foot down and back up repeatedly, rolling Joe's body all around her sole. Morrigan's footsweat soaked Joe. <br>\r\nAfter rolling him around, Morrigan places him under her toes so that his whole body is perpendicular to her foot and under each toe. She scrunches him. Joe yells in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, does that hurt?\" she says, scrunching her toes more and meshing him around with her toes. She puts her foot down to the ground and Joe felt the pain as her foot dropped. Morrigan lifted her heel and started twisting Joe under her toes. Morrigan could hear the muffled screams from her flip flops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Would you be quiet down there? Hahaha.\" she said cruelly. Joe didn't know what to do, neither did he know if he could do anything. Morrigan bent and lifted her foot with Joe in it. She pushed his legs into the middle of the sandal, then pushed his head down to go deeper. His head was now sticking out in between Morrigan's second and third toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Joe. How is it under there?\" she said. But she didn't let him have a break. she laid down on the couch, her soles pressed against the armrest. She stretched with arms over her head and legs putting force into her the armrest. Joe couldn't even scream since all the wind was pressed out of him. Morrigan began watching t.v. again, frequently moving her foot back and forth, squishing Joe everytime. Then she started moving her feet in circles and rolling Joe all around her sole but still inside the sandal. She did this for a while but stopped when she started yawning. Morrigan simply left her foot rested on the armrest. But Joe's hopes faded away when she suddenly pulled back her foot and slammed it back on the armrest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Who said you get to rest, Joey? I'm gonna sleep soon so in the meantime, lick my feet clean. I know they're sweaty again. And she was right. Morrigan's feet sweat easily, Joe thought to himself. He began obeying her command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSooner than Joe thought, Morrigan fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Joe realized that this was his only chance of escaping the succubus' clutches. He wiggled and strained to get loose from his snug position. Morrigan's foot being pressed to the armrest didn't make things any easier. Joe slowly climbed up, trying to avoid tickling Morrigan. Once he finally broke free, he jumped onto the armrest. He slid down to the couch. But as he did so, Morrigan slowly put her foot down onto Joe's back, pressing him down. She rubbed her foot on him a few times before stopping. He looked at her and saw that she was still asleep. He crawled out of the tender foot again. From there, he jumped off the couch and went onto the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was overjoyed to see that the door was slightly open, just enough to get through. He ran for his escape route to freedom. He ran as fast as he could, but forgot the fact that he was still only 2 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sound came from the other side of the door. Joe froze. He looked up to see the door slowly open and through it came a girl. She had short, light purple hair with blue clothes and red boots. She also had red bat wings on her back and on her head. Her attire was very similar to Morrigan's. 'Morrigan's sister, maybe'? Joe thought. But he didn't care. He was so close to escaping so he continued running. But as the girl walked in, she accidentally kicked Joe with the tip of her boot. After she felt it, she looked down and saw a little young man on his back, staring at her in utter fear. All of Joe's hopes of escape were now long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this? Another one of Morrigan's little toys?\" She asked herself. She bent down to reach for him, but Joe made a futile attempt to avoid her incoming hand. She wasn't as graceful as Morrigan. In fact, to Joe, she seemed pretty cruel from the start. The girl slammed her hand down on him, nearly squashing him. He poked his head out of her soft palm to see her fingers slowly encasing him like living pillars. She clutched him into a tight fist, squeezing the air out of Joe and then walked to Morrigan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst. Morrigan. Is this yours?\" She said while poking the sleeping beauty's arm. When she opened her eyes, the girl showed her open palm with Joe on it, who was gasping for air. Morrigan sat upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Lilith. What's that?\" She leaned forward to take a closer look. \"Hey! It's Lil Joey! I thought I had you trapped! Was he trying to escape again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure he was. I found him on the ground next to the door as I was coming in.\" The girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Joey, I thought I told you to not do anything stupid! Were you trying to run away?\" she asked. But Joe shook his head. \"Hey! Are you lying to me now? Shame on you. I told you there would be punishment for disobedience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Morrigan still sat on the couch, she took off her left sandal and grabbed Joe with her right hand. Joe's head was sticking out and Morrigan's thumb was placed behind his head. She put his face into her left sole and rubbed him everywhere she could, scrubbing him hard on the ball of her foot, beneath her toes, her heel, and in between her toes. She did this for a whole minute, not allowing Joe to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you ever disobey your master again, Joey.\" she said as she rolled Joe around her sole with her open palm. Morrigan's sister watched Joe being punished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis! That looks like fun! Can I try?\" she said. Morrigan smiled and let go of Joe, holding his body under her scrunched toes.<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, sis. It feels good. Trust me.\" She said. Morrigan lifted her foot above her sister's eager open hands. She dropped Joe into her hands. She put her palms together and rolled him around viciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, be careful with him. He's not used to being small.\" she said. \"Oh! That reminds me. Let Joe meet you. You two haven't had the chance to introduce yourselves.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan's sister reluctantly opened her hands. She was having too much fun torturing the creature. \"This is my other half, Lilith Aensland. Its a long story, but we just call each other sisters. And don't be fooled. She's not as merciful as I am.\" Morrigan smiled. She didn't have to tell Joe that. He could already tell. But Morrigan simply kept smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to take a shower and get dressed. You see, Joe, we are nocturnal and like getting our sleep during the day. We're almost always found at night.\" Morrigan explained. Then she held Lilith's hands and closed them for her. \"I'll leave you at Lilith's mercy\" she said to Joe. Then she looked up at Lilith. \"Try not to kill him, sis.\" The two sisters smiled at each other and Morrigan walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe gulped. He had a good impression of Lilith already. When Morrigan was out of sight, Lilith brought Joe in front of her face. She was younger than Morrigan. About 16-20 years old, Joe guessed. She was pretty and had silky smooth hair. Like Morrigan, she was flawless. Joe thought that Morrigan was sexy and Lilith was cute. But her cuteness soon faded when she spoke to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo, lil Joey. How should I torture your measley soul?\" she said in an innocent tone. Joe knew it was a rhetorical question. Lilith took him to her room, which was filled with colors of black, blue, pink, and red. She sat down at the edge of her bed, placed him down on the floor, and kept him there with her left boot. She took off her right boot and tossed it on her bed, thus revealing yet another perfect foot, just like Morrigan's. It was soft and had a different fruity odor. Her toenails were painted with red nail polish. But before Joe could stare at her foot, Lilith replaced her left boot with her right foot, allowing Joe to feel her warm, moist, and soft foot press against his small body. Lilith had her heel raised to put added pressure to Joe's pitiful body. With Joe's head in between two of her toes, she lifted him with her foot. She then plucked him out of her toes and spoke to Joe. She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just a little preview of what I'm about to do to you.\" she said. She showed him her red boot. Joe panicked and squirmed, but Lilith squeezed him into submission. The sadistic girl enjoyed seeing the little human panic. She stood her left boot up on the floor. Then she slowly lowered Joe into the boot. Joe couldn't escape from Lilith's hand. Then she let go of him. <br>\r\nThe time of punishment had arrived. He plopped onto the moist insole of her boot. He got up and tried crawling out, but he was weak and out of energy. He fell on his back when Lilith shook the boot. His head was at the tip of the boot. Then the light began retreating. He looked at the hole he entered from to see Lilith's toes blocking most of the light. They wiggled and came closer to his fallen body. Joe didn't think he could survive what was about to happen. Her sole brushed against his body as she was putting the boot on. Then the sole pressed against him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh.... That feels nice.\" she said. She grabbed her left foot and shook it near her ears, hoping to hear Joe scream. Joe was thrown side to side from the force. \"How is it in there?\" she asked. \"Hmph. I better feel some licking in there!\" Joe's head was now in between her 2nd and 3rd toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter placing her boot on the floor, she lifted her heel and twisted the front half of her foot against the ground. The pain was unbearable. He could hear her evil laughs from above. Joe remembered Morrigan say that Lilith wasn't as merciful as her. Lilith quickly lifted her foot and slammed the front of the foot down with the heel still up. She repeated this many times, not giving Joe a second's rest. Lilith then went back to twisting, giving Joe excruciating pain in his entire body. Lilith giggled whenever Joe squirmed under her unforgiving feet. She put her heel on the ground and pointed her toes up. She moved her foot forward and back as if she were pumping gas on a car, bouncing Joe's face into her toes. Joe was being dribbled by Lilith's foot, bouncing from her insole to her foot repeatedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't I say I wanted you to lick my toes? Geez.\" she said. She scrunched her toes as hard as she could. Joe quickly stuck out his tongue in hopes of decreasing the pressure. He licked as much as he could to please her, but her toes didn't move back. Joe could barely take much more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joe licked, Lilith put on her other boot and stood up, toes still scrunched around Joe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could feel the squishing feeling of Joe's body rubbing against her toes like lotion. Lilith loved this feeling and began rubbing her foot back and forth on the floor, pushing and sliding Joe along with her toes. <br>\r\nAfter a while, she lifted her heel and added pressure. Joe started coughing and desperately tried to breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith was sadistic and was about to completely squish Joe, but then she heard the bathroom door open. Lilith sat back down on the edge of the bed and turned to face the door of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're real lucky, Joe.\" She said to him, twisting the bottom of her toes into the ground. <br>\r\nMorrigan entered Lilith's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo, how's Lil Joey doing? I hope you didn't break my new toy.\" Morrigan said. <br>\r\n\"Heehee, almost.\" Lilith said. Morrigan stood next to her. <br>\r\n\"So where is that little maggot?\" she asked her. Still twisting Joe inside her boot, Lilith replied:<br>\r\n\"Right under my foot, where he belongs.\" But she soon took off her boot, held it upside down above the bed, and let Joe fall onto the sheets. Joe was lying on his back with his eyes closed, breathing hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww. Poor Lil Joey is all worn out.\" Morrigan said. Lilith giggled and poked Joe, then rubbing his body around with her index finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis. I'm getting hungry. Can we eat now?\" Lilith whined. <br>\r\n\"Yes. I'm starving.\" Morrigan said. Then she looked at Joe. \"How about you, lil man? Are you hungry?\"<br>\r\nBut Joe was too exhausted to yell, or even talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a no.\" Lilith said, giving him an innocent smile. She knew he must be hungry. But she didn't give Joe a chance to nod his head. <br>\r\n\"If he gets hungry, he can always get some foot-soup from us.\" Lilith told her.<br>\r\n\"True. Let's go eat now.\" Morrigan said as she walked away. Lilith followed, with Joe in her tight fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the table.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Morrigan had already set up the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's eat!\" Lilith said. She smiled and laid Joe on the floor, under the table. When Morrigan saw her do this, she slowly placed her foot on Joe. Her foot smelled wonderful and was moist and extra soft since she just came out of the shower. She rubbed Joe passionately as she ate, massaging Joe's entire body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, she lifted her foot off and rested it in front of Joe. Then Lilith raised her foot above Joe from behind him and he looked up. She slapped her foot down on him and rubbed him the same way Morrigan did. But after a while, she also stopped and placed her foot behind Joe's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan reached under the table and picked up Joe, two feet above the ground. Then she placed her foot in front of Joe's body. Lilith quickly placed her foot on Joe's back. He was now surrounded by the sisters' feet. The sisters stuck each toe in between the others. Joe's head was barely sticking out of Morrigan's second toe and Lilith's second toe. They both scrunched their toes,  instantly applying pain to Joe's entire body. Though their feet were both really soft, the pain was near unbearable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter squeezing toes together, the two succubus' unlocked their toes and rubbed their soled together. This made Joe relieved. They gently twisted their feet against Joe, also rubbing up and down alternately. Morrigan's moist foot made it easier for them to rub Joe in between her and her sister's feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were done, they let Joe plop back onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After this, what little pride you have left in you will soon be crushed, like an insect under my boot.\" She shot him with light from the staff and his body glowed for a few seconds. Then the light surrounding him disappeared, along with the ropes that bounded him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe felt weird inside. He sat up after Morrigan lifted her foot off his back. She laughed. <br>\r\n\"I think this will suit you perfectly. With this spell, you'll be crawling at my feet for as long as I desire. And the best part is, you'll WANT to be my pathetic little foot slave.\" She said. Joe didn't know what she was talking about. He just watched her as she sat on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan bent down and reached for her boot. She slowly started to remove her left boot. For some unknown reason, Joe was completely mesmerized by her current actions. When Morrigan finished removing her boot, she revealed to Joe her beautiful left foot. Joe became aroused. Her foot had a wonderful texture and color. The nylon only went down to her ankles, but part of it looped around the middle of her foot. Her toenails had nail polish the same color as her hair. Her toes and toenails were not long, but also not short. Anyone could tell that her feet were soft and gorgeous. 'They're perfect', Joe thought. But inside, Joe couldn't help but think of the reason why he was so fixed on her foot. He wanted to see more. Morrigan observed him and could tell right away that the spell worked. She had given Joe a foot fetish. A really strong foot fetish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan stretched her left leg up, teasing Joe with her wonderfully perfect foot. After the succubus pulled the nylon strap back from her arch to behind her heel, she peeled her right boot off. Yet again, Joe was found staring in awe at her. 'This is amazing', he thought. <br>\r\nAfter having both feet exposed, Morrigan held them together, soles pressed against each other. Joe leaned forward slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, foot fetish boy.\" She called to him. \"I bet you want some of these, huh?\" She used her hands to rub her soles together. Joe's new lust for feet made him want to worship them for the rest of his life. 'A perfect woman with perfect feet', he thought. 'This is the best thing I have ever and forever will have experienced'. <br>\r\nMorrigan used her index finger to seductively call him over to her, crawling. Joe's eyes were fixed on her feet, mouth open and almost drooling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. I know what you're thinking. You want a taste, don't you?\" Morrigan asked. Joe nodded his head with his tongue sticking out like a dog. <br>\r\n\"Then get on your knees.\" she commanded him. Joe quickly went on his knees, sitting on his heels. His shins were parallel to the ground. He opened his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked down at him and smiled as she saw his pitiful state, mouth open and drooling for some feet. She gave a smiling sigh. <br>\r\nShe lifted her left foot slowly from the ground. Joe stared at the perfection as it gracefully reached eye level, soles pointed at his face. Morrigan scrunched her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she slowly moved her foot closer and closer to Joe's face. He couldn't wait for it, so he leaned forward and planted his face right into her soft, warm sole. Joe gave a relieved sigh before he started kissing her feet, nose snuggled into her toes. He sniffed her foot while kissing it as much as he could. To his surprise, her foot didn't smell bad at all. In fact, it gave off a mixture of foot sweat and a fruit he couldn't name. <br>\r\n'Probably some special soap she uses', he thought to himself. <br>\r\nA couple minutes later, Morrigan gently rubbed her toes against his lips. That's when Joe started licking her entire sole. Morrigan smiled and relaxed on the couch. When Joe was satisfied with the sole, he began licking in between her toes. To him, they were really tasty and just couldn't get enough. Morrigan's feet were his new and only addiction. <br>\r\nAfter a while she switched feet. Joe repeated the same thing to her right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Morrigan pulled her foot back. Joe was disappointed, as he was just about to start sucking her toes. <br>\r\n\"I think you had enough for a little taste, Joey.\" she said. Joe frowned.<br>\r\n\"Aww. Don't be sad, babe. I'm sure you'll get another chance....if you behave.\" she said as she gave a seductive smile that Joe just couldn't resist. Joe gulped and began to sweat a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I give you a tour of the castle?\" she asked him. Joe was automatically confused. 'Castle?!', he thought. 'I could've sworn I was in a normal room!'<br>\r\nHe was curious to see where he was so he nodded to his master. <br>\r\n\"Good.\" Morrigan said. She put her boots back on and then walked to the door. Joe crawled behind her. <br>\r\nJoe looked up and saw that Morrigan was holding something in her hand. It was a rope. It had a big knot the same shape as the ones used for hanging. She turned around and looked down at him with her arms spread out to hold the rope tight horizontally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we go, I'm gonna have to put this on you.\" she said. Joe obeyed and extended his neck so she could put it on him. The rope was smooth against his skin as Morrigan placed it around his neck. Then, to secure it, she slammed her right foot on his chest and pulled the rope firmly, thus choking Joe. She smiled sadistically as she looked at Joe, who was struggling for breath. She stopped choking Joe a few seconds later and reached down to properly adjust the leash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Its just so fun playing with pets.\" she said like a little girl in disguise. <br>\r\n'You call that playing?!', Joe thought. 'I almost died there!'<br>\r\nMorrigan opened the door and pulled Joe through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was silent, and all Joe could hear was Morrigan's boots clicking on the cold floor, his hands plopping against the ground, and his shoes sliding behind. The hallway made a right turn and led them to the kitchen. It was big but almost empty. There was no one in there at the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can obviously see, this is our kitchen.\" Morrigan explained. \"Our cooks don't cook often, and they're often found moping along in their rooms.\"<br>\r\nJoe didn't speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Morrigan continued her tour around the castle, showing Joe the garden in the back, the moat around the castle, the library, and the dining room. Joe's hands grew weary as he was forced to crawl through the whole tour. He was quite embarassed to be seen by a few women that were walking around. <br>\r\nThey headed to the throne room.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long tour. Joe could barely crawl anymore. But he managed to reach the end of the tour when they reached the throne room. He examined the room. <br>\r\nThe ceiling was high, where the curtains were perched. An enormous chandelier was hung at the center of the ceiling. There were long stained glass windows along the walls. The middle of the spacious room was a red carpet that stretched from the tall wooden door at the end of the room to the opposite side of the room, where the throne was. There were three steps in front of the throne and two poles on the sides that held candles at the top. The throne was tall and golden, with space underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are. The throne room.\" Morrigan said. She went to sit down, dragging Joe along with her. <br>\r\nJoe sat down right in front of Morrigan. She smiled and sighed as she put her feet on Joe's shoulder with one foot over the other. <br>\r\n\"Ahh....Perfect. You'll be an excellent footstool.\" she said. Joe sat still, hiding his excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, since you're here, I can comfortably do my job.\" she said. \"Now, put your head up for me.\"<br>\r\nJoe lifted his chin so that he was looking up at the ceiling.

Another guard appeared, pushing in a skinny person with ragged clothes. He fell to the floor and got back up. Then he continued walking until he was at the steps of the throne. <br>\r\n\"Kneel down when you're at the presence of your ruler!\" the guard barked. \"You are at her mercy!\" He knocked the prisoner down with his staff, then bowed down. Morrigan waved her hand to the guard and he stepped a few steps back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now. What is this prisoner's crime?\" Morrigan commanded.<br>\r\n\"He was caught stealing food from the kitchen.\" the guard answered.<br>\r\n\"But it was for a good purpose!\" the prisoner blurted out. \"I have a poor family and I have to keep the food on the table! Please, all I ask for is some food!\"<br>\r\n\"Silence!\" the guard yelled.<br>\r\n\"So disrespectful.\" Morrigan said. \"I can't have that. Do you realize what will happen if I let you loose after stealing from my kitchen? Those insolent fools you call neighbors will inevitably try the same thing. And I won't allow that to happen.\" <br>\r\n\"Please! Have mercy, Your Highness!\" the prisoner cried out. <br>\r\n\"Hmph. You should've thought twice before you tried to steal. Take him away.\" Morrigan commanded. <br>\r\nThe prisoner screamed and cried as he was dragged away. Joe stopped cleaning to turn and see what was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I didn't tell you to stop, did I?\" Morrigan said. Joe quickly resumed cleaning her boots with his tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring in the next prisoner.\" Morrigan commanded yet again. The prisoner this time was a sophisticated man in a tuxedo. He walked to the throne casually with a calm face. <br>\r\n\"And what is this person's crime?\" Morrigan asked the guard.<br>\r\n\"Attempted murder by use of poison, Your Highness.\" the guard replied. <br>\r\n\"Hmm. Interesting. And whom was his intended target?\" <br>\r\n\"I believe it was Lilith Aensland, Your Highness.\"<br>\r\nJust then, Morrigan made a sudden change. No longer was she calm and collected. She became enraged. She kicked Joe aside and stormed to the prisoner. <br>\r\n\"Why did you try to kill her?!\" Morrigan demanded. The prisoner did not reply. Morrigan waved the guard away and slapped the prisoner in the face. He kept his face turned to the side. <br>\r\n\"I asked you a question!\" Morrigan said. \"Why did you try to kill her?!\"<br>\r\nThe prisoner kept his mouth shut. Morrigan quickly grew impatient and kicked him to the ground and repeatedly stomped on the feeble man. She pulled his left hand and pinned down his right with her heel. She pressed her other foot's heel on his forehead. The prisoner moaned in agony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Answer me!\" she demanded. But the prisoner was still silent. Morrigan pressed down harder and spit in his face.<br>\r\n\"I said answer me!\" Morrigan repeated. The prisoner couldn't take it anymore.<br>\r\n\"I.....I. ..was hired....to kill.....her....\" he managed to say. <br>\r\n\"Hmph. I know exactly who it is.\" Morrigan said. <br>\r\nBut she gave the prisoner no mercy. She placed her boot on his throat and began choking him. <br>\r\nJoe had been watching the whole time, but he had a different opinion on the matter.<br>\r\n\"Master!\" Joe said. \"Uhh.....don't you think you're being a little harsh....?\"<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?!\" the guard exclaimed. \"Don't you dare question Your Highness!\" <br>\r\nMorrigan paid no attention to Joe. He watched as the woman took away a life using only a foot. The prisoner's body stopped squirming. Morrigan gave the prisoner's neck a twist before stepping off of the body. <br>\r\n\"Take his body and hang it outside so that all the townspeople may see what happens to those who try something like that.\" she commanded. Morrigan went back to sit on the throne, calm once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Little Joey.\" Morrigan called as one would call a pet. \"Come here.\" Joe slowly crawled to the foot of the throne. <br>\r\n\"I don't like it when people question me. So I'm going to warn you right now.Do NOT question my authority ever again. Understand?\" <br>\r\nJoe gulped and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The guards brought him to the throne. <br>\r\n\"And what is this peasant accused of?\" Morrigan asked. <br>\r\n\"Stealing, Your Highness.\" the guard replied.<br>\r\n\"Again?

He turned away. <br>\r\nThe guard continually beat up the little boy, who was near unconciousness. Joe looked again. The boy was still being beaten up but had no strength to defend himself. Joe thought that he had to do something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Aensland! Please, stop this brutality! He's just a little boy!\" Joe pleaded as he lifted her boot and started kissing them.

For that, I'll have to make you even more subordinate.\"<br>\r\nMorrigan kicked him down on his back and pressed her foot against his face to keep him down. She grabbed the staff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight came through the staff and transferred to Joe. As he was encased in the light, he felt weird all over. He looked at his hands and could see that his body was slowly shrinking. <br>\r\nWhen the light disappeared, Morrigan smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe now you'll learn your place, being only one foot tall!\" Morrigan said. She giggled. <br>\r\n\"What?! One foot tall?! Noooo!!!\" Joe exclaimed. <br>\r\n\"Silence! This will be your permanent body now. You better get used to it.\"<br>\r\nJoe covered his face and began to have watery eyes. Never again shall he be normal. He will never be accepted by the community he once lived in. His hope for a normal life slipped away from him by a simple wave of a staff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, babe.\" Morrigan called. Joe had mixed feelings of anger and lust towards Morrigan. But he didn't want to anger her even more, for she might do something worse to him. <br>\r\nHe crawled to her feet.

But it's not like he would care anymore now that he's under Morrigan's feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan sighed happily. She gestured the guard to bring in the next prisoner. Joe didn't even bother to try and see who it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan barely paid attention to the prisoners, sending them to the cells after examining them with a quick glance. She was having too much fun with Joe. His midget body was like a stuffed teddy bear to her; Joe was also very light. She was able to easily carry him with one leg.<br>\r\nShe massaged his face thoroughly, rubbing against every part of his face. Then, Morrigan gripped his hair, pulled his head back, and forced her other foot into his mouth. Her foot was the best tasting thing Joe had ever tasted. Though it didn't resemble anything, it was just wonderful. He moved his head up and down against her foot, feeling her tender sole with his tongue. Morrigan giggled. She made sure he got between the toes before removing the foot and replacing it with the other. Joe repeated with a similar process, sometimes experimenting different ways to worship her feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe continued to worship Morrigan's feet during the trials of the remaining prisoners. It was pure ecstasy for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The guard quickly went to the hallway to fetch the person. <br>\r\nHe came back with someone behind him. It was a girl in red and purple. She had short purple hair with a pair of bat wings and cute red eyes, wearing a pink bath robe and pink slippers. She walked up to Morrigan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joe...\" Morrigan said. \"This is Lilith, and she's basically my sister.\"<br>\r\n\"Uhh, hi.\" Joe said in a timid voice. Lilith gave Joe a big smile and wiggled her fingers at him instead of waving. <br>\r\n\"So what'd you call me for?\" Lilith asked. <br>\r\n\"I want you to take care of our little pet Joey while I run some errands.\" <br>\r\n\"Little pet Joey, huh? Okie dokie!\" Lilith said. Morrigan kicked him to Lilith, then Lilith slid her foot underneath him and kicked him up. She caught him with both arms and pet him on his head. <br>\r\n\"You do know what to do with him, don't you?\" Morrigan asked. <br>\r\n\"Of course!\"<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" Morrigan said. \"I'll be back later for dinner.\"<br>\r\nMorrigan flew away through the window. Lilith took Joe back to her room, cradling him and gently rubbing her soft hands against his face. Joe occassionally sucked on her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer room seemed innocent enough. There were lots of pink decorations everywhere, along with a bunch of unique jewelry. <br>\r\nShe put Joe down after she closed the door behind her. She sat down at the edge of the bed with her head tilted and face smiling. She patted the bed, inviting Joe to come to her. He crawled to her, but she stopped him by placing her thin, slippered foot flat on Joe's face. He instantly tried to take it off with his teeth. Lilith pulled her foot away. She waved her index finger side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, Joey\" she said to him. \"Turn around first.\" <br>\r\nJoe turned his body 180 degrees so that he was on his back and at her feet. Lilith put the back end of the slipper into Joe's mouth. She slid her foot downward to take off the slipper, her soft sole rubbing against Joe's forehead. Lilith did the same with her other foot.Then she teased him for a bit by hovering her foot above his face, scrunching her toes. Joe was able to see her purple nail-polished toes and her pale sole with light pink on the ball and the heel of her foot. Joe knew right away that from the combination of the paleness and the pink of her foot meant that her feet were soft, clean, and taken care of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like 'em? They're pretty clean, especially 'cause I just got outta the shower.\" she explained. Joe nodded without hesitation. Lilith giggled at Joe's approval and rewarded him for it. She pushed her feet onto Joe's cheeks and massaged it by squeezing Joe's cheeks inside her toes. Whenever Lilith wasn't scrunching her toes, Joe would seize the opportunity to rub his face against Lilith's bare sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were sure that would've won it. You frown. \"Quadruple or nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nu-uh! We've already done double or nothing, and triple or nothing. It's time for me to call in what's rightfully mine.\" With that said she held out her hand. \"That'll be $5, 000 please.\" Her wide grin did nothing to make you feel any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been visiting Maya in the Kurain Village, working for a national paranormal magazine, writing a special piece on the Kurain Village, and in-between interviewing Maya and the other residents, you were invited to play some poker by Maya. To your surprise she wanted to use real money, but you were in a sporting mood and obliged. It turned out that you were hustled. She's a brilliant poker play, and after your wallet was emptied, your debts became written I.O.Us that double and then tripled in value as your desperate attempt to defeat her continued. But you lost. Again. And now she was calling in your tab. You had no idea what you were going to be able to do. You'd even gambled away the money needed for the trip back home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm..\" You say, shaking your empty wallet onto the round table infront of you. Not even lint fell out of it. There was literally nothing inside it. \"That's going to be a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya's wide grin faded and she sat back down, thinking. Then suddenly a smirk appearedon her face. She was thinking about something. You gulped. You didn't think you like what she was thinking of. And you were right. \"Well, I suppose there is one other way you can repay me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? I'll do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya's smirk grew bigger and she suppressed a giggle. \"Alright. Get on your knees and crawl under the table...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you let yourself slide off of your seat and onto your knees. Then you put your hands on the creaky, wooden floor and crawl towards Maya. You feel heat rise to your cheeks as you blush, you're already humiliated and you haven't found out how you're going to repay her yet! You crawl right up to her, marvelling at her long, lovely legs. She certainly is a beautiful woman. You had respectfully kept those kind of thoughts to the back of your mind while around her, but at her feet, right in front of her, you can't resist thinking it. You raise your head to take a look at the treasure above the legs when you hit your head on the table. \"Oww!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, did you hurt your head?\" Your hear her giggle and she looks under the table at you and smiles, a smile that makes you want to melt like butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you want me down here for anyway, Maya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that you're down on your knees under the table.\" As she sat this, she kicked off the flip flops that she always wore. \"I want you to have a little chit chat with my feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her feet. The one body part you didn't have in mind when you thought of her 'that' way. To any foot fetishist, this would be an absolute fantasy, as they were absolutely beautiful feet. But you didn't exactly have a foot fetish. And quite frankly, you thought that Maya's feet didn't smell all that fresh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, what exactly do you mean by.. Chit chat with your feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya giggled. \"Silly, I mean I want you to...\"</span></div></div>",

You're in my debt, and you have to do what I say to work it off if you don't have the money. My little piggies haven't had a good scrub since Phoenix visited... Um... That was...\" You could just envision her scratching the side of her head and blinking as she often does when she is deep in thought; unfortunately, the sight of her horrific feet block your vision of her cute mannerisms. Even more unfortunate is the realization that just hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weren't you just saying that he hasn't been by in over a month? And does Phoenix Wright, the Turnabout Terror, really scrub his assistant's feet? I find that very difficult to believe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother cute laugh, this time punctuated by a not-so-cute (to you, at least) wiggle of the toes. You flinch backwards, but only manage to hit your head on the table. Your loud exclamation of pain only makes Maya laugh even harder and start to inch her toes closer to your face. The smell of dirt, sweat, and, worryingly, some sort of cheese assault your nostrils and make you forget completely about the headache you'll have in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's right! Nick has had a bunch of cases recently, so he hasn't had much time to come out for a friendly visit. And you're right--he's too much of an old man to actually enjoy licking my feet, but he has no choice. He's always as broke as you are. He may be a lot better than you at poker, but I'm still good enough to beat him every time--thank the Samurais he's a lawyer and not a professional poker player! Anyway, I write my contracts so tightly that even he couldn't defend himself if he tried to welch, so he usually chit chats with my feet quite a bit. We don't have showers or stuff out here in Kurain, so that's all the love they get, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face has gone white with fear at this point. Maya's feet were indeed as filthy as they seemed--they hadn't been scrubbed in a month! And you now remember the large contract Maya had you sign before the game--if Phoenix Wright, Loophole Legend, couldn't get out of it, then what chance do you have? You decided one last plea is the only thing you have up your sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya. Listen to me, now. You and Phoenix are close, so I guess it's okay if you do this to him. But we just met a little while ago. While I do consider you a friend and admire you, this is still wrong. You can't do this to me. I'll repay you in some other way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOminous silence. You can't see Maya's face, but her feet are frozen in place. For a moment, at least; she starts quickly clapping them together, the sound of which is almost as deafening as her laughter. Uh-oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can, and I will! You signed the contract. If you welch... Well, let's just say that I know a few good lawyers! My tootsies are lonely... It's okay that you don't know them well yet because you'll know them VERY well after this little chit-chat. Now, start licking--start with the soles and save the toes for last, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now know what it's like to be cornered by one of the Wright &amp; Co. Law Agency.

Besides, being honorable might lead to lesser punishment, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo your tounge comes out of your mouth with the speed of a striking snake and makes a loud \"SLURP\" as it connects with Maya's filthy right sole. You drag it across the entire length of the demon: then, before your brain can even process it's taste, smell, or Maya's sigh, you let loose another slurp on the left foot. Your heroism finally expired, you draw back and the aftermath of your actions hits you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you notice is the smell. You thought it was bad when Maya was teasing you earlier? When yor nose got closer and your saliva came in contact with the filth, it became far worse. You have a childhood memory of when your high school bully forced your head into a toilet; the smell than was far more pleasent than what you could smell right now. Words can not describe how revolted it makes you feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, the taste is a mixed bag. At first it felt like you had gotten a vomit-flavored jellybean, but the aftertaste made you reconsider. Something--you guessed it was Maya's sweat---have the luck a very salty aftertaste. It was not unlike eating a pretzel--and pretzels are among your favorite foods. All in all, the drawbacks of the dirty first lick outweigh the glorious aftertaste, but there is something else you must consider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya is in her glory. Her moans are more heavenly than even the sound of her giggles. You can tell that even the first two slurps a have made the night for her; she's so cute, so charming that you want to make her entire life, if you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, you're left with a dilemma: are you actually starting to LIKE this? The smell is terrible and the taste a mixed bag, but does the joy of pleasing this beautiful girl outweigh that? Confused, you continue to repay the bargain. Your tounge alternates between her left and right feet. You spend the better part of ten minutes cleaning off the soles, then you move on to the arches and the heel. Maya's moans turn to light giggles as your tounge dances across her arches; it's only more musical to your ears than the moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha...ahhhh. Take a break for a minute please.\" You stop, relief and disappointment competing for your primary emotion. \"You're doing amazing... Nick always is slacking off and trying to get out of it by now, but you're getting better as you go along.\" She wiggled her toes quite cutely---hold it, what?-- and asked, \"are you enjoying this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood question. Um... What's your answer? It's tough to think over the rancid stench emitting from her tootsies.</span></div></div>",

And now that all of the grime is off, your feet are so soft and squishy. But best of all is the taste... I never want to eat again, because food just can't compare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya was quiet throughout your entire speech; her right heel slowly tapped against the ground. You take an (accurate) guess and assume that she's blushing. She says, \"You know, you are the cutest thing ever. Well, except for Pearly, but you're close. Anyway, I'm going to take a quick break to run and go get something to make the rest of the night better for the both of us... I'm not ready for my toe treatment yet, so I'm going to get a toy. Something old man Nick would never agree to... Anyway...\" Maya's feet leave the underside of the table and come back dangling her sandles. \"You can have these while I go and get a few toys. Bye-bye for now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya wiggles her toes at you in a cute farewell, then leaves the room . Ironically, you miss her cute feet already--a half hour ago, you couldn't stand them, but now you love them so. You decide to investigate her sandals while she's gone, but it's only a halfhearted attempt... they only hold a slight fraction of her delectable taste and overpowering smell. You get in a few licks, kisses, and sniffs but are left underwhelmed. Fortunately enough, you can hear her returning footsteps before too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time for some fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is it that Maya is carrying?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maya sits back in her chair; this time, however, she plops her feet on top of the table. \"I'm really sorry,\" she apologizes, \"that you hand to start off down there under that cramped table. I was afraid you'd fight back, so I needed you in a position where I could control you. But now that you've admitted that you can't get enough of my little tootsies... Well, you ought to come up here where you can enjoy them better.\" Maya's voice is cheery and far more playful than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no objections to getting up off of the floor; you rise and bang your head on the table again. Ouch. Maya notices your pain and offers to \"help rub your little boo-boo with her magic-wagic soles;\" once again, you have no objections. You sit down opposite Maya and lie your head down on the table between you. Maya's feet rub up against the back of your head, your cheeks, and even pop into your mouth. It's a heavenly experience; no massage you've ever had before can compare, and you find your headache being replaced by the soft coolness of her soles. Maya's baby talk completes the whole experience for you; she constantly teases and tantalizes you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she says, \"In order to complete 'the spell' and make your ouchie finally disappear, pucker up and just give each of my feet one big smooch.\" You do as she says and realize--at this point, the pain really has went away. She giggles at your expression and says, \"Now that you're better, it's time for what I brought you up here for.\" She hands you a jar of honey. \"This is some of the best honey in the world. I have Nick import it from across the country for me. He cringes at the price, but it's worth it. I put it on all of my burgers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a bit perplexed at where this is going, so you ask, \"That's all well and fine, but what's that have to do with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you a knowing smile. \"C'mon, isn't it obvious? You 're going to eat it... Off of my feet, of course. You admitted how good they taste on their own, but this should make them even better. Trust me, I speak from experience!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou love honey. It's possibly your favorite treat, and the kind she's offering you is the most expensive out there. Poor Mr. Wright. You quickly thank her, but something strikes you as odd and you chime in, \"you speak from experience? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks flash a bright red and her eyes go wide; she's cornered and she knows it. She quickly takes the defensive. \"Hey, this is great stuff, okay! When it spills, I still can't let it go to waste... Even that time it spilled on Pearly's feet... Anywho,\" she quickly changes the topic, \"It's time for your dinner!\" She upends the jar on the table, plays around in it with her feet (what a beautiful sight--the honey slowly dripping from her succulent suckers makes you swallow in anticipation), then sticks the dripping, sticky things in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attack the feet with zeal, with gusto. She's right--her feet and the honey are the perfect combination! You lick clean her soles, then suck on her heels as if they were lollypops. Of course, no lollipop could compare in terms of sweetness, softness, or size. And no lollipop could make the beautiful groans that were coming from Maya's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no time to rest, however--honey is dripping off of her arches! You quickly attack them with furious nibbles. At this point, you're in too much bliss to realize that Maya is giggling like crazy and is enjoying herself even more than you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the best is still to come, as you finally turn to the area that's been foreign to you the entire night: the toes. Maya's toes are simply beautiful. They're dripping with honey and still caked in dirt (she had said she wanted you to save them for last earlier, and you hadn't gotten to them). You start by kissing each one; the spirit medium starts moaning in anticipation and pleasure. After you kiss them all, you move up to sucking each and every one of them. You spend at least a minute per toe; starting by inhaling the honey and dirt, you quickly move in to nibble the delectable edges and lick all of the dirt from inbetween them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, the taste! Maya's dirty soles tasted great; her clean, honey coated arches better; but her dirty, sticky toes were by far the best. You'd died and gone to Heaven and so had she; though her moans were pleasent before, they were constant now. Honestly, it was the best experience either of you ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, her toes were clean as well. You note that beneath all the grime was the sexiest light purple polish that complemented her tanned skin quite nicely. The two of you break down into foot games; you play this little piggy as she playfully tells untouched that you missed spots and wiggles her divine toes around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the evening quickly winding down in such a way, you decide that it's..</span></div></div>",

After finishing the project all employees, including those who helped (like our company) received free tickets for the movie. I wasn't particularly interested in this kind of stuff despite the fact that I was part of the project so I decided that I should just sell my tickets online. The city isn't too big so I don't own a car. I try to walk home or to work whenever I can to get my exercise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn my way back home I saw a huge line of people standing in front of the ticket booth. I was surprised when I saw that they were buying the tickets for the \"Scrap Samurai: The Warrior of Neo Olde Scrapyard\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This movie is actually popular?\" I thought out loud. \"I might be able to get a lot more out of this ticket than I imagined.\" And just when I thought my luck couldn't get any better, I saw the clerk at the ticket booth putting up a sign on the window that read \"TICKETS FOR NEW SAMURAI MOVIE ARE SOLD OUT. Sorry for the inconvenience.\" Most of the people in line started walking away in disappointment. I could hear the complaints and moans from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mister!\" I heard from behind. When I turned around I saw a girl with long black hair. She was dressed in some kind of purple shrine maiden dress. It was revealing most of her long, smooth legs. \"Did you just say that you have a ticket for the movie that just sold out?\" She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I got one\" I said. Her face immediately illuminated as she put on a big smile. I should stop thinking out loud, I said to myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you give it to me? PLEEEEEASE?\" She asked with puppy eyes. \"I'll do anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Anything...?\" I thought about it for a moment. I couldn't help but glance down at her feet. She was wearing flip-flops. Her toenails had a french manicure with some little white flower designs. <br>\r\nI found myself staring at them. She didn't seem to care. The girl probably thought i was looking down in thought, but I could tell from my peripheral vision that she was getting impatient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">PS:Sorry for bad English at times.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[edited by HellaPinoy]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You almost didn't want to add your minor stipulation, simply because it might put a damper on her good mood. Almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, before I hand it over I would like one thing from you. Well two, really. First, my name is blank so no need for sir anymore. I hate when people call me that, too formal. Second, and most importantly,  I would love it if you would give me your phone number.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya's good mood did not seem to falter in the least, although she did look a tad confused. \"Sure blank, but why? My number I mean, not the sir thing. I can understand that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I would like to go out some time and standing around outside the theater until I see you does not seem like the brightest idea. I would offer to buy you dinner, but the movie starts in about five minutes so...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya seems to become even more overjoyed than before, if that is even possible. \"Wow, movie tickets and an offer of dinner! You really know the way to a girls heart, huh? Well of course you can have my number. Keep playing your cards right, and you may never get rid of me!\" That last statement was made with a chuckle and playful wink. She quickly pulled out a business card, with her name and contact information. It is also marked with her profession as well, something about being the master of a village. It would explain the weird outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter passing you the card, a voice called out from the theater. It announced that the last showing of the movie was about to begin. \"Oh no, I better hurry! Call me later blank!\" And with that she was gone. Although her image was still burnt into your mind, from her adorably odd hair to her perfect toes.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Miles Edgeworth. I am a prosecutor currently on a three-story airplane in First Class from Borginia. Starting from the bottom level is the cargo, then the lounge, and then the passengers seats. Due to unexpected turbulence, I was knocked unconcious in the lounge. When I woke up, I found everything in disarray, with grape juice spilled on the floor and glass shattered around the elevator. But when I opened the elevator to head upstairs, I was greeted by a fresh corpse sitting at my feet. After having the flight attendant Ms. Rhoda Teneiro suspect me of being the murderer, I calmed her down and proved my innocence. Being a prosecutor, I found it to be my obligation to hunt down the real murderer, starting with clues. Tracks led me to the plane's shop that Ms. Teneiro attends to. Unfortunately, Ms. Teneiro supposedly lied when she told me that the captain granted her permission to escort me around the shop and lounge, as pointed out by the other flight attendant Ms. Cammy Meele....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lie, Rhoda....\" said Cammy Meele. <br>\r\n\"What is?\" Rhoda replied. <br>\r\n\"The captain never gave you permission to escort Mr. Edgeworth to the shop.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes he did! I just came from the cockpit!\"<br>\r\n\"Do you really want me to prove you wrong? I can go to him right now and ask if he granted you that permission.\" Knowing that what Ms. Cammy said was true, Ms. Rhoda did not argue any further.<br>\r\n\"Instead, I'll be the one escorting you, Mr. Edgeworth. Rhoda, you go back upstairs and do your job or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rhoda Teneiro walked back up the stairs, Ms. Meele turned her attention back to me. \"So where were we....? Ooooh yeah. You wanted to inspect the shop, riiight?\"<br>\r\n\"If I may?\" I said to her. <br>\r\n\"Well what're you waiting for? I'll be right behind you. But don't you dare think you're off the hook. I still think you're the one who did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to not reply to her remark. I continued my investigation of the shop. The broken glass from the cabinet indicated that something from inside busted its way out during the turbulence. Furthermore, there was grape juice found on the wheel of one of the suitcases. I pointed it out to Ms. Meele. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see this?\" I told her. \"The murderer must've used this luggage to transport the victim from the shop to the elevator!\" <br>\r\n\".......zzzz.........\" she snored. <br>\r\nI snapped my fingers in front of her face. She had fallen asleep, still standing up and still holding that teddy bear of hers. I called her name out loud. <br>\r\n\"MS. CAMMY MEELE!\" I said quite loudly. <br>\r\n\".......huh......whaaa.....?\" She said as she woke up, rubbing her eyes. <br>\r\n\"Please stay awake while on the job.\" I lectured her. \"This is a crime scene and the murderer is definitely nearby, so we must both be very vigilant.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok....Mr......Prosecutor......\" she managed to say before falling back asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave up trying to talk to her and continued my work. I squatted down to further inspect the luggage that had grape juice on the wheel. The other luggage had a stopper on the wheels so it would not move during the turbulence, and yet the luggage with grape juice on it managed to stay in place during the turbulence even without stoppers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as I found that out, something hit me in the back of the head with incredible force. I was knocked nearly unconscious, laying on the floor. A few seconds later, I felt two soft fingers press against my throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. You're still alive.\" said a familiar female voice. \"I'll have to hide you somewhere before finishing you off....\" That was all I was able to hear before everything turned black and I fell into unconsciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was gagged by some type of cloth and my body was tied by rope, with my hands taped together behind my back. When I opened my eyes I saw Ms. Cammy Meele looking down at me from the foot of a bed. She had both of her feet on my chest to keep me on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! You like the taste of sweaty flight attendant socks in your mouth?\" she mocked at me. I tried to spit it out but found out that my mouth was also taped. She grabbed the end of the tape and pulled it off. A muffled shout came out of me. I then tried again to spit it out, but Cammy pressed her bare foot on my mouth. She shook her index finger and smiled her lazy smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it in your mouth. It belongs in there.\" she said before releasing her foot from my mouth. I spit it out and coughed. <br>\r\n\"What's the meaning of this?!\" I exclaimed. <br>\r\n\"What do you mean, 'what's the meaning of this?' \" she teased. \"Are you telling me that you don't belong down there, under the feet of the true murderer?\" <br>\r\nI could not believe my ears. Here I am, at the mercy of Cammy Meele, the murderer. I knew that the possibility of me escaping was less than zero percent. According to her, I should've been dead when she struck me at the shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you honestly think I would let anyone find out? You're the only one on this plane who even had a chance of finding out. The best thing to do now is to... get rid of you.\" <br>\r\n\"But why?\" I asked. \"Why did you need to kill him in the first place?\"<br>\r\n\"Weeeelll....\" she began. \"It's pretty similar to your situation. He was snooping around in the cargo and almost found out about the smuggling operations we've been doing here. Sooo.... I pushed him off the stairs then carried his body in one of those hideous luggages that Rhoda designed and brought him up using the elevator.\"<br>\r\nI sighed. I knew that since we were all on a plane and no one can escape, she would have to place the blame on someone else until we reach the airport. Who better than either me or Rhoda? <br>\r\nI snapped back into my current situation and thought that the least I can do now is stall until we get to the airport. I would then have a slightly better chance, if any, to escape Cammy Meele's clutches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see no point in killing me, Ms. Meele...\" I began to reason. \"You wouldn't want more blood on your hands, now would you?\" She was silent for a tad bit, for my logic seemed to influence her. <br>\r\n\"Hmph. You prosecutors....\" she began as she smothered me with her toes and the ball of her foot at my mouth. \"So you're saying that we're supposed to pretend as if nothing happened? I didn't kill that damn interpol agent or kidnap you? How would I know that once I let you step out of this plane that you wouldn't tell anyone else what I did? Prosecutors and lawyers like you are so obsessed with getting to the truth and bringing justice to us criminals. Oh no no no, Mr. Edgeworth. I'm afraid you're not going anywhere. I'll never let you out of my hands.... and feet. *heh heh heh* \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hopeless. It didn't seem like she'll be showing mercy anytime soon. Having my face used as a murderer's foot rag didn't make things any better either. I decided to stick to my original plan to kill time before we arrive at the airport. But who knows how long that would be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Normally I wouldn't even think of stooping so low, especially to a criminal, but under these circumstances, not only my life, but the conviction of the rightful murder depended on it. With only Ms. Meele as my witness, I swallowed my pride, and began to submit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Meele, please reconsider. If you let me go, I will do everything in my power to give you the lightest sentence possible.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh please, you're not fooling anyone. If I take my sights off you for one minute, you'll blow this murder right into the open and take me straight into court.\" <br>\r\nIt was no use. She's in the best scenario for her, no amount of bargaining would cause her to sway.<br>\r\n\"Now that you're mine, you can say goodbye to prosecuting for good. Maybe I should pick your new life for you. Hmm...\"<br>\r\nThat sinister look on her face as she pondered, I had a feeling this would be going from bad to worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on Mr. Edgeworth, you're going to be my eternal foot slave!\"<br>\r\n\"That's... insane!\" I exclaimed. \"I wouldn't dream of complying!\"<br>\r\n\"You don't have a choice. You gave up that right as soon as you fell into my hands.\"<br>\r\n\"Grrrr...\"<br>\r\n\"As my foot slave, you will massage my feet, give me pedicures, kiss my arches, lick my soles, suck on my toes, and when I'm not around, I will lock you in my closet and you will smell my shoes until I come back for you.\"<br>\r\nI couldn't believe it. Until this plane landed, she could do whatever she wanted with me, and I'd be powerless to resist. And unless a miracle happens, it would be this way for the rest of my life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my foot slave, I want you to start by...\"</span></div></div>",

She took one foot off my chest, and reached over to the side to hook one of her white leather shoes with her big toe. As she dangled her shoe over my face, I began to notice a change in the atmosphere. No, wait. Not atmosphere. It was an odd smell, and it appeared to be emanating from her shoe. It was faint, so I began to study it more. I closed my eyes, took a deeper whiff, and immediately regretted my decision. It was vile, putrid. The repulsing odor of what seemed to be an unpleasant combination of vinegar and expired cheese made me drive my head back as far into the floor as I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Meele began to speak.<br>\r\n\"Did you get a nice preview?\"<br>\r\nI shook my head.<br>\r\n\"Well...\" she replied. \"You just need to experience it full on.\" As soon as she finished, she grabbed her shoe in her hand, and rammed the opening into my face, my nose exposed to the rancid stench dwelling inside. I wouldn't dream of voluntarily taking in more of the smell, so I tried to breathe in through my mouth. She had forseen this, and pushed her right foot over my mouth, sealing my lips shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah!\" she said, imitating my finger wag in front of me in a mocking yet powerful gesture. \"You're my slave now, so you must do whatever I want. And I want you to smell, so take a nice big whiff before I make you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't going to let me breathe, so I had no choice. I braced myself, and took a whiff. The smell was ten times as strong as before! It was unbearable, having to smell it, but the torture did not end past the nostrils. I could feel the cheesy stench circulating through my body! With each and every moment I spent smelling this awful odor, I could feel my body giving in, my willpower slowly draining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you like it, I worked really hard to get it to smell this nice.\"<br>\r\nHer commentary was not helping, but I couldn't interject in this condition, so she went on.<br>\r\n\"We staff have a few pairs of shoes for each flight, but I just love the pearly white color of these shoes so much, I wear these all the time! I've been walking back and forth in these shoes ever since I started working here, and at 10,000 ft in the air, it gets awfully stuffy inside. To think, I've been walking in these for years, and now you have the pleasure of being the only man who gets to smell them! Aren't you lucky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky is far from the word I would use to describe it.<br>\r\nAck! I had been listening to her story to try and take the focus away from the smell, that I hadn't been trying to resist the toll it's taken on my body! Before I knew it, the smell had gotten inside my head, and each of my muscles had lost all energy to move! I could feel myself on the brink of passing out. The smell was too much for me to handle, and I could black out at any second!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I was about to give in, I noticed the smell rapidly fading. Ms. Meele had taken the shoe away. What would make her decide to give me mercy was something I could only speculate. Did she want me to stay awake? Did she have something else in mind? Something much more humiliating?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brushed her long brunette hair behind her, and leaned in close.<br>\r\n\"I've given you a taste of pleasure, now it's your turn to please me.\"</span></div></div>",

I held my tongue, and kept my lips pressed shut.<br>\r\nShe responded. \"Or perhaps you'd like another session with my shoes, hmm?\" dangling her shoe over me and slowly moving it closer.<br>\r\nShe had me cornered. The last thing I wanted was to be stuck underneath her shoe again, having to suffer from the smell at such intensity.<br>\r\nDefeated, I laid my tongue out for her.<br>\r\n\"Good boy\", she said. \"Now, my soles are so tired, they want a massage.\"<br>\r\nI took my tongue back to speak. \"To do that, you would have to take off my handcuffs.\"<br>\r\n\"Not from your hands, silly. From your tongue. Now, stick it out.\"<br>\r\nI swallowed in fear, and laid my tongue out flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed her right sole flat against my tongue. As soon as I felt the sweat on her sole connect with my tongue, I tried to retreat, though she had pinned my tongue into my chin. Her foot sweat smelt just as bad, though fortunately it wasn't as strong as being trapped inside her shoe. The taste was... peculiar, to say the least. It was; warm, slimy, but surprisingly, not the worst thing to have come from this woman. If anything, I could consider this a break between what could be worse forms of torment and torture in store for me. It would be tolerable, if it wasn't for me having noticed her rubbing her toes all over my cravat with her other foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her right foot, hovering slightly over my mouth. She commanded me to lick, and not to tempt her into doing something more punishable, I complied. I stuck out my tongue and reached for the heel end of her sole. As the tip of my tongue got a taste of her foot sweat, I moved my tongue up along her sole. As I did, I heard moaning coming from her. It was a moan of pleasure, of arousal. A smooth gentle sounding \"mmmm\". Just hearing it put my body and mind at ease. Perhaps it was because she was turning docile, or maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep going.\" Her command interrupted my train of thought. I continued to lick her sole, moving my tongue up and down, gently caressing her skin. As I went on, I heard more moans coming from her, and I could taste more of her foot sweat on my tongue. I never thought I would say it, but I think I began to find the taste quite... nice. It must have lasted about ten or fifteen minutes, before she raised her foot out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke again, sounding a tad bit flustered. \"Nice work, slave. I didn't think you'd have it in you.\"<br>\r\nBefore, a compliment from a woman like this would've slid right off my back. Though I somehow found myself, pleased to hear this from her. Perhaps I was starting to grow accustomed to this new lifesty-<br>\r\nNO! I must not submit to this! I am trying to keep her occupied until the plane starts to land, where I will find my chance to escape. I must stay focused on my mission, and hope this will all end soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's on your mind? What are you thinking so deeply about?\"<br>\r\nUh oh, I think she might be onto me.<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope it's about me. Since I'm your world now. I'm your everything. But enough talk...\"</span></div></div>",

I could feel her toes wiggling against my tongue, she was enjoying this.<br>\r\n\"I want you to rub your tongue all over my toes. I know how good you are with your tongue, so I want you to cover every single corner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued to follow orders, and rubbed my tongue on her toes. The skin on her toes were just as soft as her soles, if not more. From her moans, I could tell that she was easily pleased by rubbing my tongue on the underside of her toes.<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to lick between the toes as well.\"<br>\r\nHer tone of voice had changed. She wasn't quite as stern as before, she seemed to be too caught up in enjoying this that she's become less strict. As her commands started sounding more gentle, it didn't feel quite as humiliating having to submit to such a figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I licked in between her toes, I could feel the natural pressure between the toes of each side. She wasn't clenching, but the thought that she might at any moment and crush my tongue in the process crossed my mind. Nevertheless, I carried on. The sweat between her toes were thicker than the coating under her sole, especially between her big toe and index toe. As I carved out the sweat, she let out a particularly loud and memorable moan.<br>\r\nShe moved her other foot from my chest, and started caressing my face with her left sole. Her sole was still rich in sweat, and the smell started to cling to my skin, making the stench linger, and breathing through my nose more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her foot out of my mouth, but stopping just short of her big toe. She started plunging her big toe down and up, using my lips to massage the sides of her toe. During this motion, I realized that she was dragging me along through every moment, and despite her softened voice making her appear more vulnerable, she was still in full control, and she could have been messing with my head the entire time. I began to doubt if I would ever find an opportunity to take advantage and escape, but as long as I can make it to the end of the flight with her still in my sights, someone would be bound to walk into the cargo hold, discover her abusing a passenger and have her arrested on the spot. I had my plan in mind at this point, but before I could further develop the idea, I noticed that she had removed her toe from my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have that look again. I can see it in your eyes. What are you thinking?\"<br>\r\nHow can she read me so well?<br>\r\n\"I think you're missing something. I know what you want.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had also pinched the top of my nose with the tip of her toes, and kept my mouth closed with her other foot, forcing me to breathe deeply through the nose. <br>\r\n\"You're aching for my foot smell, I can tell. Now you get to smell it up close and personal. Enjoy, sweetie!\"<br>\r\nI had hoped this moment wouldn't come. I couldn't take it in lightly like this. I inhaled as deeply as I could, and the smell rushed through my entire body! She kept my nose smothered until I could barely handle it, making me want to beg for mercy. She would let go momentarily to tease me, before trapping me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love it, the smell soaring through you, telling you to submit to me. Your eyes flicker when you sniff it, you want me so bad.\"<br>\r\nI was too exhausted to reply coherently. The smell of her feet had beaten me savagely from the inside, I could barely make a complete sentence.<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're a good slave, I just might let you smell my feet as much as you want. You'll dream of my feet every night, and live your dreams every day. If I were you, slave, I'd be grateful to devote my entire life to such a beautiful woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese comments were ringing in my mind more than anything else she had said. Who knows how long it had been? I couldn't think straight, the only thing I could think of was the smell of her feet. I began to lose hope, there may not be any way out of this, and I probably will have to submit to a life with Ms. Meele.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I closed my eyes in defeat, a miracle slapped me in the face. I heard an echoing voice, one that was not the voice of Ms. Meele.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention ladies and gentlemen. Please return to your seats, the plane will be arriving in California shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Ms. Teneiro! And the announcement was my chance! Any moment now, she would head towards the cargo hold to prepare the luggage for drop-off. As soon as she walks in and keeps Ms. Meele distracted, I will be able to right myself and get up onto my feet. This torture session of Ms. Meele's would soon be over, and she would be behind bars for good. My final move would be complete. I looked up at Ms. Meele to see her reaction to the announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was flustered, as to be expected, but she brushed it off rather quickly. For a moment, she didn't say a word. The expression on her face was different. She gave an expression of determination. Then before I knew it, she has covered my nose again between her toes and blocked my mouth. The smell once again seeped into my body, causing each part of my body to shut down as I suffered. I figured out what she was trying to do. This time, she was trying to make me black out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I fell unconscious now, I would lose my chance to escape! I had to hold on as long as possible, and fight off this strong odor. I tried to struggle, but her feet kept me pressed against the floor.<br>\r\n\"I know what you're up to, and you're not getting away from me that easily! I'll make sure you never leave my sights! Now, give in to my feet.\"<br>\r\nThe smell was surging through me, poisoning me, keeping me subdued. With every moment I try to resist, the smell keeps me pinned and seduces each of my muscles to give in.<br>\r\n\"Fall asleep for me now, my slave, and be with me forever, forever under my feet.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everything was starting to get dark. The last thing I saw was Ms. Meele lean towards my face, close enough for her long bushy hair to tickle my cheeks a little, speak her last words.<br>\r\n\"Good night, my slave.\"<br>\r\nAnd with that, everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I awoke, I felt myself trapped. I saw nothing but darkness. I was no longer handcuffed and I was free to move my arms slightly in front of me. I felt like I was trapped in a rectangular shaped box. I felt around, and concluded that I was trapped in a suitcase. I let out a sigh, that I had lost my chance for freedom. Breathing in through my nose, I noticed the smell of Ms. Meele's feet was back, and as strong as ever. I felt around, and found her shoes on my lap. The putrid smell was even worse, because I was trapped in a small space, and none of the smell would escape. I was trapped with her shoes, the stench filling the entire suitcase with a thick layer that I couldn't take my mind off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly felt a giant shock, followed by rumbling. These movements triggered my inner-most fears. While I figured it was the suitcase being moved, the nudges simulated one of the most horrific moments of my life. I felt my spine freeze up, my legs going numb, and my head flashing with images of the nightmare of my past, which has plagued me ever since it happened. The tremors felt like I was trapped within the Earth during an earthquake, this was more intense than any other earthquake I had fallen to, and it wasn't ending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis nightmare has been haunting me for long enough! I had to take my mind off it, not let it control me anymore! It was pitch black, there was nothing to focus on, other than the shoes that were thrown into the suitcase along with me. I never wanted to stick my nose inside her shoes again, but the tremors were too unbearable. I took a deep breath, grabbed her shoe, and buried my face into it. I inhaled as deep as I possibly could, and let her foot smell seep into my body. The scent was pure toxic, and my body once again started submitting to the smell once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was working! Before long, the tremors began to fizzle away until I stopped feeling it. As I continued to immerse myself in her foot smell, the strangest feeling opened up inside me. I began to feel, dare I say... comforted, by the smell. The powerful cheesy vinegary scent started to become addicting, and I found myself forcing my nose deeper into her shoe, and caressing the leather with my hands. Even if I wanted to, I never wanted to stop smelling her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a drug addict obsessed with their substance, I had to inhale more of that aroma. Every time I took a deep smell of her shoes, my body felt more and more relaxed. I clung onto her shoes with all my life. I was in a moment of complete serenity and bliss. While I was in my own world, the tremors stopped, and I only just picked up a faint sound of unzipping. Light suddenly burst into the suitcase and I tumbled out from the back, still clutching onto her shoes. Looking up, I saw Ms. Meele, standing over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to see you liked my little present. I had to change into a different pair of shoes, but you deserved it after all the lovely work you did on my feet. You make a great foot slave.\"<br>\r\nI looked around, and saw a giant window, light pouring into the room. Pink carpets, wallpaper and bedsheets, I concluded that I was in Ms. Meele's bedroom.<br>\r\n\"Take a good look, this is where you will spend the rest of your life.\"<br>\r\nShe walked over to a closed closet door, and told me to look. As she opened the door, I saw stacks and stacks of shoes.<br>\r\n\"This will be your room, slave. When I have to go, you will stay here, and lick all of my shoes clean. I'll make sure they smell nice and sweaty, just for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back over to her bed, and sat down at the foot of it.<br>\r\n\"I hope you liked your trial as my foot slave, because from now on you'll be spending all eternity worshiping my feet.\"<br>\r\nAll my doubts about being her slave, and all the time I spent plotting my escape turned out to be in vain. It would've been better spent giving into my new mistress. But now I can spend the rest of my life making up for my mistake. My destiny was not to become a prosecutor, it was to spend my life groveling to the woman most deserving of pampering and worshiping. And now I will devote my life to making sure Cammy Meele would always be loved.<br>\r\nThese were my thoughts as I lowered my head under her feet, for what would be the second time of many to come.</span></div></div>",

The storm pouring down outside not nullifying his creative mind. Soon though, he grew sleepy, deciding it was time to hit the sack, not long after dozing off. A loud boom crackles right above his house. A strange gust of wind blew in his window. Moments later, a rouge streak of lightning, struck Dash in his bed. Thus starts our adventure.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dash woke up comfortably, sitting up and stretching, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. Yawning and getting out of bed, Dash finally took notice of his surroundings. One his room and house was now a medium-sized tent, with just a bed in it. Second, he was no longer the strapping young man he once was, but a short purple monkey, a pokemon named Aipom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Holy hell! Dash thought, as he grew more worried by the second. He'd always wanted to live in the pokemon world, but as a trainer and not the pet. He started to panic and hyperventilate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u0153You are here for a reason, young one. Be not afraid,\" came those words as an image of Arceus appeared. And for what ever power Arceus had, he used to calm the mind of the newly formed Aipom. Dash started to ease into his transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u0153What is it you would have me to do mister Arceus?\" Dash asked with slight bow. Arceus touched him on the shoulder and the whole world seemed  freeze for Dash, as he felt just a fraction of how much power Arceus possessed. And he was in awe of just that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u0153First, get used to your new body. Then I will send you messages that will point you in the right direction. I will give you all the knowledge you will need to know to survive. For now I'll take my leave.\" As he vanished, leaving nothing but a blank note and a weird collar, that Dash felt compelled to wear. And so he put it on. Arceus allowed a gentle rest come back to his eyes as Dash climbed  in bed, and fell asleep yet again.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dash, get up!!! We are going to miss our appointment with the Sabertooth Guild because of you. Get your lazy butt up.\" Rose the Vulpix said while pushing Dash out the bed. A very audible oomphf could be heard as Dash's head collided with the floor, landing in front of Rose. Now as a human, Dash never really cared about feet or in this case paws, but now he thought about how sexy and pretty Rose's paws looked to him, especially since they were in his face. Dash leaned in real close and planted a kiss on her right front paw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dash, You can can play with my feet later on, after our audition for the guild.\" Rose told Dash as she started to drag him by his back tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fine Fine. I'll wait.\" As Dash stood up and dusted himself off. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lets go then. I'm ready to impress then.\" With a huge grin on his face. As the pair walked out of his tent. And Dash went on, not remembering the conversation he had with Arceus. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Guys like \"scorp\" or whatever and \"Chrisw\" just plain suck. It's as if they didn't <i>read </i>the last two rules that I put so many caps on. NO SHORT CHAPTERS. I'm gonna start checking up on this more often, as well as adding and deleting chapters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n/end rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>RULES:</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The stories <b>must be</b> <i>female foot fetish</i> related.<br>\r\n- Shrinking/giantess is allowed<br>\r\n- No intercourse/anal. <br>\r\n- Vore is allowed, but keep it limited.<br>\r\n- No deaths (unless you reach the end of the story, but even then, I prefer that no one dies)<br>\r\n- Keep added chapters related to previous ones<br>\r\n- Come up with creative chapter titles<br>\r\n- Do not change character personalities <i>especially </i>if adding to someone else's story<br>\r\n-NO. SHORT. CHAPTERS. Making shorts chapters are useless to me and everyone else. <br>\r\n- Please, I cannot stress this enough: GOOD GRAMMAR, SPELLING, &amp; PUNCTUATION!
