Their digestive systems would also be injured, causing them to expel four times the amount of gas even the gassiest human on the planet did on a daily rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll train in their little room and totally ruin themselves in the process!\" Mystique crowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExodus nodded, joining his compatriot in some evil laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut which X women would try out the now literal Danger Room?</span></div></div>",

They all ordered from the Belly Burger and Emma went to pick up the food. However, they all seemed to be hungrier than usual, as each of them ordered four meals at a time. It had been half an hour and Rogue's stomach grumbled as she read a magazine on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I'm hungrier than usual today,\" she groaned, \"Usually I just buy a small fries set from that place but I ordered four extra large bacon burgers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPHFRRRRTTTT! Magik's gassy fart blasted in the room, which the girls were starting to ignore at this point, as if it had started to become normal for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate several bags of chips a couple minutes ago but I'm still starving!\" she whined, \"Where's Emma already!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened as the girls faces lit up. In came Emma, with not just several bags, but five wheeltrays each packed with several dozen bags each on them. Their jaws dropped as Emma walked in, sloppily chowing down on a chickenburger. Crumbs rested on her shirt and her face was messy with the grease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh.... I got kinda excited and ordered about... fifteen meals or so for each of us.....\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emma! You used my card! This must've costed several hundred dollars!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma just blushed. \"URRRRRRRRRRRRRP!\" was all she could reply as she dug back into her burger. Rogue licked her lips, suddenly feeling hungrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, forget it, I'm starving, give me my damn food\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls grabbed several bags and chowed down. Rogue went to task on her first gigantic baconburger, filled with three meat patties and three layers of cheese, as she washed it down with a Big Gulp sized coke. The cheese and grease dripped onto her gloves, as she wiped them off onto her legs, ignoring the napkins she had nearby. Before she knew it, she finished one and was already starting on the second. She grabbed some cheesefries as her side dish and started gulping a second cup of Big Gulp. As she finished the second burger and gulped the coke in one breath, she let loose a cannon of a fart as she licked the cheese off her gloves. She grabbed five more bags and dug in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPsylocke was on her fifth chicken sandwich at this point. Her face was messy with mayo as she washed it down with a large chocolate milkshake. She shoved some more onion rings into her mouth as she unwrapped a six sandwich. URRRRPPPPPPPPP! Her mouth released some gas before she dug in once again. She didn't toss the trash aside as it all piled into her lap, her legs getting covered in the grease and chicken form the wrappers. A fart rumbled into her bed as she finished the sixth sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagik had already eaten her fifteen double burgers at this point. She borrowed a couple chicken burgers from Emma and dug in. She scratched her hair a couple times, accidently greasing it up, but was too busy eating to notice. Her farts got smellier and louder, but at this point, in the commotion of the farts and burps it didn't really matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls spent over an hour eating away at the food, lost in the daze of their nearly infinite order.</span></div></div>",

She put in for more detail to confirm it. Sure enough, her first suspicions were accurate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Exodus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo answer him, Mystique zoomed in on the offending wires within the emitters, pointed them out and turned to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We made a slight mistake in the wiring. We set it to make the women fat at twice their normal rate, but we neglected to consider all their other changes. They're hungrier and they eat more, but all the extra food they eat comes out as sweat and gas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skinny slobs? That's a first. What about our other changes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're holding up well. They always split up into teams that specialized in combat roles, now they'll become specialized slobs!\" Mystique had to laugh at the changes the women must be going through already. \"They'll all have a little of each other's problems, but when it comes down to it nobody on another team could beat out Emma and her team in gassiness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about Storm and Jean Grey's teams?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teams were split up and decided that morning, but the one unusual case was Polaris. Because she just got her powers back and returned to the X-men, Emma, Storm and Jean decided together that Lorna needed triple duty training and bounce around on the teams until she found one where she could fit. For better or worse, this meant she would become a jack of all slobs, and after spending the morning practice session with Jean, she sat down next to Storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know I was so out of shape until this morning. Maybe I should spend more time in the Danger Room after we're done training,\" Polaris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her arm and scratched the itchy stubble growing under her armpit. Her attention went from Storm to X-23 when she felt the teenage girl's hand grip her arm and felt X-23's nose bury into her sweaty pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stink,\" X-23 said matter of factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you expect from smelling my armpit after a training session,\" Polaris answered. \"You're no rose yourself, you might want to take a shower and change out of those sweaty clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to get sweaty and dirty again anyway, I'll wait until we're done for the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura's right, and it appears the training regimen I prepared is a lot harder than I thought. There's no sense in freshening up yet when we have the rest of the day left to go.\" Storm said this while wiping her forehead. Like any of the team leaders, she was hit the hardest of all with the specialized slob changes. Her white hair stood out like a sore thumb under her armpits, which her teammates shrugged off as Ororo's choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarma took a napkin and slipped it under the collar of her suit to wipe off some of the sweat building on her chest, while X-23 blushed as she tried to secretly scratch her itchy, sweaty crotch.</span></div></div>",

Jean sat on her bed, her costume now clinging to her body that had grown by almost one hundred pounds and was so sweaty the stains could be seen through the material. Pixie made her way into the room after changing into a pair of pajama pants that used to be big on her but now the elastic was expanding to its limits and the tank top now exposed her round growing stomach. \"Awww, Ms Grey shouldn't you have changed already? The slumber party is *FRAP* just moments away,\" she said as her pajama pants fluttered in her own wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, oh right,\" said Jean as she wheezed and reached to her side and grabbed a bowl of potato chips, she lifted it to her face and started shoving her head right into the bowl and chewing on it all until it was gone. When she lifted her head back out her face was covered in grease and it could even be seen in her hair. \"But... I forgot where my pajamas are. Can't I just go in my underwear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, you're so smart Jean,\" said Jubilee who was lazing on the floor, propping herself up against the wall, her raincoat taken off to make space as her breast tried to contain themselves in her top and her pants unbuttoned and about to be ripped through by her fat legs. \"My legs don't feel good trapped inside these pants,\" she said as she rolled onto her back and lifted her fat cankle forming feet into the air. \"Pixie could you hewp me take them off, this zipper must be stuck or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPixie examined Jubilee's pants and remarked, \"Um, they're already all the way down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, sorry about that,\" said Jubilee blushing, \"I guess I forgot.\" Jubilee used to always feel like the dumbest member of the team back when she was a rookie, and that feeling came back quickly, only to be replaced by a bubbly happiness as she laughed it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, that's why I'm happy just staying in my wolf form,\" said Wolfsbane as she crawled into the room in just her tight fitting underwear that was drenched with stains and sweat. \"I don't have to worry about zippers or such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, um, Rahne, you're still in human form,\" corrected Pixe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I am,\" she asked in a confused Irish accent. She began grunting and straining until *FRRRRPPPP* \"How about now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that was just a fart, *wheeze* still human,\" commented Jubilee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, now I have to start walking on two legs again,\" said Wolfsbane, more embarrased at that than the fart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, something seems up with these girls,\" thought Pixie, \"they seem.... smarter,\" she thought as she started picking her own nose. She stopped to let out a fart and giggle over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" wheezed Jean as she sat up, her fat finally tearing a rip through the back of her costume, \"we should get ready.

Most of the time it would be a quick need to say \"excuse me\" or a blush at a fart, or quick nervousness over the pudge forming around their stomach. But after a few minutes the feeling would wear off and they'd be shoving their faces back into the food they had gathered around them. In fact at that moment one of them was going to get fairly close to breaking the effects of the spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm was struggling to tug off the leather leather one piece that made up her uniform, normally she could slip it off just fine but her extra one hundred pounds had strained it so much the leather could visibly be seen stretching and changing color. \"By the *Hnnnng* Goddess,\" she uttered as she tried to pull the costume down, \"when did this become so tight. The costume was so tight that she tried to fart but a muffle came out as her butt cheeks could barely spread out enough for it. She had begun working up a sweat, even more than before, and this went to helping her squeeze the costume down, it sliding slowly down her flabby roles until it dropped to the ground like a bag of groceries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm let out a sigh and fart of relief. There was a knock on the bathroom door. \"Miss Storm are you alright?\" asked Karma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much much better now child *FRRRRRT* I feel brand new after that.\" She scratched her rump with such vigor that her cheek flapped up and down making a small smacking sound. It was then that she couldn't help but notice how stretched out her costume was. She began scratching the stubble under her sweaty pits when she turned towards the mirror in the bathroom and saw her bronze skin now in folds and building up all over her body. Her massive breast flopped around freely and were covered in grease and sweat. Her stomach had a muffin top so large it drooped down to the point where her panties couldn't even be seen. And her fat leg's rubbed together no matter how far she spread them apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what has become of me!?\" she shrieked as she fell backwards and landed on her massive rump. She blushed so hard she could feel her temperature rising. Almost in response her farts started spilling out of her uncontrollably and she tried to clench her cheeks shut, but it just caused her to start burping loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teacheeeeeer,\" whined X-23, \"the rest of us need to change too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we could eat while she's taking so long,\" suggested Kitty Pryde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good idea,\" said Karma as she released a fart so loud even Storm could hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm stood up and started pacing back and forth, feeling her fat flapping up and down and jiggling uncontrollably. \"What has happened to me, to us?

However her embarrassment began to subside as it was replaced by a hunger building up inside of her. \"Ooooh, why did I have to come in here on an empty stomach without supplies.\" She tried to fight it but the feeling got the better of her. She cracked open the door and peaked out and saw Karma laying back and shoving miniature hot dogs into her gapping mouth, causing her fat to expand enough to begin shredding her costume. Kitty Pryde had taken out a liter bottle of soda and was chugging it down, only to take it away from her lips and let out a massive belch. And X-23 had scewered several donuts which whe was eating off her claws, her giant belly and large breast now pushing her tank top to its limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong with them, don't they see this,\" wondered Storm as she looked around the room. She stopped when she saw a large bowl of chips that were overflowing, the mere sight of which almost caused her to start drooling. \"I... I just need to reach that bowl without them seeing me.\" She slowly opened the door and started crawling across the floor, her massive breast and flabby stomach hanging down like udders on the cow she had been turned into. She finally reached the bowl and didn't even think to grab it, instead she just dove her head strait in and began chewing away like a pig at a trough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww *URP* Ororo if you were done you should have told us, we need to change too,\" said Kitty as she scratched under her armpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terribly sorry,\" she said lifting her head out of the bowl and letting a wet fart escape her rump, almost ruining the last shred of clothes on her, \"I just... I just got so hungry,\" she said as she shoved her head back into the bowl, all her worries now gone and once again returned to the lazy piggish slob she had become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" said Karma, \"but we need to get changed soon, the slumber party is about to begin.\"</span></div></div>",

Her pants were ripped in various places but luckily Storm was able to sew some curtains into the fabric and increase the size of the fabric, now easily covering her huge rump. Of course her clothes were covered in salt and grease from all the food she had eaten but she didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, on the other hand, was in her panties and bra, both stretched to their limits, Shadowcat's huge gut covering her crotch area, sweat glistening all over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarma, who had been fat once before but highly aware of it, was now just as huge. Of course she didn't care as much now as she did then and actually liked her fat, at least her slob-programmed brain did. She was dressed in queen sized bed sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX-23, whose butt, thighs, and belly were the largest out of Storm's team, save for the leader's huge proportions, was dressed in a modified version of her skintight leather X Man uniform. Her chubby cheeks were rimmed with powder from the donuts she had managed to find almost instantly, the food set out on a long table. Of course there was enough to feed the entire school twice over, the refreshments about the only thing cleanly looking about the slumber party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty and Karma started dancing as Storm started the music, the weather mutant waddling over to X-23 as Laura ripped a loud fart in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's keen sense of smell detected just how rancid it is but she could only muster up a momentary blush as she turned around. But instead of scolding her as she would have in her normal state of mind, Storm instead patted X-23's beer gut, causing the clone to belch soon afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one!

She suddenly got a strange hankering and decided \"Why do I have to choose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the refrigerator and found half a birthday cake from a party yesterday still sitting there. She didn't even stop to think about it as she took the entire thing out and placed it on the table. But this wasn't enough for her, she got a hankering for ham, and turkey, and mustard and relish and all sorts of other toppings. She kept grabbing items and didn't even notice that while her hands were busy grabbing food her mouth had a bottle of soda in it and she was attempting to chug it without the use of her fingers. Finally she got everything on the table and looked at it all and though, \"Well... I'll just pick and choose little bits of it until I'm full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe acted very pretentious and important, as she always does, as she reached down and took a bit of the cake on her finger and licked it off. The moment the frosting hit her lips she was gone, lost in a pleasant fantasy about food. She dug her hands into the cake and started slathering it across her face, chewing it down as frosting covered her cheeks, clumps of it falling to the ground. She kept reaching for one handfull of cake after another with one arm while the other reached over and grabbed slabs of ham and dunked them in mustard and started shoving them into his mouth, many times at the same moment as the cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her skintight pants start to tear as her butt began to expand. Her breast slowly grew larger until a tear started to form up her back. She kept eating and eating, cake covering her ever rounding cheeks as she snorted like the pig she was acting like, and she continued until she finally finished off all the food she had gathered. She layed back and patted her stomach, which sounded like a ripe watermelon and looked like an inflated beach ball it was so rounded with fat. The moment she slapped it a jiggle went across her fat and it caused her pants and top to burst off in one moment.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura was aware of the bar's delivery menu the day it was released. While she had earned her share of friends since her time with the X-Men, part of her was still the girl raised in near-isolation inside a laboratory base. Being able to snack on the bar's famous beer-battered chicken wings and towering burgers made a quiet day away from the bustle of the outside world even better for Laura.  Wolfsbane was no more extroverted than Laura, so Rahne quickly fell into line with placing massive delivery requests.  Kitty, more than happy to spend the day on a computer, reading a book, or playing some video games, saw no logical flaw in the waves of greasy food showing up at the Xavier institute.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Laura took to ordering beers. What started with a six-pack soon became stacks of cans, to the point where a sea of aluminum would surround X-23 by the time she was ready to retire to her room from one of the den couches. Lazing around, she began to find time moving much faster than usual; she could burn a whole day watching movies while slurping up dripping cheese and gushing streams of beer. She often took to wearing shirts that she had outgrown long ago, leaving her soft, widening gut hanging out. She could often be seen resting one hand on it contentedly as it filled with yet more sustenance. Laura's ass had swollen to take up nearly two couch cushions, and her belly was just wide enough to keep up with her waist. Her chest was certainly getting weightier, and her face had settled into an extra chin.  Laura took note that her body was starting to rankle at her diet; the constant stream of junk food and frothy beer had given her an omnipresent case of gas, and Laura found herself plagued with stomach cramps that even her regenerative abilities couldn't alleviate.  Rahne, possessing a canine sense of smell, always seemed to wrinkle her nose around Laura, occasionally remarking that she was developing worse manners than Wolverine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for some time, until Laura began to re-prioritize.  She was going through beer faster than it could be delivered. Bending around the couch to grab fresh bags from the sea of trash around her was starting to make her break a sweat, and she certainly didn't have the energy to be showering all the time, not with so much food to be eaten!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Kitty? You in there?\"  Shadowcat was sitting at her computer, stripping a chicken wing clean.  Laura noticed her friend's arms were much plumper than a few months ago, and that she was wearing jeans that were missing their button, allowing a handful of pale flesh to poke through from under her just-too-tight tank top.   \"I was thinking we could head back to the bar at night...just because we're ordering delivery all day doesn't mean we can't go out, y'know?\"  Shadowcat turned, licking some sauce off her lips. \"Sure, though you're going out in <i>that</i>?\"   Laura's skin-tight black pants had split at either thigh, and her stomach lolled out over her waistband.  \"Well..I haven't been out much...\" Laura examined herself, trying to pretend that the state of her clothes was due to her ignorance rather than her refusal to waste energy dragging herself to go clothes shopping.   Kitty got out of her chair and gestured to her hips, where most of her 90 pound gain had fallen. Laura saw that while Kitty's jeans were tight enough to mold her sides into generous lovehandles, they were certainly much bigger than her old ones.    <br>\r\n     Laura raised an eyebrow. \"When did you go clothes shopping?\"   Kitty smiled.  \"I just ordered some stuff online!\"  Laura tried not to blush; even spending 10 minutes online shopping seemed like a chore to her.   \"Well, just throw on some sweatpants for tonight or something, I'll order some better-fitting clothes for you. It'll be good to go out again; I'll tell you this stuff is greasy! Maybe we'll lose a few pounds walking to the bar...\"  Kitty's eyes widened as a fart escaped her rear end, splitting her jeans down the middle. Laura noticed her friend's panties were bunched up to a thong-like position due to their lack of a size update.   Laura smiled. \"I kind of doubt that, but maybe we'll air ourselves out a little!\"  Laura put a hand on her hips and let out a fart that she was planning on releasing silently in front of her friend until the recent turn of events.  Kitty tried her best not to giggle, but failed. Laura raised an eyebrow thoughtfully.  \"I wonder if all this food is hitting Rahne as hard as us...I kind of hope so, because -burrrrap!- trying to be sneaky about this is going to be trouble!\" <br>\r\n     \"No kidding.\" Kitty sighed, fanning her hand by her backside, cocking her head to one side. </span></div></div>",

Her upper body was getting the worst of her weight gain, her breasts already nearing D-cups and her belly wrapped in a too-tight t-shirt, hanging like a small  sack of feed over her waistband.  Shorter than her friends by over half a foot,  Rahne's generous cleavage was perpetually on display for her friends.  Kitty noticed that there was no excess flesh popping out of her clothes, indicating that Rahne had probably been the most conscious of how rapidly they were fattening up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying you don't want to come with?\"  Laura raised an eyebrow.  Rahne licked her lips. \"Well...lets not be hasty! Why don't we just try and get a little exercise first?\" <br>\r\nRahne decided jogging was out when her breasts nearly bounced out of her shirt before she hit the front door. <br>\r\n----<br>\r\nKitty shook her head. \"If I do squats I'm splitting these exercise shorts.\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nAfter her first situp, Laura began extending her claws, using their force to push her body up rather than her muscles, letting a fart rip with each thrust. Still, she was winded after her fourth, and her belly barely made it possible anyway!<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nRahne pinched her nose.  \"Laura, could you cut it out with the gas? I can't spot you like this, I'll faint!\"    Kitty raised her hand. \"I'll take over, you get used to it after a while, Rahne!\" Laura shook her head. \"More? Next you'll be suggesting I use weights rather than these tubs of ice cream!\"    Rahne's eyes widened. \"When the hell did you switch those out with the dumbells?! My eyes were watering, I've been half-blind!\" <br>\r\n---<br>\r\n\"I don't really have an excuse for skipping soccer...I'm just a computer nerd.\"  Kitty gave Rahne her best smile as she kicked the soccer ball away, sending a ripple through her thigh-fat.  <br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we've been at it for two hours Rahne and we've gotten-\"   <br>\r\n\"Sweaty and bad case of indigestion from all of those power bars.\"  Rahne let out a small belch. <br>\r\n\"Amen.\" Laura replied.<br>\r\n\"Well, we should hop in the shower then get going to the bar...\" Kitty started to turn back towards the mansion, her ass shifting up and down through tight-fitting black exercise shorts.<br>\r\nLaura lifted up her arm and sniffed her armpit. Laura noted she definitely was starting to get a little ripe. \"We're not -that- bad!\"  She put her fist over her mouth to cover a particularly voluminous belch. <br>\r\nRahne pinched her stomach fat. \"We stink enough already. I doubt anyone will notice a little post-exercise funk....geeze...my stomach is killing me! I was dumb for trying to run with a stomach full of fried food...\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After their showers, the girls had a bit of trouble. Fitting into their clothes was becoming a bit harder than usual. Laura ripped two pairs of pants wide open trying to fit into them. Kitty went through several dozen shirts, trying to find one that stretched past her large belly. It took Rahne fifteen minutes just to fit into a bra that didn't snap open. Frustrated, Rahne demanded that they were getting new clothes before getting food. Laura and Kitty tried to convince her otherwise, but her fiery eyes caused them to back off and go with Rahne to the mall before going back to the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them too tired to even consider walking, Rahne brought her car out as they squeezed inside and drove off. Laura let loose a fart in the backseat as she sighed, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mannn, I haven't had anything to eat in over twenty minutes!\" she groaned, \"I'm gonna starve to death!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get over it, Laura,\" Rahne said as her fat stomach pushed against the wheel, \"We're just gonna grab some better clothes to slip in for our new bodies at the moment. We won't be in there for longer than ten minutes, max\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled in to the parking garage and they got out. Kitty released a burp that echoed through the building, causing her and Laura to snicker. The three girls walked inside to the giant clothes store as they made their way to the women's section. They each grabbed some larger clothes and went to try them out in the dressing rooms. However, each one of them had trouble putting on clothes that were even larger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't going well,\" Laura sighed as she stepped out, \"I just tried several sizes larger and they still barely fit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty and Rahne both stepped out, disappointment seeping in on their faces. An employee saw their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is anything wrong, ladies?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all too fat for these clothes!\" Kitty whined with a fart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, this might be the wrong store for you three,\" the woman replied, \"A new store called Wide Women just opened the other day that has much larger sizes than we offer. You can find it at the other end of the mall\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three walked off and found the new store called Wide Women. Inside, they were all happy as they found plenty of clothes that fit them perfectly. Laura found a shirt that covered up her stomach perfectly, even if the shirt was large enough to cover her entire previous body. Rahne found a variety of bras that didn't lose support. Kitty was happy to find some pants that were snug enough to fit her big ass. The girls bought a couple bags of clothes each, changed into them in the changing rooms, and walked out happy in their new attires. Laura thought she looked cute especially in her shirt with a pig eating in a trough on the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the girls couldn't help but stop by the food plaza on their way out. The three of them sat in the car as Rahne drove to the bar, Kitty eating a bag full of chicken legs and Laura finishing her third baconburger during the drive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRP!\" Laura greedily burped as grease dripped onto her shirt, \"That was a great idea Rahne! With these new clothes and a quick snack we're ready for more food!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girls piled out of the car, repositioning their new clothing to cope with their standing positions. Laura eagerly waddled up the front doors of the bar, when she stopped short. Laura felt Rahne's chest briefly press against her back as she almost bumped into her.  Laura balled her hands into fists. \"Closed, owners on vacation for the weekend?!\"  Kitty could hear the loud growls emanating from Laura stomach....and Laura herself.  \"Woah, Laura, bad idea!\"  X-23 had released her claws, and was clearly making to tear the front doors of the bar open to gain entry.  Kitty sunk her hand into Laura's soft forearm just in time.  Laura wheeled to look at her friend. \"Are you suggesting we go to bed <i>hungry </i> tonight?\"  Kitty smiled and puffed a little belch into her friend's scowl.  \"No way, I'm starving.\"  Kitty sauntered through her friend and continued to phase through the front door of the bar.  She then simply undid the lock from the inside.  \"...Oh.\" Laura mumbled, kicking herself for her obvious oversight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura went straight for the beer tap. After setting up a few stools, Laura positioned herself under one of the taps (her belly was being stabbed by other taps because it bulged out so much, but oh well!) and depressed the lever. Laura's eyes almost rolled up into her head with pleasure; a constant stream of delicious, calorie-laden beer, never stopping unless she wanted!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rhane had fired up the fat frier. She indulged in a long, drawn out fart as she began to smell the chicken and ribs beginning to fry. Rahne glanced at Kitty, hoping she didn't gross her friend out. Kitty gave her a little nod of approval and licked her lips, also half-hypnotized by the smell of cooking meat.  \"I'll fire up the grill!\" Kitty declared, figuring that just food from the frier wouldn't cut it.  Rhane grinned, an animalistic hunger flashing in her eyes. \"When the burgers and hot dogs are done grilling, throw 'em in the frier.\"  Kitty's eyes widened as he imagined the taste, then darted to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura had swallowed about 8 liters of beer when she took her first break. Heaving herself off the stool, she felt the slightest buzz coupled with fierce gas. With no one around to judge her, the raven-haired beauty began letting out extremely throaty, deep belches that sounded like an air-horn going off inside a bullfrog. She contentedly peeked inside the kitchen to see her friends heaping dozens of hot dogs, chicken wings, ribs, and burgers onto multiple plates, occasionally grabbing one and stuffing their faces with it. Rhane had developed serious pit stains from working the frier, and Kitty's chin was literally dripping with oil from their unhealthy concoctions.  \"Hey, save some for me!\"  Laura exclaimed, startling the girls with another belch.  As the girls tore into their meal, they began to tire of just fried meat.  \"Fried Oreo time!\" Kitty cheered, and poured sleeve after sleeve into the fat frier, which was at this point positively shining with fatty residue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Washed down with generous amounts of beer, the feast went quickly, and the final course of double-fried foods seemed to go the fastest.  By the end, all three girls were unabashedly flatulent, unable to keep even the slightest pretense of politeness.  Laura rubbed her stomach contentedly.  \"Let's stop in for breakfast, we'll buy a few hundred eggs and like a sixty pounds of bacon, get the friar going again.\"   Kitty and Rahne made sympathetic groans of hunger at the thought.  Rhane perked up slightly. -Burrrap-  \"Laura, what are you looking at?\"    X-23 was staring at the fat frier.  \"Oooh....the grease is cooling....\" like a girl possessed, she rose to her feet and stumbled towards the metal bin.   Rhane gasped. \"Laura, no way!\"  She had stuck her face into the cooling grease, and had begun to slurp up the basin.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty and Rhane looked on in awe as Laura was face-first into the cooled grease, drinking it up like a horse at a river. They could hear her gulping at the thick liquid. Some of her hair got into the grease and was wet with the substance. She stood up to take a breath after several gulps, savoring the taste and licking her lips. The top of her piggy shirt was stained with grease, and some of it dripped off her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Laura!\" exclaimed Kitty, \"Why did you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHFRT! Laura's gas was smellier now as she stroked her greasy hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, I just thought it looked really good and dove right in!\" she said, \"It tastes sooooooo good! It's like a meaty drink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" uttered Rhane, still a bit blown away by what just happened, \"Are you kidding with us Laura? No way is that healthy....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura just rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you STILL going on about that girls? Come on, look at us. We're not exactly striking models anymore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls looked down at their big, dirty shirts and messy bodies. They definitely felt like they changed a lot this past month, almost unrecognizable from their old selves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it isn't healthy! So what! I'm tired of people telling me what's good and what's not for my body. If I can absorb alcohol with no problem, then why not grease?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuck her head back in and went back to feeding off the grease. Kitty and Rhane looked on for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You know, maybe it's not too bad?\" Rhane said, \"It doesn't hurt to try something once\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, yeah, it does smell pretty good right now.....\" said Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls cautiously walked next to Laura as each one slowly put their faces in. They felt the grease mere inches away from their faces, as they each took their tongues out and lapped up the liquid. Laura stood up and admired the situation. They both looked like they were feeding, just like the piggy on her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's the verdict?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some tasting, Rhane looked up at Laura. She tried to say something but a fiery burp came out. Laura giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's.... it's pretty good!\" Rhane said, \"This even tastes better than the soda I was having! I can't believe it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dove back in and dunked her face into the grease. Kitty didn't even take time to explain her opinion, as she was already slurping it up like water after a drought. Laura got thirsty again and dove in with the two girls, all three of them drinking up the contents. Their faces got coated with grease as they continued on with the dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd better get back to the academy,\" Laura said as she carried a huge bucket out to the car, \"It's 1 AM and I'm sure they'll wonder if we don't get back soon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 40 minutes with the tasty grease, the girls realized the time and decided to head on out. Because they loved the grease so much, they cooked up another batch (along with some more hot dogs and burgers they happily ate) and put it into buckets to take home once it cooled down. Rhane was carrying two more buckets, plus her thermos that she dumped the coffee out of and replaced with the much tastier grease. They placed the buckets inside as Kitty locked the place from the inside, then phased outside the building and jumped into the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls weren't much heavier, only several extra pounds each, but they definitely weren't hygienic role models anymore. Laura's greasy hair laid on her shoulder, as she sucked some of the grease off her shirt. Kitty began to develop some acne and her teeth started to yellow out a bit. Rhane was farting so much that she didn't realize it half the time, and the sweat on her body was worse than it ever was. With a quick gulp from her grease thermos, she started the car as they drove back to the academy.</span></div></div>",

Laura thought to herself, groggily getting her soft, greasy body up and throwing her fat legs over the side of the bed. \"Was that...Logan?\" Laura sleepily said to herself. She slowly heaved herself out of the bed, and with nobody watching, scratched one of her jiggly buttcheeks with an extended claw. But as she reached for the doorknob, she soon found herself grabbing a hold of a greasy roll of belly fat as Kitty had phased herself through her door...and landed with a thud on top of Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty what the hell?\" Laura said trying to push the flabby x-girl off of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Laura, I needed to hide from them. Needed to think of a plan.\" Kitty answered, clearly stressed and sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hide from who? What's going on?\" Laura answered, still grumpy she was woken up before 1 PM on a weekday. The door then creeked open to reveal a rather energetic-looking Rahne, who was wearing a blue and grey sports bra that barely managed to hold her assets, and made her flabby arms appear even bigger while at the same time, compressing most of her middle into a massive muffin-top that had her fat midsection spilling out over all 360 degrees of her body. Below that, solid black excercise shorts wrapped tightly around her booty which admittedly to Laura and Kitty, didn't look nearly as fat and flabby as their own when squeezed into the shorts. The shorts also emphazized her already monstrously thick thunder-thighs and flabby legs that while in no way shape or form were marathon quality, also seemed slightly more in-shape than Kitty or Laura's lard legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ummm...did I come at a bad time?\" Rahne questioned, seeing only one flabby half-naked body from the waist down on top of another upon entering the room. Laura, quickly turning red, pushed Kitty off of her stomach to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rahne, what's going on.\" Laura asked, now clearly angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you didn't know? Umm...you might want to just look out the window...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Kitty slowly crawled over to the room's window, and what they saw made their hearts sank. All of their classmates were huddled in a large group circle in running shorts and stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Logan and Xaiver thought it would be beneficial to have a daily team run every morning from now on. Team bonding and getting in shape all in one!\" Rahne was clearly more excited to get her body back than the other two. \"Well, I don't wanna keep you two, you guys still need to get some pants on! I'll see you down there!\" Rahne left. And the remaining two girls stared at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what.\" Laura asked coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?!?\" Kitty nearly yelled, \"We can't go down there! Remember the last time we Rahne tried to get us to excercise? It was humiliating! And that was just with the three of us! Can you imagine how awful it would be if the whole school saw how out of shape we are!\" Kitty was now yelling and getting red in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down...I actually have an idea...\" Laura smirked, \"If I leave some minor claw marks on you...we can just say that we got up EARLIER and were training right? Then we will have already had our exercise and don't need to go! And then with your phasing...maybe you could do some internal damage that we can say might take my healing factor longer than expected to repair and I need to rest all day to catch up!\" Kitty shrugged,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...kind of unorthodox but I guess I don't have anything better...cut me up sister,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah there,\" Laura responded, \"It was my idea...shouldn't I have the day off first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm why don't we flip a coin? I'll be heads.\" Kitty replied,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails,\" Laura answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin flipped, and as it fell, both girls were planning to find a malicious way to work the system they had just created so that only one would have to exercise....</span></div></div>",

X-23 snarled in dismay. \"Best two out of three?\" She asked. \"No way. I won fair and square so you get to exercise in my place!\" Kitty giggled happily. \"Now, I think you agreed to leave some minor claw marks on me?\" Laura sighed and popped her claws out. Gently, she pressed her claws against Kitty's side and slid them down. Kitty giggled as they did, leaving visible marks. \"S-s-sorry! They just tickle!\" She giggled as Laura looked at her in surprise at her laughing. \"Guess I better go out and exercise.\" Laura sighed as she started to leave. \"Have fun!\" Kitty smiled as she watched Laura depart. Laura stuck her tongue out at Kitty, who merely smirked. A little later, Laura was jogging with Storm. Laura panted and wheezed, sweat rolling down her face and body, making her greasy and smelly. \"Please *Wheeze* Ororo *Pant* can't... we... take... a *moan* break?\" She pleaded, gasping, wheezing and panting in-between each word. \"Alright.\" Storm sighed as they stopped, Laura flopping onto her belly, tongue lolling out of her mouth as she panted, clearly exhausted. For the last two hours, she had been forced to do 60 push ups, 40 sit-ups, 50 jumping jacks and now she had to jog 70 miles. Meanwhile, Kitty was happily lolling around, eating nonstop. When Laura did her push-ups, Kitty had eaten a giant hot fudge sundae with pickles. During Laura's sit-ups, Kitty had eaten a bucket of fried chicken before switching to a candy bar during Laura's jumping jacks and now was eating a whole chocolate cake as Laura finished her run. Luckily for Laura, she and Storm had finished their jog and she crawled into the mansion, dragging herself on her belly. Kitty was just finishing her cake, loudly chewing and smacking her lips, as Laura crawled into the kitchen and managed to pull herself up, using the fridge door. \"Oh, hi Laura!\" Kitty smiled, showing off her chocolate smeared smile. Laura merely grunted as she wiped the sweat from her face. \"Pee-yew, Laura! You really reek!\" Kitty remarked. \"Bite... my... big... greasy.... butt.\" Laura wheezed as she grabbed a bottle of water, only to change her mind and grabbed a pitcher of lemonade instead. She then began gulping it down loudly, not caring that she was spilling some of it down her front. \"Have fun?\" Kitty asked innocently, taking a loud slurp from her large Dr. Pepper bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoesn't say anything but glares at Kitty<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurps in Kitty's face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarts in Kitty's face after sitting on her <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake your pick!</span></div></div>",

With a small whimper, the Scot moved her hand to snatch another pint of ice cream, this one being, \"Chocolate fudge supreme explosion\". She pulled off the lid from the dessert, and scooped up a chunk of the ice cream, shoving it into her stained lips. Frowning, she dropped the spoon onto her side, lifting the pint to her lips, tilting her head back she let the ice cream flow into her maw, letting the chocolate slop enter and add onto her girth she developed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ever since the death of her son, the redhead was stuck in depression, a horrible case that is, but attempting to overeat on ice cream didn't work, until she started binging on other fatty woods to \"cure\" herself, sporting a new belly in the next few weeks. Growing and growing as Rahne indulged and stuffed herself, leading to her current state on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 With a grunt, Rahne lowered the pint and belched again, huffing slightly as she brought a hand to her the pudgy gut that grown in the middle, small droplets of ice cream on the orb, shifting her body to the side, the redhead grunted as a small fart escaped her ass. \u201cGod bless, ice cream..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhat died in here?\u201d Theresa Cassidy, Siryn, stepped into the room, her fingers pinning her nostrils shot as she scanned the room, the obvious answer being her teammate, chugging down ice cream and letting it flow on to the rest of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cShe's getting bad, y'know.\" Theresa spoke, stirring a spoon into her coffee.  \u201cAnd you think I care?\u201d Monet responded, giving the redhead a sigh, biting into some buttered toast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWell, she's our teammate! And you know.... depressed.\u201d Siryn whispered out the last part, putting her spoon to the side and taking a long sip from her coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWell, do you think we're going to solve miss ice cream's problems over there?\u201d She stared down at her toast, and then at a smiling redhead. Monet brought her head down and sighed, \u201cAlright, go call Lorna why don't you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Theresa brought her hands together and clapped, jumping out of her seat and running towards the hall, leaving Monet alone to eat her breakfast. \u201cI live with a bunch of morons.\u201d She sighed, biting into her toast. \u201cYe goin' to finish that?\u201d Rahne asked, staring down Theresa's coffee cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Another quick sigh was release, \u201cKnock yourself out.\u201d And Rahne grabbed the cup, chugging down the coffee as she walked away. Monet dropping her head as she heard a burp come from the petite woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAlright, ladies, it's just us girls. So you know what that means?
