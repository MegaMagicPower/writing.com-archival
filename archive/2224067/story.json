He wasn't the athletic type, but he wasn't overweight either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe attended university and made money on the side by signing up for some for work in the university's lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe currently had a girlfriend, who was the jealous type, she always wanted to know where he was and didn't like him talking to other women. He also had a number of exes and was despised by more than a few.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard had always been curious in the unknown and was almost certain magic and aliens really existed and would sometimes go out of his way to try and prove it. He had collected a few strange items over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe university housed a rather mischievous sorority, that loved to play pranks, especially on the guys. Richard had gone on a date with one of them once, only to discover it was a challenge and the girls had to pick the 'worst boy on campus' the girl who dated him came last at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also some strong activists on the university grounds, some were very anti patriarch and others were against over population. Richard tried to avoid those groups as much as possible but sometimes they didn't give him much of a choice.</span></div></div>",

He didn't always get along with his roommate and there was something off about him, though he wasn't quite sure what it was. He often had women over, a couple even belonged to those weird activist groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat annoyed Richard the most about the women his roommate would invite over is when his girlfriend called, she would always call him instead of texting, was she'd get annoyed hearing another woman's voice in the background, especially when they said babe or some other cutesy nickname. He'd always have to explain that it was a girl his roommate brought over. She'd never quite believe him and that was starting to strain the relationship. Richard had been in relationships like that before, he wasn't sure he could go with another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took his experimental drug he was being paid to take before bed just as the instructions had stated and he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a strange dream that night, it felt so real, there was a hooded figure standing over his bed. His sheets were pulled back and he was completely naked, unable to move. The hooded figure seemed to be focused on his crotch, it had reached down and grabbed his genitals and pulled it off. Richard's eyes went wide open as he saw his detached genitals being held in front of him.... then the dream was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---------------------------------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Richard had slept in, he still felt tired and his weird dream, or rather nightmare, was on his mind. He knew it was stupid but he reached down and touched his genitals, just to make sure they were still there. Only when he had touched his crotch, there was nothing, not even a single pubic hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard pulled the sheets back and looked down. His skin, where his dick should've been was completely smooth. He had been castrated over night... Richard told himself it was all still a dream as he couldn't move his eyes away from what he was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was happening to him was real, the only question was, where was his penis and testicles?</span></div></div>",

Standing over him was a purple skinned creature, with six eyes and a snout, it had no noticeable ears and had four skinny arms with two long fingers and a thumb. The outfit they were wearing was metallic in nature but also soft like cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt spoke in a mix of squeals, whistles and growls, some of the pitches hurt his ears. Richard couldn't read their expressions so he didn't know what mood, if any, the creature was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the only one in the room though, there was another one that was blue standing near his feet, this one's arms had different lengths too, the top arms longer and the bottom arms shorter. While the purple one had the same arm length. He wasn't sure what those differences meant, if it was a gender difference (if they had any) or if was a racial one. He would've been fascinated if he wasn't drugged up and strapped to a metal table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue one had a device in its short, left arm and with its longer arms it started to touch Richard's penis and testicles. Richard tried to say something about the prodding but something on his mouth prevented him from even making a noise. It was like his lungs were deflated of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a humming of a device then felt a warm string start at the bottom of his testicles and work their way up to his penis. The warm feeling suddenly became hot and a tiny bit painful before a cool and soothing mist was sprayed in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard's eyes went opened and he wished he could scream as the blue creature extended its long arms over Richard's face, in its hands was his genitals. The alien made some noises which repeated and the other one followed through. It hurt Richard's ears and for the first time he could understand what they were doing. They were laughing.</span></div></div>",

They were promoting issues with over population the most concerning part with their group was their poster of Bob Barker saying \"Right Idea, Wrong Species.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't the only one in the library either, in the corner there were a menacing looking group of girls. They looked like a study group but there was something off about them.

The strange study group off in the corner kept whispering and muttering, occasionally interrupted by laughter.  It wasn't that they were terribly loud, at least compared to some study groups he'd had to put up with, but every time he glanced in their direction, several of them were already looking at them.  He wasn't shy per se, but the whole thing was weird, and he was feeling too self conscious about the unwarranted attention he seemed to be getting to concentrate on his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't recognize any of the girls, at least as far as he knew.  Were they from one of his classes, or did they know someone he did?  Richard wasn't exactly well known on campus, but was there some kind of rumor about him that he wasn't aware of that may have changed that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they're just bored and looking for some sort of distraction,\" he thought to himself in an attempt to brush it off.  From his brief glances at their table, Richard noticed that they had some sort of large, old book that they seemed to be studying.  It looked like something from the library's archives, and if it was like any of the similar books he'd seen, it was probably very old and very dry, so he couldn't blame their attention wandering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard had been going at it for a few hours now and needed to stretch his legs, and the water he'd been drinking was finally getting to him.  Hoping a brief departure would give the study group time to direct their boredom elsewhere, he stands up to go to the bathroom.  But as he gets up to leave...</span></div></div>",

He had no clue what it could possibly be, but it was warm and felt almost like skin.  The feeling startles him, making him jump and shake his leg reflexively, kicking whatever it was free of his trousers.  He hadn't the slightest clue what could of possibly gotten into his pants, but he definitely would never have expected what came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords fail him, and Richard stares aghast as the very realistic dildo that flew free of his pants and lays on the ground a few feet away from him.  Its skin tone is very similar to his, and for some reason, it looks like it wasn't molded after an erect penis, but just looks like a regular, flaccid dick and testicles.  Stunned, he freezes with eyes wide as his brain tries to catch up with what's going on.  Everything goes quiet for a few seconds as the room stares at the object on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drop something?\" one of the girls in the study group asks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis snaps Richard out of his shock, and he turns to the girl that made the quip, face flushed with embarrassment.  The moment they see his reaction, the girls can no longer hold back and burst into a fit of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must be part of the prank sorority,\" Richard thinks.  He knew he shouldn't have bothered coming out tonight, but naively, he thought he would be fine at the library.  But he also couldn't stop thinking about how impressive the prank was.  He knew the sorority was supposed to be good, but how in the world had they snuck that toy onto him\u2014 and into his pants no less\u2014 without him noticing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls continue to cackle at his expense, and, fed up with the situation, he...</span></div></div>",

They can keep it and bother some other guy with their pranks, so far as he's concerned.  He's fed up with this stupid sorority and wishes they would just leave him alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it he gets to the bathroom, he realizes he doesn't really feel like he has to pee anymore, but he's already this far and doesn't want to go back yet, so he continues into the men's room.  It's getting kind of late and the library is mostly dead at this point, so luckily there's no one else inside.  He takes a moment in front of the mirror to compose himself and wait for his face to not look so blushed.  Though he no longer feels like he needs to go, Richard doesn't want to have to come back in an hour, so he goes ahead and makes his way over to one of the urinals.  He unzips his pants and pulls his underwear down, pulling out his...  Nothing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" he thinks to himself as his hands meet empty air where his penis should be.  He looks down in panic, only to confirm that his genitals just... gone.  Missing.  Where his penis and testicles should be, there's just flat, hairless skin continuing down from his upper pelvis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard looks around in a panic, and then darts into one of the stalls.  He drops his pants completely to get a closer look, but they're really gone.  He touches the blank space experimentally, feeling the distinctly smooth and soft new skin that now occupies his crotch.  It's very sensitive, if not so much as his junk is, and he shudders at the alien sensations, weirded out by the whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe begins to panic, but tries his best to calm down and think about all of this rationally.  He immediately thinks back to the weird dildo falling out of his pants, and while, at the time, he did notice how odd it was that it looked exactly like his own genitals, he'd just brushed it off.  Maybe his junk was just normal, and most people's happened to look like that, he'd assumed, but it looks like that wasn't just coincidence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis also didn't seem like it was just a sorority prank, he realized.  Though they were notorious for pulling off some crazy stuff, he'd never heard of them doing something crazy as somehow detaching someone's genitalia.  His genitalia. Which he now realized he'd just left there, lying on the ground.  Shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard quickly pulled his pants up, washed his hands and dashed out of the bathroom.

It's only been a couple of minutes, but the table full of girls are gone, taking all of their books and bags with them.  It looks like they've left for the evening.  But what's more, his junk is no longer where he left it on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard drops to his hands and knees, searching the around to make sure it wasn't kicked aside or in a different spot than he remembered, but after a few minutes of desperate searching, he comes up empty.  It's gone, and he has no clue where it went.  He hurriedly scoops up his books and stuffs them in his bag, running to the front desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fellow student is the only one working the desk.  With the library mostly dead this evening, she sits there, reading a book idly, pretty unaware of what's going on around her.  Engrossed in her book, she jumps in startlement when Richard scurries up to the desk in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, can I help you?\" she asks, confused by why he's so visibly worked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, uh...\" Richard trails off, trying to think about how to broach the subject.  \"Has anyone dropped anything off that they found in the library in the last few minutes?  I think I, uh, I dropped something and I'm worried someone may have picked it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm afraid not,\" she answers, \"I think we have a thumb drive or two from this morning but...\" She sees Richard's face drop and quickly adds, \"But oftentimes at night when there's less traffic, people won't bother dropping things they find off at the front desk and will ask around first.  Someone may already be looking for you.  And if not, sometimes we get some things put in the lost and found in the morning that were left the night before, so you can check back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's discouraging, but it was a long shot to begin with, and Richard doubted he was going to have any luck with the lost and found in the first place, but it at least was a convenient segue into his next question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there was another group that was studying nearby that just left,\" he tells the girl, \"Maybe they found it. Did a group of girls come by recently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh those weird goth girls?\" she says, lighting up.  \"Yeah, there're here like every night.  I tell my friends about them but people think I'm exaggerating. This is the first time I haven't had to kick them out when I close up since I started working the evening shift.  They always have that weird book that they bring with them.  At first I thought they were trying to sneak one of ours out, but they showed it to me and it looks like some kind of DnD book or something.  Some kind of role playing shit, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard perked up at this information.  \"Do you remember what the book was called?\" he asks hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squints her eyes trying to think back.  \"Like something-arcana-something.  Latin shit.  You know how a lot of that stuff is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard's mind begins to race.  He'd read about this kind of stuff online.  He was always reading about the paranormal, but he never expected to run into it first hand, especially not without seeking it out himself. Could that have been a real magic book?  Then what would that make them, Sorcerers?  Witches?  A Coven even?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. Everything he knew about those kinds of groups told him that they tended to be secretive, to keep to themselves.  Surely they wouldn't be operating in the open on a university campus.  But then again, he had experienced the potential proof first hand.  He needed to figure out more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long ago did they leave?  Do you know which direction they went?\" he asks hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I dunno, maybe five or ten minutes ago?  It wasn't that long,\" the girl answers.  \"I didn't really pay them much mind though, and I definitely don't know any of them, so your guess is as good as mine where they wandered off to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks anyway,\" Richard says, \"I'll try to get in contact with them and see if they might have picked up my, uh, my stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then heads out the library door.  The mysterious girls could be anywhere by now, but it's not terribly late yet, so they still might be out on campus.  On the other hand, he needs to do some research to figure out exactly what he might be dealing with.  Richard ponders his options for a moment.</span></div></div>",

His roommate and his roommate's girlfriend were watching a movie when he got in and mostly ignored him, for which he was thankful.  He was already stressed out enough and didn't want to deal with anyone right now.  He immediately opens his laptop and jumps on his bed, going to the paranormal message board that he frequented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pokes around online for awhile looking for info on witches and magic, but finds both too much information, and not enough.  He asks around on the forums, at one point even anonymously recounts what happened to him, but most just ignore him or accuse him of LARPing.  After an hour or so of mostly just getting frustrated,</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Richard suddenly feels his phone vibrate, so he fishes it out of his pocket. Shit. It's Kara. It's not that he doesn't want to talk to his girlfriend.  Actually, things are going great on the whole, but they haven't been dating terribly long yet, and he has no clue how to even broach the topic of what's happened to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand, he'd like to think she'd sympathize with him, but on the other, he really has no clue how she'd react. It's kind of embarrassing, or maybe even emasculating, and while she's great on the whole, she has some weird hangups with jealousy. He can't imagine she'd be fine with the idea of another woman\u2014or worse, a group of them\u2014literally having possession of his genitals. He also can't really explain the situation over the phone without his roommate and the girl he's with potentially overhearing, and he'd rather not drag them into it. At the same time, he's kind of been neglecting Kara lately for his studies, and he really doesn't want to mess things up, so he picks up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" he answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how's it going?\" Kara says cheerfully. \"Please tell me you aren't still at the library. I know you're excited about your research, but I promise the books will still be there tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I uh, I actually finished up a bit early,\" Richard says, \"I just got back to my dorm a bit ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great! I told you that you needed to take a break more often.  So what are you up to now?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing much.  I'm just kind of browsing the web.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a slightly awkward few seconds of silence as each waits for the other to speak.  Kara's the first to break it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Can I come over?  We haven't hung out in a few days now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, definitely!\" Richard says, mentally chastising himself for making her ask, \"Er, shit. Actually, Chris is here watching a movie with someone. But I definitely want to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara just chuckles as he trips over his words.  \"That's fine. You can come over to my place. Erin's out tonight with her sorority. You know it's their big anniversary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard was a bit relieved at that.  Erin was nice, but she could be a bit much sometimes.  She definitely fit in with her sorority, if maybe too well.  It was rare that he and Kara could spend time alone without worry about being the target of some prank or other, though she was never mean-spirited about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's great!  I'll head over right now,\" he says, shutting his laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!  Looking forward to it,\" Kara says, grinning audibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too!  I'll see you in a few minutes,\" Richard says and hangs up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard quickly runs to the bathroom and spruces himself up a bit.  He wasn't planning on trying to look presentable tonight and was a bit disheveled.  He knew it wasn't some romantic date, but he at least wanted to try.  He glances momentarily at the crotch of his jeans, almost having managed to forget about what had happened thanks to the sudden distraction. Did they look flatter? No, surely it was just his imagination. Besides, people don't really notice things like that.  Right? <br>\r\nFeeling apprehensive again, he tries to reassure himself that he couldn't do anything about it right now either way, so he might as well try to get his mind off things and see if he had any useful responses online after a bit of waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heading out again, Rich?\" his roommate Chris asks, looking up from his bed where he and the girl are watching something on a laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm going over to Kara's,\" Richard answers, opening the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great! She's a good gal. You need to hold on to that one,\" he says, \"Go show her that Dick Dickson lives up to his name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, thanks,\" Richard says, blushing. Chris was a nice guy, and he meant well. Their school lives were a bit different, but he definitely could have done worse as far as roommates go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttempting to take his mind off his empty crotch, Richard mentally tries to convince himself that the evening will be fun and he has nothing to worry about.  He exits out the front door of his dormitory, </span></div></div>",
