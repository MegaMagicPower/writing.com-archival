He wasn't the athletic type, but he wasn't overweight either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe attended university and made money on the side by signing up for some for work in the university's lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe currently had a girlfriend, who was the jealous type, she always wanted to know where he was and didn't like him talking to other women. He also had a number of exes and was despised by more than a few.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard had always been curious in the unknown and was almost certain magic and aliens really existed and would sometimes go out of his way to try and prove it. He had collected a few strange items over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe university housed a rather mischievous sorority, that loved to play pranks, especially on the guys. Richard had gone on a date with one of them once, only to discover it was a challenge and the girls had to pick the 'worst boy on campus' the girl who dated him came last at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also some strong activists on the university grounds, some were very anti patriarch and others were against over population. Richard tried to avoid those groups as much as possible but sometimes they didn't give him much of a choice.</span></div></div>",

He didn't always get along with his roommate and there was something off about him, though he wasn't quite sure what it was. He often had women over, a couple even belonged to those weird activist groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat annoyed Richard the most about the women his roommate would invite over is when his girlfriend called, she would always call him instead of texting, was she'd get annoyed hearing another woman's voice in the background, especially when they said babe or some other cutesy nickname. He'd always have to explain that it was a girl his roommate brought over. She'd never quite believe him and that was starting to strain the relationship. Richard had been in relationships like that before, he wasn't sure he could go with another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took his experimental drug he was being paid to take before bed just as the instructions had stated and he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a strange dream that night, it felt so real, there was a hooded figure standing over his bed. His sheets were pulled back and he was completely naked, unable to move. The hooded figure seemed to be focused on his crotch, it had reached down and grabbed his genitals and pulled it off. Richard's eyes went wide open as he saw his detached genitals being held in front of him.... then the dream was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---------------------------------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Richard had slept in, he still felt tired and his weird dream, or rather nightmare, was on his mind. He knew it was stupid but he reached down and touched his genitals, just to make sure they were still there. Only when he had touched his crotch, there was nothing, not even a single pubic hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard pulled the sheets back and looked down. His skin, where his dick should've been was completely smooth. He had been castrated over night... Richard told himself it was all still a dream as he couldn't move his eyes away from what he was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was happening to him was real, the only question was, where was his penis and testicles?</span></div></div>",

Standing over him was a purple skinned creature, with six eyes and a snout, it had no noticeable ears and had four skinny arms with two long fingers and a thumb. The outfit they were wearing was metallic in nature but also soft like cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt spoke in a mix of squeals, whistles and growls, some of the pitches hurt his ears. Richard couldn't read their expressions so he didn't know what mood, if any, the creature was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the only one in the room though, there was another one that was blue standing near his feet, this one's arms had different lengths too, the top arms longer and the bottom arms shorter. While the purple one had the same arm length. He wasn't sure what those differences meant, if it was a gender difference (if they had any) or if was a racial one. He would've been fascinated if he wasn't drugged up and strapped to a metal table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue one had a device in its short, left arm and with its longer arms it started to touch Richard's penis and testicles. Richard tried to say something about the prodding but something on his mouth prevented him from even making a noise. It was like his lungs were deflated of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a humming of a device then felt a warm string start at the bottom of his testicles and work their way up to his penis. The warm feeling suddenly became hot and a tiny bit painful before a cool and soothing mist was sprayed in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard's eyes went opened and he wished he could scream as the blue creature extended its long arms over Richard's face, in its hands was his genitals. The alien made some noises which repeated and the other one followed through. It hurt Richard's ears and for the first time he could understand what they were doing. They were laughing.</span></div></div>",

Unable to struggle, or even protest, he could only watch in horror as the strange machine was pressed up against his forehead. There was that same warm, pinching sensation as the alien activated the machine, and Richard could feel it running around the top of his head. After a few moments, the alien's hand completed the circuit of his head and he could hear a clattering sound on the table just behind him. There was a sensation of cold air on the inside of his head as the alien reached back and picked his detached skull cap up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt dangled it mockingly in front of Richard before setting it aside, looking for all the world like an unused wig. Richard could feel himself sweating. He couldn't see what had happened, but he knew. Just out of vision, his brain was lying exposed to the air, partially hanging out of his head on the cold metal table. But he also knew that these aliens weren't going to stop there. They were going to completely remove him from his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuddered mentally and his brain throbbed with anxiety as the blue alien scooped it up. He mentally tried to brace himself as the alien lowered the device behind his head again. There was that, by now familiar, pinching sensation again, this time at the base of his skull, and then... Nothing. His lobes jiggled as his detached brain rolled out of his head and onto the table. They'd actually done it. He was just a disembodied brain! Unable to see, hear, or even feel whatever they were about to do to him, he was completely helpless!</span></div></div>",

He worried for a moment that this was how he was going to die. As the experimental subject of a pair of sadistic aliens, taken apart like a frog for a school science class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the moments passed though, he started to calm down. Without any outside sensation, it was near impossible for him to tell how long it was. But it didn't -feel- like he was dying, and surely he would know, right? If he'd still had a heart, it would have slowed down from what would doubtless have been a frantic pace. This was actually quite calming. It was hard to worry when he couldn't even see what the aliens were doing. He found himself musing that he could actually get used to this. Maybe this whole thing wasn't even happening. With his senses cut off, it was easy to convince himself that this whole situation might be a dream that he'd wake up from any moment now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was thinking that though, he felt a bizarre jump in his thoughts, as if they had been momentarily scrambled. It felt like something was wrapped around his mind, literally. It was a sensation that he'd never felt before, but it didn't take him long to work out what it was, and when he did, his heart metaphorically dropped through his stomach. One of the aliens (He assumed it was the blue one, but without any senses it was impossible to tell) had picked him up. What were they going to do with him now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Richard got his answer. There was a sensation of being dropped into some kind of liquid, and suddenly he could see again! The purple alien was right in front of him, and screwing a lid onto the specimen jar that he'd been placed inside of! He didn't know -how- he was able to see, since there wasn't any camera from what he could tell, but he was able to look around easily enough. Not that this was a great comfort. He could see his former dick and the still attached balls floating in the jar next to him, and he could see the blue alien still standing by his body. He felt his earlier panic returning.

From his brief glances at their table, Richard noticed that they had some sort of large, old book that they seemed to be studying.

They can keep it and bother some other guy with their pranks, so far as he's concerned.  He's fed up with this stupid sorority and wishes they would just leave him alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it he gets to the bathroom, he realizes he doesn't really feel like he has to pee anymore, but he's already this far and doesn't want to go back yet, so he continues into the men's room.  It's getting kind of late and the library is mostly dead at this point, so luckily there's no one else inside.  He takes a moment in front of the mirror to compose himself and wait for his face to not look so blushed.  Though he no longer feels like he needs to go, Richard doesn't want to have to come back in an hour, so he goes ahead and makes his way over to one of the urinals.  He unzips his pants and pulls his underwear down, pulling out his...  Nothing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" he thinks to himself as his hands meet empty air where his penis should be.  He looks down in panic, only to confirm that his genitals just... gone.  Missing.  Where his penis and testicles should be, there's just flat, hairless skin continuing down from his upper pelvis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard looks around in a panic, and then darts into one of the stalls.  He drops his pants completely to get a closer look, but they're really gone.  He touches the blank space experimentally, feeling the distinctly smooth and soft new skin that now occupies his crotch.  It's very sensitive, if not so much as his junk is, and he shudders at the alien sensations, weirded out by the whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe begins to panic, but tries his best to calm down and think about all of this rationally.  He immediately thinks back to the weird dildo falling out of his pants, and while, at the time, he did notice how odd it was that it looked exactly like his own genitals, he'd just brushed it off.  Maybe his junk was just normal, and most people's happened to look like that, he'd assumed, but it looks like that wasn't just coincidence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis also didn't seem like it was just a sorority prank, he realized.  Though they were notorious for pulling off some crazy stuff, he'd never heard of them doing something crazy as somehow detaching someone's genitalia.  His genitalia. Which he now realized he'd just left there, lying on the ground.  Shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard quickly pulled his pants up, washed his hands and dashed out of the bathroom.  He rushes back to the table he was studying at, but when he gets there...</span></div></div>",

It's only been a couple of minutes, but the table full of girls are gone, taking all of their books and bags with them.  It looks like they've left for the evening.  But what's more, his junk is no longer where he left it on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard drops to his hands and knees, searching the around to make sure it wasn't kicked aside or in a different spot than he remembered, but after a few minutes of desperate searching, he comes up empty.  It's gone, and he has no clue where it went.  He hurriedly scoops up his books and stuffs them in his bag, running to the front desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fellow student is the only one working the desk.  With the library mostly dead this evening, she sits there, reading a book idly, pretty unaware of what's going on around her.  Engrossed in her book, she jumps in startlement when Richard scurries up to the desk in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, can I help you?\" she asks, confused by why he's so visibly worked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, uh...\" Richard trails off, trying to think about how to broach the subject.  \"Has anyone dropped anything off that they found in the library in the last few minutes?  I think I, uh, I dropped something and I'm worried someone may have picked it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm afraid not,\" she answers, \"I think we have a thumb drive or two from this morning but...\" She sees Richard's face drop and quickly adds, \"But oftentimes at night when there's less traffic, people won't bother dropping things they find off at the front desk and will ask around first.  Someone may already be looking for you.  And if not, sometimes we get some things put in the lost and found in the morning that were left the night before, so you can check back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's discouraging, but it was a long shot to begin with, and Richard doubted he was going to have any luck with the lost and found in the first place, but it at least was a convenient segue into his next question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there was another group that was studying nearby that just left,\" he tells the girl, \"Maybe they found it. Did a group of girls come by recently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh those weird goth girls?\" she says, lighting up.  \"Yeah, there're here like every night.  I tell my friends about them but people think I'm exaggerating. This is the first time I haven't had to kick them out when I close up since I started working the evening shift.  They always have that weird book that they bring with them.  At first I thought they were trying to sneak one of ours out, but they showed it to me and it looks like some kind of DnD book or something.  Some kind of role playing shit, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard perked up at this information.  \"Do you remember what the book was called?\" he asks hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squints her eyes trying to think back.  \"Like something-arcana-something.  Latin shit.  You know how a lot of that stuff is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard's mind begins to race.  He'd read about this kind of stuff online.  He was always reading about the paranormal, but he never expected to run into it first hand, especially not without seeking it out himself. Could that have been a real magic book?  Then what would that make them, Sorcerers?  Witches?  A Coven even?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. Everything he knew about those kinds of groups told him that they tended to be secretive, to keep to themselves.  Surely they wouldn't be operating in the open on a university campus.  But then again, he had experienced the potential proof first hand.  He needed to figure out more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long ago did they leave?  Do you know which direction they went?\" he asks hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I dunno, maybe five or ten minutes ago?  It wasn't that long,\" the girl answers.  \"I didn't really pay them much mind though, and I definitely don't know any of them, so your guess is as good as mine where they wandered off to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks anyway,\" Richard says, \"I'll try to get in contact with them and see if they might have picked up my, uh, my stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then heads out the library door.  The mysterious girls could be anywhere by now, but it's not terribly late yet, so they still might be out on campus.  On the other hand, he needs to do some research to figure out exactly what he might be dealing with.  Richard ponders his options for a moment.</span></div></div>",

Also, it was getting kind of late, there was a good chance that they just went back to their dorms, so trying to wander around searching for them could end up being a huge waste of time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he needed to know what he was dealing with first, anyway.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Richard suddenly feels his phone vibrate, so he fishes it out of his pocket. Shit. It's Kara. It's not that he doesn't want to talk to his girlfriend.  Actually, things are going great on the whole, but they haven't been dating terribly long yet, and he has no clue how to even broach the topic of what's happened to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand, he'd like to think she'd sympathize with him, but on the other, he really has no clue how she'd react. It's kind of embarrassing, or maybe even emasculating, and while she's great on the whole, she has some weird hangups with jealousy. He can't imagine she'd be fine with the idea of another woman\u2014or worse, a group of them\u2014literally having possession of his genitals. He also can't really explain the situation over the phone without his roommate and the girl he's with potentially overhearing, and he'd rather not drag them into it. At the same time, he's kind of been neglecting Kara lately for his studies, and he really doesn't want to mess things up, so he picks up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" he answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how's it going?\" Kara says cheerfully. \"Please tell me you aren't still at the library. I know you're excited about your research, but I promise the books will still be there tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I uh, I actually finished up a bit early,\" Richard says, \"I just got back to my dorm a bit ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great! I told you that you needed to take a break more often.  So what are you up to now?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing much.  I'm just kind of browsing the web.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a slightly awkward few seconds of silence as each waits for the other to speak.  Kara's the first to break it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Can I come over?  We haven't hung out in a few days now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, definitely!\" Richard says, mentally chastising himself for making her ask, \"Er, shit. Actually, Chris is here watching a movie with someone. But I definitely want to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara just chuckles as he trips over his words.  \"That's fine. You can come over to my place. Erin's out tonight with her sorority. You know it's their big anniversary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard was a bit relieved at that.  Erin was nice, but she could be a bit much sometimes.  She definitely fit in with her sorority, if maybe too well.  It was rare that he and Kara could spend time alone without worry about being the target of some prank or other, though she was never mean-spirited about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's great!  I'll head over right now,\" he says, shutting his laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!  Looking forward to it,\" Kara says, grinning audibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too!  I'll see you in a few minutes,\" Richard says and hangs up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard quickly runs to the bathroom and spruces himself up a bit.  He wasn't planning on trying to look presentable tonight and was a bit disheveled.  He knew it wasn't some romantic date, but he at least wanted to try.  He glances momentarily at the crotch of his jeans, almost having managed to forget about what had happened thanks to the sudden distraction. Did they look flatter? No, surely it was just his imagination. Besides, people don't really notice things like that.  Right? <br>\r\nFeeling apprehensive again, he tries to reassure himself that he couldn't do anything about it right now either way, so he might as well try to get his mind off things and see if he had any useful responses online after a bit of waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heading out again, Rich?\" his roommate Chris asks, looking up from his bed where he and the girl are watching something on a laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm going over to Kara's,\" Richard answers, opening the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great! She's a good gal. You need to hold on to that one,\" he says, \"Go show her that Dick Dickson lives up to his name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, thanks,\" Richard says, blushing. Chris was a nice guy, and he meant well. Their school lives were a bit different, but he definitely could have done worse as far as roommates go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttempting to take his mind off his empty crotch, Richard mentally tries to convince himself that the evening will be fun and he has nothing to worry about.  He exits out the front door of his dormitory, </span></div></div>",

She was cute but not beautiful and she had an average build, with breasts on the smaller side and a small amount of body fat. Richard loved her regardless of her appearance, she was smarter and funnier than the other girls he had dated and they got along quite well. However Valarie was insecure about her looks, and always feared a prettier woman would steal Richard away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValarie lived close to the campus, sharing a small house with her aunts. It was a nice retreat for Richard on the weekend when he didn't have to go to classes, as he moved interstate to attend university. Richard preferred staying in with Valarie lately as the last few times, he had been accused at looking at the waiter too much, which lead to an argument. Even at the house he had to be careful at looking at Valarie's aunt's too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard sighed as Valarie laid against his chest, while they watched Netflix on her bed. He really enjoyed her company but she was becoming too problematic. He'd always get yelled at if Valarie even thought he was focused on another girl. She was getting way too jealous. Richard couldn't even keep his eyes on the TV when the lead actress appeared in certain scenes and he had already received one glare from Valarie while they watched the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard...\" Valarie said looking up at him before sitting up. \"I've been thinking...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard hoped this was going where he thought it was. He was at his wits end with Valarie but he didn't want to breakup with her, he felt that would validate everything she thought. But if she were to breakup with him, that would make it easier. \"Yes? Val\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I haven't been on my best behaviour lately. But that's because I love you so much and I want to make this work. Though in order to do that, there needs to be a change...\" she continued. This was actually better than Richard had hoped for, Valarie had seen the error in her ways and was willing to change for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what you think is best...\" Richard agreed with her but not too much. He had fallen for that before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I knew you'd understand...\" Valarie gave him the biggest smile and kissed him on the cheek. She then pushed him onto his back and pulled down his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard didn't think she'd go this far just yet, they still hadn't slept together but he was happy to let Valarie do whatever she liked. At least he thought he did. It wasn't until she grabbed his dick and balls too tightly and began to pull them, did he regret it. \"You're hurting me...\" Richard moaned in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will only take a second...\" Valarie promised as she sat on his legs. \"This is way harder than my aunts told me it'd be.\" Richard felt one last pull and then the pain was gone. \"There, all done,\" Valarie was proud with herself. Richard looked up to see what exactly she thought she had done when he saw his genitals dangling from Valarie's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to me?!\" Richard screamed as he reached down and touched his blank crotch, confirming that Valarie had somehow pulled his genitals off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValarie looked at him confused. \"I thought you agreed for the change. With your dick now in my possession I don't need to be jealous of other girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you meant you were going to change!\" Richard snapped, there was no way he expected this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you want me to change?\" Valarie asked genuinely hurt. Richard sat up and she pulled away from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so angry at her for not seeing how fucked up this situation was but she had his genitals in her hand and he wasn't sure how she even managed to do that. He decided to take the gentle approach as he didn't want to risk her wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry...\" he pleaded. \"I just didn't think you meant this... I didn't even think this was possible...\" Richard couldn't describe the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, isn't it great? My aunt's taught me,\" Valarie explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's great and all but how does this help exactly?\" Richard wanted to ask so many questions but the how wasn't important at the moment, it was the why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, if I keep this, you can't be with other girls. So now I have nothing to worry about,\" Valarie gave an innocent smile as she fiddled with the detached penis and testicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where does that leave me? How am I meant to got to the toilet,\" Richard wanted to ask about a million other questions, actually he wanted to demand she give it back, but he was now frightened of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy silly...\" Valarie begins....</span></div></div>",

Soon he was able to narrow down the location and even tracked down the man who first posted the claims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man had told Richard that he was returning home from a movie at the cinemas, that he was suddenly busting for the toilet, and saw the park across the road. It was after midnight but still the man needed to go. As soon as he entered the bathroom he could feel the presence of something but since he had just watched a horror film he blamed it on that. The lights didn't work properly in the toilet and it was hard to see. Still he could make out all the graffiti dicks on the walls. He used the urinal and that's when the ghost or demon struck. The man didn't tell Richard what it did, if anything, just that it was too dangerous to go at night and he wanted to warn everyone he possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard didn't heed the warning though. For him, this was his chance to prove the supernatural existed, so one spare night he decided to go to this park and find the so called haunted bathroom. He brought everything he felt he needed to capture the ghost on camera or at least an audio recording.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went alone, unable to find anyone to join him and the first two stories the man had told him, turned out to be true. He saw all the graffiti dicks, though this wasn't out of the ordinary for a public restroom like this and the lights refused to work properly. He didn't feel any other worldly presence, though he decided to stay for half an hour, trying to communicate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't work and when Richard felt he had been in the bathroom too long and went to leave, he got an idea. The man had told him that he went to use the bathroom when he was attacked, so Richard went over to the closest urinal and lowered his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly he felt a chill up his spine and it felt like something was standing right behind him. His heart raced with fear and he was unable to move. He felt something cold touch his penis and then felt a strong pulling sensation, as his entire genitals flew out of his pants and landed inside the urinal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard's eyes went wide as he didn't know what to look at, his detached dick or his empty crouch. As he stood there, immobilized by fear and shot his genitals began to float upwards, and went towards one of the stalls. Richard turned around, though not by his own choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched in horror as his genitals...</span></div></div>",
