Now, this 'guillotine' (hand gestures provided by Dr. Evil) is the most simple thing, you just lean the vic- subject number one's neck in the machine slot. Then, you set the safety device known as the 'lock' so that the procedure may continue in peace, as the subject may experience a sensation of fear and despair, but this will only happen if you either failed to administer enough ehem, 'assurance' so that they think that this is a completely safe procedure. Next, you pull the device known as the 'lever' that activates the mechanisms that make this procedure so easy. Now, by this point, you will have a perfectly swappable head and a recipient body. You will know that you followed the instructions correctly by the sudden silence that comes when the vi- patient stops screaming, otherwise you may need to repeat the steps a few times. Now that you have a head and a body, you just repeat those steps with the next subject until you have two heads and to recipient bodies. Unfortunately, this machine lacks the function to properly attach the heads to the bodies, a feature that we plan to add in later versions. But that can be fixed with a variety of tools, including: cateurization via a welding torch, sewing needles, industrial grade glue, and many other things. If you lack the money to buy our latest Guillotine model XVI then don't worry, we have a much more economic solution. It's called a 'blade', and comes in many different models and sizes! As a side note, results may vary, so may blade prices. Product use is subject to buyer's local law, and may be allowed or banned in accordance. Smiling Tools &amp; Co. is not held responsible for damages caused by use or misuse of it's products.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively: There's a device that trades the minds of people. Drunken and misplaced terrorists who may or not be high use it to swap the minds of  heads of state with the cast of Jersey Shore.

Besides, frogs don't jump \"high.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wish is fulfilled by becoming the greatest high-jumper in history. You go to the Olympics and win. You win at every track meet everywhere in the world. You spend every waking hour training so you can always jump high. This leaves you without a social life which is actually good because, after winning every time, everyone hates you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou become depressed and finally make your greatest high jump. As you do you think back to what it might have been like to be a frog. You then land awkwardly and break your neck leaving you paralyzed and in a coma for several years until you're given an experimental drug made from frog juice. You jump out of bed and start bounding down the hall, out the doors and into a nearby pond. You're attacked by all the frogs there and are pulled barely alive and taken back to the hospital where they have to strap you down to keep you from constantly jumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, you are now conscious and able to speak. Well, maybe croak is the better word for the sounds that come from your mouth. After another year, a young intern tests you to type on a computer. Miraculously, you compose words that make sense and everyone is amazed. Unfortunately, your mind is still mush, and all you want to type are poems about water lilies and fantasies about being turned into a frog. They are not good enough to publish and make money to pay your bills, so they take the computer away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sends you into the deepest of depression, and finally you even stop croaking at the moon. One night a shooting star sails across the sky outside your window. You make one wish upon a star thinking your dreams will come true. When you fall asleep and dream, it is no longer of frogs. You see a stary sky with flashes sailing across it. You smile involuntarily as the sound of another shooting star thunders down upon the hospital. Your body is fried with nothing remaining but your legs which propelled you to jump so high. When those are pulled from the wreckage, their aroma makes the workers eyes water. Your legs were delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wish that toy stuffed animals could talk and play but were never evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A sudden swoop, and your claws can nab any critter that you will peck apart and swallow pieces to partially digest before returning to your nest to regurgitate some for your baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when you return, there is no baby. You search around frantically before taking back to the sky, desperate to find your little precious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you spot it tethered to a stake with a strap round one ankle. Beside it is a human that looks familiar - too familiar. You recognize that person as having the body of your old human self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaternal instinct takes over, and you circle high before starting your dive. Reaching speeds of over two hundred miles per hour (320 km/hr), you will teach that human to take your baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaws ready, you focus on the human. He looks up; raises some sort of tube. There's a flash of fire, and something hot rips through your feathers and body immobilizing you. You can't stop and crash hard.

Yum!\" With a finger, Winnie points to a hole in the tree just out of reach. You being much taller can easily gather some and decide to look inside before sticking your hand in and grabbing something you really don't want.  After all, raccoons, spiders and snakes could be in that hole as well. Fortunately, none of those are in there.

All the generals then retire remaining optimistic because they are given government jobs so they can collect their pension (you'd be amazed at how much a general gets after 30 years along with benefits) as well as a six-figure salary paid by Uncle Sam.

I wish...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you can go a lot crazier than that! :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules;<br>\r\n1) No swearing - light swearing is okay but no f-words, b-words etc<br>\r\n2) I'll allow sexual innuendoes! :P<br>\r\n3) Keep the wishes short if you can, but I'm not too fussed about it really... the corrupts can be as long as you want!<br>\r\n4) Try to add your own title to each new entry<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's about it for now - have fun! :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS: Over 400 chapters?
