Nick's deep baritone voice whispered as he prayed, \"...and that you will please keep my Granny safe, alive, happy, and healthy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that Nick was seventeen and would turn eighteen in a few months, he still prayed every night and had never lost his faith in Christ. Nick had more or less succeed in controlling his more human impulses, and had done his best to spread the word of god but with him being an outcast at school he had not done many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nick prayed he did not hear the sound of someone climbing up the side of the house on the ivy his mother had been letting grow there for ages, the man looked in and saw Nick praying and smiled as he quietly picked the lock on the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was reaching the final part of his prayer and quietly prayed, \"Lord if to be your will, when I die I ask that you will please reincarnate me as a dragon. For you know I have always loved them almost as much as I love you and ask that before I join you in heaven that I may spend a lifetime as a dragon here on Earth, so before I say goodnight my lord I will listen for your voice. So if you have anything to say to me I ask that you say it now for I am listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick suddenly felt a knife blade pressed up against his throat and smelled a man who smelled of beer and sweat behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you have anything else to add to your prayers boy you would best say them now,\" the man said chuckling softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick remained silent, and the man sliced open Nick's throat, and as Nick died he breathed the words, \"Amen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckled and turned to look for something worth stealing in the kids room. Unfortunately, Nick had never been very tidy, and the man stepped on an old toy that rolled and and stumbled backwards. The man stepped on one of the clay models of a Dragon Nick had made in art class, this one had a long sharp spin the pierced the man's shoe and made him hop on one foot cursing. The man then stepped on Nick's old Hotwheels that he had never gotten around, but gave away and slipped completely off his feet cracking his head on the open window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow completely limp the man sagged out the window falling twenty feet and cracked his head open on the ground below. Nick's father came in to see what all the noise was and saw his son dead, and bleeding onto the bed his hands still folded in prayer. Nick's father was at a loss for words and only hoped Nick was in a better place now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know that god had granted Nick's final prayer as a reward for his lifetime of devotion, even if it were short.</span></div></div>",

Nick felt overjoyed seeing dragons, but being this close to them when they woke up might be a problem since they might not like humans to much. Nick moved as quietly towards the front of the cave to see just where he was freezing when he heard movement behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going Zash?\" a feminine voice asked behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick slowly turned his head to look behind himself and saw that a dragon that seemed to tower over him was looking down at him from behind the pile. Nick had no doubt that this dragon was the mother of the other dragons, but why had it called him Zash?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zash do not think that if you just hold still I won't see you,\" the dragon said an edge coming into its voice, \"I am your mother and I want to know where you think you're going to this hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick jumped a bit hearing the mother dragon refer to him as his mother. That is when Nick notices that he was walking on all fours, he had been so intent on moving quietly he had not noticed it before. He also noticed he had a long tail, light green scales, and wings there was no mistaking it, Nick was now a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick crowed happily and practically danced on his four tiny feet as he realized this and jumped a foot in the air when the mother dragon shouted, \"Zash, just what are you doing!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick noticed that the shout had woken up what appeared to be his new brothers and sisters. Nick thought hastily and said, \"Its a beautiful morning, and I thought I might go warm myself in the sun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, why didn't you just tell me,\" his mother said rustling her wings, \"I thought you where going to go try to see humans again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick took note that humans where still alive whenever he was and apparently close.

Nick could see that it has not changed at all since he had been reborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick spotted his house and focusing could see both of his parents' cars. As well as his own still parked out front, it had obviously been a very short time since he had died and it might even be within the same week.

Humans are not friendly creatures and are constantly attacking each other just for the hell of it.

The limos stopped, and the first carried Nick's coffin out and carried it over to the grave where it has suspended above the grave itself. The other two limos deposited Nick's large and scattered family from his half sister Jessica and her boyfriend to a dozen relatives. Nick only knew existed because he had seen them at family gatherings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's family took a seat at the numerous chairs the were place in front of the coffin and looked either at the coffin or the priest standing in front of it. Nick saw faces ranging from stony and anguished to some crying on shoulders and his brother's beaming face. Nick didn't think he has ever seen that little brat so happy in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priest opened his book and began to mutter something from his bible that Nick tried, and failed, to hear what the priest said. The priest spokes about a minute before he closed his bible, bowed, and walked away from the coffin. Several of the less affected relatives and Nick's brother walked away with the priest as Nick's coffin has slowly lowered into the grave, and the grave diggers removed the straps to begin to fill the grave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick waited in his tree as his family milled about the grave talking and weeping, telling each other moments they remembered of him, or cried at the lack of them. A few of the younger more distant relatives simply looked bored and as they wanted to leave. Nick saw his younger brother come by and all but danced as he fingered one of Nick's CDs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick quickly looked around to make sure no one was looking and propelled himself at his brother's back and drove him to the ground, snatching up his CD. Nick quickly ran back up the tree and hid high up where his green scales acted as camo. The whole thing had taken about two seconds, and Nick's brother looked around for who had knocked him down and saw no one was nearby and that the CD vanished without a trace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's brother's face contorted in horror as he looked around and ran to the brightest spot he could find. Nick chuckled softly as he watched his brother. He seemed to think that Nick had been so stubborn and possessive that he had come back as a ghost to reclaim what was his. Nick thought that if he had not been reborn he just might have forced himself to become a ghost for similar reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon everyone had left the grave sight. Nick hopped out of his tree and walked over to his grave looking at it and thinking that it was HIS grave. Nick sat there for a moment before..</span></div></div>",

As a human, I always like dragons, and always wanted to be one or at least meet one.

Nick continued to weep for a few seconds before he looked up at his mother and said, \"It would seem you haven't abandoned me at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I fully understand what you have told me,\" Nick's mother said soothingly, \"But whatever it means you are my child now and dragons do not abandon their children as humans do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had theorized as much,\" Nick said sighing, \"I have just one more thing to do before we can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine but make it quick,\" Nick's mother said looking around nervously, \"I hate to be in a place where I might be spotted by a human any second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick walk to the tombstone and above the scale he had placed there used one of his claws to carve, \"Alive and free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick walked back to his newest mother, and she asked, \"What did you carve there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something that could take some of the pain out of death for my family.\" Nick said as his mother picked him gently up with her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's mother grunted and took to the air flying back to the cave and the rest of her children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

Nick was outside staring off into the sky like he was in a deep trance that nothing could make it loosen its hold.  Nick's (should I say dragon) mother having come out of the cave to check on him. He's been staring off into space for quit some time. Mean while...<br>\r\nA strange man wearing a dark hood who's running for his life. \"Do these guys ever quit? They been chasing me for hours.\" Sounds of guns being fired. \"Shit they have guns.\" He runs out into the open onto the edge of a cliff. \"Oh no dead end.\" Sound of a gun being prepared. \"Don't even move.\" The hooded figure raises his hands and slowly turns around to see 5 men 2 having shot guns 2 with rifles 4 of them were wearing masks concealing their faces. The final man wasn't you could see a scar over his brown eye. He had a revolver. \"Where do you think your going with my necklace.\" He said in a deep raspy voice. \"Your necklace? First of all this is a pendent. Second of all you stole this from me just last week. Third of all you don't know what its truely for.\" \"All I know is that its worth something and will fetch a pretty penny at market. Give me that necklace!\" \"No!\" This hooded man takes a step back. Forgetting that he's on a cliff. Looses his balance falling off the edge into the fog below. The man with the scar looked over the edge to see nothing but fog. \"No man could survive a fall like that.\" <br>\r\nBack at the cave... Nick was still staring at the sky. Until he was pulled aside by his mother. This is where the hoodied man landed passed out.  \"Where did he come from?\" Nick was surprised to be seeing what he thought was a body of a dead man. The man soon began to stir. \"Uh how am I not dead.\" Before he quickly passed out. Nick got wide eyed he knew he has hear this voice before he just wasn't sure where. \"I swear I know this person from some where. I just can't remember where. Wait it can't be.\" The hood hiding the mans face is removed. \"I can't believe its him. I thought he was dead.\" \"And who is he then?\" \"His name is Seth. But why is he here?\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">I'm sorry for stealing their ideas. I sick of waiting for Dragonlord to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story starts as a seventeen year old boy named: Nicholas Birnchett saying his prayer and prays that when he dies, he may resurrects as a dragon. A man who decideds to rob his house hears this and does the killing part happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAftermath, Nick wakes up as a dragon, but how much time has passed and how long will it take him to grow enough to remember is unknown. Nick will have all of his memories of his human life once the story enters that part of his dragon life, he might of not be born with his memories. What happens to Nick can vary since he could be born the next day to millions of years later after man has left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you got touchy by the words God, Jehovah, Reincarnation, or death, this story is not for you so turn around and don't let the door hit you on the way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground rules are...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick may vore people, but he needs a very good reason and will not do so happily or enthusiastically, only regular vore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick does not have to be reborn as a male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick may or may not be able to speak English as a dragon but will always be able to use jesters and crude writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's dragon form may be shaped like that of a western Dragon, but he can be reborn anywhere on Earth (and only Earth).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe behavior of humans or what might have replaced them depends on the timeline. They may be curious and inquisitive or terrified to down right hostile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's attitude is that of an outcast who is willing to make friends but rather cautious, though he is more than willing to talk of his abilities and past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgot to mention this earlier but the second chapter should be about how old Nick now is and possibly his gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy writing!</td>",
