He seems to be perfectly fine, no flaws in the DNA  structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary went to pull off the helmet. \"We're all good Jo- mmph!\" Her eyes widened as Susan quickly covered her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can take this off now?\" Johnny couldn't see from behind the helmet and cared much more about getting his body back than his sister's strange interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet Johnny. Just a second.\" Susan quickly pulled Mary aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is our chance to teach Johnny a lesson for all his pranks. We could keep him like this for a while!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary couldn't believe her sister. \"Are you nuts? He'll rat us out to mom and dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogical deduction proved this to be true and Susan reconsidered. \"...He's still attached to the scanner. We could download some new memory files right into his brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temptation of more science and no consequences easily pushed aside Mary's moral complaints. \"We do have those prototype files too. We could just make him into...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sister!\" The idea was beyond tempting. No more annoying Johnny, hello helpful sister Jenny. Someone savvy and smart, who could help them seduce their amazing neighbor Gil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins grinned at each other. \"Give us a second Johnny, just one last test for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Johnny groaned in exasperation, his sister quickly inserted a card into the machine. Within seconds, a stream of data would enter Johnny mind and mold him into someone different. The question was how drastic the change would be.</span></div></div>",

She dragged a hand through her hair, straightening any mess caused by the helmet. \"And that'll help with your experiment thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary and Susan glanced at each other. Had it worked? \"Yeah, it'll really help us out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny turned back to her sisters with a warm smile. The sisters were taken aback. Johnny was a boy for mischievous grins, manipulative smirks, and dumb laughter. The look Jenny was giving them was far different from that. It was something caring and encouraging. Like she was <i>proud</i> of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear.\" She strolled over to their desk to pick up her things. \"You guys work really hard at this stuff. I don't really get it, but you're doing great work here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary's mouth open and shut repeatedly, failing to find any appropriate response. Susan recovered quicker. \"It's, uh, nothing that amazing. Just doing what we know. You're the one who volunteered for the experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's grin somehow turned brighter and her hand naturally moved to ruffle each of their heads. \"Nonsense, squirt. I'm  always happy to help my genius sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she strolled toward the door, briefly rubbing Dukey's head on her way out, leaving behind two oddly comforted sisters.</span></div></div>",

Did she just not care about her promise?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven that felt exciting. No one ever \"forgot\" about Trixie. They used her for popularity and wealth, but they never forgot about her. Despite a sense of betrayal and sadness, being abandoned was almost exciting too. Timantha was full of surprises, from bonding over comics, to pedicures, video games and soaps... she was different from anyone Trixie had ever known. And that drive for attention and companionship, which consumed Trixie on a day-to-day business, was almost mitigated just thinking about how open and honest she had been with Timantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie sighed as she went through her more unusual gifts. A Rubix Cube with alligator designs. A rocket-powered Chihuahua. An honest to goodness Monkey's paw. Even if it worked, what could she possibly wish for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time with Timantha, of course. If she and Timantha were the last people on Earth, Trixie wagered they would get along great. Anyone else, and she'd probably start getting needy and possessive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, putting down the paw. \"I wish I could meet that girly yet boyish Timantha again.

By now, Clark Kent had almost completely vanished from the world and Claire Kent had taken his place. By the time she graduated from high school, she made her decision. With a future ahead of her, Claire embraced the rest of her role as Claire and left Clark behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe liked to think she had adapted pretty well to womanhood. She learned the little fashion choices women were supposed to know, she picked up the warning signs that a man wasn't exactly looking at her innocently, and she developed into a cute woman. Forging the documents was easier than she expected and a life skill she didn't expect her parents to have. But a lot of things were unexpected for a child of Krypton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Claire Kent completed journalism school. As the strange threats to Smallville faded away and Superwoman moved to Metropolis, Claire Kent was hired on as a reporter to the Daily Planet. A job she quickly learned to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Claire Kent has put on a blue skirt, with a professional, matching jacket over her blouse. She'd styled her hair into curls and made herself look as small and mousy as possible. That was the important difference between \"Claire\" and \"Superwoman\". Superwoman was strong and beautiful, people wanted her or they wanted to be her. Claire was a nervous but sweet farm girl who somehow made her way to the big city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes Claire wasn't sure which persona was the \"real\" one. Maybe it was both. Fighting criminals made her feel strong and her troubles melted away. In public, talking to people, making sure no one caught on to her double identity, all while trying to form some kind of social life... Well, it made things difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was another problem. Today, Claire had to finish her article on Metropolis regents meeting, start preparing for her next article, and then make her usual Superwoman patrol. It was a lot for one woman, but she could handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached her desk, she saw a familiar face...</span></div></div>",

But with this, you can write down how you think there much longer experience will go for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course I'm going to limit to only transformations that happen, none that happened in Fanart, Fanfiction or anything like that. If you want that kind of story, then make your own. There might be a chance I could do it myself someday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that have fun with this and please other Transformation that have happened that I don't know about (I recommend you tell at least a brief story leading to the transformation).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpdate 5/17/15: I decide to get rid of the limit of transformations based on actually official stories. You can now do transformations based on various Fanfictions, Fanart, Fan made comics, etc. I suggest having a link leading to the original work.</td>",
