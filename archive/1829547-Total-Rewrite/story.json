Pikachu gave her a consoling pat on the shoulder. \"Pika...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright guys, if we stay out in the woods, there's less of a chANCE that something bad will happen.\" Brock suggested. \"We should set up camp nearby, so we're close at hand when Lily finishes her potion.\" The others nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverhead, unnoticed by the group of young trainers, a cat-shaped balloon floated lazily on the breeze. \"Oh, what's this? James exclaimed, looking down through a pair of binoculars. His partners in crime rushed to his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it James?\" Jessie asked excitedly. \"James giggled with glee. \"It is! A rare mint bottlecap! I must add it to my collection!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeowth swatted him over the head, taking the binoculars from his hand. \"Now's not da time for dat, moron! We're hot on da trail of da twerps!\" He zoomed in on the road, quickly spotting their prey. \"Huh, dat's odd. Dey's gots two Pikachus, and the one kid's missin'!\" He leered at his companions. \"You know what dat means, right?\" The group burst into evil cackles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Ash and co had reached the shore of a large lake and were busy setting up their equipment. Brock was currently working on cooking up some lunch, while Misty helped get the tents ready. Ash, due to her small frame and lack of thumbs, couldn't do much to help, so she just chucked pebbles into the water. \"Stupid potion, stupid Lily, stupid me...\" She muttered with every stone she threw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was getting ready to throw another one, she heard a commotion from the campsite. She turned to see...</span></div></div>",

She decided to head over and see what was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello!\" Brock greeted the officials. The first one, a woman with long red hair, leaned down towards him. \"What are you doing here? Don't you know that this area is a Pokemon reserve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock blinked, or would have if his eyes ever opened. \"Huh?' Misty tilted her head in confusion. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second member of the group, a tall man with purple hair, made a 'tsk tsk tsk' sound. \"Kids these days...\" He pulled out a shiny, official looking badge. \"This area is off-limits due to poaching. Tell me, do you have permission from Park HQ to be here?\" Both trainers shook their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short one pulled out a clipboard. \"Lemme see, hm... Names?\" The two young trainers gave him their names. He pulled on his moustache before looking at the two approaching Pikachu. \"Are dese two your Pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh wanted to speak up, but decided that a talking Pokemon might freak out the rangers. Brock responded for her. \"They... Belong to a friend. We're just... Holding on to them for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty quickly nodded. \"Yeah, that's right! His name is Ash.\" The tall man gave them a look of disbelief. \"Oh really? Would you mind telling us where this 'Ash' is?\" When neither responded, he pulled out something resembling a price tag scanner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! What are you going to do with that?!\" The redheaded woman frowned. \"Relax, girlie. That device scans for ownership info. If these two belong to your friend, they'll be registered to his Trainer Card. If you two are his friends, it will like list you as traveling companions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall man knelt in front of Pikachu and held the trigger. A red beam flashed in the little rodent's eyes, blinding him momentarily. The device gave a beep, and the man inspected it. \"Hm, Ash Ketchum of Pallet Town, age ten, seven Johto badges and eight Kanto badges. Starter Pokemon, Pikachu.\" He looked up to his partners. \"This one checks out.\" He moved towards Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all of her willpower not to run away as he scanned her. The man frowned as he looked at his device. \"This one is wild. It's not registered to a Pokeball.\" Brock quickly tried to explain, but was silenced by the short man with a moustache. \"Dirty thieves, eh? I'm not surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, that's not it!\" Misty cried, trying to come up with an explanation. \"It's just- she wanted to join Ash, but he was out of Pokeballs!\" Brock quickly caught on. \"Yeah, that's why he's not here right now. You've got to believe us, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman shook her head. \"I'm afraid not. We'll be taking these two so we can get them back to where they came from, and we'll be taking you to jail.\" She sighed. Though I suppose if your 'friend' vouches for you when he shows up, we'll let you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall man picked up the two Pikachu as the woman handcuffed Brock.

The shiny new machine gave a ding noise as it extended a silver vacuum chute to accept any medium sized pokemon, or at least 12 pokeballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jessie,\" James said, \"I can't wait to use it on a Pokemon!\" Meowth looked aghast and ran a few metres away from the machine as it beeped once or twice behind the bushes. Meanwhile, a certain Pikachu was exploring the area of Saffron City with Ash as it scampered behind the Silph corporation building, where the machine was located. The leafy green bushes hid the location of the morphing machine well from the prying eyes of passerbys and Pikachu was sniffing around, curious as to what it had found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is!\" exclaimed Jessie, \"We have to catch it for the Boss!\" Pikachu accidentally gave a shock as it accidentally activated the morphing machine. The machine shook and gave a loud beep as the evolution music started and Pikachu suddenly flashed white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few seconds, the white glow subsided as Pikachu's form became more humanoid by the second. Yellow hair sprouted from its rodentine form, human skin soon replaced its fur, and it grew taller by the minute. Soon, a teenage girl would be seen in the bushes as its blond hair would be seen easily. Brown eyes would blink as she spoke<br>\r\n\"Pika?\" the teenage girl said, as Jessie was astounded by the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James! What have you done?!

In the few hours since she had woken up and found out about her new body, Lillie had refused to leave her alone as if she could not take care of herself. Not even Wicke is willing to take her seriously and is more than happy to treat her like she really is a little girl, though at least for now she is still the Aether President by proxy. Being only half of the other girl's size, she can only complain as Lillie dresses her with her frilly hand-me-downs. \"Don't you have anything that looks less childish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, sorry,\" Lillie continues dressing her. \"These were the only type of clothes you ever let me wear at that age. Don't worry, though. You look very cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be cute!\" Lusamine stomps at the ground in frustration. \"I'm your mother and I demand respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, now you want to be my mom? For a while now, I just saw a little girl throwing a tantrum who needs to treat her elders with respect. It's only now that your body matches your mind.\" Lillie states bluntly as she quickly brushes the smaller girl's hair. Lusamine, shocked and even hurt that Lillie would say that, is stunned into silence. Ever since Lillie has found her backbone and has become twice her size, she has become rather nervous towards her. Not to mention, considering her past mistakes, she can't exactly say that Lillie is wrong to be upset at her either. After all her former daughter had been through, she was not going to be able to get Lillie to forgive her that easily and being regressed cements the idea that she may never have a second chance to be a good mother for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm sorry.\" Lusamine looks down at the ground timidly trying to hold back her tears. Lillie, having finished braiding her hair, kneels down and gives her a hug, something she cannot help but admit she finds comforting despite the circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, sweetie. Your big sister loves you very much.\" Lillie picks her up and carries her like a cherished stuffed animal. Lusamine just pouts, figuring she will just have to accept it, though she is not sure how much further patronizing she can take. At that moment, Wicke storms into the room and informs her that ___.</span></div></div>",

Long story short, a mishap forced the good guys to escape the virtual world and the fortress before a satellite crash lands on the fortress, destroying everything within, including Gozaburo.

' This female earthling does not look so bad. ' , He said sliding his feminine right hand through his blue hair. He then felt a strange weight on his chest. He then placed both his hands on his new breasts. He felt two soft orbs through the yellow fabric of his sleeveless tunic. ' That felt so good! ' , he said as he began to open his tunic in front. He opened the tunic infront revealing firm large breasts that was covered by a skin tight black jumpsuit. He then took his tunic off and tossed it on the floor. He groped his boobs some more and more pleasure shot through his body. He couldn't help but moan. He had to get his jumpsuit off, he really wanted to see how these strange orbs looked. He figured out that there was a zipper on the back of his jumpsuit. He pulled the zipper down and then took the jumpsuit off until his waist revealing his red bra and flat stomach. He then struggled to get his bra off. ' He began to play with his breasts and twisted his erect nipples. He moaned even more with all the pleasure. He felt a moist sensation build up between his legs . He then slipped his right hand down to his crotch and was surprised to feel a wet slit between his legs. ' I guess earthlings don't have a penis , it actually feel more comfortable not having one . ' , he thought to himself. ' I never felt anything this amazing ! ' , he shouted as he began to play with his pussy. He had multiple orgasms before he stopped masturbating when the planet vibrated. He could now sense the battle between Goku and Frieza. He knew he had to get getting going so he got dressed again. He just finished dressing when he heard a voice behind him, ' What have you done to my body! ' , shouted Bulma. Ginyu then walked to the frog and lifted his foot above the frog and then said ' You don't need to worry about your body anymore, I will take good care of it. ' . Ginyu laughed as he squashed Bulma under his red boot staining it with frog blood. He then washed the blood of in the lake and saw Bulma's hoover bike. He did a backflip and  landed on the bike. ' Her reflexes isn't so bad. ' , he thought to himself as he started the bike. </span></div></div>",

She looks at her slimy little body in fear, sadness and disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since she arrived on Namek with the boys, her time on the planet have been absolutely terrible so far. From meeting an alien foot soldier who she find charming at first, whose true form was...something she rather not talk about again, to getting left behind in the cave, to that incident with the crab and one of the Dragon Balls, and just getting chased off by dinosaurs to add to the fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if she can't ask for anything worse then that, come an alien frog, who somehow have body snatching power, and took off with her own body and ran!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Bulma just have enough of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does it!\" croaked Bulma as she swore. \"I have had it with this planet! I'm going to find that crook, find my body and get me off of this planet! I don't want to be a little frog for the rest of my life!\" She sighed. \"Well, at least he was kind to...huh?! The translator! It's gone!\" Bulma said, as she looked all over her to see if it still on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her shock, it's not. The translator must of had slipped off of her body when she lands hard to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, that must means...he had it with him!\" cried out Bulma. \"I have to catch up with that fiend if I ever want to get back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ginyu, in Bulma's body, is en route to the battlefield on Bulma's old air-ski, where Lord Frieza awaits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah hah hah! What a woman! To think that I really gave her a second chance like that! Hah! The look on her face was priceless!\" Ginyu gloats as he drived and steered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, I even managed to snatch that device when I trashed the little slimeball to the ground, like a worm! Still though, I could sure use a better body myself, these lumps here ain't gonna do me no good.\" He said, just before a frog jumps on the front of the air-ski. \"What the?! It's you!\" yelled out Ginyu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you damn pervert, your going to give me back my body and that translator right this instant!\" Bulma-Frog croaked. \"How about a little of this instead?!\" Ginyu said, as he rams the air-ski to a nearly wall of a mountain in hoping that Bulma-Frog will get splattered by it. But luckily, Bulma-Frog is still hanging on the air-ski.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrrgh! Hold still, you little---\" said Ginyu, before he get cut short by Bulma sticking his tongue at Ginyu's eye. \"---AAAAAUUUUGGHH! MY EEEYYYEEE!\"Ginyu screamed, as he loose control of his steering, and crashed on the ground, right at the heart of the battlefield, where Son Goku's epic battle with Frieza is taking place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku's son, Gohan, one of his best friends, Krillin, and his once-rival Piccolo are watching on from the sidelines as speculators, but not before Ginyu and Bulma crashed on the ground, leading the trio to come to \"Bulma's\" aid. Son Goku and Frieza overheard the crash, as their battle comes to a halt. \"What the devils is going on down there now?\" thought Frieza, having recently been powered up to his final form, and is using 30% of his power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that Frieza has stopped the fighting, so does Son Goku, as they both looks down to see the commotion from the sidelines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! I had it with this slimy bastard! I'm going to stomp you out into toad...\" Ginyu stopped midway before turning over to a confused Gohan and Krillin, and a highly suspicious Piccolo. \"...uh, hey guys! It's me, uh, Bulma!\" He said in a higher pitch, trying his best to impersonate Bulma, albeit, pathetically poorly at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Bulma, are you okay? That must of been a rough landing you got there.\" asked Krillin. \"Also, what's up with your voice there? And that frog you got on your hands?\" \"Oh, erm, I-\" said Ginyu before Bulma croaks. \"No! Don't listen to him! I'm the real Bulma! You guys have to believe me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on here, Krillin. Something doesn't seems right with Bulma.\" said Piccolo as he gives a suspicious grin. \"Especially the way her voice is now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what the hell is the meaning of all this?\" asked Frieza as he lowers himself into the sidelines. \"We were just in the middle of our battle before that blue-haired monkey and her miserable toad interrupted all of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what is goin' on, you guys?\" added Son Goku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinyu tossed the frog aside as he approaches Frieza. Gohan would see the poor frog being flung before he flies up and caught it. \"Lord Frieza, it is but I, Captain Ginyu! I have returned to you to follow all orders as you commanded!\" said Ginyu in his real voice, leaving the group, excluding Bulma and Frieza, who is merely surprised, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-G-Ginyu?! Didn't Goku took care of this guy and the Ginyu Force already?!\" yelled out a nerving Krillin, as he steps back a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinyu nods, before he glanced at Goku from up above. \"Indeed, your friend Goku may of had killed off all four of my men, however, I was far ahead of my death. For you see, I was just about close to switch bodies with Vegeta, before that Goku threw a frog and made me what I made your friend now!\" He glanced at Bulma-Frog, giving a devious smirk, nerving Bulma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on! If you are just so happen to be in Bulma's body, wouldn't that make Bulma---\" Piccolo added, before being rudely interrupted by Ginyu. \"---the frog the little brat is holding? Like you would of all knew by now. It's just that obvious!\" Ginyu said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, poor Bulma...\" Gohan said, having just caught on, holding Bulma-Frog gently in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as much of a tale this has all been, I hate to break it up that you have finally outlived your usefulness, Captain Ginyu.\" Frieza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?!? But Lord Frieza, you just can't do this to me!\" said Ginyu. \"Well, ain't that too bad for you. In that case, you'll gladly be the first victim to die before me! If you can't just accept your uselessness to me, we'll might as well make this dying planet your rotting grave!\" said Frieza as he readies a Death Beam at Ginyu's possessed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Frieza! Don't do it! If you do it now, then there is no reason left to get Bulma back in her body! So please, in the name of all the good people you have killed on Namek, don't!\" protested Goku. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he knows that Captain Ginyu was far from being a good guy, taking his body as possession earlier and almost taking Vegeta's body for himself, who the latter have just died in front of Goku recently, and that he serves under Frieza's own rules, Ginyu was far from being as half the menace then Frieza is, given that he has a life with the Ginyu Force underneath his cold heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what's more important is that he is in the possession of Bulma's body. The very first friend that Goku have ever met in his journey, long before Piccolo, Gohan, and even Krillin, back when he was a little boy. To see Bulma, nor anyone else getting hurt in any size or form would take someone this ruthless and heartless to go through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to Frieza, this was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, I think I let this one slipped.\" said Frieza sarcastically, as despite Goku's warnings, he fires it anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>FRIEZA, NOOOOOO!!!</b>\" screamed Goku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-What happens next?-</span></div></div>",

He looked around for a few seconds before finding a big enough stick to use as the torch. He blew out fire from out of his nose and onto the torch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done!\" Spike proudly exclaimed to himself. He and Scootaloo were now walking away from the area they were once in and into a narrow passage with the torch clutched in Spike's hand. It was a long trip and nothing interesting happened along the way except for a weird looking treasure chest that was leaning on one side which Scootaloo picked up. When they reached the entrance of the cave, Spike noticed that Scootaloo was carrying a chest of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Scootaloo,\" Said Spike, \"Where did you get that? I've got a key that Twilight gave me earlier but it didn't unlock anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found it in the cave,\" replied Scootaloo before she turned enthusiastic, \"Let's try the key on the chest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they did. The chest unlocked itself and opened to reveal five golden necklaces and one golden tiara that represented the Elements of Harmony. The chest also contained a strange bottle with a green liquid inside of it. On the bottle, was the words 'Cure' on it. They couldn't believe their eyes. They knew that justice was going to come back.

From one bite out of the biscuit, Clover was swept in by incredible taste and gobbled it instantly. \"<b>Mmmm... </b>Wow, they're not kidding when they were calling them a miracle in your mouth\" she moaned. \"So minty... So chocolatey...\" There she stuffed another cookie into her mouth, already hooked on the cookie's addict taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Sam looked at Clover and figured the cookies can't be that good, right? Opening the box that Sam was holding, she gave one to Alex and ate one as well. Soon the two were also hooked on the cookie's explosive flavour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... These are amazing,\" Sam said, already shoving another three down her throat, with Alex following suit. The girls continued to wolf some more cookies down into their bellies; as they continued their way to Shirley Roger's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were there, half of the boxes are already gone as the spies were licking their fingers and hands from the chocolaty goodness, ignoring the stains they have left on their clothes and pudginess on their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam rang the doorbell and\u2026</div></span></div></div>",

The photo showed a woman with huge tits but a rail thin body who looked just like the cookie eating ssbbw standing in front of them. However the Shirley that stood before them was massively fatter with colossal knockers, a massive belly which hung over her crotch, legs and arms smothered in jiggly flab, two large butt cheeks each globe saturated with soft fat. Shirley wore nothing but a strained apron which barely held her overspilling boobs and her belly which hung under the garment. \"Nom dang Shirley you put on some serious weight nom.\" said Clover shoving a cookie in her mouth. \"Yeah I put on a few but who cares the cookies are sooooo good nom plus I can always find a chubby chaser.\" Shirley said as she feasted upon a box of patties. The spies stood at the doorway eating cookies along side the ssbbw Shirley as they interegated her. However they didn't get too far before a mob of fat women rushed at the girls for the desired cookies. \"EEEE! run girls!\" said Sam. The girls sluggishly ran noticably fatter then they were before tasting the patties with thighs wobbling as they ran, heavier boobs bounced more, and a formidable amount of pudge lingered on their bellies. Huff Pant the girls were quickly running out of breath. Suddenly Jerry called \"Spies I need you to take a tour of the Passion Patty factory I'll send a... did you gain weight?\" Jerry said \"Uh maybe\" Sam replied. \"Anyway I'll have you get picked up and send you on a plane to the factory.\" Jerry said.   </span></div></div>",

She worked at a small, private college in Nebraska until a revolutionary breakthrough landed her a job at Caltech. While her social skills are a bit lacking and often gets frustrated with others who do not have as high an IQ, her heart is usually in the right place. While her apartment was meant to be a temporary home until she got situated in Pasadena she has lived there for almost five years, despite her common complaints if being surrounded by idiots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard: An all star athlete, and team captain and quarterback of the football team throughout high school and college, Leonard narrowly missed making it into the NFL something he has still not managed to quite get over. He ended up becoming high school Social Studies teacher so that he is able to coach the football team. At five foot ten inches he is slightly taller than normal, and is quite the looker. He shares an apartment with Sheldon, and often has to look out for his roommate and bail him out of trouble.  He and Penny have started to develop feelings for each other, though neither will admit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheldon: An amateur bodybuilder, Sheldon is dumb muscle of the group. His strength is only matched by the size of his ego, something that consistently gets him in to trouble and one of the reasons he has as of yet been unable to keep a steady job. He dropped out of school as soon as he could, much to the dismay of his devout Catholic mother who had hoped he would join the priesthood, and is currently making ends meet by working as a bouncer at a local nightclub and sharing an apartment with Leonard.  He is also a bit of a womanizer, though this has tones down some since he started dating Amy. People often wonder why his friends put up with him,  something they themselves still wonder as well. The Lazy boy in front of the TV in his and Leonard's apartment is his lucky chair, which he won't let anyone else sit in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoward: At over six feet tall most people are surprised to find that Howard doesn't play professional basket ball, and even more surprised to find out he is Jewish. Howard have up the chance to play in college in order to stay home and help his mother care for his aging father.  His insistence on keeping Jewish law often annoys his friends - especially Sheldon - but he is a vial part of the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRajesh: Raj's family immigrated when he was a young child to escape severe poverty in India. He spent most of school coasting on his popularity as a cool foreign kid and fully expected to make it to college on a soccer scholarship, so that his fairer to do so came as shock. He's a major womanizer, and spends most of his time around time picking up girls. </span></div></div>",

And had just completed her 'education' just before receiving the family wand....which she still used the set the kingdom on fire. Just because she's a 'proper lady' now doesn't mean shes any better with magic. She is still sent to Earth and still sent to live with Marco. However this is a version of Star Butterfly thats the very textbook definition of a 'proper princess'. A lady among ladies if you will. A delicate flower of ladylike virtues whose all a fluster about having to share the same home as a boy.....and whose real feelings are packed so tightly down inside herself that when they come out they'll erupt with the force of a volcano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2- When Mewburty started to happen. Marco had done what he'd thought was the smart thing and gotten a permission slip to take Star home until whatever was happening to her wore off. Unfortunately, this required her to be in close proximity to him for quite a bit of time. By the time he got her home and got her to lay down, Marco didn't even have time to reach her mirror and call her home before Star went full Mewburty and gunked up the house, along with any chance for escape or calling for help as she immediately turned her attention on the only boy she could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3- The wand and the spellbook had been lost shortly before Star had been meant to inherit them. Being cast across reality where conveniently enough they ended up landing on Earth in a little town called Echo Creek. Not together of course, that would be 'too' convenient. Items such as a massive ancient book and a crystal scepter are not things that go unnoticed for very long, and before the day was out both items were found by two ordinary girls. Girls that would not stay ordinary for very long.</span></div></div>",

Sora had already been there befire and somehow he came back again, \"What happened this time?\" He askes to himself. After walking through some platform, he finally reached a door. His right hand summoned his keyblade and opened the door. As he went throught, Sora met Kairi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...\" Kairi looks a bit depressed, \"Hey, what's wrong?\" Sora asked her, \"Well... You know... After you and Riku had gone, things were changing.\" Kairi replied, \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The heartless went crazy and The Darkside also appeared. I was trying to escaped from him, but I know it's too late. In the end, here I am inside your memories.\" She explained, Sora couldn't believe it that Kairi now, in fact, dead without anybody knows. \"I.... I'm sorry...\" He aplogized, but Kairi laughed, \"Why should you?\" She asked, \"Eh? What do you mean?\" Sora confused.<br>\r\n\"I'm not actually dead, I just lost my body and right now I'm wandering as a soul.\" \"So, you mean that...\" \"That's right! I actually wanted to ask if you let me go inside your heart, may I?\" Kairi asked with smiles, \"You know, to be always together, even if you meet Riku, we'll be together.\" \"Hmm... You're right.\" Sora claimed, \"I don't mind.\" \"Okay!\" Kairi quickly went inside Sora body. Soon, the dream stops and light poured its light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes opened slowly and nothing happened then. \"It was a dream afterall...\" A soft girl voice heard like she's whispering. But something is fishy, that's the same word that he wanted to talk. He? He confused, as he went up and somehow lighter than his usual weight. \"Okay... What just....\" The voices stopped a bit, he realized, his voice became girly, \"What?!\" By shocked, he looked at the mirror and saw a girl which is mean that's himself. The girl have a longer hair than Kairi, but the colour shares the same. The eyes became pretty as it sparkles the blue sea. The skin is so soft and the body looks older. Here stands almost all Kairi's yet is Sora. The names were recalled, Tenshi which means Heaven*. \"Uh... This is weird.\" Said Tenshi. She currently on her pink lingerine, then she took her clothes on. She walked out and looked around and knew that she's in Twilight town. \"One thing for sure!\" Tenshi raised both hamds and two keyblades were summoned, Kingdom Key and Destiny's Embraces. \"Okay... That explained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenshi began start her journey, but sadly she didn't know that she lost Sora's main purpose to defeat Ansem the Wise. Tenshi journal is written to find Riku, where at her journal too is her crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I searched a while about Kingdom Hearts main character name translated. I know the fact that Sora means sky, Kairi means ocean/sea/water, and Riku means land. I firstly thought that the name should be mixed between sky and ocean, which is land that Riku already had. With that, I changed into heaven<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenshi appearances:<br>\r\nA seventeen teenage girl, with red hair and blue eyes like Kairi. Instead of short, she had a long hair to the waist. Talking about height, she's actually pretty high at 5'5\" with normal breasts at C cups, slim waist, and nice butts, making it reasonable to be say that she's a bit ideal. She share Sora's personality and share both Sora and Kairi abilities. However, for something were made, there's other thing to be sacrificed, yet it's her memory, anything about Sora and Kairi long before the dream. Her memory were altered to know Riku and fall in love with him.</span></div></div>",

What are you doing over there with... myself?!\" That's when he realized the source of his dizziness.<br>\r\n<i>I-I am Kairi?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, the trio turned around to see their friend in a new way. It also finally dawned on Kairi but she kept her confusion to herself, rushing over to \"herself\" as Donald and Goofy did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's really you Sora, summon the Keyblade!\" Donald wisely suggested.<br>\r\n\"Uhm, okay...\" Sora did as instructed. He stretched out his arm, concentrating on the Keyblade. To everyone's surprise he successfully summoned it.<br>\r\n\"Woah, it still works!\"<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Kairi asks, never having seen a Keyblade.<br>\r\n\"That's the Keyblade, So-, oh, right.\" Donald caught himself, not used to this bizarre situation. <br>\r\n\"Gawrsh, that's just too much for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora, can you explain this? Why have we switched bodies?\" Kairi spoke up, demanding answers.<br>\r\n\"It's kind of a long story but when our home got destroyed your heart entered my body I think. I used Riku's Keyblade to remove your heart from my body but only mine got removed and I guess it moved into your body... I am so sorry Kairi.\"<br>\r\n\"It's alright. You did what you thought was right. What happened to Riku?<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. The Keyblade I used for this dissolved and I can't do it with my own... I guess we're stuck like this. Wait, the Keyhole is open now! I have to close it now! I'll tell you about Riku later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Sora rushed to do what he does best, trying to ignore the awkward situation he is in.</span></div></div>",

It was true, it's not like there were any fancy parties in District 12, and the richer people in the district probably wouldn't want something so small and simple. \"Why don't you give it to Prim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jewelry isn't really our thing.\", Katniss said. As they walked towards the Hob to trade with Greasy Sae, they passed by a group of young innocent children who were playing, making Katniss remember her own childhood, a childhood that was cut short, when her father had died in a mining accident. It also made her think of Gale's baby sister, Posy, who had never known her father, and had become like a second sister to her. \"What about Posy? Do you think she would like the necklace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she might.\", Gale responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll then here, you should give it to her.\", Katniss said offering the necklace to Gale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, you found it, you should give it to her.\", Gale said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\", Katniss asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she loves it when you come over.\", Gale said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\", Katniss said, looking forward to seeing Posy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter trading with Greasy Sae, the two headed towards the Hawthorne house, so Katniss could give Posy the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Katniss and I are back.\", Gale called out as the two entered the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Posy ran into the room, and jumped into Katniss's  arms. \"CATNIP\", Posy exclaimed, calling Katniss by the nickname only she and her oldest brother used for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Posy.\", Katniss said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to spend the day with us.\", Posy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I have to go home soon, but here I have something for you.\", Katniss said then set her down, before pulling out the necklace then kneeled down to show it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty.\", Posy said amazed, with all the innocence possible for someone in a world like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you might like it, turn around, so I can put it on you.\", Katniss said, and when she did, she felt a small shock, but passed it off as nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosy then turned around and wrapped her small arms around Katniss's neck, giving her as tight of a hug as she could manage. \"Thank you Catnip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\", Katniss said hugging her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ///////////////////////////////////////////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter returning home, doing her chores and spending time with Prim, by the end of the day Katniss was exhausted was happy to get some sleep.

Barely opening her eyes, Katniss untangled herself from the nearby body, and stretched her arms out, before letting out a small yawn. Still sleepy, she didn't even notice the fact that her legs no longer reached the floor, while she sat at the edge of the bed. After getting down, she walked towards the toilet, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes as she did so. Once she was there, and closed the door, she finally saw her reflection in the mirror and let out a small yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReflection: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://photo.ma-bimbo.com/fr/56/27929/avatars/22343173.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://photo.ma-bimbo.com/fr/56/27929/av...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a little kid, she looked no older than Posy, she wasn't even wearing the clothes she had worn to bed the previous night, she was instead wearing a large T shirt, probably one of Prim's. Touching her face, she couldn't believe it, she looked just like she had when Prim was born. Before she could do anything, there was  a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catnip, are you ok?\", she heard Prim ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised to hear Prim use that nickname, and by her current situation. Not sure how Prim would react, Katniss remained quiet, and after a few seconds the door opened. There stood Prim, her normal 12 year old self, she then knelt down to your level, acting like nothings wrong. \"What are you doing up so early, you should still be in bed.\", Prim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure what to say, Katniss looked around the room, outside the window, she could see that it was early, but it appeared to be the normal time that she woke up for a hunt. Before she could say anything Prim lifted Katniss into her arms and carried her back down the hall. \"Come on back to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prim someth-\", Katniss stopped when she heard her squeaky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk later, I can already tell, your still sleepy\", Prim said. It was true, while usually, Katniss would usually be able to get up at this time easily, her now smaller body seemed to lack the strength to stay awake and her eyes began close, while she unconsciously rested her head on Prim's shoulder. Prim then laid Katniss back in bed, before getting in herself, and held Katniss close, just as Katniss had done only the night before, and after a minute Katniss was once again asleep, hoping that this would turn out to be nothing but a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// /////////////////////////////////////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Katniss woke up again, she noticed the sheets that she laid in seemed wet. As Katniss sat up, she noticed that Prim was no longer in bed with her, and that it was bright outside. Confused, she looked around the room and spotted her reflection in the mirror, and saw that she had the necklace that she had given to Posy, was now around her neck. Realizing that it was no dream, and that the wetness of blanket was probably from her after Prim had returned her to bed, without using the toilet, Katniss screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moment her mother rushed into the room and knelt down in front of her. \"Sweetie what's wrong, did something happe-\", her mother stopped when she felt the sheets \"Oh, it's ok sweetie, it's just an accident.\", she said in a calming voice, before lifting Katniss off the bed, and onto the floor, then gathered the soiled sheets. \"Now come on, let's clean you up\", she then offered Katniss her hand. Not sure what else she could do Katniss took it, and followed her mother to the kitchen, where she began to heat up water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's get you out of those clothes\", she said, then began to pull the shirt over her daughter's head, while Katniss resisted, not wanting to be naked in the middle of the kitchen, where anyone could walk in. \"Now come on sweetie, I know it's cold, but I need to clean you.\", her mother said, and after a moment managed to get the shirt off, then her underwear. She then wrapped Katniss in a clean blanket, while they waited for the water to finish heating up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting, Katniss noticed that Prim wasn't around. \"Where's Prim?\", she asked, in her now squeaky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's with the Hawthorne's like she always is honey.\", her mother said. Figuring that she was with Rory and Vick, she didn't ask anymore questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the water was heated, her mother dropped her into the small tub and began to scrub her skin. While embarrassing, the water did seem nice. Being the older child, she usually went after Prim, when the water had already cooled down, it had been years since she had a warm bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the door opened, Katniss covered herself as best she could, and looked to see who it was. It was Prim, and to her surprise was wearing their father's old hunting jacket, it hung loosely over her thin frame.Spotting you in the tub, she seemed surprised, then walked over, placing a bag on the counter. \"Hey Catnip, I brought something for you.\", Prim said, using that nickname again, then turned to their mother. \"Why is Catnip taking a bath so early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it was nothing. your sister just had a little accident?\", Their mother whispered, but loud enough for Katniss to hear, causing her more embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrim nodded, then knelt down to place a kiss on Katniss's head \"I'll give you, your treat when your done.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Katniss was done, her mother dried her off, and put her in a dress, something she rarely wore, then placed her on a stool near the table, while she prepared breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrim going through her bag, and brought out a much smaller bag, and handed it to Katniss \"Here Catnip, just for you.\", Prim said. When Katniss looked inside, she saw blueberries , as she pulled one out Prim stopped her. \"Remember, those are for later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, their mother had work to do, and asked Prim to take Katniss outside for a while, then Prim</span></div></div>",

Hoping that she would be taken to the Hawthorne's home, Katniss did not resist and followed, but before they could head there, a group of young children ran past them, playing a game of tag. \"Hey Catnip\", one of them said as they ran off. Katniss couldn't believe it, her mother and sister acted like nothing was wrong, as if she had always been a 4 year old little girl, and now little kids were treating her as if they knew each other, and everyone was calling her by that childish nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wan't to go play with your friends Catnip?\", Prim asked, as she ran her hand through Katniss's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about Po-\", Katniss said, but was cut off when a young girl ran up to her, and tapped her on the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tag your it.\", the little girl said. It was one of Posy's friends, Lily, who was now the same age as Katniss, but slightly taller. \"Come on we have to find everyone else.\", she said taking Katniss by the hand and and began to run off. Being too weak to resist, Katniss followed, struggling to keep up with the girl, she had occasionally looked after, while spending time with Posy. When she looked back, Prim was already gone, probably inside of the Hawthorne house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of following Lily, Katniss forgot about her current situation and actually had fun, chasing after other children, tagging them, before running off to find others. In between rounds of tag, Katniss shared her blue berries with Lily, not caring about her now muddy dress, or even thinking of her current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the next round began, it was Katniss's turn to count, while the other's ran away. Not paying attention to wear she was running, Katniss ran into someone, causing her to fall to the ground,dirtying her dress even more. \"OW\", Katniss said, then looked up, it was someone she didn't recognize, she was Katniss's former age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK? You should be more careful when you are running Catnip.\", the girl asked, kneeling down and helping her up. She seemed familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i'm fine.\", Katniss said quietly, looking at the ground, remembering her situation, and embarrassed by the fact that she had just spent ,most of the day playing with a bunch of little kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good.\", the girl said as she patted Katniss down, trying to remove as much dirt as possible, \"Your wearing the necklace I gave you.\", she said holding the pendent in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"POSY!\", Katniss said in shock, realizing that the young woman in front of her was the little girl, who had run into her arms, only the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what?\" Posy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Katniss could say anything, the two heard Gale call out. \"Posy come on.\", he said. Katniss looked over to him in shock, everything seemed exactly the same as it did the day before, the only two exceptions being her and Posy, who appeared to have switched ages, and nobody except Katniss, not even Posy herself seemed to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming!\", Posy called back to him, then turned back to Katniss. \"Sorry I can't stay Catnip, Gale and me need to see Greasy Sae.\", Posy said before kissing Katniss on her head, then stood back up and began to walk towards Gale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..but\", Katniss said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we can play when I get back\", Posy said before she and Gale walked off to the Hob. Leaving Katniss  standing there stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure what to do Katniss then</span></div></div>",

Katniss then turned around, seeing Prim run up to her. Kneeling down, Prim examined Katniss, \"Look at you, you dirtied your dress, your face is covered in dirt and you have a scrape on your face.\", she said, then took Katniss by the hand, leading her back to their house. \"Come on, we need to clean you up before dinner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two had gotten home, their mother was understandably upset, but as she was busy cooking, she simply told Prim to take Katniss to their room and clean her up.

She then sat down, and began to wipe the dirt from Katniss's face. \"You should really be more careful Catnip, I don't want anything to happen to you.\", Prim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\", Katniss said, remembering how worried she would get whenever Prim got even the smallest cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrim let out a huff, \"It's ok, just be careful from now on.\", she said. After cleaning the dirt off Katniss's face, Prim applied a band aid to her cheek, where the scrape was. \"Now arms up, you cant eat it a dirty dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to be undressed by her little sister, Katniss crossed her arms, \"No.\", Katniss said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that this was nothing more than a child playing games, Prim tickled her sides, causing Katniss to uncross her arms, and giggle, giving Prim the chance to pull the dress over her head, before replacing it with another oversized shirt, similar to the one she was wearing that morning. \"Now come on, its time to eat.\", Prim said as she rolled the long sleeves up her sister's tiny arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner Katniss was feeling tired, so Prim decided to take her to their room, \"Sleep tight Catnip.\", Prim said as she tucked her sister in, then noticed Katniss still had her necklace on. \"You're lucky you didn't loose this today.\", she said then removed it from Katniss's neck, and placed it on a nearby table. \"Wouldn't want anything to happen to it, the day after Posy gave it to you.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wh...Pos...\", Katniss tried to say, as she drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthen next morning</span></div></div>",

Reaching out for warmth, Katniss discovered that Prim was no longer next to her, causing her to sit up. Katniss let out a tiny yawn, sleepily looking around the room for her big sister. When she saw her reflection in the mirror, she saw nothing wrong with it, but for reasons unknown to her, something seemed off. After climbing down the side of her bed, Katniss left the room, heading towards the kitchen, where she found her mother cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama.\", Katniss said as she rubbed the sleep from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, her mother saw her. \"What are you doing up so early sweetheart?\", she asked in a sweet tone, before picking Katniss up and placing her on a stool by the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Prim?\", Katniss asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's with Gale and Posy., but she'll be back soon.\", she said as she brought a small plate of food over to her daughter. \"For now, just eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Katniss finished eating, Prim entered the house, she quietly walked over, placing a kiss on Katniss's head. \"Hi Catnip.\", she said quietly, before sitting down. Her mother then placed a plate of food in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worried about today?\", their mother asked, now seeming a bit sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrim simply nodded, before beginning to eat her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Prim?\", Katniss innocently asked, not knowing what today was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing.\", Prim said, not really paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katniss why don't you get dressed, and go play with your friends.\", their mother said, not wanting Katniss to hear their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatniss quickly jumped off her stool and ran to her room, putting on a pink dress, shoes, and the necklace she had given posy two days ago. Looking at it, she couldn't help but feel that something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// //////////////////////////////////////////////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile playing tag with Lily and the other young children, they were interrupted by a large crowd of older children and teens walking by. Katniss noticed that Prim was among them, but was unable to get to her, so once they passed, the children returned to their game. While searching for other children, Katniss had tripped, as she sat up, her necklace slipped out from under her dress, and as she looked at the pendent again, she finally realized what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no, its reaping day and I'm a little kid.', Katniss thought, as she looked around for her sister. Realizing she must be at the Reaping already, Katniss ran towards where the event was being held. When she got there she could see Prim. While making her way through the crowd, towards her sister, Katniss heard what she feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Primrose Everdeen.\", the woman announced. as Katniss continued to make her way to her sister, the woman continued to encourage Prim to come up. When Katniss got to the front of the crowd, she saw her shocked sister standing there, and as the guards attempted to escort Prim to the stage, Katniss did the only thing she could do in her state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prim!\", Katniss called out as she ran to her sister, holding onto her leg, not wanting anything to happen to her. As the guards tried to separate the two a voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I volunteer as Tribute.\", she said.

There had even been a couple of moments, where Katniss had nearly thrown a tantrum, before she realized how she was acting and calmed down. Katniss continued to think over how she could return to her normal form and life.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Oh boy - I bet that a LOT of people have wanted something like this to happen. But this isn't going to be much of a transformation or any other stories on this website. It's not going to be a full length story - cause then it'd be a novel. This is just going to be a synopsis of how episodes 1, 2, and 3 might have been improved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo start of with - Episode 1 seemed so very distant when going to Episodes 2 and 3. The two latter movies took place only three years apart - where as episode 2 happened 10 years after episode 1. While it might seem strategic, it makes the movie out to be the Black Sheep of the Prequel Trilogy. Compare it with the Original Trilogy - all three movies, in the timeline (not when they were released) were roughly 1 year apart each. So - to make a long story short (too late) I would suggest that perhaps 10 years is a little too long to wait to start a war. So I feel that it should be a maximum of at most 5 years. You may think it might conflict with some issues, but we'll get to those. Now moving onto the movie itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLets face it - McGreggor's portrayal of Obi-Wan in the first movie, seemed a bit too...serious. In the Original Trilogy - older Kenobi did state that when he was young, he too was reckless, like Luke - and evidently, like Anakin. But in Phantom, he seemed to be the Epitome of what Yoda described a Jedi MUST be - with a Deep Commitment and a Most Serious Mind. He did crack a joke every once in a while, but he seemed a bit too stressed out.<br>\r\nI imagine Obi-wan as a Padawan, a lot younger and not as serious - so that Qui-Gon would have to be more of a Mentor to him, having to teach him to be Patient and Serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plot can go relatively the same - but when they land on Naboo - say it with me now - NO JAR-JAR BINKS!!! I'm sorry, I saw Phantom in Theaters when I was six years old, and I thought Jar Jar was hilarious. But lets be honest - Star Wars does NOT need Comic Relief! And Jar-Jar has NOT aged well. Very few of his antics are funny - and even fewer of his words are understandable. So - let's just assume that, since Naboo is part of the Galactic Republic, they would have Registered Knowledge of all species on the planet. So the Jedi land on the Planet and immediately seek out the Gungan City to request help to Warn the Naboo.<br>\r\nNow instead of the Gungan's actually speaking those ridiculous inaudible words, why not have them speak their own Language that comes with Subtitles. And why not explore deeper into the prejudices between the Nabooan and the Gugan - it could be that human beings are the Invasive Species on what used to belong to the Gungans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo - as the Viceroy and the Droid Army take Theed and capture Amidala - the Jedi race to Theed to rescue the queen. Here's a footnote here - get Amidala a more reasonable dress or fashion sense. Now I know that there's a report out there that 'claims' each of her dresses mean something...but I have trouble accepting that when she clearly has the same Fashion Consultant as Rita Repulsa.<br>\r\nThey can escape in relatively the same way - now here is another adjustment that I think is needed - No R2D2 or C-3PO. Like I said, Star Wars doesn't need too much comic relief - and until Return of the Jedi, 3PO only serves as such. I get that R2 does a lot more than him - but the fact that they knew Obi-Wan Kenobi, causes a bit of conflict. Even in old Age, Kenobi would remember the single most reliable Astromech Droid from the Clone Wars. I feel like this should've simply been Obi-Wan and Anakin's story - the presence of Original Trilogy characters like R2 and 3PO, just drags it down. I'd much prefer watching A New Hope and seeing R2 and 3PO more or less as New-Comers in the series - those who heard the legends of the brave Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, and knew to seek his help.<br>\r\nR2 fans can hate me, but that's the way I see it. That being said - moving on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would - of course - have to land on Tatooine to meet with Anakin. Though, I find it a bit confusing cause when charted on a galactic map, Tatooine IS closer to Naboo than Courscant, but it's in the opposite direction, and out of their way. But I suppose, that since the Trade Federation probably doesn't Import goods there, it seemed like the safest sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they land on Tatooine - since Obi-Wan is younger, Qui-Gon would suggest him accompanying them on their journey into Mos Espa to purchase parts. This would allow Obi-Wan to contrast with Padme's cautious attitude. This would cause them to butt-heads on a lot of things, and would form a sort of animosity between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow - regarding Anakin - as even as rough as the 9 year old kid playing him acted, I think he was at least descent as far as child actors go. But, I do wish that Anakin was handled a bit differently - perhaps a bit older. Like I wanted with Obi-Wan to be younger, perhaps in teen years - I also wanted Anakin to be older, into Teen Years as well. That way they would be roughly the same age - with Obi-Wan being the older - and would give them more cause to be rivals. Especially when Qui-Gon begins to notice Anakin's strength in the force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Anakin's family - I personally feel that it was kind of Forced in Episode II that Owen becomes Anakin's Step Brother. Especially when compared to Episode IV - how Owen seemed to know Anakin a lot more than just their one and only meeting. So I was thinking that perhaps Owen could've been Anakin's true brother, or maybe his half-brother. It would provide a contrast - since Owen would not be strong with the force. Now, further regarding Anakin - he can be a good pilot, like Luke and Obi-Wan claimed - but at the time, he doesn't have to know it. And also - he doesn't have to be an inventor. He doesn't build C-3PO - I feel like that was a little TOO much fan-reference; \"Darth Vader BUILT C-3PO,\" now doesn't that sound just wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo like in the film - in order to get the money to purchase the parts for the Hyperdrive Generator, they must compete in a Pod Race. Since a Pod Race requires split-second reflexes, one of the Jedi's must take it. Obi-Wan offers to do it, so that if something goes wrong, the more experienced Qui-Gon, can still protect Amidala. But Qui-Gon, wanting to test his feelings about Anakin, suggests that Anakin do it. Nervous as never pod-raced before, Anakin reluctantly agrees, and discovers his heightened reflexes thanks to his ability to use the force. And like in the movie, they win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQui-Gon frees Anakin so that they can take him along. And this would cause Obi-wan to begin to feel jealous of him, now that is surrogate father figure (Qui-Gon is paying all attention to him). Padme understands his jealousy and begins to connect with Obi-Wan more. Suddenly their feelings of Animosity melt away to reveal something more. (Now, I'd personally like to say that I am not in any way a Character Shipper, what-so-ever. I personally think that Padme and Obi-Wan make a rather lousy couple. I am only suggesting this as an improvement, in order to strengthen the burgeoning rivalry with Anakin and Obi-Wan.) However, she does comfort Anakin with his feelings of home-sickness and missing his family - once again making Obi-Wan jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally make it to Courscant where all this debating about what to do on Naboo is going on. We meet the Jedi Counsel - except Yoda is either absent and just mentioned, or Yoda is there but, never shown fully. Mace Windu is more the one in charge - and he's upset that Qui-Gon wants to teach Anakin because he's too old. Plus - they're concerned what he's going to do about Obi-Wan. Qui-Gon suggests that Obi-Wan himself is ready to be a Jedi Knight, and can perhaps begin teaching his own Padawan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon we get introduced to Palpetine. It seemed a bit unfair that he got so much power as a Democratically elected official only to become an even more powerful dictator. So instead of him being a Chancellor or Supreme Chancellor, this time he is considered the Middle Man or Third-Party person that handles the dealings between the Politicians and the Jedi Order. That would explain his knowledge of Jedi dealings, and would allow him to manipulate so much more, without being noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd since he is a kind and caring man in public, he gets close to the young padawans - looking for his next potential apprentice. He's had his sights on Obi-Wan for a long time, and feels to be confirmed when he senses a higher concentration in the force. Obi-Wan uses him as a confidant when he expresses his jealousy of Anakin. So, during their time on Courscant, Anakin is allowed to enter Jedi training but at the beginners level. But - Anakin is now a teen in a children's class, so he feels out of place and embarrassed. However when he is shown to have an almost reflex - control of the force of great strength, it's concluded that he is far beyond the beginners level and needs a Master to harness his skills. But as Windu and the Counsel state, Qui-Gon cannot officially train him, however, Windu decides to cut Qui-Gon a break and hints that Qui-Gon can discretely train him, for better control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Bureaucrats in the first movie were completely useless to resolve the Trade Federation Blockade, the Queen decides to do things herself and returns to Naboo - the two Jedi and Anakin accompanying her. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When they land on Naboo - they seek out the help of the Gungans and resolve the prejudiced issues between the two species. It's then revealed that the Gugan's - while believed to be endangered and only surviving in small tribes, have actually been flourishing in secret, and have enough members for an Army. The Gugans us their submersibles to enter the waterways of Theed so that they can mount an attack from the inside and force the droids back, away from the capital. Meanwhile, the two Jedi accompany the queen for the Battle of Theed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogically - Qui-Gon would not take young, defenseless, inexperienced, trainee, Anakin into a dangerous situation. But since Anakin has to be featured in the Climax of the film, he can't be left somewhere outside the battle. I imagine that, Qui-Gon would order him to stay in the submarines with some Gungan protectors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally - we catch up with Darth Maul. (since I'm only mentioning the stuff that I change, you can assume that Darth Maul had encountered Qui-Gon Jinn on Tatooine - but I'm also adding a subplot about Maul following them across, Tatooine, waiting to make his move, or for them to reveal where the ship's location is.)<br>\r\nHowever - instead of diverging off from the Queen and her guardsmen, the duel with Darth Maul takes place alongside them - Maul is so confident in himself that he feels he doesn't need to split the two Jedi up in order to beat them - since Obi-Wan is so young and all. It would be reminiscent of Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein - when Dracula and the Wolfman begin fighting all over the castle, while the two comedians dodge Frankenstein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin begins to get concerned about Qui-gon and Padme' so he decides to slip past his Gugan protectors and into the palace. That's when he sees that a second squad of Battledroids is moving down the Hallway to ambush the Queen and her guards. So Anakin feels he has to do something and follows. Concentrating hard, he uses the force to loosen some debris from the ceiling and crush the droids - from there, feeling more confident in himself, he hurries to catch up with the others and help some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPadme and her guards finally corner Viceroy Gunray, and order him to call off the droid army and surrender. At that moment, the Jedi, dueling with Darth Maul spills over into the throne room. During the distraction - Gunray grabs Padme and holds a gun to her attempting to take her hostage to escape. Because of this, Obi-Wan gets distracted - leaving the duel to Qui-Gon. He uses the force to pull the Gun away from the Viceroy's hand, and the guards completely arrest him. However, during this distraction - Maul outmaneuvers Qui-Gon and kills him. Obi-Wan, realizing his mistake, is shocked. As a result - he attacks Maul in a fit of rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaul takes advantage of his anger and easily over powers him. Maul begins to taunt his younger opponent. He manages to knock Obi-wan to the ground. When he does, Padme goes to help him up. Maul rushes them both, determined to kill Obi-Wan, when suddenly, he is forced to stop. Anakin is revealed to have entered the room, and is now using the force on Darth Maul's entire body, rescuing Obi-wan and Padme. Maul is at first astonished that someone so young could be so strong with the force, but then notices Anakin's anger at seeing Qui-Gon's death. The battle causes some rubble from the roof to fall, distracting Anakin into saving himself and Maul escapes with his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObi-Wan rushes to Qui-Gon's side and with his dying breath, he beseeches Obi-Wan to take care of and train Anakin. Before it's too late, Anakin thanks Qui-Gon for freeing him. Qui-Gon passes - and now, Obi-wan and Anakin are like two orphaned boys who just lost their father. Obi-Wan decides to put aside his jealousy against Anakin now that he had just saved his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jedi Counsel arrives - joined by Count Dooku, Qui-Gon's old Master. The Viceroy are arrested and taken to Courscant to stand trial. Obi-wan brief's the Order of the situation with Darth Maul, leaving out the information of both he and Anakin loosing their Tempers during the final moments of the fight. For successfully facing the Sith and trusting Qui-Gon's judgement, the Counsel allows Obi-Wan to take the Trials. When Obi-Wan is dismissed, they discuss Anakin - impressed that a young boy could successfully hold off a fully grown Sith, it's decided that regardless of if he is dangerous or not - if the Jedi don't train him, the Sith very much will. It is decided that should Obi-wan pass the Trials, then he shall train Anakin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after Qui-Gon's funeral and cremation, Obi-Wan breaks down in his room - distraught at being key to Qui-Gon's downfall, and his fear of facing the trials - no longer believing he is ready. However, he hears Qui-Gon's voice telling him to be strong and that the Force will always be with him. Obi-Wan's sorrows are cured as Qui-Gon Jinn appears before him as a Force Ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on Courscant, Darth Maul has successfully escaped and returned to his master - Darth Sideous. He apologizes for having failed on Naboo. Sideous tells him its of no consequence and thanks him for his deeds - by killing Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan will now be consumed with anger and could be tempted to join the dark side. He tells Maul of his plan to make Obi-Wan his next apprentice because he felt a massive Force reading when he met with Obi-Wan. Maul now feels double-crossed that his Master is already making plans to replace him - so in a fit of spite, he elects to not tell Sideous about the true source of the power he sensed - Anakin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe cut to the Epilogue sometime later - on Naboo, Queen Amidala has had the Gungan Integration Act signed and Gungan's are now welcomed in Nabooian Society. A celebration is held, as the Gungans parade through the streets of Theed. We see Obi-Wan - his Padawan braid severed, and Anakin now sporting a Padawan braid. Padme nervously smiles between the two of them. Like she feels this big decision needs to be made.<br>\r\nThe End<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to talk about the smaller things I'd change.<br>\r\nFor the one thing - Midichlorians do NOT exist. I understand how having parasites in your body, being lifeforms and all, would allow you to control more of the force around you. BUT - to me, the Force will be nothing more or less than an Energy Field that surrounds us and Penetrates us and binds the universe together. It's energy surrounds us, and binds us - Luminous beings are we, not some crude matter. It is between all things - the wind, the trees, the rocks, the water, the land...and the ship. That being said - the Force is an Energy Field, not Parasites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly - I feel like the Prequel Trilogy had the Jedi come off as a bunch of stuffy bores. I felt it was not right nor fair that Jedi weren't allowed to love, or feel relatively any emotion at all. I understand that they shouldn't feel fear or anger, but what about the more positive emotions. And I understand that attachment can often lead to bad things and the whole chakra structure stuff. But consider this, just because you can let go of an attachment doesn't mean you don't have to love Something - Avatar 101. They made being a Jedi more of a religion than it should've been. Because - the Jedi are all Knights! And knights are all about chivalry - protection of their Land, their Lord, and their Lady. So if anything, Jedi should not only be allowed to love but encouraged to love. Sure it can be difficult as my rewrite of Episode II will demonstrate - but we'll get to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the one I've been looking forward to - Darth Maul. For being the only redeeming factor of Phantom Menace he is a VASTLY underused resource. He is an embodiment of evil - he doesn't say much - and to top it all off, he has a Double-Bladed Lightsaber! He killed the man who taught Obi-Wan Kenobi, Obi-Wan's father figure and mentor - that could've been used for so much character development. Now he is Obi-Wan's motivation. He's a personal villain, someone that haunts Obi-Wan, someone he must defeat to regain his honor. It adds so much more for character development.<br>\r\nWhich is why I wrote all of it this way - so that we can experience Obi-Wan's growth as well as Anakin's. I'm sorry that Anakin had to take the back seat this time, but I had to have his character do a complete 180 - He was raised a slave, but has so many latent talents, but is to timid and brow-beaten to let them loose. But now that he shows he has power, he will begin to grow more confident in himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObi-Wan to me just came off as a perfect Jedi. I wanted to see him as capable of making more mistakes. So now, instead of being able to fall back on his master, he is now forced from his comfort zone and must be the Master to a new student. But, I also included the reference to Qui-Gon knowing the Immortality Technique and being a ghost at the end, so that technically, his tutelage under Qui-Gon doesn't fully end, because now, he can learn to become, 'More Powerful than can Possibly Imagine.' It sets up NECESSARY plot points for the future Trilogy, instead of focusing on creating the Comic Relief. I hope you enjoyed my Rewrite of Phantom Menace and keep an eye open for my Rewrite of Attack of the Clones.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(I've wanted to do this for a long time. It could essentially be how Dragonball Evolution should've been written. I'm not going to say this is perfect, but it will be better. The problem with DBE is that it tried to be the Origin Story for both Goku and Piccolo, while being the first chapter in a trilogy of DBZ movies followed by the Sayain and Frieza Sagas. But unfortunately, to do this properly would require the movie being much longer, or have prequels. But there is a third option; it's called...Exposition.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrologue<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany have heard the incredible feats of Son Goku, the wild boy raised in the wilderness of the East, who journeyed into the West, on a quest to possess the Seven Magical Dragonballs. Created by a Wise old Sage, the Dragonballs were forged with powerful magic and scattered to the corners of the globe. When all seven are brought together, they possess the power to summon the Eternal Dragon, Shenron from his confinement. According to Legend, upon Shenron's release, he will grant one perfect wish to the one who summoned him, as a reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong Goku's journeys to have his wish, he made many loyal friends along the way. Bulma, Yamcha, Korin the Sage, his wise Martial Arts Mentor, Master Mouten Roshi, and of course his fellow trainee and best friend, Krillin. The group traveled with Goku across many adventures all over the world to find the Dragonballs. But where he made friends, he also made enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku's legend was built upon the many deeds he'd done in such a young age, and the foes he conquered. There were those who also sought the Dragonballs, to use their magic to conquer the world. Goku triumphed over the wicked Emperor Pilaf. He destroyed the entire Red Ribbon Army, who sought to control the world through industrial war-machines. He dueled and defeated notorious and ruthless master assassin Mercenary Tao. And despite all odds, against any enemy, Goku rose to every challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver his five year journey, Goku competed in two World Martial Arts Tournaments; a competition of the greatest fighters all over the globe, to see who would be the strongest fighter in the world. While Goku was unable to win either tournament, he was without a doubt one of the most competent contestants. And he vowed to continue his training and become stronger so that he would win the next Tournament...Along the way, he turned many opponents into ally's. Inside the ring, his greatest challenge came from Chiaotzu and Tien Shenhan. Though they began as fierce rivals, the two joined Goku as fierce friends. And despite defeat, every challenge Goku met from a better skilled opponent, always brought a smile to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Goku's greatest challenge yet soon befell him. It was the return of the evil Demon King Piccolo. He sought to rule the world, boasting his invincibility and power. He hunted down the former tournament contenders and began to eliminate them one by one, so that they wouldn't stand in his way. He even killed Krillin and Master Roshi. He stole the Dragonballs and in a shocking display of power, he killed the Eternal Dragon, destroying the Dragonballs' power. Piccolo was Goku's deadliest opponent, and it took all that Goku had within him to strike the demon king down. But Goku succeeded and cemented himself as the legendary hero of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut shortly after Piccolo's defeat, Goku vanished from the world. It was said that he was last seen seeking wisdom from Korin the Sage. And with Korin's help, Goku ascended into the Heavens to seek continue his training with the Gods and bargain for the lives of his fallen comrade. And so, the Hero of the World left the world. And over the next three years, his legend grew. It is rumored that he is still in Heaven, training with God himself, becoming stronger and stronger. And when at last the day comes when the world is threatened with new Evil, Goku will descend from on-high and save us all...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...Now many who hear this story are skeptical of Goku's feats,\" the old man telling the story at a bar surrounded by other half-soused patrons, continued. \"They do not deny the existence of King Piccolo - he was all over the news when he threatened King Doggy for control of the world. They doubted that Goku - who was only fifteen at the time could do it. And they definitely deny Goku ascending into the Heavens to bargain with God for his friends' lives. Especially considering that several eye witnesses claim to have seen both Krillin and Mouten Roshi still alive today; thinking that they never died at all. But still, there are those out there that, when faced with this evidence...only believe Goku's legend even more...Now isn't that a story worth the hearing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man lifted the tall beer mug to his face, the white foam clinging to his very long white beard and mustache. The others who were listening to his story looked around at each other. \"Well I'd say it was when you first told us this story two months ago,\" one Patron said. The others began laughing and patting each other on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's still something I'm confused about,\" another drunk asked. \"You said Goku sought the Dragonballs seeking his own wish, but his enemies ended up stealing the Dragonballs and we assume the wish as well. Did Goku ever have his own wish granted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No actually,\" the old man told them before adjusting his dark sunglasses. \"The truth is, Goku was never after the Dragonballs to grant his own wish. But the reason he collected them was because his new friends wanted to. Goku always made sure to come along to keep an eye on his most sacred treasure. Passed down from his grandfather Son Gohan, Goku was the owner of the Four-Star Dragonball. When his grandfather died, Goku kept it as a reminder of him. Whenever a wish was granted, he always made it a point to recover the Four-Star ball first. But when Piccolo killed his friends, he knew that his one wish would be to revive all of the people that Piccolo and his demon spawn killed before they were defeated. That was Goku's wish...And now, everyone who lost their lives to Piccolo and his minions, is alive and well. Now...It's rumored that God revived Shenron and the Dragonballs are out there, to this very day, waiting to be found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know so much about Goku's grandfather? Why would he just happen to have a legendary Dragonball?\" one of the patrons asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Because I GAVE it to him of course,\" the old man boasted as he wiped the beer suds from his Hawaiian shirt. \"Gohan was my student. In our youth, he came to me and I taught him everything he knew about Martial Arts. It's why Goku came to me, to complete his training!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barflies began laughing at the old man's antics. \"Oh really? And why would you just happen to have a mythical Magical orb that no one ever heard of before? And why would you just give it to your student?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had TWO of them,\" the old man said. \"They were a symbol of the completion of my training, and my Master gave them to me as gifts. Just as I gave one to my student as a symbol of his training! I gave him the Four-Star ball and I kept the One-Star Ball. Goku found me when he was searching for all Seven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I thought he came to you to complete his training,\" one of them said. The drunken men began to slowly stand up, still laughing. One turned and slapped the old man over the shoulder. \"Keep telling stories Old Man,\" he said, giggling to himself as he walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man became sad and quietly muttered into his beer mug. He lifted it up and drank from it, finally finishing his beer. He lamented quietly, knowing that these were the reasons why he became a reclusive hermit. His beer was finished. He slowly stood up, propping himself up with a large oak staff. He clung to it, balancing himself for support. He slowly walked to the bar to pay his tab. \"Good night,\" he told the bartender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his way for the exit, he tripped and stumbled into a young waitress. She caught him and helped him stand up. \"Are you alright sir? Do you need any help?\" she asked, being polite as possible. He old man gained his composure and got a clear look at the soft surface he'd fallen against. He suddenly realized how busty this young waitress was. When he fell, his head brushed into her vast endowments. He blushed and smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I'm fine young ma'am,\" he said. But then he tilted his sunglasses to reveal his eyes to her. \"But I think I may need some help getting home. Why don't you come home with me and tuck me into bed? Hehe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress recoiled in disgust when he started flirting with her. She tried to be as polite as possible, but it was still uncomfortable. \"You're not going to drive home, are you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...I'll catch a ride from a friend...But there is room for two,\" he persisted. \"I own my own island y'know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice,\" she said as she stood him upright. She left him as quickly as she could. He didn't mind watching her go; the view of her backside was pleasant. But then he remembered that, she is still leaving as fast as she can. He somberly began to saunter toward the door. He stepped out onto the cold night street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked down the street, the only noise was the thump of his walking stick and the tiny taps of his footsteps. He soon came to the docks and walked past the warehouses toward one of the piers. However, he soon began to notice that there was another sound; a subtle one, hidden under his own walking. He stopped and quietly listened. He heard footsteps approaching him. There was more than one pair. At least three of them; they were coming at him from all around. He took a deep breath and sighed. Before long, the old man found himself surrounded by a trio of sailor thugs. They looked like they were preparing to mug him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey old man!\" one of them said. \"We've been watching you. Every day you show up at that bar and throw tons of cash around. Looks like you've got some pretty deep pockets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys, it's been a long night, and I've had a lot to drink,\" the old man said. \"Do we really have to do this now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's when we realized who you were...You're Jackie Chun, that guy who won the grand prize from the 21st World Martial Arts tournament a couple of years ago. you're in disguise, but we know it's you...We're willing to bet that you're just drinking your prize money away. What a waste...That money would be better off with us, wouldn't you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man stood there quietly. He began to chuckle to himself. \"So you found me out, eh?\" he asked. \"So you plan to beat and rob a martial arts champion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had to wait for you to get soused up. You can barely stand,\" one of the muggers said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clever,\" the old man responded. \"But...regardless, now that you know who I am, you should be afraid of me. But more than that...My closest friends know me by another name. And if you knew that name...You'd be even more terrified of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio suddenly rushed toward him. The old man, ducked down, causing the three of them to inadvertently strike each other. He then punched the man in front of him and kicked the one behind. The third man took a swing at the tiny old geezer. But the old man jumped into the air and avoided the attack. When he came back down, he smacked the thug over the head with his staff. He then raised his leg and kicked him off to the side. Another attacker got up and attacked him from behind. The old man soon turned and jabbed his staff toward the mugger, striking vital pressure points before knocking him away. The third and final mugger tried to attack one last time. The old man leaped through the air and kicked the attacker in the chest. When he landed he began making several quick strikes to his attacker's chest before striking him with his palm. The attack sent the thug flying down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man stood there, surveying the situation and seeing his work. He noted how none of his opponents were getting up. They seriously underestimated him. He smiled and began to slowly trek toward the pier again. He finally he stood at the edge of the dock. He was teetering slightly from the alcohol. He decided to sit on a small crate sitting on the edge of the dock. He sat quietly and pondered, lightly tapping his walking stick on the wooden pier. He looked down and slowly began to reach inside of his jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled something out of his breast pocket. He turned his hand to reveal a glowing amber orb. There was a light that glowed inside it, like a fire. And floating around, like particles in a snow globe or oil in a lava lamp, was a single red star. It was a Dragonball! The old man looked at the glow it gave of. He covered it with his hand and lifted it to his chest, holding it right over his heart.<br>\r\n\"...Thank you Goku,\" he said, as in in a prayer. That somehow speaking to the Dragonball, Goku could hear him, where ever he was. \"We owe everything to you...Without you, I and so many others would not be here today.\" The old man looked as though he were ready to break into tears. \"But we do wish you were here with us...Life just hasn't been the same without you, my boy. But if you are in Heaven for us...Then it is a much greater place because of you.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh my dear Goku,\" the old man continued to pray. \"You truly were my greatest student. And yet not even I could prepare you for the tribulations. But I would never ask you to take that task for your own...You chose it for yourself. And by Jove, you were amazing. I was never more amazed nor more proud than when Bulma told me what you did that day. To have seen you strike the killing blow to the evil King...would've been such a treat and pleasure before I died, that Death would've seemed like a welcome comfort. My life would be complete. But I couldn't see it...Hehe...I was already dead. I was a fool Goku...But even more of a fool that I couldn't protect you from this task because of my arrogant pride. I knew exactly what I was dealing with...I wonder, if given the chance; would I do things differently? I do envy you Goku...You have achieved what could be the greatest accomplishment a student can; you made your master proud. A satisfaction that I too tried to achieve when I faced Piccolo; to honor my master...Mutaito.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man looked up to the night sky and began to recollect a memory from his youth. He saw himself as he was nearly fifty years ago when Piccolo first rose to power. He was a young man then, only eighteen. He was arrogant and he was brash. He and Chen had completed their training under Master Mutaito years before...But their master requested their presence to answer the threat of the Invasion. When Piccolo began his campaign, the three of them stood against him. Mutaito fought Piccolo himself and told his students to not interfere under any circumstances. The two of them battled throngs of Piccolo's minions. While they were able to triumph, their poor master was beaten by the Demon King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them were forced to retreat, and Piccolo conquered the world. The three of them went into hiding with the intent of forming the resistance. But Mutaito left them. He told them that he was leaving on a journey to discover a way to stop Piccolo, and that he would return. In his absence, Piccolo decimated most of the human population on the planet. And Chen soon lost faith in his master, and left. He broke all bonds with friends, and became Crane Hermit, perusing a career of darkness, and immorality.<br>\r\nTwo years passed and Piccolo ruled his dark empire...It seemed to be hopeless for the world. And then one day, Mutaito returned. He said he'd found a way to stop Piccolo once and for all. Student and Master once again prepared to stop the Demon King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PICCOLO!\" Mutaito shouted. \"Show yourself! Step forward and be counted for all of the crimes you've committed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them stood against a huge army of Piccolo's minions. They were surrounded by green-skinned monsters with wings, sharp fangs and claws, and all wearing the word \"Devil\" on their Clothes - it was their Master's symbol. Then finally, the demons parted, and their king stepped forward. He was a monstrous giant that towered over them all. Clad in black robes, wearing a blood-red cape. His face green, wrinkled and ugly like a Goblin. His eyes glowing yellow. He grinned when he saw us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember you,\" Piccolo said. \"You're the Peace-seeking fools who challenged us once before. Are you here to bring Justice upon me? Fine then...If you so wish, I will make you dance just like last time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMutaito took the package he'd been carrying and gently laid it on the ground. He undid the wrappings to reveal that the weapon he intended to use, was little more than an electric rice cooker. It was an unremarkable green pot, with little else changed about it, save for the seal stamped to the side. Mutaito opened the top and slowly stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And what is this old man?! You intend to cook us lunch before we fight?\" Piccolo laughed. \"My children will be more than happy to feast on your flesh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mouten,\" Mutaito told his student. The young man turned toward his master. \"When I complete what I intend to do...there is a good chance that I might not be able to fight anymore. When it happens, you must close the pot as quickly as you can...And when it is closed, you must protect it at all costs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh but Master,\" the young student exclaimed. \"There's so many of them...I...I can't defeat them alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mouten,\" Mutaito slowly turned to face his student. His white hair and mustache never looked more reassuring. \"You...are one of my greatest students. It has been an honor and a privileged to be your mentor, teacher, and friend. I have long since regarded you as the bravest young man I have ever known. I have the utmost faith in you, that you will carry out this task. Without their master, the hordes of demons will be lost and confused. They will fall easily by your hands. And when you triumph...take the pot and throw it into the darkest depths that you can find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, Master,\" the young man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMutaito turned back toward King Piccolo. \"Goodbye...Mouten Roshi,\" he said. Suddenly the old master was bathed in a green light. Piccolo fired a Ki blast from his hand. But it washed off of Mutaito; he was completely unharmed. Piccolo grimaced and fired more. But none of them worked. Finally, Mutaito threw his arms forward. \"EVIL CONTAINMENT WAVE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA green vortex fired from Mutaito's hands and engulfed Piccolo. The demon king was drawn into the spiral and was sucked along with the waves. Mutaito directed his hands downward toward the rice cooker. The green waves poured into the pot until all had traveled inside. Obeying his Master's wishes, the young student rushed forward and closed the lid of the pot. The force of the waves was holding off the lid - he could feel something trying to get out with all its might. But the young man managed to close the lid. The Demon King Piccolo was gone, trapped inside of the jar for what they would assume was forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master! You did it! He's gone!\" the young man looked up and said to his Master. But his joy soon faded as he saw Mutaito struggle to stand. The old master slowly tipped over and fell to the ground. Using the Evil Containment wave had drained all of his energy. Master Mutaito was dead; his life given in defense of the planet. The young student mourned, and closed the old man's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe army of demons were confused at the sudden disappearance of their King. They spotted the rice cooker. Soon they began to rush for it. The young student remembered the final task his master had given him. He stood and protected the jar from the hordes of demons. The battle lasted for hours, and against the sheer numbers, fighting pain and fatigue, the young master defeated them all, and triumphed in the face of insurmountable evil. The battle was witnessed by the survivors who had emerged from their hiding places to see a young man - alone - standing against Piccolo's army and defeating them. When the army was finished, the young man was hailed as a hero, and the crowds chanted his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he cared not for their praise. He had one last task to complete. He picked up the Rice Cooker and traveled to the ocean. He chartered a ship to carry him to the deepest part of the darkest sea. And so there, above the Abysmal Trench, he cast the Pot into the ocean, hoping to never see King Piccolo again. The young man soon established himself as the Turtle Hermit, and began to teach students of his own, to honor the memory of his fallen Master who saved the entire world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man snapped out of his memories. He opened his eyes and looked out at the rolling sea in the night sky. \"Yes...It was a hope...But we were wrong. I thought he'd forever be entombed at the bottom of the sea. I'm sorry Goku,\" the old man lamented. \"You and Krillin had to pay the price for my mistake.\" He slowly began to stand up. He took a deep breath and shouted, \"HEY! BABY GAMERA! COME HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words echoed out, until there was silence. But before long a strange spinning saucer appeared out of the water. It landed on the dock before the old man. It soon revealed to be an enormous turtle.<br>\r\n\"You need a ride back home?\" the turtle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the old man said. He slowly began to climb aboard the Turtle's shell. \"Also...I've had a lot to drink tonight, so I'm already nauseous. So, no spinning. Fly straight if you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright; hang on,\" the turtle said. The turtle retracted its legs and fire began to shoot out of the shell like rocket engines. Soon the turtle flew through the air with the old man riding on its back. The turtle carried him out to sea, but the trip was a short one. Several hundred miles off the coast was a small atoll with a single house on it. The turtle began to descend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Gamera,\" the old man said. He climbed off the turtle's back. \"Good night.\" The old man walked for the door as the turtle crawled back into the sea. He looked up at the door. The words 'Kame House' written in red letters across the front. He quietly entered and walked into his living room. He found his best friend, an enormous brown sea turtle sitting there, watching TV. \"Hello Turtle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, you're home early tonight,\" the turtle said. \"Launch is cooking dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he home?\" they heard a feminine voice call to them. Soon a young woman with blue hair, wearing an apron over her clothes appeared. \"Oh, hello Master Roshi. So glad you can back so soon; dinner is almost ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Launch,\" Roshi told her. He moved to sit down on the couch and wait for dinner to be finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's see, let's just add a bit of pepper and -\" they heard Launch say. Hearing that, Roshi and Turtle got really nervous. They could hear Launch preparing to sneeze. \"Ah-Aaah-Achoo!\" The two of them froze. They soon heard the clicking and subsequent popping of two capsules opening. Suddenly Launch appeared from the kitchen, her hair now blonde and her expression mean. She was holding a machine gun. \"Make me cook for you old man?! Make me wear an apron will ya?!\" She began firing as Roshi and Turtle hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, never a dull moment with her around,\" Roshi said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(For some reason, I had the strangest desire to start the story over; I guess that's what Total Rewrite is FOR.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the serene and unassuming Mount Paozu, the silence of the morning air was broken by the roar of powerful motorbikes. The first zoomed along the mountain road, as quickly as it could; it's rider was a young woman, her blue hair pulled back into a pony-tail. She looked very frightened. Her bike was far ahead of a pack of motorcycles, each being driven by undesirable looking fellows; all burly and unclean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman glanced over her shoulder back at them. It was obvious that they were pursuing her and intended to do her harm. She accelerated her machine in a vane attempt to outrun them, but she could not increase the distance. And even more unfortunate, one of them was now closing the gap. He pulled up his bike along side her and began swinging a lead pipe toward her bike. The young woman swerved to the right to dodge the oncoming attack. She then veered hard to the left again, smashing her bike against his, causing him to lose control, and the bike to tumble and fall back.<br>\r\nUnfortunately the confrontation caused the gang to catch up on her yet again. She was getting desperate; if they caught her, they would do horrible and unspeakable things to her. She looked off to her right and could only see mountain forest. It was quite thick, but she was certain she could navigate through the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately stopped the bike and hopped off. As soon as she did, she ran off into the woods, ducking tree branches and slipping through them as quickly as she could. The bikers all stopped and followed her into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA secluded lake in a clearing of the mountain was the home of enormous Paozu Tuna. The lake was calm and tranquil, the surface unbroken. Suddenly the surface broke when an enormous Tuna-Fish was flung from the water onto the shores nearby. A small figure soon follows the fish, slowly emerging from the water and walking onto the shore. The mysterious fisherman soon adorned his purple gi that he'd left on the shore before he entered the water. Now that he was out on the surface, he suddenly heard the roar of the motorcycle engines down the mountain. He turned his head toward the sound; he'd never heard anything like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman ran through the woods, her legs pumping as hard as they could to keep sprinting. Her denim short-shorts and jacket were absorbing so much sweat. She was beginning to get fatigued. She could hear her pursuers coming up from behind. She was beginning to get more worried; up ahead the morning fog had grown thicker. She could barely see which direction she was going.<br>\r\nSoon she began to hear the sound of running water. And it became more prominent as she broke into a clearing. The fog had cleared only just enough to reveal that she's run to the edge of a lagoon, being fed by a waterfall. A waterfall from the top of a large rock wall. And the woman now realized how desperate her situation was. This was a dead end, and she couldn't possibly climb it...She was trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around defiantly as her pursuers appeared. She panted hard as the group of thugs began to spread out in an attempt to surround her. The largest and toughest of the group smiled a sinister grin at her through his thick black beard. She began to suspect he was the gang's leader.<br>\r\n\"Bulma Briefs,\" he said with a gruff and surly voice. \"Imagine our surprise when we saw the Capsule Corps Heiress all the way out here...and all alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much is she worth, Boss?\" one of them asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Capsule Corps is the biggest company on the planet; her family is worth billions,\" the leader said. \"I'm sure her old man will be quite compliant when he hears we have his little-girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma cringed and furrowed her brow. These thugs were planning to kidnap her and hold her for ransom. All things considered, it could've been a lot worse; but she was Bulma Briefs - one of the most brilliant and strong willed young women on the face of the planet. She was NOT going to give into this. Besides, if these guys did kidnap her, she wouldn't be able to complete her mission; and she'd worked so hard already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well guys; let's get Mrs. Briefs out of here and show her some of our generous hospitality,\" the Leader said. With that the men began converging on her. \"Now, come quietly and this won't have to get rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sunlight was beginning to pierce the fog bank as the thugs closed in on Bulma. Suddenly the leader found himself standing in a shadow. He raised his head in just enough time to see an enormous Paozu Tuna flying right toward him. It suddenly crashed into him, pinning him to the ground. The group, including Bulma all gave a light jump when the fish slammed into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss, are you okay?!\" one of them asked. However while their eyes were locked on the enormous fish that kept their leader pinned, one of them was suddenly knocked to the ground completely unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH!\" he grunted after being struck over the head. The group turned around in enough time to see a figure disappear into the shadows after attacking their fellow biker. Suddenly the figure reappeared, jumping out of the forest and striking another of them in the face. Suddenly the remaining group members converged on this figure, all attacking him at once. Bulma was surprised by this turn of events; she could just barely make out what was happening through the fog, but she could infer that whoever this person was, he was succeeding in fighting them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mystery warrior defended himself using a kind of staff, holding off their clubs and lead pipes as they swung toward him. He moved so quickly, dodging their attacks that they began to swing wildly...It didn't help, and it only succeeded in their defeat. The fighter was able to easily overpower and outmaneuver each of them, screeching like some kind of wild animal as he did. Soon, each one of them was knocked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma spotted her mysterious savior perched on a rock near the edge of the lagoon. He was still shrouded in fog and darkness that she couldn't make him out. However suddenly, the leader of the thugs recovered and began to stand, lifting the enormous fish off of his body and tossing it aside. He looked very angry. He picked up one of the abandoned lead pipes and charged toward the fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mystery person leaped off the rock and rushed forward to fight him with his staff. The two of them exchanged blows for a moment before the figure parried the lead pipe away. The gang leader tried to strike at him, only to be dodged before receiving an incredibly strong strike to the face. The figure then twirled his staff around and smacked the gang leader with it. he hit him with enough force to knock the man into the lagoon where he made a splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma shrieked and covered herself when the wave of water came toward her. She moved away from the lagoon and began to lean against one of the trees. She breathed heavily and tried to calm herself down. She looked back toward the scene. She saw that her mystery savior was perched on a rock above the scene, the morning light now piercing through the fog, enough to silhouette his form.<br>\r\nShe suddenly realized how tiny this person was; smaller than she was...he was just a boy. His hair was incredibly large and spiky. He raised his staff and triumphantly tapped one end into the rock. And then Bulma suddenly spotted it, rising out from the boy's back was a furry tail! Who was this person?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could tell he was looking at her. \"Uh...Hello?\" she asked. \"Uh...Thank you for...saving me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he leaped off the rock and came toward her, pointing one end of his staff at her. She was so startled that she put her hands in the air, submissively. \"Uh okay...okay, just...don't do anything crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing up close she finally got a good look at the boy. He was indeed a young child, maybe 10 or 11. He wore a purple training gi. He had a round face and wide eyes. He didn't seem to want to hurt her; he seemed more cautious of her. He slowly began to circle her. She scowled at him as he went around behind her, not wanting any funny business from him. When he came back around, he seemed less cautious, and more curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of creature are you?\" the boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma raised an eyebrow at that comment. \"What do you mean, \"creature\"?\" she asked. Then she thought a moment. This boy had a tail, and was able to fight off five grown men, all the while screeching like a monkey. He was probably a feral child who had lived out here all alone. She was probably the first female he'd ever seen in his entire life. \"...Are...you alone up here?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy jabbed his staff at her again. \"No; I live here with my Grandpa!\" he said. \"And he told me to always be weary of the creatures that live in this forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I suppose then you've never seen a girl before,\" Bulma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girl?\" the boy asked. He slowly lowered his staff. \"Grandpa told me to always be nice to girls.\" He suddenly began to bow toward her. \"Please pardon me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma smiled, knowing that this boy wasn't truly feral and had some manners. \"It's alright, considering you did save me from those guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, Grandpa says that we should always extend our hospitality to girls,\" the boy said. He suddenly turned around and walked toward the tuna. He grabbed its tail and began to drag the fish behind him. \"Follow me; my home is this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma wasn't sure she was interested in following him. However, she soon heard a beeping sound from a round device she kept on her belt. She took it off to examine it; it's large green screen with a coordinate plane showed an orange circle off further in the mountains. It was in the direction the boy was going. Bulma figured she might as well not waste the opportunity. She began to follow, not knowing where this adventure would leave her.</span></div></div>",
