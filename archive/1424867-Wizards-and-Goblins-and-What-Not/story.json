You set off on your long and perilous journey, sure to encounter danger, epic battles, goblins and other fantasy type stuff.  Your journey begins in the center of the White Continent, Iceanosha.  You must set off and find the rhun stones retrieve them and return them to their masters or face dire consequences. Your spells include fire of furry, ice of sorrow, wind of terror, and ground of protection.  Your spells can never be taken from you, and you may gain new spells and abilities on your travels.  Your inventory is empty as you begin your quest with only your skills.</span></div></div>",

His skills are great, but is that enough for him to survive in this unforgiving land?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mishap occurs that turns this wizard into a goblin.  Will he try to regain his humanity or will he just screw around?  Either way your sure to have fun and a laugh or two.</td>",
