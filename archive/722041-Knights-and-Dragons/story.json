Five swords, five knights.  The Sword of Eternity is the ulitmate prize.  It is the sword you deserve and so it shall be yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king approaches, his eyes dark and unrelenting.  You feel the sweltering heat of your body collecting inside your armor as the king walks slowly down the line of knights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each of you,\" He begins, his voice deep and strong.  \"Are special.  Each of you are strong.  I need you all, the five provinces united under the royal banner.  None of you know who stands beside you, could be brother or stranger, friend or foe.  Here is your solemn vow.\"  The king picks up the Sword of Eternity from the midst of the others.  \"He who weilds this sword shall be the one to trust.  He who bows first will be the one to serve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour knee bends of it's own accord and you are humble before the king.  The others growl in thier helmets and you can hear grumbling.

Moving your eyes up, over the gems to the cold blade your pupils dilate.<br>\r\nBut that other knight.  Blind bravery and insolence he must have to disrespect you in such a way, keeping his face hidden from his new leader.  Yet the king allowed it, even kept him back, and for what reason you will unearth.  A strong knight must know those under his command if he is to succeed.  <br>\r\nYou lift the lid of the battered, leather chest before you and take out a silk pouch and a rag.

Despite the fine layer of sweat you feel, your face is not flushed.  It never does.  It always remains pale, especially in comparison with such thick dark hair.  <br>\r\nFaint steps slowly become audible.  It cannot be a knight, the footsteps would be heavier and would clang on the stone.  No.  It could be a woman or...you straighten your back and replace your helm.  An elf, clothed in the navy of evening, continues up the steps until he is head height with you.  \"You be well, I trust, friend of the elves.\"  Dry sarcasm dusts his echoing voice.  <br>\r\n\"I find you false, Yesterbel.  So do not aggravate me futher.  Particularly as my hand touches the sword of eternity.\"<br>\r\nHe gives a wry smile and leaves you.

You remain for a short while longer enjoying the scene. Soon you see your father scanning the room for you, you know it was time the knight from Golden Elm excuses himself. Returning to your chambers, you change as quickly as possible, sad to once again wear your shackle of a gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your haste to return to the grand ball room you run into someone as you are leaving your chambers, nearly knocking him to the ground.</span></div></div>",
