            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's Spring and a new term was about to begin at Seirin High. You've been excited to finish junior high ever since one of your upperclassmen in the basketball team graduated and entered Seirin. Finally, you'll be able to meet him again and show him how much you've improved. But before that, you needed to find the basketball club's sign-up booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you! Sign up here and join the baseball club!\" One of the students shouted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget baseball and join our kendo club!\" Another student chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou marched your way through the busy crowd, doing your best to avoid the upperclassmen who cornered the freshmen like hungry wolves looking for prey. As you stealthily made your way through, you tried not to make eye contact with any of them. However, while looking away and pushing yourself against the crowd, your hand slipped and you suddenly crashed into something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Agh! That hurt!</i> You thought while caressing your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi!\" The person you crashed into yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. It was just too crowded, I didn't mean to...\" You shook your head and began to apologize but your train of thought was cut off after raising your eyes to look at the person you just bumped into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't mean what?\" The guy asked menacingly while he glared down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh..uhm...I didn't mean to force my way against the crowd so hard.\" You said while apologizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Probably around five-eleven...? Maybe even more....</i> You pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy also sported a fiery red hair which made him stand out like a delinquent in a shounen manga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble.\" You apologized again, not wanting to make things worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to join the basketball team?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, you suddenly heard another person's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the red-haired guy for a second, but he stood silent. You looked behind you but nobody was there. Finally, after turning your head back to face the red-haired guy again, you were surprised to find another person standing beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" You blurted out in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you surprised me! S-since when were you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was here the whole time.\" He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a blue-haired guy who stood a few inches taller than you and looked a lot friendlier than the guy standing beside him. It was probably the intimidating presence of the red-haired man that distracted you from noticing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kuroko. Don't waste your time with this guy. He's too short to be the type who'd want to join a basketball club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wouldn't know until we ask would we?\" He answered back in a flat tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am! I'm interested in joining Seirin's basketball club.\" You told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are?\" Asked the huge guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, he suddenly walked behind you and roughly pulled you up by your collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! W-wait! What are you d-doing?!\" You shouted while your feet were suddenly raised a few inches from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to struggle free from his grasp but it was difficult. His hand was clamped tightly around the back of your collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! Let me go you...oomf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs roughly as you were <i>picked up</i>, you were forced to sit down on a chair in front of one of the club booths after the red-haired guy walked a few steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kagami stop that!\" A girl across you shouted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to scare all the freshmen away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the fuss? I'm just bringing him over here. And besides, he couldn't even get past that thick crowd by himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are other ways of inviting freshmen! Less violent ways!\" She retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe atmosphere felt tense. As much as you disapproved of how this Kagami guy brought you here, you felt like you needed to break the tension somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....\" You began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" The girl asked after giving one last annoyed look at the red-haired man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm interested in joining the basketball club.\" You told the girl in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Yeah! Right!\" She muttered like she forgot the reason why you were sitting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the club application form.\" She said, handing over a sign-up sheet and a pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're a new school and the club's only been around for a few years but we'll be striving for the nationals again this year! We'll win it this time without fail!\" She spoke energetically while raising her fist high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Aida Riko. Nice to meet you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryou. Sanada Ryou.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sanada! Welcome to the basketball club!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks.\" You said sheepishly as she reached out her hand to offer a handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regular practice for the club starts tomorrow. Freshmen orientation will be held at the same time right after classes. Be sure to be there on time and just wear the uniform you use for P.E.. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Thank you.\" You told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally. Tomorrow's the day!</span></div></div>",

Catch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretched your arms out, ready to catch the ball about to be passed when something enormous suddenly crashed into you. The large object pushed you backwards, forcefully making you fall on your back and skid violently until hitting one of the benches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Agh! That hurt!</i> You thought while pain coursed through your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut from nowhere, a feeling of deja vu crept into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why do I feel like...this has happened before?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly opening your eyes, you tried to push away the object that slammed into you but it was too heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell is going on?! What just happened?</i> You panicked as you tried your best to make sense of the situation with your blurry vision and hurt limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter helplessly trying to push the object away, the weight was suddenly lifted from you. The pain from your arms and legs quickly faded and you felt a wave of relief after getting a few breaths back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I missed your pass. I guess I kinda blacked out there...for...a second....\" Your train of thought was blocked after raising your eyes and looking at the guy who just helped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OI! ARE YOU ALRIGHT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thunderous low-toned voice boomed above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU OKAY?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour whole body vibrated while the deep bass voice sent shivers down your skin. You couldn't believe what you were seeing. A monolith of a man was looking down on you. The light from behind his back casted a dark shadow that loomed all over your whole being. You began to feel confused as you tried remembering what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off the feeling of anxiety, you tried to grab hold of the situation and slowly adjusted your eyes to take another look at the man hundreds of feet above you. It was a bit difficult to notice at first, but the red strands of hair that were swaying around his forehead and the deep voice that reverberated a while ago belonged to someone familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further thoughts, it dawned on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kagami?\" You blurted out weakly as you looked at the titanic red-haired man. Intense heat emanated from his body as beads, or probably buckets, of sweat dripped across his face and jersey. The powerful scent of sweat quickly filled your nose, making you cringe all the more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, you noticed one of his enormous hands move to the side. It was clamped onto a huge round object almost right above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE INJURED. HERE, LET ME HELP YOU.\" He boomed as your attention was drawn to his other monstrous hand which started descending upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong bony masses of fingers started closing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" You shouted out of fear when suddenly....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sanada! Sanada! Wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight suddenly filled your eyes and you heard laughter around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sanada, please refrain from sleeping until the lecture is over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the Math teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's right. It was almost the end of classes. You must have dozed off while listening to the boring lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you off with a warning this time. But please avoid sleeping in my class again.\" He sternly warned you while walking back to the teacher's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>RIIINGGG!</i> the bell suddenly rang noisily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then class, I hope we'll have a good year together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone started standing up and collecting their things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What a weird dream.</i> You thought while trying to calm yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I must've been too excited about the first day of club practice.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started packing up your things thinking you should probably avoid Kagami for the meantime if that dream meant anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the classroom, you began to walk towards the gymnasium, excited to finally be able to see your upperclassman and play basketball with him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmm...but it's still a bit early before club practice starts.</i> You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should you do?</span></div></div>",

They had a swimming pool, a soccer field, a running track, some tennis courts, and a basketball and volleyball gymnasium. Despite that, the school didn't have a solid track in terms of winning sports competitions yet. If it weren't for your upperclassman in the basketball team, you probably would have picked a different school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I guess I'll go look around the next building first.</i> You figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking most of the sports facilities wouldn't be different or special in any way, you started walking towards the building opposite the main hall where other club activities were usually held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first floor had the school clinic, the student council room, and a few meeting rooms. After taking a look around and seeing nothing of interest, you started to make your way up the second floor. Atop the second floor, you noticed a few club rooms lining both sides of the hall, but all of them were still closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Club activities won't start until later in the afternoon after all.</i> You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking further, you spotted some laboratories. On the right was a computer laboratory while on the left was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it's you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, you turned around to see who it was but no one was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...Sanada? Am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice sounded very familiar. Turning around again, you saw the blue-haired guy named Kuroko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I haven't introduced myself yet. I'm Kuroko Tetsuya. You can call me Kuroko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...Kuroko. You surprised me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed he was wearing a white lab gown on top of his uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this? We just finished Chemistry Lab a while ago.\" He said, after sensing your confused demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi! Kuroko! Help me return the materials so we can get to club practice already!\" Someone shouted from inside the laboratory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kagami!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream you had earlier flashed through your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I'll be g-going...\" You tried to excuse yourself, but Kagami suddenly popped out from the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. It's the shortie.\" He said rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" You greeted him with an unsure smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami was also wearing a lab gown, but it looked too small for a man his height. Seeing him wear one made you laugh a bit inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to club practice too right?\" He said roughly with a glint in his eye. It was as if he sensed what you were thinking at that moment and felt insulted by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come help us clean some stuff then we can go together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kagami!\" Kuroko said while looking sharply at Kagami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? I'm just asking for a little bit of help.\" He said while diverting his eyes away from Kuroko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...it's fine.\" You said unwillingly to avoid any fights between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Kuroko? Let's go then.\" Kagami said nonchalantly while returning inside the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuroko let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry if he appears to be rude. It's his way of trying to make people feel welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Make people feel welcome? In what way?</i> You asked yourself. All he had done since yesterday was intimidate you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Kuroko started to enter the laboratory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning your surroundings, you figured both of them were the last pair to finish the experiment since they were the only ones left in the room. You placed your bag down on top of one of the shelves and started helping by putting away some of the chemistry lab equipment left at one of the tables. Most of the equipment were test tube racks and flasks that contained different colored liquids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Shortie, be careful not to spill them.\" Kagami warned you while washing the other test tubes near the faucet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Sanada Ryou. Not Shortie.\" You scrounged up the courage to tell him...but only in your imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kagami, I'll go ahead and return the Chemistry Lab Form to the other room.\" Kuroko told him after putting away half of the test tube racks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sanada, can you return these flasks to the stock room? It might take some time to get this signed.\" Kuroko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" You told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Kuroko left his lab gown near his bag, you started carefully placing each flask on a rack and walked towards the stock room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the stock room, a lot of equipment were arranged in an orderly fashion, but most of the drawers had scientific labels that were too complicated for any normal student to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Argh...where do these go?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started opening each drawer one by one, figuring out which goes to where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Shortie, it looks like you're taking quite a while in there. Do you need some help?\" Kagami shouted from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I'm fine!!\" You shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's three times he's called you shortie today! It's not like it was your choice to grow up so short. Not everyone had the good genes and the luck to grow up as tall as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I rearranged some items in there a while ago when the professor asked me to. Just ask me if you need my help.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumbled for a second, thinking you shouldn't have agreed to help them earlier, when one of the labels inside the drawer caught your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Experimental Growth Enzymes</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe description read...<i>a multivitamin that helps induce growth</i>....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What a coincidence. What harm could there be?</i> You thought.</span></div></div>",

The sound of glass beakers started ringing, making you instinctively turn and lose your balance. Just when you were about to fall on your back, you closed your eyes to brace yourself for impact when you heard a soft thudding noise. Something big and warm cushioned your fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter opening your eyes, you were surprised to see Kagami\u2019s hands supporting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to be careful didn't I?\" He said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly got up in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luckily none of the beakers on the shelves got broken. But look at the mess you made.\" Kagami said angrily while he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you were confused by what he said. But it didn't take long before you felt something cold around your stomach. A blue stain started spreading on your uniform. You looked back at Kagami and saw him holding the last flask you were supposed to put back in the drawer. Kagami's lab gown and shirt underneath were also stained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry.\" You apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened here?\" At that moment, a professor suddenly came into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I....\" You stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry prof. I accidentally spilled one of the liquids while putting the flasks back.\" Kagami apologized quickly to the professor, cutting you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind that! Are both of you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're both lucky that flask didn't contain any of the acids we used for the experiment today.\" He said while taking the flask from Kagami's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. Just leave the rest to me. You can both go.\" He said in a flat but stern tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and Kagami. I'll need to speak with you after club practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly left the stock room with Kagami and gathered your things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried that Kagami had to take the blame for the accident, you began to think of ways to say sorry, but just when you were about to say something, you noticed Kuroko outside the laboratory signalling for both of you. Kagami took both his bag and Kuroko's in one arm and started walking out. You quickly followed him and all of you started walking down the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look. Kagami...I'm sorry I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to apologize.\" He said while walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did force you to help us after all. It was my fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't say anything. Kuroko just silently listened as all of you walked towards the gymnasium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" You finally got the courage to tell him after a minute or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami turned his head towards you and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He's not that bad of a person after all.</i> You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking silently, the three of you finally arrived at the basketball gymnasium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still a bit early. Maybe you guys should go get changed first.\"  Kuroko said after noticing the blue stain on your uniforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true. What about you?\" Kagami asked Kuroko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you heard a high pitched muffled sound from Kuroko's gym bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Kagami shouted while pointing at Kuroko's bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The captain told you to keep him at home for the meantime right?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\u2026I\u2026\" Kuroko was unable to finish his sentence when a small furry head poked out of the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a puppy with round blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>WOOF! WOOF!</i> The dog barked happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought pets weren't allowed in the school vicinity?\u201d You asked Kuroko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you were about to hear his answer, your attention was shifted towards Kagami. His hands were shaking while beads of sweat started dripping from his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKagami?\u201d You asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagami jumped a bit just from the sound of your voice. His face looked pale as if he had seen a ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you used to being around him yet?\u201d Kuroko asked while his hands pulled the puppy from his gym bag and handed him over to Kagami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah! We\u2019re friends alright! But he still creeps me out!\u201d Kagami yelled, stretching his arms in a defensive manner to prevent Kuroko from bringing the dog any closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe puppy barked cheerily and wagged its tail despite Kagami's rejection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the thought of Kagami being afraid of such a cute little puppy. He noticed your smirk and was about to say something when you felt a stinging sensation from your stomach. You reached your hand over your belly to look for any injury but there was none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Kuroko asked still holding the puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it was that liquid from the flask.\u201d Kagami guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm. Maybe.\u201d You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were starting to get a little light headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys go ahead and change first. I\u2019ll just take care of Tetsuya 2 before club practice starts.\u201d Kuroko said while embracing the puppy into a hug and walking towards the back of the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d Kagami said while walking ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
