And coincidentally, it's a memory from my sweet 16.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't remember exactly what it was that I did, but there was this one night, early on in the school year and before the new calendar year, when I made my mom really, really mad at me.  I was 15, and in 10th grade.  She yelled at me, \"You know what?  Your sweet 16 is CANCELLED!  I was going to make it a nice surprise for you and all that, but after your behavior tonight, you don't deserve it.\"<br>\r\nLike I said, I really don't remember what spurred that reaction. I only remember having to write a reflection, saying \"What I did was wrong; I did it because of this reason, and I know it was wrong.  I promise not to do it again, but I don't think it's fair to take away something I didn't even know I had.  Like one of my older friends said, a sweet 16 is like a gateway into adulthood, and I really wish you hadn't told me it was cancelled-  I wasn't even expecting one, so had you just taken away something else, it probably would've been easier that way too, then just not have the party at all, like it wasn't even planned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast forward through to January-ish, and my yearbook editor (in high school) is messing around with my friend Eleni, pulling tricks on her and such.  I told him, \"it's not nice to mess with other people, y'know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother month later, Eleni and I are sitting next to each other on the bus up to the other high school for a cancer awareness walk, because both schools on the hill had a student with Lymphoma (I think).  So I ask her, \"hey, are you free on X day at X time? Do you wanna go see a movie?\"<br>\r\nThat day and time was the exact timing of my sweet 16.  It was back on, and I was fully aware of most of the plans- I had chosen the guest list, but they were all told this was \"top secret\", and I was, under no circumstances, to be told about the party. <br>\r\nEleni, being the nice girl she was, became rather uncomfortable and didn't quite know what to say, besides, \"Umm, I'll have to check.  I think I'm busy though, I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\nThe day of the party, Eleni was sitting close to me, when she overheard me saying something about \"Yeah, I knew this was going to happen.\"  Her eyes went wide, and she asked me, \"So you knew all along?  You were just messing with me?\"<br>\r\nI laughed as a response and told her, \"Yeah.\"</span></div></div>",

There was another game, I don't know what the name of it was; but the obstacle was to take a spoon full of beans from one bowl to another bowl across the room and the first person to have all of the beans from one bowl to the other was the winner. Any way I was so young and dumb I didn't know what to do with the beans  so I just put the spoonful of beans in my mouth and chewed them up and ate them.  Everyone at the party started laughing at me for being so goofy and doing such a foolish thing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you would think as I aged I'd get smarter but not me.  I recall my eighteenth birthday, my friends and I were in vocational school, and we decided to skip school for the day and get drunk since I was finally old enough to do so.  I must say that I don't think there is any kind of sick like that, is there? I was so stupid because I live in a Dry county in Kentucky, which means there is no alcohol allowed in the county.  We went to the next county over and got it and I was so afraid that people would know I was drunk that we passed by these two older pentecostal women and I was so afraid that they could smell the vodka and beer from within our car that I actually ducked down in the floor of the back seat.  My friend and I got so tickled that we died laughing until we got sick that is, which lasted all night long...</span></div></div>",

I have always loved planning parties and I always loved asking Nan (my grandma) about party ideas. She would always help me plan parties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNan mentioned a Chinese Firecracker game that was played at one party she attended. It didn't have a religious theme to it, so friends of all faiths could play this game. Basically, you would pass around wrapped gifts and whichever gift or gifts you wound up with when a song ends, it/they was/were yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought it was a fun idea and instead of buying the typical gifts of expensive items, I made CDs, bought muffin mix, shampoos, bought some paperback books, inexpensive CDs, Ramen noodles, lotions, and a teddy bear. I wrapped all the gifts for the day of the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell let me tell you, the game was a hit! Everyone was surprised by the gifts they received! Although they were inexpensive gifts, everyone acted like a five year old opening gifts. They loved the small trinkets and they loved playing that game!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone enjoyed the party I threw, but they especially loved the Chinese Firecracker game that Nan suggested.

A three-ring circus filled with cake that juggles and falls at death defying heights, tumbles like a clown, and flies through the air at incredible speeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter what we\u2019re celebrating, cake is the most important part of the party. In my family, there is an un-written law instituted by the over \u2018sixty five\u2019 crowd that states you have to eat cake right after a heavy meal or you\u2019ll faint.  If you suggest we retire to the living room to relax\u2014sudden headaches and gasps ripple through the dinner conversation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three-ring circus begins with the in-laws and my mom sitting and drooling while the table is cleared. A whole discussion commences about the type of cake that will be served.  Memories of cakes through their childhood start up.  My mother-in-law reminisces about the Battenberg cake her granny baked with soft spongy squares of yellow and pink.  Her husband pipes in with a tale from Germany. During World War II, there was no cake while growing up but he enjoyed eating bugs as a treat.  The conversation stopped as the homemade Black Forest cake slid out of the refrigerator and onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI served them a thick piece with cherries dripping down the sides and chunks of chocolate scattered on the glass plates.  The chatter started up again with more conversation about the different cakes of the past.  How my mother made cakes with coins wrapped in wax paper and buried them into the cake before she topped it with icing.  My mother-in-law mentions her famous Butterfly Cakes and describes how to make them in every detail.  Her husband interrupts and adds his comment how every piece of cake should have ice cream on it\u2014any flavour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three-ring circus continued with my mom cutting a huge piece, her mouth wide-open, it juggled on the fork and looked like \u2018The Leaning Tower of Pisa\u2019. It climbed at a steady pace to her chin before it took a death-defying leap and splattered on her plate.  A cherry coated in thick sauce tumbled like a clown down the front of my mother-in-law\u2019s ample chest\u2014it had a long way to travel.  I\u2019m thankful she asked for a tea towel to cover her blouse instead of a napkin.  Her husband\u2019s cake is like the brave man who flies out of the cannon\u2014he talks while he eats and the crumbs fly at an incredible speed.  With each bite, whip cream, cherry sauce, and chocolate crumbs build on his full moustache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show ended with them smacking their lips and praised the baker for a show-stopping cake. I know the entertainment is worth every splattered chunk, tumbled cherry and flying crumbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a couple of weeks, I will have the joy of another family party.  I can guarantee the same characters will be the stars\u2014let the show begin!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/view/2053743\" title=\"Lornda~Power Chick Dress Image-Framed  [#2053802]\nImage for Power Chick Fashion Show\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/trans.gif\" title=\"Lornda~Power Chick Dress Image-Framed  [#2053802]\nImage for Power Chick Fashion Show\" height=\"0\" width=\"0\" id=\"protectWMLImg1\"><img onmouseover=\"protectMe(this, 'protectWMLImg1');\" title=\"Lornda~Power Chick Dress Image-Framed  [#2053802]\nImage for Power Chick Fashion Show\" alt=\"Image for Power Chick Fashion Show\" src=\"https://www.writing.com/main/images/action/display/ver/1441079518/item_id/2053802.jpg\" width=\"162\" border=\"0\" height=\"218\"></a></div></div></div>",

I'm shocked by what parents spend on birthdays. They have to be events, even when the kid is two years old and won't remember a thing. Parents pay upwards of $200 to have a particular place or event reserved. If you have the money, it's a great idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids do have a blast, though. One place to hold an event is like a giant gymnasium, with the entire floor padded. There's a ball pit, which I had to haul both my grandson's out of. And their dad got stuck, while trying to play it cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur interactive is all about 15, so I added the years of all my grandchildren together, and it came to 15! How cool is that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can Google a search and find suggestions for party themes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September, my grandson will be six. His theme is all things cats. Rather than gifts, he wants his friends to bring cat food to be donated to animal shelters. His family will buy him presents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",
