Wake up, or you are going to be late for school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud voice of your sister waking you up shattered your \"sweet dreams\", and you slowly crawled out of bed. You still wished you could go back to sleep, but you knew you could not. High school had came by so quickly, and now you are in the second year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh ... morning, Reiko ... \" you groaned, still a little sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up and get changed! You will be late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Reiko left your room and went to prepare breakfast. You finally got out of bed, and started getting changed. As you changed into your school uniform, you can't help but think about your past. Though you were a bright student and your looks aren't too bad, somehow girls shunned you. This may be due to your interests, including watching anime and collecting manga volumes, not to mention the huge figurine collection on your shelf. Your good friend once told you that high school is the best time to score a date, and that if you did not, you are destined to stay single forever. The thought of you growing old and no women in your life was a scary thought lingering inside your head, one that you wish will stop by the end of high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki! Breakfast is ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly rushed down to the kitchen, eager to taste Reiko's cooking. You and your sister live together in this small two-storey house in western Tokyo. Your parents, though alive, are seldom home due to work. Your father's a manga artist, and your mother a fashion designer who often flies between cities. Perhaps because of this background, Reiko had matured relatively quickly and even takes care of you despite being 3 years younger. As you two sat down for breakfast, Reiko could not help but notice that you had a new uniform type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You got a new uniform, it seems!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! My old school got merged with 3 others in some M &amp; A (Mergers and Acquisions) scheme, so from today, I'll be attending school at the new school building down the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that old girls' school which was renovated recently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that one. I wonder what was the school board planning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear Yuriko will be in the same class as you. Are you going to make your move?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spilled coffee at hearing Reiko's comment. Although Yuriko was your childhood friend and was beginning to mature in age and in her figure, you did not think that you might end up with her some day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"REIKO! That's not funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! Sorry, my bad! Here is a tissue. (You took it and wiped the coffee off your face) Still, I can tell you are not that popular with girls. You sure Yuriko is not the one for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, probably not. Besides, it also looks like she's already dating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, too bad. Well, hurry up, or you are going to be late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breakfast went by uneventful, and after cleaning up, you and Reiko went your seperate ways to your different schools. As you walked to school ... </span></div></div>",

She had changed quite a lot, cutting her hair short and sporting a cute hairband in addition to her already bright eyes and cute face. Though her uniform somewhat breaks the outline of her figure, she still looks pretty good in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y ... you look very pretty today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, shucks, Hiroki.You flatter me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you took a slow stroll as you headed to school, chatting along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, Hiroki. Are you looking forward to studying in this new school? I mean, suddenly bought over and merging schools. What was the board planning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beats me. I just want to be done with high school, so I don't really care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, enough about school. How are your parents doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same as always, rarely home. Their careers are flying, so they are not quitting anytime. Looks like it's going to be me and Reiko at home for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko giggles slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, if you two need help, I can always drop over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then handed you a packed lunch wrapped in a piece of cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to take care of yourself. OK, Hiroki? Promise me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko then left, waving to you as she left. You just stood there, still holding Yuriko's packed lunch. She was a kind and gentle person, not to mention caring, but you still wondered if she was the right person for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you entered school, you ...</span></div></div>",

Looking around the room, there seems to be no activity and even though the gadgets on the work desks are tempting you to touch, it still does not answer your question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes caught attention to a strange object on a seperate workdesk. It looks like one of Reiko's digital alarm clocks, except without the timer display, only a label with the words \"SHRINK DEVICE\" on it. You saw two buttons on it, one red and one blue. Curiously, you pressed the red button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZZAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body felt a huge jolt of electricity flowing through it, causing you pain and giving you a bad hair day. Next thing you knew, as you felt the electrical shock throughout your body, the workdesk above you felt like it was growing. It went by for 5 seconds, and the electric shock subsided. You don't feel any pain, but you look around, and got a shock of your life. You had shrunk! The so-called \"SHRINK DEVICE\" really works!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the device, you know that the red one shrinks the person while the blue one reverses the effect. However, you have bigger problems, literally. The shrink device is still on its workbench, high up above your head. Making matters worse, you heard footsteps from behind the door.

You decided to go towards it, even though you don't know what's in store for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, you find people behind the other side of the light, and they are people your size. Strangely, all of them wore the same uniform as yourself. They are obviously students of the school, and it is obvious you are not the only victim of Shizuka and her mad plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki! Is that you?\" A familiar voice came out. You look around, and to your surprise, it was Daisuke, at your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daisuke! How on earth ... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had no idea either. One moment I was minding my own business, and suddenly I was shrunk down to this ridiculous size. Luckily I had help from these guys. Otherwise, I would have been crushed to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The former members of the Technology Club at our school.

He was the so-called \"Emperor of the Geeks\" back at your old school, Tetsuya Takahashi. You and Tetsuya were friends, but not as close as Daisuke or Yuriko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too? Let me guess, Shizuka did this to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she and the new Chairman of the Technology Club did all this. As you can see, we are all victims. I built this base underneath one of the classrooms as a sort of relief for us. Shizuka and the new Chairman will pay for ruining my beloved club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this Chairman anyway?

We have to get out of here!\" Tetsuya exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light above you got brighter, and then it is revealed.

Watch out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaped forward and pushed Tetsuya away before Shizuka's foot crashed into the hole. Her foot alone occuiped much of the hole that is Tetsuya's secret base, indicating the sheer size difference.

There's no point crying over spilled milk. I'll need time before I can get another base up and running. This is where we part ways, Hiroki.

I'll also try to find a way to reverse the shrinking. Godspeed, Hiroki!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bid goodbye to Tetsuya and his band of geeks, Dsiauke included.

You walked around the huge school yard, but it looks like there's trouble. Both Madoka and Mikako are at the yard, trying to look for you. In addition, it looks like it's the first break at school, so a lot of students are hanging around the yard, and the chances of you being stepped on is too real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Yuriko have had a weird day. Even after saying goodbye to you and going for classes, everything still felt strange. The male students all seem to disappear into nowhere when you talk to them, and above all, a few students from class 2-C, namely Hiroki and Shizuka, did not attend classes the whole time. She was worried for you, especially if anything somehow happen to you, she was going to have a hard time explaining it to your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if by chance, Yuriko had lost a piece of her favorite charm bracelet a few years back, when the abandoned school building was still standing. It had always disturbed her that she is missing a piece in her charm bracelet. As the piece is really small, she had brought a magnifying glass to help in her search. She remembered that she dropped in the school yard, and luckily, no real changes have been made to the yard. The challenge is finding it in such a huge place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking and avoiding the students walking around the school yard, you tripped onto something, and fell flat on the floor. You had no idea what tripped you, but whatever it was, it was too big to be a small rock. You turned back, and to your surprise, you had found Yuriko's missing piece of her charm bracelet! It wasn't too big for you, but it felt like the side of a basketball to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if by coincidence, you saw the huge figure of Yuriko walking and looking around on the school yard. You tried waving your free arm, but Yuriko still didn't see you. It looks like the piece is your only solution out of this, so you raised it high up in the air, hoping it will get Yuriko's attention. Yuriko spotted something, and is heading towards you. As her thundering footsteps get closer, you wonder if it's a bad idea to do this. Did she see you?</span></div></div>",

She saw you, holding her charm up high above your arms, calling out to her, but the voice barely audible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she crouched down to have a closer look, you could see her pinkish-white panties underneath her skirt. Though it was a pleasant sight, you decided to focus on getting Yuriko's full undivided attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HIROKI-KUN! WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? HOW DID YOU GET THIS SMALL?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her softest voice felt like the wind's shouting at you. On your part, your voice is too inaudible for her ears. All you could do now is signal to her to pick you up and get you off the ground before you get stepped on. Although Yuriko didn't get your gestures, she still wanted to get you to safety, and reclaim her charm bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I understand!\" She can't hear herself whispering, but to you, you recognize the melodious voice anytime. You nodded, and when Yuriko got her hand out, you leaped on.

Still, it was the best place for a shrunken person to be in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, classes had already started back at class 2-C, with the teacher a bit puzzled at the number of students present. Many of them, especially the male students, are all missing in action. Shizuka was also nowhere to be found.

You were safe, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went by eventless, and the both of you started counting down till school's out. You got the better end of the stick, as you could get some sleep after running around the schoolyard all day, whereas Yuriko had to pay attention in class or risk getting detention. Inside the pocket, you fell asleep, exhausted and giving in to the warm afternoon weather. Yuriko had a glance inside the pocket, and found you asleep. Though she can't hear you snoring, she still smiled, knowing that you are OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up after having a good sleep, and decided to crawl out and have a look at where you are. Surprisingly, you were able to sleep all the way till school's over, as you saw Yuriko walking down the familiar alley where you two first met this morning.

Your first time washing your own clothes was a huge chore, and it was here when you finally learn to appreciate what Reiko did all these years. After a long and hard ordeal, you finally got the aroma off your clothes, and left them to dry. In the meantime, Reiko had cut a small piece of cloth from her old clothes and gave them to you. There was no needle small enough for you to use, so you had to wrap the cloth around yourself while your clothes dried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner came and went, and when it was time to sleep, you were given Reiko's old dollhouse to stay for the night.

Whether is was from the pain from running around all day or that you caught up with sleep in Yuriko's pocket, you were wide awake, unable to sleep.

She was approached, and accepted the offer, but left it after a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The firm was planning a 'Master Plan', a plan Saki wanted no part of. She left them, but her technological designs were already in the hands of this firm.

There was not much activity and not many people around, so you were safe from being spotted and squashed, though the robotic \"flea-dogs\" were still a threat. Like trained covert operatives, the three of you sneaked your way around the huge underground laboratory. While you still found the Yamamoto brothers' tale unbelievable, you still had a job to do: find the resizing device and get back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after a lot of snooping around, you finally found the device hidden inside one of the labs. Though you found the device, operating it would be hard. Upon closer examination, you noticed that all three of you had to stand inside the bubble capsule beside the machine if you want to revert back to normal. In addition, someone had to start up the machine from the console above, which can only be accessed by a single pole chair attached nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a discussion, all three of you will climb the device to reach the console, using the nearby chair as leverage. It took a while for you guys to reach the top, but eventually, you reached the main console. It had a flat-screen built inside it, with a dial and a keyboard used to operate the machine, possibly to control the size of whatever might be in the bubble capsule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiroshi and yourself jumped around on the keyboard to access the program needed to operate the resizing device, while Shuhei adjusted the dial. Soon, the program was set. The device was ready for your enlargement. However, at the same time, the noise generated from the device could potentially be a wrench into your plan if anyone was to hear it. Your worst fears came true when you heard a female voice booming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear footsteps rushing towards the resizing device, and when the door opened, a giantess (to you) entered the lab, looking around.

Making matters worse, she had noticed the three of you on the console, and she was already walking towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU CREEPS! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you want to answer that question, you know very well that she cannot hear you, despite being at the side of her stomach. There was no time for anything as Shizuka placed her huge hand onto the console, aiming to squash you guys with it! All three of you managed to dodge the first attack, but she will be back with another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TCH! MISSED!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge hand came slamming down on the console again, and you guys only barely managed to evade it this time. If this goes on, not only would you three remain at 0.5 cm permanently, but you could also end up being flattened to death by Shizuka's huge hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki! I have a suggestion!\" Shuhei finally spoke. \"My brother and I will lure Shizuka away from the console, while you finish the programming. We don't have any other choice. It's all up to you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Yamamoto brothers then tried to get Shizuka's attention while you finished programming the console. It was not easy jumping from key to key on the keyboard, and Shizuka was getting annoying with her loud bursts of \"Will you hold still\" and \"Argh, I missed\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few jumps over the keyboard, the program was finally complete. The machine was ready to be used, and all it needs now is for you guys to enter the bubble capsule. As you try to turn around and get the Yamamoto brothers, you saw in shock that they had been defeated by Shizuka. They were alive, but heavily worn out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW IT'S YOUR TURN, HIROKI!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran to pick up the fallen Yamamoto brothers, and in that split instant, you jumped off the console and onto the chair, before climbing down the chair itself. Shizuka nearly flattened you with her hand back then, but now you have another problem to face: her feet! Running as fast as you can while still holding onto both Yamamoto brothers, you dashed towards the open bubble capsule while avoiding Shizuka's stomping. Did you make it in time?</span></div></div>",

While both Hiroshi and Shuhei were still out cold, you could feel the effects of this energy source. Slowly, but gradually, you could feel yourself getting enlarged, and so are the Yamamoto brothers. Soon, the bubble capsule opened, and you find yourself back to normal. Hiroshi and Shuhei regained consciousness, and were also glad to find themselves restored to their respective sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the bubble capsule, you went forward to confront Shizuka, who was not as threatening when you were shrunk. Seeing 3 boys all staring down at her, Shizuka remained defiant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y ... you! You haven't seen the last of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a mad huff, she left the lab. After she left, all three of you could finally trade high-fives without fears of being stomped. As the three of you look down on the ground, the flea-sized robotic dogs don't seem as scary as they look anymore. Shuhei even picked one up, and easily tore it apart into two, scaring the others away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so Shuhei and I will go and look for our bikes. You can go where ever you want now, Hiroki.

As it turns out, there was a secret entrance inside the labs without anyone noticing: a trapdoor underneath the school yard, hidden in the ground. You were in the familiar yard, but this time, you were normal sized and had no worries about being stepped on or get chased by bugs. You went towards the school gate, towards the one person to know that you were normal and safe: Yuriko Takamoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the school gate, you found the main lock, and using the skeleton key you found while travelling around the labs, opened it, allowing Yuriko to enter. Yuriko was at a loss of words upon seeing you at normal size, but went out and hugged out ... tight. You blushed, but said nothing. It was the first time you got a hug from a female who is not Reiko or your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're OK ... Hiroki ... \" Yuriko said, still clinging onto you tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of embracing each other, despite not in a relationship, it was finally time to get serious.

OK, stay where you are, I'm coming right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLICK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that Shuhei?

As promised, you told Yuriko everything you know, and even though Yuriko had the confused and puzzled look, she still believed your story. After all, you had spent much of the night in her pocket and shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally caught up with the Yamamoto brothers, and Shuhei was with another person, namely your classmate, Mikako Nagama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shuhei!

One of them is Shizuka herself, standing on the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki Iketani! I never thought I would see you here! I should have crushed you back there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be patient, Shizuka!\" The seated girl finally spoke. \"Hiroki Iketani, it is an honor to meet you.

You seem quite decent to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh ... thanks ... Chairwoman Mizuki ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess an explanation to whatever is going on is in order. My apologies for your unfortunate shrinking adventure, but it was all part of the 'Master Plan'. Hope you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard about this Master Plan from Mikako and the Yamamoto brothers there. Could you at least tell us what exactly are you planning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you already know so much ... very well. The Master Plan involves the resizing device you had used. We plan to use it to shrink the world's population down to a more ... managable size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT! I won't allow it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you will listen, Iketani-san. As you can see, the world is always fighting over scarce resources, land, food, ... you name it, wars have always been fought over. Why not look at our country itself: our country is mountainous, with very little plains and natural resources. Our country cannot expand under these constrains, and history had shown us that we were wrong once. If the human population was smaller in size, there would be more land to spare, and more room to grow our own food. If people were smaller, we won't occupy too much space on this planet, and with so much land available, no one would be fighting over territory anymore. Everyone benefits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChairwoman Mizuki had got you there, as you had always been concerned with the growth of Japan, and in the way, the world. But she is proposing a very radical solution: shrinking the world's population down to size. It all boils down to your decision. Yes ... or No?</span></div></div>",

Do you know what you just said?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Yuriko-san, I know. If you think about it, our nation is already struggling with the growing population. In time, out descendants will have very little space to support themselves. History had shown us that aggressively taking over space will only backfire on us, and if we do nothing, we will all die out. I know how much you don't like this, and I too have my doubts about this, but I want to go on with this Master Plan, no matter how whacked out it sounds. I'm not doing this for them, or for me, but for the future ... our future, if we have one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko nodded after hearing your answer, while Chairwoman Mizuki simply applauded after hearing your speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well said, Hiroki Iketani.

Her eyes widened at first after hearing it, but eventually, she agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne month passed ... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Sunday afternoon, and you were sitting in front of your TV set with Reiko, watching the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The government today approved a massive construction project to establish 18 new settlements. A month has passed as the world marvelled at the discovery of new lands all over the world. As Prime Minister Takeo Fujimura described in his speech, 'We will not have to worry about our population boom any longer.' ... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world is going along with life as per normal, though the lengths and heights of rivers and mountains have to be remeasured. Chairwoman Mizuki's Master Plan was complete, and the world's population, flora and fauna were now reduced to no more than an inch in height (comparison to original sizes). Buildings and structures all over the world had to be shrunk carefully, but it was successful. You were already used to your current height, being shrunk and all in your adventure a month ago, but most of the girls in school were still not getting used to their new sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a month, and for some reason, I still feel that I'm not the right size. I don't know why, but something says that I was ... bigger ... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your imagination never fails to amaze me, Reiko. Yuriko-san was also saying the same thing for over a month. Seriously, I don't know why you girls keep saying that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to take a vow of secrecy to make sure the world never found out about the shrinking devices or the Master Plan, or it would be all for nothing. As much as you want to tell them the reason for their weird thoughts, you had to keep it to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In other news, the gigantic shoe in the middle of downtown Tokyo continues to draw attention from tourists and locals alike. Our scientists are all stumped at how such an item of this size could be made. The shoe itself continues to remain a marvel up till today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled to yourself upon hearing the news, as you had requested Chairwoman not to shrink one of Yuriko's shoes just to see how the world would react to it. A secret only you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hiroki, why are you smiling like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing! I was thinking maybe we could go see that giant shoe for ourselves. I'll call Yuriko, and the three of us can go together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, let's do it then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world continues to move on ...</span></div></div>",

I missed! I won't miss a second time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gets ready to aim again, Shuhei was already close to her and with quickly disarmed her, with the shrinking carbine falling onto the floor. Before Shizuka could reach for the carbine again, Shuhei stood in her way, preventing her from getting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was for shrinking my brother and I yesterday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizuka had the nasty look on her face, but could do nothing as she does not have her precious shrinking carbine anymore. Incidentally, all of you suddenly heard a sound of a gong going off. It went on for a while before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well! I guess it's time to put the Master Plan in action! Hitomi, Shizuka, let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChairwoman Mizuki got off her \"throne\" and started walking away. The other girl (name revealed as Hitomi) followed suit, and an annoyed Shizuka followed suit, but stopped short at the door. She then turned towards all of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the Master Plan is complete, revenge will be sweet ... FOR ME! I'll see you guys at Marunouchi ... if you have the guts, that is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walked away, while you guys went towards Shuhei to examine the carbine Shizuka threatened to use against you. After all of you had your turns to admire the carbine, there was only one thing to do left: stop the girls from completing their \"Master Plan\" before it's too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did Shizuka say 'see you guys at Marunouchi'? Isn't that place the financial district of all of Japan?\" Hiroshi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably where their funding came from. I'll bet the firm responsible for this also has another base in the financial district.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have much time. Hop on to our bikes, we will take you there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 4 of you then headed towards the main exit, where the Yamamoto brothers' bikes were.

Interestingly, there was something strange on the main spire. It looked like four gigantic cups attached onto a rotating cylindrical base. Although you have no idea what it was, it cannot be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's our target! That tower in the centre.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on! We're almost there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be another ten minutes before you arrived at the base of the tower. Appearance-wise, it looked like a normal building, but strangely, there were no guards or business going on. Most businesses don't work on Saturdays, but even so, there would be guards patrolling the building. Hiroshi then dismounted his bike and tried to open the door, but found it locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No good! It's locked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's just great! If we don't find a way in, we'll be the size of ants in a matter of hours.\" Shuhei ranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Yamamoto brothers then started one of their squabbles, which you find quite irritating. Despite the attention being drawn towards them, the brothers still continued. It was not until Yuriko noticed a sign pointing to a basement car park, and the brothers finally stopped their quarrelling. The four of you then headed towards where Yuriko pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark inside the basement car park, even with the headlights switched on. As it was too dark to ride on, you all agreed to dismount the bikes and go on foot. Without any light source, the four of you had to \"feel\" your way around the car park. Shuhei then felt a switch of sorts, and flicked it on. When the lights are restored, imagine your surprises when you see loads of robots the height of a small building surrounding you guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYAAA!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you hugged each other in surprise in fear that the robots would attack you guys. After a while, it appears that the robots are immobile, and looking at your awkward positions, quickly got back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! That gave us quite a scare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went up to have a look at one of the robots. It had the appearance of an armor-clad samurai, with a big kanji for \"oni\" (A Japanese demon in folklore) on its torso. Feeling curious, you went to the back of the robot, and you found a ramp lowered at the back. You wanted to discover more about this robot, but there really was little time left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hiroki! We have to go now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, OK! I'm coming on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you then proceeded to the main exit of the car park, and up the staircase to put a stop to this \"Master Plan\".</span></div></div>",

As you headed towards the lift lobby, you tried calling the lifts, but to your surprise, none of them were working. You knew Shizuka had planned this, and there was only one way up left: the stairs. Begrudgingly, you returned back to the main staircase, and went up the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine your surprise when you found Shizuka waiting for you along the main corridor. She was holding another one of those carbines she threatened to use on you. However, this time, she fired the cold laser at you guys, and you find yourself shrinking down to 0.5 cm again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it! Not again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around, and you saw Shuhei and Hiroshi at the same size as well. You were wondering about Yuriko until you notice the moving \"veil\" above you that is Yuriko's skirt. The three of you were close to peeping at her panties before Yuriko covered her skirt down with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACK! DON'T LOOK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko was blushing a little, but all Shizuka did was just simply point a few fingers, and then suddenly ran off out of sight. You wondered what she meant with those gestures, but then you find yourselves surrounded ... by a pack of high school boys ... all shrunken to a smiliar size as yourself. They all had that look in your eyes, a look you really don't want to see even at normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi ... Hiroki ... What should we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko was muttering at a voice so low that even at your size, her voice sounded nothing more than a whisper.

It was a ridiculous sight, a normal-sized high school teenage girl running away from a horde of shrunken high school boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM? WHY ARE THEY ACTING THIS WAY?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to answer, but being bobbed about on Yuriko's hands made it difficult for you to give an answer. In addition, as she was holding you guys close to her chest, her breasts add to the \"hindrance\" with Yuriko's constant running motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko kept running upwards the staircase, kicking aside minor annoyances occassionally. It was not too bad at first, but as she kept running upwards, the annoyances kept piling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, guys. I think a few of them are on my leg. They're ticklin ... OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko let off an ear-piercing scream that almost deafened the three of you. Looking down at her leg, you could see a shrunken student hanging onto Yuriko's left leg, with a taser in his hand. He then jabbed the taser into Yuriko's leg again, causing Yuriko to let off another scream in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized that if they continue hurting Yuriko, she would be unable to run any further. Yuriko was already slowing down due to pain and exhaustion, and there was still a long way to go. Shuhei then leaped off Yuriko's hands, and slid down her body and chased off the annoyance on her leg. Another climbed up, but Shuhei knocked him off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep doing that, Shuhei! I'll continue upwards!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou envied Shuhei's role by now, but you can tell that Yuriko was getting very tired. Eventually, she got down on her knees, too tired to move, and letting Hiroshi and yourself off her hand. You wonder if there is really no other way to stop the \"Master Plan\" left, until you notice the elevator door next to you. Upon closer observation, you noticed a electric box of sorts close to the lifts. By chance, you might be able to fix the lifts and head to the rooftop without having to run anymore. There are risks of being electocuted or sabotaging the lifts even more, but the decision is up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Yamamoto brothers hold off the zombified student horde to allow Yuriko to rest, what will you do?</span></div></div>",

You flipped through the wires (without being electrocuted) to check for problems. You had some knowledge with these from your previous science project, but you had not done anything like this. After 5 minutes of looking around, you were still unable to locate the source of the problem until you saw one unplugged wire. You wanted to kick yourself for missing that, but you hurriedly picked up the wire (it felt like lifting a sofa) and plugged it into the lone empty socket. Within seconds, you could hear power surges all around, and you could hear rumbling sounds from the elevator shafts. It's fixed, you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rushed back out, and went back to your friends. You tugged at Yuriko's finger, and when she saw you, you pointed at the lifts, indicating that it had been fixed. Yuriko nodded, and picked you up and placed you back on her palm. There was no time to pick up the Yamamoto brothers, so they had to cling onto Yuriko's socks while she headed to the open lift, and quickly pushed the button to the top floor, and luckily for you guys, the doors closed before any of the zombified students could enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PHEW! That was close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko heaved a sigh of relief, and picked up the Yamamoto brothers hanging onto her socks and placing them with you on her palm. All 4 of you know that it was still not over yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived at the top floor, which looked like a laboratory of sorts. You could see the Chairwoman working on a supercomputer of sorts, and making things worse, Hitomi and Shizuka are guarding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IF YOU WANT TO GET TO THE MACHINE, YOU HAVE TO GET THROUGH US FIRST!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GLADLY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three \"normal-sized\" girls then got into a catfight of their own, while the Yamamoto brothers joined in. Shizuka was about to slap Yuriko but stopped when she noticed Hiroshi on Yuriko's shoulder. Yuriko took the chance, and pushed Shizuka down on the floor. Hitomi went to help Shizuka up, while Yuriko placed you down onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki! Go! Only you can stop her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and you ran towards the Chairwoman and her supercomputer. You looked back, and you could see Yuriko trying to hold off Shizuka and Hitomi from giving chase. As you ran towards the machine, you had two options to stop her. You can slip in through the opening located at the bottom of the machine, or you can stop the Chairwoman herself by crawling into her clothes. Your call.</span></div></div>",

She ignored you, and returned to the supercomputer and resumed typing. Meanwhile, you found yourself buried inside bundles of electric wires again, but this time, you had to pull out the critical wire that will stop the machine from functioning altogether.

It was all or nothing for you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here goes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled the green wire with all your might, and after a while, it came off its place. For a while, you thought that your luck was out, but to your surprise, you could hear the machine powering down. Even as the Chairwoman desperately keys in the final codes into the program, it was too late. The supercomputer shuts down, and the program was effectively erased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had won ... for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to celebrate your triumph, but you could feel a major overload of power inside the supercomputer. If you stay too long, you would definitely get zapped. Hastily, you made your way out of the machine just in time. The massive overload from the supercomputer let off a major surge of power, which spreads across all over the building. Bolts of energy went darting in every direction. You were struck by a dart, but strangely, you found yourself feeling enlarged, and you did not stop until you were normal sized again. You don't know the logic behind it, but after seeing you enlarged, Hiroshi and Shuhei were also hit by the energy bolts, and likewise, returned back to normal size. As the massive power surge affected the entire building, you were very sure that everyone below had also returned bck to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove your heads, the massive cup-like structure began tocrumble under the massive power surge, and subsequently, blew itself up. The sound from the explosion was loud enough for you guys to hear it, and judging from the looks of Hitomi, Shizuka and the Chairwoman, it must have been critical to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! MY SHRINKING DEVICE! MY PSIONIC BEACON!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chairwoman looked helplessly as her precious machines destroyed themselves. After all that happened, she turned around, with a very angered look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ... YOU! You blew my chance to save the world! Now, you must pay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into her coat, she pulled out an odd pistol of sorts, and aimed it at you. It must be another one of their portable shrinking weapons, and you wondered how many of those they have made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! You're going to shrink me again!\" You exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chairwoman simply smirked, and adjusted the dial the same way Shizuka did during your first encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shizuka's carbine can only shrink people, but mine here is advanced. It is capable of reducing the size of objects and people, and also enlarging them in the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran towards the closest open window, and prepares to jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you doing! Don't jump!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TOO LATE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her pistol around, and jumped off the window, firing the pistol in the process. As she disappeared down onto the pavements of the main street, you wondered if it was only a hoax. However, you heard a loud booming sound coming from the street level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked outside the window, and to your horror, you saw the Chairwoman herself, now at almost 200 ft tall, heading towards the tower!</span></div></div>",

Avoiding the loud sounds and the occassional rubble falling down, the four of you frantically raced down the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't escape me!\" The loud voice of the Chairwoman echoed above your heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge hand then came crashing down in front of you, accompanied by falling bits of rubble, and her palm almost flattened you had you been caught. However, the damage to the tower had been done, and the walls around started to crumble. Cracks appeared on the staircase, and even your footing is becoming very unstable.

The three of you picked the three closest \"Oni\" mechs and climbed inside.

Check me out!\" Shuhei's voice followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time to admire ourselves! We have to get out of here!\" You said. You could hear some groaning from Shuhei, but the brothers followed behind you. You walked towards the main exit, but as you got close, rubble began falling at the main ramp, trapping you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hell no! Not this!\" you exclaimed. \"Oh, I'm so mad, I'll ... I'll ... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZZAP!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour anger caused the mech to fire a beam of sort from its eyes, melting part of the rubble pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOA! Hiroki! What did you do!\" Hiroshi exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I just focused my anger on my eyes, and then ... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZZAP!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I just found this thing's main weapon. Hiroshi! Shuhei! Focus your eyes onto the rubble pile! Just do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had their doubts, but in no time, the three mechs were firing beam lasers that melted the rubble pile completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK! Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three mechs then exited the basement carpark (partially destroying part of the ramp in the process), and strided their way to face the giantess in the city. Even though your mechs were the size of a small house, the Chairwoman was still much bigger than you guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you managed to actually pilot those mechs in the basement! No matter, I'll stomp you guys flat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA battle broke out in the now ruined streets, a single giantess facing three toy-sized \"to her perspective\" mechs. The giantess has the size advantage, but the mechs were able to avoid most of her \"slapping\" attacks and the occassional stomps. The mechs fired their eye lasers at the giantess, but at her size, her skin was now thick as ever. The fight was effectively a stalemate, until the giantess started lifting her right foot, and prepares for a mega stomp. As her foot falls down, did you manage to avoid it?</span></div></div>",

The three of you managed to avoid being stepped on, but some of the rubble from the stomp went airborne and struck your mechs. Being one with the mech also meant that whatever happens to it, you are affected as well. A piece of rubble struck the head of your mech, and you felt a painful bump on a similar spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could barely see the giantess' face, but you could tell that she was smirking. Without warning, she removed her foot from the floor, and imagine your surprise when she kicked all three of you down like pins. The three of you crashed down heavily on the floor, and naturally, you could feel the pain on your backs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha! Poor, pathetic fools!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour back reels from the pain, and the fact that she's rubbing it in only made it worse.

Yuriko brushed it aside, but also noticed the pistol that the Chairwoman had ditched after transforming her into a giantess. Yuriko picked it up, and saw that it was still working. She could use the pistol on the Chairwoman and shrink her again, but she might be stepped on if she tried. Then again, she could use the pistol on herself and join the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was not much time left as much of the city was being destroyed.

You had barely got back on your feet in your mech, while Hiroshi was still helping Shuhei up. Even with your combined strength and technology stolen from her, she still had the upper hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you give up, Hiroki Iketani? You're better off accepting your punishment than continuing this pathetic struggle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you had been taunted quite often at school, mainly by Shizuka and Hitomi, you were already reaching a boiling point. Angered, you fired another heat ray from the mech's eyes upwards, to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pathetic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chairwoman simply raised her palm and easily stopped the attack, and judging from the look on her face, she barely even felt anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done? Now it's my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of you could only wait in fear as the 200ft tall giantess delivered her statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant shoe slammed down a few meters away from you, taking the three of you by surprise. You looked up, hoping that it was not another enemy, and you could see a pair of towering legs that disappear inside a plait skirt. You noticed the pinkish-white panties inside the skirt, and you knew who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y ... Yuriko! How on ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D ... don't look at me like that, Hiroki! I'm embarrassed too at this size. I'm not going to be the one delivering your corpses to your parents later, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter now, Yuriko! Honestly, I'm glad you showed up. Now, let's take this other giantess down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chairwoman did not seem fazed at the arrival of this \"newcomer\", though she did feel irritated at being interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you used my resizing pistol ... so what? It only means that I have to punish one more person anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chairwoman and Yuriko attempted to attack each other, and failed. After a few missed punches and avoiding being tripped multiple times over, the two eventually ended up in a slapfight of sorts, with each girl slapping the other on the cheek, and vice versa. The three of you could only stare at this rather embarrassing catfight going on in the city, but as the fight goes on, you noticed that Yuriko had actually hurt the Chairwoman, as evidenced by the multiple bruises on her body, but mostly on her face. Seeing a chance, you fired a heat laser at one of the wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OUCH!!! Who did that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chairwoman yelled out in pain, and noticed you. Immediately identifying you as the one who shot her, she raised her left foot, and tried to step on you, but you managed to avoid it before the shoe slams down on the floor. On the other hand, the Chairwoman's skin was not as tough anymore now that she had sustained bruises, and even one of those is an opening for your heat lasers. You wasted no time to deliver this news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuriko! I know you don't like it, but keep attacking her with whatever you got. Hiroshi-san, Shuhei, target your lasers at her bruises and wounds! Hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four of you went forward into your strategy to bring down the Chairwoman and stop her rampage.

It was a hard-fought battle, but eventually, Yuriko delivered one final slap on her face, causing her to fall straight down onto the ground with a massive thud. The four of you had done it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could celebrate your victories, you could see the Chairwoman's fallen body getting smaller and smaller, as if the growth ray effect had worn off. You were still worried, so you exited your mech and rushed forward to have a look. The Chairwoman herself was still alive, though severely hurt from the fall. You rushed to her side, and held her close. Shizuka and Hitomi then appeared, seemingly from their hiding spot. Shizuka was visibly mad at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki Iketani! What have you done! You flattened much of the city, and injured the Chairwoman! Why I outta ... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could slap you, the Chairwoman grabbed her arm, and gently lowered it, despite being hurt so badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Shizuka-chan.\" She said with a weak voice. \"I caused the destruction, not him. Blame it on me if you have to. Besides, you are showing disrespect to me by slapping Iketani-san here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Hiroshi asked. He and Shuhei had too left their mechs to have a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess an explanation is in order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what you have to, Chairwoman Mizuki.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stop calling me that now. That name was just an alias. My real name is Hanako Iketani, and I came from 50 years in the future. Hiroki Iketani-san is my grandfather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gasped in shock about this revealation, including yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ... you're my granddaughter from the future?\" You asked with skeptism and shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I am. The world 50 years later is a horrible place. The human population had exploded to over 1 trillion people, and there was very little space left on the planet to support the boom. Stronger nations resorted to invading and destroying entire populations to solve their own space problems. Japan was not spared either, and almost 90% of our population were simply destroyed. My grandfather and I were the only survivors of the genocide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! I'm sorry to hear about that.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were sorry about the loss of our population, so you came up with a radical plan: shrinking the entire human population so we can solve the space problem later. However, since it was already too late in my era, Oji-san (grandfather) decided to put the plan in action 50 years ago, with similar technological expertise. Due to his advancing age, I had to put his Master Plan into action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I came up with the Master Plan? I wanted to shrink the population?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you did. I was lucky to inherit your intelligence, so I was able to plan the mergers of schools to conceal the secret labs and plans, and the tower there serves as a red herring (to fool the different bureaus) and the main beacon to trigger the shrink beam. The plan was already in place, and before you intervened, the only thing left was to trigger the beacon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That still did not explain why you tried to 'punish' me when I thrawted your plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda lost it then. The thought that I was unable to save our future and the fact that you were trying to stop the plan YOU came up with pushed me over the edge. Oji-san told me to contact his earlier self, but I guess I kinda got carried away with planning and completing his plan to realize you were my grandfather all this time. I only knew when Shizuka said your name, but if I told you then, you would probably say I'm absurd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled a little, but then stopped due to her injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Master Plan had failed, and it appears that the tragedy of the future is unavoidable. I don't know how to face Oji-san when I get back ... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears started rolling down her cheek. Seeing Hanako so sad strangely breaks your heart, since she IS your granddaughter of the future. You gently wiped the tears off her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be fine, Hanako-chan. Despite the dark and terrible future which you described, I'm sure we can handle it. After all, we have 50 years to think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical Oji-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she started to smile, you notice her body starting to fade away. You were still holding her in your arms, but it looks like she is literally vanishing into thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanako-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK. My time here is done, and I must return to my era 50 years later. Shizuka, Hitomi, it has been nice knowing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitomi was sobbing at the sight, while Shizuka was clearly trying to hold back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oji-san. I know it would be rude to say this, but take care of yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could no longer feel her weight on your hands. Although she had answered most of your questions, there was still 1 more nagging question in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! One more question: if I'm your grandfather, who is your grandmother then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you know her very well ... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she vanished completely. She was no longer in your arms. You stared blankly at where she last laid down, but said nothing. Everyone stared blankly at what just happened, but said nothing. There was no explanation at what just happened.</span></div></div>",

It was reported in the news that Marunouchi (the district where the fight took place) suffered a massive earthquake, but surprisingly, no casualties. The district itself is undergoing reparations, with much of the finances being contributed from an unknown source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn school, it went on as per normal, though Shizuka had notably changed, her not being mean was a change. The shrink ray that was fired on the first day appeared to be temporary as opposed to the permanant shrink ray intended for the Master Plan, and most of the \"victims\" appear to be cured, though side effects remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were at the Department of Investigations to give your statement. The Japanese Self-Defense Forces were alerted of the mayhem caused a week ago, and you were at the center of it all, but you were lucky to be interrogated by this particular officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that's my story, sir. All of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it was anybody else, they would have dismissed you as crazy and probably did something else to you. You lucky I'm part of the 'crazies'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is going to happen to all that technology left behind in the school building, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This crazy university professor named Fukujima has taken a keen interest in it, and is willing to pay a fortune to acquire them. Normally, we would have denied him, but we decided to make an exception this time, given the footage of the mechs you guys used in the fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short pause, his tone became more formal as he gives his verdict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki Iketani! You are hereby cleared of this entire matter. The Marunouchi Incident and the Shrinking Incidents in your school are now classified as \"Non-Existant\", and no mention of it must be made. Including yourself and your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, you are free to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the interrogation office, and pulled out your cellphone. There was still one more \"problem\" to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Yuriko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki-kun! So, how did it go? The interrogation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The incidents are now non-existant, and we are not allowed to talk about it. Including you too, Yuriko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see. Are you still in the building?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm on my way out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on! Wait for me! I'm coming to pick you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLICK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited at the corridor of the JSDF Investigations Building for Yuriko, when you felt tremors and heard loud stomping sounds. Before long, a pair of huge fingers opened the window, and you knew your \"ride\" had arrived. You climbed onto the fingers, and made your way to Yuriko's giant palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuriko! Came to pick me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now let's go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko was still a giantess after a week, as it seems that the growth ray she used on herself was a permanent one. You adamently refused the military's offer to hurt her, which explains why she was still 200ft tall after all this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your parents don't mind your size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll never know. It will be at least another month before they return from their business trips. Besides, I kind of like it being this tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard from Shizuka and Hitomi that there may BE a way to revert you back to normal. They were working on something called \"VX gas\", which can nullify the effects of both the growth and shrink ray, but then again, I am still finding it hard to trust them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can wait, Hiroki-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we go home, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko then walked towards western Tokyo, careful to avoid stepping on anything, especially vehicles. On her palm, you comfortably watched the view as the two of you made your way home, awaiting your next adventure ... if there is one waiting for you, of course.</span></div></div>",

You were not sure why she was not taking damage despite throwing everything you guys have at her. Each time Yuriko threw a punch or slap, the spot always seem to disappear after a while. The same is true wherever Yuriko struck (minus the groin, as Yuriko finds it dishonorable), the Chairwoman simply shrugged it aside like nothing happened. For Yuriko's case, this was not true, and as Yuriko continued to get abused by the Chairwoman, standing alone became a struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Yuriko finally could not take it anymore, and collapsed onto the ruined district, full of bruises and cuts. You wanted to aid Yuriko, but the worst was not over yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for you pesky boys!\" The Chairwoman said, and with a quick swipe, she grabbed Shuhei's mech, and lifted it to her chest level. In the next instant, she hurled the mech (with Shuhei) at the nearby electric pylon, and the mech landed in a mess of electrical wires. The impact caused the power levels in the mech to surge to dangerous levels, and from your interface, you watched in horror as Shuhei got electrocuted in the most terrible of ways. After that, you and Hiroshi watched in horror as Shuhei's lifeless mech plummeted onto the ground below, and crashed into multiple parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiroshi snapped after seeing his younger brother get killed, and in a frenzy, he rushed towards the Chairwoman's giant feet. The normally calm and composed Hiroshi made the biggest mistake of his life by charging forward, unaware that the Chairwoman's other foot was already hovering above him. Her foot then crashed down on Hiroshi's mech like how a person would crush an ant under his foot. Hiroshi was pinned down under the heavy weight of the Chairwoman, but it did not end there. The Chairwoman then proceeded to twist her foot ... with Hiroshi's mech underneath as well. Hiroshi was grinded to death as his mech began to tear apart under the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew you were next, but how the Chairwoman decided to deal with you is up to speculation. You stood there, awaiting whatever terrible fate she has planned for you. She reached down and grabbed your mech, you being too scared to even move. She then proceeded to fiddle her finger around your mech, releasing you out of the console, and in the next moment, her fingers found you and picked you out of the mech. You were trapped between her fingers, while she hurled the mech away. She calmly picked up the abandoned beam gun, and started shrinking herself ... with you still in her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was back to normal size, while you were now the size of an insect. It seems that she had the most cruel and unusual punishment reserved for you. She calmly walked toward Yuriko's fallen body, and entered Yuriko's skirt. She calmly climbed up Yuriko's left leg, and went towards her pinkish-white panties. Without hesitation, she lifted up the soft fabric, revealing Yuriko's pubic hair and parts of her pussy. She then proceeded to throw you right in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last word you ever heard from the Chairwoman, as she simply walked away from Yuriko's fallen body and out of your life. You were now permanently trapped in Yuriko's pussy hair, whether you like it or not. It was not long before the Self-Defense Forces arrived, and had Yuriko's body restrained and transported back. You wanted to scream and shout to the soldiers \"handling\" Yuriko, but you were simply too small. Even if you could get their attention, you would still be like an insect to them anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bodies of the Yamamoto brothers (Hiroshi and Shuhei) were never recovered, while Yuriko was pinned as \"The giantess that rampaged through Marunouchi\", and held in permanent custody in a secret location in Japan, still as a giantess. Your parents and Reiko tried in vain to look for you, unaware at where you are: trapped inside Yuriko's pussy hairs the size of an microscopic being to Yuriko.</span></div></div>",

I just don't know why it failed to work on the Chairwoman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the truth, Hiroki-kun. I'm going to meet up with you guys now. Later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to dissuade her, but she had already hung up. You got back to \"action\", as the Chairwoman picked up Shuhei's mech, and slammed him right back down onto the floor. Hiroshi went to check on his brother, leaving you alone to deal with the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! This is bad! I just wish I had something for a reference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you said that, you feel a gadget of sorts being placed over your right eye, like the onesfound in sci-fi manga. Immediately after that, data started displaying on the crystal panel, before showing you the contents of what it found. You did not know what it was, but at this time, any help is welcome, so you read the data. Meanwhile, Yuriko had just caught up with you guys, with the beam pistol still in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki-kun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuriko!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to hug her, but at this time, it would not be a wise decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuriko. I know why it did not work! The laser is simply not powerful enough to penetrate her thick skin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how to stop her, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, yes. This strange device beside my right eye and ear had given me two solutions. While her skin might be thick, it is still vulnerable, and if we can cause enough damage to cause a wound, you can try and shrink her down by firing at the open wound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go, then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! There is another solution. There is this strange chemical called \"VX\", and it is said to be able to nullify the effects of the shrink and growth ray. There is a missile inside this mech that contains the VX warhead. The only problem is that if I use the missile, I might destroy much of the city, since it IS contained in a warhead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do, then? I'll support you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoose.</span></div></div>",

You must take the shot once the three of us wound her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko nodded, and quickly rushed to a nearby pile of rubble, waiting for a chance. Meanwhile, Hiroshi had helped his brother up back to his feet. The mech was damaged, but was still capable of fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroshi-san! Shuhei! Fire at the Chairwoman's right leg. We have to do this together. This is the only chance we are ever going to get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of the Chairwoman's left foot crashing down mere meters away quickly convinced the Yamamoto brothers of your plan. Quickly, you used the inbuilt console to relay the co-ordinates for the three of you to fire your melting lasers. By a stroke of luck, there was a scratch on the Chairwoman's left leg, which might have been received when rubble started falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Target that scratch, guys! Together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, the three mechs then started firing the melting laser at the Chairwoman's scratch. It worked, and the wound is opening. Unfortunately, the Chairwoman is also feeling the pain from the scratch getting bigger. Realizing the danger, she moved her hand towards her left leg, in an effort to cover up the wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko! Now! Do it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese words screamed inside your head, and Yuriko, wither through instinct or mind reading powers, saw her chance, and came out of hiding. Running towards the giantess, Yuriko fired the cold laser towards the wound, as the Chairwoman's massive hand within position to close the scratch wound. Did the beam succeed?</span></div></div>",

It may be our only chance against her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko stayed slient for a while, but then returned with her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" ... OK, if that is what you want. The VX warhead is contained inside your mech.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Yuriko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then proceeded to access the mech's computer system, and you found the location of the VX warhead. With your fast typing skills, you worked through the program to arm and prepare the co-ordinates to fire the missile. The prime location will be the Chairwoman's face, as according to the data you received, the VX gas must enter the bloodstream if it wants to start nullifying the effects. As Shuhei and Hiroshi continued to struggle, you were going for your only shot against the giantess to bring her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBEEP! BEEP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was ready to fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HIROSHI-SAN! SHUHEI! YURIKO! STAND BACK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two mechs immediately pulled off, while the world watched as you fire the VX missile right into the face of the Chairwoman. The few seconds of the missile in flight was the quietest and most critical moment that could end the giantess' rampage or just a last desperate gasp for survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe missile blew up right in the Chairwoman's face, taking her aback, and causing her to cough endlessly upon impact. After that, she saw the smoke coming from your mech, and immediately went for another foot stomp. She barely managed to step on you, but it still caused your mech to lose balance and crash down. You bellowed out in pain, as your mech landed like an upturned turtle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you could see the Chairwoman getting smaller and smaller. The VX gas is starting to take effect. The look on the Chairwoman's face was that of irony, as it was one of her inventions that had brought her down. You managed to get the mech back up on its feet, just in time as the Chairwoman shrinks back down to her normal height. Did she stop there?</span></div></div>",

Everyone who did not escape during the fighting began to gather around the girl who had caused all this destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Yuriko by your side, you slowly made your way towards the Chairwoman, and you could see her, battered and bruised. You would expect her to curse out another insult at you, but to your surprise, you could see tears flowing down her bruised face.

I cannot explain how or why, I just do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then feel a hand touching your face, and you could see that the Chairwoman was touching your face. Strangely, it feels like the Chairwoman was fading away, as if disappearing into thin air. Her entire body started de-materializing, notably as you could no longer feel her weight on your hands. As she faded away, you could see her smile at you, tears still rolling down her face. She did not say anything, except for one last whisper before she finally faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Grandpa ... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had completely faded away, and only a small piece of paper was left. As you finally regained some of your consciousness, you picked up the piece of paper, and it turns out to be a letter of sorts, and strangely, it was written to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are reading this, then my mission has failed. Please forgive me, but I do not want to shock everyone about my true intentions. I am actually a time-traveller from 50 years in the future, and \"Mizuki\"is only an alias, named after my favorite idol. My true name is Hanako Iketani, and I was supposed to contact my grandfather of the past to carry out his \"Master Plan\", a plan to shrink the world's population down to avoid the consequences of a world with nearly 3 trillion people. I had set up hidden facilities underneath the old girls' school, and recruited honor roll students, but over time, the group got intoxicated with the advanced technologies I had brought with me. I thought that by using a front to merge schools through an M&amp;A scheme, I can get more help, but it seems that even I had strayed. I am sorry to all those whose lives I had wrecked. I am sorry to those that I had led astray. Most importantly, I am sorry to my grandfather, both the past and the present. Please, use the technologies I had left behind for good use. My grandfather and I will have it no other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n - Hanako\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was still in slight shock over the revelation (you narrated the letter), and for a while, nobody uttered a word. It was Shizuka that eventually broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the Chair ... Hanako was sent here to prevent an overpopulation disaster. Why didn't she tell us before? It also shocks me that Hanako is related to ... of all people, Iketani.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. It shocks me too.\" You replied. \"All these years of being mean, and you were working with my plan with my granddaughter. What has this world come to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizuka stayed silent for a while, and said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do recall her telling me we were going to save the world when I joined her secret technology club, but it seems that I too got intoxicated with revenge and humiliation. Hiroki, I am ... sorry ... for the times I have mistreated you and nearly ... stepped on you ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is all right, Kinugawa-san. I forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a distance, you could hear the sound of heavy vehicles approaching. You know that the Self-Defense Forces have been alerted, and now they are here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys. Let's get out of here before they catch us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded, and each one of you went your separate ways.</span></div></div>",

After days of interrogation, the Self-Defense Forces decided to confiscate every high-tech item from your school, with a promise to reverse-engineer it. Shizuka and Hitomi, being prime suspects behind the incident, were sentenced to 240 hours of community service, and fined for their role in \"causing widespread panic and damage to property\". The Yamamoto brothers, Yuriko and yourself were all let off with a warning, and allowed to continue with your lives in exchange for your silence in the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at school, it functioned like nothing even happened, even though the Self-Defense Forces had blown up every last trace of the underground facilities. Most of the shrunken students were returned back to normal, each one with no memory of being shrunk. The rest of your school life continued on, with no mention of the giantess incident ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 years later, the incident had become an \"icon\" in pop culture, with Korean film companies making their own parody movies in an attempt to 1-UP us. Parodies like \"Giantess in Seoul\", \"Giantess in Shanghai\" and even \"Giantess in New York\" became bestsellers at the box office. Shuhei and Mikako's relationship was going strong, and Shuhei intends to propose to her soon. Hiroshi entered the Superbike Grand Prix, and won the \"Best Rookie Award\" in his debut season, with intent to win the championship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Yuriko ...\" You said, taking a stroll at a park with your fiance. \"Our wedding is in a month, and all the preparations are already done. Reiko is intent on baking the best wedding cake, while Shizuka and Hitomi have agreed to attend the wedding despite their busy schedule in the US.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed, Hiroki.\" Yuriko said. \"The clumsy guy I knew is now on the cover of \"Innovation\" magazine, the premier magazine for the brightest minds. I have no regrets with settling down with you. I know that I had made the right choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, unable to hold back blushing. Yuriko had grown into a stunning beauty, and even though you were decent looking, you still feel that your appearance may not fit with Yuriko's beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no regrets either, Yuriko. I am about to have Tokyo's most beautiful journalist as my bride, but something's still missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, ten years ago, the incident ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko pointed her finger at you, but remained smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you are thinking, Hiroki.\" Her tone then turned serious. \"You want a giantess bride, right? I don't mind, but how are you going to do it without arousing suspicion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled back, but answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have my methods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you then shared a passionate kiss as the sun sets. While you two kissed, your mind was filled with your recent breakthrough. You have managed to replicate the shrink ray once again despite the destruction of all blueprints 10 years ago.

However, before you could do so, you could see her get smaller again. At first, you were taken aback, but when the Chairwoman reached the height of a child, you started to panic a little. It seems the VX gas you exposed her to still was not fully tested yet. Regardless, you climbed out of your mech, and rushed towards the Chairwoman, still shrinking as you made your way towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chairwoman was now at the exact same height you were in after the past few hours. You, Hiroshi, Shuhei and Yuriko all stood around her, like massive skyscrapers blocking out her view of the sky. You could barely make out what the now tiny Chairwoman was saying, but she seems very scared, too frightened to even move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so tough now, Chairwoman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko crouched down to have a look, before she picked up the tiny Chairwoman with her fingers. She lifted her up towards her face. The Chairwoman went from frightened to outright frustration, kicking and screaming, even as she was powerless against a much taller Yuriko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you suggest, boys? Put her in a cage or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one said a word. Not even you. Despite what all the Chairwoman had done to you, you still knew how it felt to be tiny and at the mercy of giantesses all this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you let me see my granddaughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn oddly familiar voice came from behind you guys, and all four of you turned around to have a look. There stood two people: one old man in a lab coat, with white hair and glasses. The other was a woman, best described as a fully grown up and mature image of Yuriko. The two of them then headed towards Yuriko. As they came towards you, you decided to just let them pass. The woman the stretched her hand out, as if telling Yuriko to hand the tiny Chairwoman to her. Yuriko was hesitant, but the woman nodded, and Yuriko did likewise. Surprisingly, the tiny Chairwoman did not resist as she was laid on the woman's palm, even as the old man went to have a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems I have miscalculated with my Master Plan.\" The old man said gingerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait ... your Master Plan? Who are you, old man?\" You finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man turned to you, but simply paused for a while before he finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is good to see you, Hiroki Iketani.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got shocked. This is an old man whom you have never met, yet he knows your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK ... this is getting weird ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man then continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Hiroki Iketani. I am you ... 50 years later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not believe this relevation that the old man standing in front of you is indeed your future self, but the older Hiroki simply reached in his lab coat, and pulled out a portable flatscreen (or something), and pressed a few times on it. After that, some holographic images appeared from the screen. The images were not pleasant, displaying what appears to be a scene from an apocalyptic movie. Ruined buildings, bodies all over the floor, occasional sounds of shouting, chopping and gunfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A world with three trillion people ... and not enough space to keep them all. People started fighting among themselves to secure a living. This is the world, 50 years from now. It pains me to see people fighting and dying to etch out a living, especially since ... I lost the love of my life to these riots ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man turned to have a look at Yuriko, as if remembering some good memories of the past. You raised an eyebrow, but said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is why I sent my granddaughter back, and to put my Master Plan into action, namely shrinking down the world's population so we have more time to prepare for the inevitable space problem. Before she left, I did ask her to contact my earlier self, but ... it seems I have miscalculated. She got sent 60 years back. I would have been a pre-schooler then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man chuckled. After a brief laugh, he turned towards you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have said many things, but it's all the truth. As for my granddaughter, I'll let my Yuka handle her.\" The older Hiroki pointed to the other woman, who does resemble Yuriko a lot., only much older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, now I have seen everything ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko said, looking at Yuka, with the tiny Chairwoman still resting in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will grow up to be like that, Yuriko-chan. Trust me on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man winked. Then, he turned right back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be taking my granddaughter back with me now, and restore her size proper. However, to my younger self, I have spoken the truth, and I have provided you with all the resources necessary for the Master Plan to proceed. Now, the decision ... is yours. Let's go, Yuka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuka nodded, and went to the old man Hiroki's side. The old man Hiroki then pulled out another gadget from his lab coat, a silver stopwatch, or what appears to be. The older Hiroki simply turned a few knobs, and in a flash, they simply vanished, leaving the four of you behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you stand within a ruined Marunouchi, and it will not be long before the Self Defense Forces arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki. Before we go, I need to ask you this question.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you intend to do now, after hearing ... well, your older self's ... words ... Do you want to go ahead with this Master Plan thing or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you guys suggest?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the outlook 50 years later seems grim, and although it sounds radical, maybe shrinking the world's population down could buy us some time before the inevitable, hopefully we would have a solution by then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuriko?\" You turned to her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK ... I'm still a little freaked out with seeing an older Hiroki, especially after giving me that look, but ... although this is something I believe Hiroki will think of, present or future, but I think shrinking the world's population down is not the right thing to do. I mean, the girls who knew of this plan got intoxicated with power and advanced technology. I refuse to live in a world where people are dominated by their sizes. That ... includes not having me as your personal giantess to play with, Hiroki.:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe decision that could change the world, both present and 50 years later, is up to you now. What will it be?</span></div></div>",

No more war correspondence videos from now on.\" A older male voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young lady just got up and went into her room, not even turning around to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, I think you are being a little too harsh on Hanako.\" Another female voice came into the picture. \"You know, I think she may have Mom's genes after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh, I sure miss the days when I was younger.\" The old voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know.\" The female voice answered. \"Here, Dad.\" A young woman in her late 30s hands you the newspaper. Taking the newspaper, you opened the pages, and started reading it. After a while, you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do people always have to fight and kill each other over space? For crying out loud, the planet's only asset is its boundaries.\" You lamented. \"Even if we shrink ourselves down, people are still going to fight and kill each other anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then started coughing. Old age had taken a toll on your health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, you should take care of yourself.\" The young woman said, rushing towards your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about listening to your daughter for once, Hiroki?\" Another female voice said, this one much older than before. It was an old woman, who slowly stumbled into the room, with a cane in her left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuriko, you should be inside resting!\" You suddenly got up, and rushed to your wife's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep telling me to rest, Hiroki. How about you do the same as well?\" Old woman Yuriko retorted. \"Ever since we got married, you had dedicated your entire life into the space colonization program. Now that Earth is finally free of its overcrowding problem, you deserve a break. Yuka is already doing so well in your footsteps. You can trust our daughter to carry on your work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh ... you win, Yuriko.\" You said. \"Even after you retired from your journalist life, you can still provide a strong and solid argument.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you both just sit down and enjoy some peace and quiet instead?\" Yuka said, her hands resting on two single seat couches, one on each hand. \"Mom on this side. Dad, the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly helped his wife towards one of the couches, and together with his daughter, gently placed her down on it. After that, you also took his place on the other  couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, perfect.\" Yuka said, satisfied with the sight in front of her. \"Now, I will leave you two while I attend to Hanako. I'll try and calm her down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuka left the living room, and went after her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Yuriko, I never thought that after all these years, I will still be with you.\" You said, turning to face your wife. \"Perhaps Yuka was right, maybe I should be slowing down and catching up on the time we had lost. Me on the space program, and you on your journalist career.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both need to slow down.\" Yuriko answered. \"I may not have the looks that I used to have any more, but my love for you is still strong after all these years. I knew I had chosen the right man to be with for the rest of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As do I, Yuriko.\" You said. \"Besides the decision to now shrink everyone, I have never regretted the decision to marry you and start our family. In fact, I may even call them the two best decisions I have ever made in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you.\" Yuriko said, as she placed her hand just slightly beside yours. Without hesitation, you placed your hand over hers, the love between you two having not wavered even after five decades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best decision of my life.\" You said to yourself as you enjoyed the peace and quiet that you have worked hard to achieve without relying on the shrinking technology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Peaceful Ending)</span></div></div>",

Although it seems crazy to face a giantess head on, there really might be no other way. The Chairwoman turns her head around, and sees you approach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU WON'T STOP ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns her full body away from the supersomputer and faces you head on. She lifts her foot, and goes for a stomp, which you managed to dodge after all the \"practise\" you had.  She tried again, but the result was the same. After a few failed stomp attempts, she's had enough, and reached her hand and tried to grab you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited for her hand to get dangerously close to you before you dodged. Normally, this would have been a foolish move, but you needed her to bring her hand down for whatever you had planned. Her hand slammed down on the floor, which you took the chance to climb up, and into her sleeve. Before she could react, you hurriedly climbed up her forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! QUIT IT! I'M TICKLISH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave away her weakness, you thought to yourself. Originally, you had planned to use her body as leverage to get to the supercomputer, but now you have a better (and somewhat perverted) idea. From her forearm, you climbed your way up towards her shoulder, and then towards her neck. Wherever you climb, it felt very ticklish to the Chairwoman, who could not stop laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHAHAHAHAHA! NOT FAIR! AHAHAHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her loud voice, you went straight down onto her chest, and landed between her breasts, which were not that big in comparison to Yuriko or Shizuka. Using her bra as leverage, you held onto the lacey material, and slowly edged your way towards her back. The design of your school's uniform made it hard for a person to simply rip open their clothes, so you were quite safe from the Chairwoman attempting to grab you. You bypassed her other arm, and by crawling past her armpit, your hair inadvertedly touched another sensitive spot, causing her to laugh out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHH! NOT THERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew it was a matter of time before she could not take more of this, so you decided to capitalize. You slid down her back (very carefully) and caught the rim of her panties before you fell straight out. From there, you made your way around again, back to the \"front\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, your weight almost caused you to pull her panties down, although just slightly, but she certainly felt it, and closed her legs together, unable to move of sorts. If you want to stop her, maybe crawling inside her panties may be justified, but then again, pulling her panties down where you are might just be threat you need. Your call.</span></div></div>",

The smell inside the shoe was less than pleasant, but you had to go deeper as you can see Shizuka's socked foot hovering above you, ready to slip in. You ran until you reached the toe of the shoe, and with that, trapping you inside her shoe until heaven knows when.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizuka then started walking again, causing you to get bumped about inside the shoe. Your face also got into contact with Shizuka's sock, which smelled terrible. Trapped in a stinky enviroment with your \"mistress\" in total control, this was going to be the rest of your life, it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she went home, and inside her room, she finally removed her shoes.

If you even think about getting out of my shoes, you are going to get it! Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder her threat, you gently nodded your head, and Shizuka then left you alone. Gasping for fresh air, you could only imagine what would happen if you defied her back there. Slouching back into the giant loafer, you patiently waited until a perfect time to move. From a far distance, you could hear Shizuka's loud giggling.

Still very worried, you managed to escape your prison, as if you were given a boost of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was Shuhei, who too made his escape to rescue his brother. However, the successful escape made you realize how small you were, and even if you reached Shizuka, what were you going to do then? You wanted to turn back, and crawl back into the shoe, but from the distance, Shizuka's half-naked body sat up from her bed, and making things worse, she sees the both of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU CREEPS! YOU'RE TRYING TO ESCAPE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late. Even if you were to scramble back into her shoe, it would be all for nothing. You tried to run away, but you could hear the loud thumps of Shizuka's feet, louder with every step. Eventually, she managed to pin you both under her socked feet. Not only was she heavy, since much of the weight was pinned on her feet, but the socks also stank. Being pinned underneath a stinky sock was never a feasible thing, regardless of size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAD ENOUGH?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed her foot away and dropped it down beside you with a loud thump.

She reached for a pistol of sorts on her desk, and aimed it right at you. Before long, she shot you with the powerful beam, and you find yourself getting smaller and smaller. Shizuka's foot now felt like the size of an amphitheater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, you saw Shizuka's massive finger picking you up, and you braced yourself for her \"punishment\".

If Reiko took twenty minutes, then you can assume Yuriko was going to take as long, probably longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay back on the desk, staring at the ceiling, awaiting Yuriko's return. The blank ceiling resembled the screen of those projector screens at school, and you started to imagine images on the ceiling. Of course, the only thought you had was Yuriko. Although she had grown considerably, she had always kept her hair short, decorated with a similar pink hairband. The pink hairband, as you remembered, was a gift from her father when he got promoted, shortly before her parents started traveling a lot. If not for your father agreeing to be her legal guardian while her folks were away, you might not be here right now. Even though you were not her boyfriend, it seems like fate had a strange way of keeping you two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko's growth. The moment that thought entered your mind, you remembered just a few days ago, you accidentally stumbled into Reiko's room, where your sister and Yuriko were changing. Yuriko always seemed to like the color pink, as even her bra and panties were pink. Although it was only a glimpse before Reiko threw a pillow at you to get you out, your mind started imagining Yuriko wearing that same bra and panties. You flustered at the thought of that, and you placed your hands on your nose. Luckily, there was no nosebleed, but the image of Yuriko wearing only her undies was just not easy to just shake off. The perverted side of you started to focus on Yuriko's bosom, and how they bounded about while you were in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that instant, you got up, trying to snap out of the perverted trance you almost fell into. You looked at the clock on Yuriko's desk, and to your disappointment, only ten minutes have passed. The boredom of staying on your childhood friend's desk with only a cartoon character on a mug for company was starting to bother you. After imagining Yuriko in only her undies, you started to get tempted to leave the desk to find Yuriko in the shower. At the same time, the longer you stayed here, you have no idea how many more perverted thoughts of Yuriko might flood your minds. I'm not that kind of person, you thought to yourself, but the image of Yuriko in her undies remained imprinted in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do now?</span></div></div>",

Although you have reservations about this teacher and her offer, you decided to take a risk and try out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKijima-sensei smiled at you, but said nothing. After that, she turned around and walked towards her medicine cabinet. She opened it, and started rummaging through the plastic bottles and other apparatus inside. She took out about three bottles, each containing a liquid of a different color. She then took out an empty test tube, headed towards the nearest sink, and started pouring the liquids, carefully, into the test tube one after the other. Her back was turned towards you, but you could tell she was being very careful, lest something happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, she turned around to face you, with the test tube filled with some brownish liquid inside. She signaled you to stand up, which you did, and she slowly poured the liquid over you. There was no taste or smell, but the color of the liquid made you feel a little ill, not to mention that it stirred up some horrid memories when Shizuka and her clique pranked you by dumping a bucket of sludge over you as payback for beating her in a science quiz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might take a while for the liquid to be absorbed in your skin, so be patient.\" Kijima-sensei softly whispered. In your amazement, the liquid was no longer present, not even on your clothing. The liquid must be already been absorbed into your skin and clothing, you thought to yourself. You took a deep breath, and breathed out, hoping for something to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of waiting ...</span></div></div>",

Your potion is not working!\" You cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKijima-sensei had the confused look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange! It should have worked. This was the exact formula that restored my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some liquid left in the test tube, so Kijima-sensei reached down her desk, and pulled out one of her spare high heel shoes., and placed it next to you. At your current size, it looked like it could be the ideal house for you, if nobody wore it. Kijima-sensei poured whatever remains of the liquid onto the shoe. Just like you before, the liquid got absorbed really fast by the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine your shock when you saw the shoe get bigger before you. At Kijima-sensei's perspective, the shoe grew about 25% bigger, due to how little potion was used, but to you, it felt like a bungalow house just got upgraded into a two-floor house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it does work ...\" You and Kijima-sensei said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKijima-sensei looked at her enlarged shoe (knowing that she can never wear it again), and then at the now empty test tube. Then she turned her attention towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki-kun. Do you remember how you got so small?\" Kijima-sensei whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see ... \"You placed your hand underneath your chin, thinking about what had happened. \"There was this square that I stood, surrounded by four pillars on each side, all had some weird coils on it, capped by an orb that emitted electrical energy. For some reason, all four pillars shot out this strange lightning like energy bolts that struck me. It was pretty painful, and I did not remember much after being zapped. Next thing I knew, I was already this small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKijima-sensei took down the pointers you mentioned, but said nothing. As you finished explaining, she continued to look at the notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrinking through using electrical power ... \" She muttered. \"So that's why the growth potion failed to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKijima-sensei turned back towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki-kun. If you want to get back to normal, you have to use the same machine that zapped you to get back to normal.\" She said. \"The reason the potion failed was probably something that blocked the potion from taking effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Suddenly, you felt despair. There was no way you know how the machine worked, and even if there was, you might be too small to operate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Hiroki-kun. This is all I can help you.\" Kijima-sensei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat down in both exhaustion and disappointment, there were sounds of footsteps pounding along the corridor. Before long, two female student appeared at the door. One of them looked like she was not in good shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei! We have an emergency!\" The healthier female student exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKijima-sensei quickly placed her notebook over you, being careful not to crush you underneath. It was pitch dark underneath the notebook, but you could still catch a glimpse of what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Kijima-sensei asked the student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Haruna just suddenly collapsed on her desk! I was told to bring her to you.\" The student replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Place her down on the gurney over there. Careful now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student, named Haruna, was slowly placed onto the gurney reserved for sick students. Through your small peephole, you could see that she looked really flustered, and she was sweating profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can take it from here. You can return to class.\" Kijima-sensei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But ...\" The student protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go. Everything will be fine.\" Kijima-sensei insisted, gently but firmly. The student simply nodded, and left the sick room. Kijima-sensei then returned to the desk, and removed the notebook off your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, Hiroki-kun.\" Kijima-sensei said before returning to treat Haruna. You watched from your desk as Kijima-sensei slowly got to work examining Haruna. Then, as she started to remove Haruna's overcoat, you noticed something stuck onto Haruna's neck. Its size meant that it escaped Kijima-sensei's eyesight, but not yours. It looked like a needle of sorts, but you still needed to get closer to confirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can try and call out to Kijima-sensei for attention, but she might not hear you or you might startle Haruna, even in her sickened state. The other option is to just make your way towards the gurney and either get her attention or get to the needle yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's your call.</span></div></div>",

You knew that time was running short, but there was no way you could run towards the gurney in time. Just then, you noticed a ray of sunlight emanating from the nearby window. You also notice the now enlarged high heel shoe. Suddenly, you had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing the high heel shoe was not easy, and you nearly fell inside the shoe, but you successfully reach the top of the shoe. You took off your glasses, and using it, you slowly turned the glasses so they can reflect a bit of light towards Kijima-sensei's direction. The small ray of light caught Kijima-sensei by surprise, but she definitely noticed you, moments before you slipped and fell inside her shoe. Luckily, that was enough for her to head towards the desk and whisk you out of the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki-kun. What are you doing?\" Kijima-sensei asked as she brought your tiny frame in front of her face, carried by her two log-sized fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said nothing, and pointed back towards the gurney, where Haruna was. Kijima-sensei returned to the gurney, with you still being carried by her fingers, and slowly placed you down it. As soon as you were firmly on the gurney, you rushed towards Haruna's neck, where you had initially spotted the needle. Sure enough, your instincts were right: there was a needle punctured into her neck! The size of the needle was the more curious aspect, as it was normal-sized to YOU than to the giantesses. Carefully, you extracted the needle out of Haruna's neck, and then returned back to Kijima-sensei, who saw the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKijima-sensei nodded, and opened her palm for you to hop on, which you did. She walked back to her desk, placed you back on it, and then went to her cabinet. You looked at the needle that you had extracted. It was no sewing needle, and judging by its shape, you guess was that it was a projectile, possibly from a blowgun, a blowgun suited towards your current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki-kun. The needle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKijima-sensei's words snapped you out of deep thought, and you saw that she had brought out a microscope. You nodded, and placed the needle on the lens. Kijima-sensei reached for a chair, sat down and then got to work, looking for some clues on the needle you had extracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the ...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKijima-sensei exclaimed as she continued to observe the needle from her microscope. Suddenly, she got up from her seating position, and rushed back to  the medicine cabinet. She pulled out a small bottle, and hurried towards the gurney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, drink this. It's an antidote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Kijima-sensei's words as she slowly fed the antidote down Haruna's mouth. You looked at the microscope, which was still active, and you approached it, looking at the needle that had caused it all. Kijima-sensei mentioned 'antidote', so your instincts were fairly accurate. It was a needle projectile, and likely lathered with a poison of sorts. Now, the question remains is who did it, and why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I owe you one, Hiroki-kun.\" Kijima-sensei said as she returned to the desk. \"If you had not noticed the needle in her neck, it might have been too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK, sensei. Saving a life is more important.\" You said. Being small does have its qualities, you thought to yourself. \"What was it, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some kind of paralyzing poison had been applied to the needle.\" Kijima-sensei explained. \"I have heard of such stories from history and from my chemistry lessons, but nothing like this. All I know that this potion is slow-reacting, it will only affect the nervous system after a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKijima-sensei looked at Haruna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A moment later, and this young lady will be either dead or permanently paralyzed.\" Kijima-sensei continued. \"The antidote will do its work, but it will take some time before all the poison in her body is neutralized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who will do such a thing like this?\" You said, worriedly. At the same time, after seeing the needle firsthand, you are starting to wonder if you were not the only victim of shrinking around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh ... ohh ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you turned around to see Haruna on the gurney, moving slowly. Is she waking up?</span></div></div>",

It's been laced with some paralyzing poison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poison!\" Haruna exclaimed. \"How could they ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she stopped, and covered her mouth, as if she was going to blurt some secret out. After a while, she slowly removed her hands away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, sensei,\" Haruna said, getting off the gurney. \"I ... I should get back to class, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, before you go,\" Kijima-sensei interrupted, and Haruna turned around. \"Do you remember where and when you felt that something on your neck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ... think it was at one of the corridors at the lower floors, probably the first.\" Haruna said. \"I should go. Thank you, sensei.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruna then hurriedly left the room, without even looking back. After a while, Kijima-sensei turned around, and headed back to the desk, where you had heard everything. Gently, Kijima-sensei reached her hand out, letting you hop onto it before raising it so you can see her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think she's hiding something, Hiroki-kun?\" Kijima-sensei whispered, and you nodded. You noticed that she seemed more concerned that there was poison involved than actually collapsing on the desk. Obviously, this meant she knew the attacker, or whoever sent the attacker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Hiroki-kun, I'd be taking the rest of the day off,\" Kijima-sensei whispered. \"If you like, you can join me, until we can find the device to restore you back to normal.\" You nodded your head again, signalling to her that you accept her offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, Hiroki-kun,\" Kijima-sensei continued. \"If you like, we can try and find this device to restore you back to normal, if you are that desperate to get enlarged again. Of course, if you like being small, I don't mind taking you with me and spend this day off together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed your hand over your chin, pondering the options that Kijima-sensei presented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll do it like this, Hiroki-kun,\" Kijima-sensei said. \"Raise your left hand if you want to find this device, and raise your right hand if you want to wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe decision is yours, either have Kijima-sensei on your side to find that device to restore you back to normal, or spend \"quality\" time with her as a tiny and return back to find it another time.

Can't blame you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head again in agreement. There was no way you are leaving Reiko alone, especially not at a time like this. The sooner you get back to normal size, the better, and maybe then you can take the fight to whoever built the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKijima-sensei then lowered her hand, over towards her left shoulder. Using her other hand, she pointed to the shoulder, as if telling you to either sit or just lie down on her shoulder. You did as you are gestured to. It was good that Kijima-sensei had short hair, so that lessens the chance of her hair bumping you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKijima-sensei (with you in tow) then locked the sick bay door shut, and then went on your way. It was a pretty bumpy ride on Kijima-sensei's shoulder, but it was certainly much better than having to walk by yourself, avoiding giant feet and other hazards in the process. The sight of Kijima's shoes stamping on the pavement made you a little ill, knowing very well that could be your fate: flattened underneath a pair of shoes like an insignificant insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you arrived at the corridor where Haruna had claimed that the attack happened. Raising her head, Kijima-sensei looked around, being very careful not to bump you off her shoulder. She turned around, and continued to observe around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange ...\" Kijima-sensei whispered. \"Everything seems normal. I can't find any good spot for anyone to attack.\" On her shoulder, you too was puzzled. By all means, the windows and even the top of the ceiling would have been a perfect ambush spot for a person your size, but there were no holes or even openings at the windows. If there were, the attack had probably covered his or tracks by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back down at the floor, still feeling a little ill looking at Kijima-sensei's shoes and thinking about how they were this close to squashing you. Then, quite by chance, you noticed a shine on the floor. At your size, only you can see it. Without hesitation, you reached for a strand of Kijima-sensei's hair, and started pulling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" Kijima-sensei's voice boomed at the sudden tug at her hair, and you found yourself losing balance at the sudden movement of her head. Then, you found yourself falling forward, down Kijima-sensei's body. Luckily, she had seen (and possibly felt) you fall off her shoulder, and quickly reached her left palm out to grab you. The human palm had never felt any softer, as she managed to open her palm in time to catch you before you fell any further down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKijima-sensei simply gave you a stern look, before her face changed back to her gentle self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Hiroki-kun?\" She whispered, with a slight tone of annoyance with you tugging at her hair earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can either point downwards to try and discover whatever that shine was, or you think it's too risky, and you want to go back up on her shoulder.

Almost every male student at school have always expressed interest at getting close to Kijima-sensei, and who could blame them? She was very attractive for someone her age, and she is certainly over-qualified to work at a middle school. It is also implied that she may be pretty well off, but no one has ever proven that. And yet here, you are going to be the first one to actually spend time with the school's \"blooming flower\", Motoko Kijima-sensei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's OK, Hiroki-kun,\" She whispered. \"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, she went over to pick up her bag before returning to you. You stared at her bag, which felt like the size of a fishing ship to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this?\" Kijima-sensei whispered. \"No, silly. I'm not putting you in there. You're riding with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached out her free hand, and opened it in a palm to let you climb onto it. Once you were on it, she gently raised it to her left shoulder, and lowered you onto it. For the first time since you were shrunk, this might actually be a more favorable mode of transportation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter locking the sick bay door shut, the two of you left the school compound, and headed to the car park. You whistled in amazement as Kijima-sensei stopped before a black open-top two seater sedan. You covered your ears as Kijima-sensei reached for her pocket and pulled out her car keys. The sound of the alarm being de-triggered was painful to your ears, but thankfully, it didn't last long. Kijima-sensei got into the car, and once she was seated, she grabbed you off her shoulder, and placed you in front of the area between the steering wheel and the windshield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Hiroki-kun, but you have to stay there for a while.\" Kijima-sensei whispered as she strapped her seat-belt on, and you knew why. You sat there on the little space, clasping your ears as she started her car engine. You then felt something placed behind your back. You turned around, and you noticed she had placed a tissue pack behind you. Kijima-sensei thought about everything, you thought to yourself. Then again, she did say her brother went through the same thing, so she might already be familiar the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car started up, and soon after, Kijima-sensei drove out of the school. The ride felt like you were being bumped about back and forth, with the tissue pack preventing you from falling down to the pedals. The sight before you was not comfortable either, and you try not to look at the windshield while Kijima-sensei drove on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twenty-minute long drive felt like two hours to you, and throughout the journey, you felt like a slab of meat being tendered by either Reiko or your dad, when he has the time to cook. However, after countless minutes of being bumped about, it looks like the journey is over. You had a look at the windscreen, and you found yourself at ...</span></div></div>",

Ms. Kijima's scream had attracted attention, and judging from the footsteps approaching, it sounds like 2 pairs of feet. Your guess was correct when you saw the door swing open, revealing two schoolgirls. You gasped again, as it was the two people you least want to see at this size: your nemesis Shizuka and her best friend, Hitomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Ms. Kijima's down and out!\" Hitomi said, looking at her fallen body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start searching! I think I saw him coming in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think it might already be too late to hide behind Ms. Kijima's body, but you still took a chance anyway. Scurrying away from the giant girls like a rat, you approached Ms. Kijima's fallen body, hoping that she can shield you from these giant girls. Unfortunately, it was not the case. Hitomi saw you running towards Ms. Kijima's body, and with her right hand, she reached and picked you up with her fingers. You struggled as you were caught by Hitomi's fingers, but your tiny muscles were nothing to her fingers at this size. All you could do was wait and accept whatever fate might have planned for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Shizuka-chan! I found him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizuka had to get very close to you to have a glimpse. You struggled occassionally, but your efforts were futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well! So it was the geek boy who stumbled his way into the resizing device, and got himself shrunk down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pondered over what to do with you next, you could hear a faint sound calling out for help. You swore the voice came from Shizuka's pocket, but it looks like your fate had been decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hitomi! Swallow him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! You want me to swallow another one of these? That's the 3rd one today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on with it!\" Shizuka threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, OK!

Her tongue stuck out like a large slimy worm out of its cave, and before you could do anything, she released her grip on you, and you fell straight down into her mouth. She didn't bother to chew you, and you fell straight down her esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGULP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the two giantesses had helped Ms. Kijima up onto the main bed, and left the Medical Room.

Looking around, you know you where you were: Hitomi's stomach. You looked near where you landed, and you saw a skeleton nearby, which freaked you out. You jumped aside, still staring at the skeleton. You presumed that was one of Hitomi's three victims, and probably was the first one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued looking around, the \"cavern\" suddenly began to shudder, like an earthquake. The sudden movement almost knocked you off your feet, but you were still in one piece ... for now. As you continued looking around, you found someone's body just lying down in the distance. You quickly rushed to the body, hoping to save it before digestion takes place. You were relieved when you realized the person was still alive, but just barely. Imagine your surprise when you discovered who it was. It was Shuhei Yamamoto, your classmate and neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Shuhei! Wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to shake him awake, but he was still too weak to move. It was as if he had not eaten for quite some time, so you had to do something. You remembered the bento Yuriko gave you earlier today, and to your relief, you were still carrying it. Reluctantly, you gave it to Shuhei. The smell of the food worked, and he quickly reached out and ate the contents inside the bento. While you were a little sad to give away food Yuriko made, at least your friend was awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Hiroki! I thought I was a goner after Hitomi swallowed me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say. Still, how did you end up shrunken down anyway? I know you will ask me the same question, so I'll go first. I stumbled onto a secret lair of sorts, and somehow I got shrunk after being zapped by a mysterious ray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's strange, because I could say the same, except we were shrunk outside the school yard. My brother and I were just riding to school until for reasons unknown, we got shrunk down. It was not long before Shizuka and Hitomi found us. Hitomi was told to swallow me, and that was how I ended up here. Hitomi must not have eaten for a while, as I could not find any food around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is your brother, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shizuka has him ... as a pet of sorts. We have to save him, and find a way to get back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after your conversation, the \"cavern\" started shuddering again. This time, you were caught off-balance, and fell down onto the fleshy floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to try and get out as soon as possible! Hitomi's digestive juices are starting up again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not have much time to think, so a decision has to be made. There are two possible ways out. One, through her mouth and two, through her digestive system below. Both have their risks, but you have to make a decision now. Choose.</span></div></div>",

You went to join in, but after ten minutes of constant banging and kicking, nothing happened. Your current sizes make it too insignificant to cause anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Shuhei slouched back down on the floor, exhausted from your futile efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about ...

(pant) ... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Hitomi felt something tickling inside her stomach, and simply rubbed it. She did not like the idea of swallowing tiny people alive, and she only did because of Shizuka's dominating personality. While Shizuka looked at some research papers, Hitomi snuck out of her sight, and gently crept towards the vending machine nearby. She bought a can of fizzy cola, and promptly drank it all down before Shizuka finds out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh ... Shizuka-chan is so dominating, I wish she would listen to me once in a while ... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to finish the cola, and threw the can away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her stomach, the two of you overheard what she said, and for once, you could feel some symphaty for Hitomi. Even though she was always heckling and making fun of you and your geek friends, she was only doing it out of peer pressure from Shizuka. As you contempt your next move, you could see a large \"waterfall\" of fizzy cola falling into the pool of stomach acid. While normally you would admire the sight of it, you could not help but feel disgusted as the brownish liquid falling into the pool of stomach acid. Shuhei tried to get a sip of it, but you stopped him, reminding him where it \"came from\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two liquids started reacting to each other, you could see bubbles forming from the surface of the acidic pool. The bubbles were quite large, like the size of giant beach balls. You finally had an idea, and you promptly dragged Shuhei towards the edge of the acid pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh ... what are you planning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Hitomi just threw us a ticket out of here! Come on, before all the gas is used up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you entered the acid pool, and in a stroke of luck, a huge bubble formed up around you and Shuhei, and lifted the two of you up before the acid starts to melt your clothes off. As the bubbles started to rise up, carrying the two of you with them, but concerns still remain. The bubbles can still burst before they reach Hitomi's mouth, and even then, you might still be thrown back down her throat and back into your stomach. It all boils down to luck.</span></div></div>",

Shizuka heard her burp, and immediately went forward and confronted her. Hearing Shizuka's harsh words on her supposedly best friend, your sympathy for Hitomi also grew. How or why Hitomi stayed with her despite putting up with Shizuka's domineering personality and, to an extent, humiliation, remains a mystery. Getting scolded simply for drinking a can of soda felt a little too harsh for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot, Shizuka sure is mean to Hitomi.\" Shuhei started speaking. \"I have to make up for Mikako if I manage to survive this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, why are you bringing this up now?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei turned towards you, with a slightly guilty look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I owe you guys ... an apology.

On one hand, you wanted to slap Shuhei right there for causing this mess and getting you involved as \"collateral damage\" for his relationship problem. However, on the other hand, you know that Shuhei may be blunt and crude at times, but he genuinely cares for those that he loves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I get it ... I'll help ... in whatever way I can. However, our concern now is ... our host right here. What is your choice, then?

Then, slowly, but steadily, he climbed downwards. You were a little hesitant in doing so, but you realized that you did not have a choice. Slowly, but steadily, you followed Shuhei down Hitomi's uniform. It helped a little that Hitomi was still standing there. Apparently, Shizuka has a knack for long-winded speeches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you climbed down, you could not help but have a peek at Hitomi's body.

As Hitomi ran, all you could hear was Shizuka's gradually softening voice, yelling insults and profanities at her so-called best friend for her actions. Shizuka's actions caused you to shake your head, and at the same time, somewhat relieved that Hitomi was finally able to see Shizuka's true nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a while before Hitomi finally stopped, and when she finally opened her hand, you find yourself inside what appears to be a small room.

The 2 of you fell right back down her stomach, and plunged right into the pool of stomach acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei and yourself struggled to swim your way out of the acid pool, but there was no \"dry land\" in sight, and by the time you see your clothes dissolve, you knew it was the end for you. As your clothes fully dissolved, you could feel your flesh burn as the nasty liquid tried to dissolve you. You tried to scream, but nobody could hear you. Close by, Shuhei had already blacked out and much of his body was already being dissolved. That was the last thing you saw before you whited out, the pain from your body being dissolved too hard to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, Hitomi could feel a small bulge on her tummy, and groaned about Shizuka forcing her to swallow tiny men. In addition, her last trip to relieve her bowels was less than enjoyable, as there was a sharp pain of sorts when she \"did\" her business. If she had looked at whatever that was left, she might have seen two skeletal hands sticking out, namely yours and Shuhei's. While your skeletons remained indigestable, the rest of your body became a layer of fat on Hitomi's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister and Yuriko tried in vain to look for you and the Yamamoto brothers, with neither of them knowing the awful truth.</span></div></div>",

You had a closer look at the bra, and to your amazement, it was not the cheap types that Reiko and even Yuriko hangs out in the laundry.

While it may seem strange to anybody, you did not dare to question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not have much time to continue thinking about things, as you can see Mikako's giant hand entering the school blouse from below, scratching her belly in the process.

You had correctly predicted that Shizuka can't stomp you with both feet, but now you must make a run for it before her other foot crushes you, now that both her feet are on the ground. You made a mad dash away from Shizuka's, trying to get as far as possible from this dangerous giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready exhausted, you know that no matter how many times you managed to dodge Shizuka's relentless stomping, it would only be a matter of time before she finishes you off. What seems like a long run to you is only a few small steps for her, and Shizuka has the upper hand quite literally. You could see Shizuka's shoe hovering above you again, and dodged it again, though that step came within inches of squashing you flat. If she takes another step, you are finished!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you could hear the sound of engines from a distance, and the sound is getting louder by the second. You looked at where the sound is coming from, and you could see two motorcyclists coming towards you. To your relief, the bikers are the same size as yourself, and before you could react, one of them beckoned you to move closer to them. You nodded, and using whatever's left of your physical strength, you rushed towards the mysterious tiny bikers before Shizuka lifts her foot again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you eventually met up, but there was no time for any idle chat as one of the bikers signalled you to climb on and hold on tight. You followed suit, and the two bikers then hit a spectacular 180 degree turn and by the time Shizuka noticed you, it was too late for her, as the smaller bikes outran her. Furious at losing to a bunch of insects, she gave one final stomp on the ground in frustration, before turning around and heading back to her class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were finally safe from Shizuka, though you wonder how or why these bikers even came in the first place. You wanted to talk, but without a helmet, the wind is blowing at you at such speeds, it was impossible to even open your mouth. You had to wait until they stopped, which they eventually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three of you dismount the bikes, you were breathing heavily both from running from Shizuka and being exposed to high speeds without a helmet. You panted heavily, but you still needed to know how or why they saved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you (pant) ... save me back there (pant) ...? Do I even (pant) ... know you? (pant)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you still don't know who we are after all that?\" A biker spoke in a very familiar voice. \"We were best buddies since elementary school, and you always helped us with homework and tuning our bikes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after the bikers removed their helmets before you finally recognized who they were. It was your neighbors, Hiroshi and Shuhei Yamamoto. You were best buddies with Shuhei, and Hiroshi was like a bigger brother to you, despite the lone year gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroshi? Shuhei? How on earth ... no ...what on earth is going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to ask you the same question. We were riding our bikes past your school, and suddenly we were shrunk down to the size of insects. It was quite fortunate our bikes were shrunk as well, or we probably won't be meeting with each other again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something big is going on at my school. I need your help, and in return, I can help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. You got a deal! We can go back to your house, or we can head back to school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou choose to ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA/N: In Japan, the legal riding age is 16.

My sister should be home soon, maybe she can help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, if you say so!\" Hiroshi answered, tossing you a spare crash helmet. You put the helmet on, and then climbed onto Hiroshi's bike. The two brothers revved up their motorcycles, and rode off before Shizuka or anybody else located you. Comparing to running about at your size, travelling about at such speed at your current size actually seemed fun. Yes, the distance was longer, and the risk of being stepped on was still high, but with a motorcycle to ride around, you can easily outrun footsteps,and occassionally, ride through the legs of passers-by. The Yamamoto brothers are enjoying this, it seems, as they seem to frequently steer their motorcycles through the legs of the ladies, with the occassional \"wind\" exposing their panties slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a 20 minute ride before the three of you arrive at the foot of your doorstep. The three of you dismount, and removed your respective helmets. While the brothers went to work and check their bikes, you headed towards the shoe rack. Even at your size, you could still clearly see what was on the racks. The shoe rack gave you your answer: Reiko's not home yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it seems like you need not wait long as you could hear footsteps from nearby, and the sound gets louder as time passes. Eventually, you see Reiko's figure in the distance, but as she gets closer to the door, you wonder if she is able to see you guys. Especially when the stamping of her feet on the floor gets louder and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rushed towards the Yamamoto brothers and attempted to warn them of the impending danger, but they are too engrossed in their bikes to actually care. You watched in horror as Reiko's Mary Jane shoe hover above you guys, preparing for the drop. You quickly headed forward, and waved your arms around like mad, hoping she will notice. Did she?</span></div></div>",

Even though the size difference was considerable, you could notice that Reiko's face felt flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ... hi, Hiroki ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReiko's voice was slurry, and before you could respond or anything, Reiko just promptly went inside the house, slamming the door shut. You were not angry with your younger sister, but worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, nuts! I thought she was going to help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki, can't you do ... something ... hey, Hiroki. Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei tapped you on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Shuhei. I don't think that's her normal response ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish, you heard a loud thud coming from inside the house. Immediately, you knew something was definitely wrong. Concerned, you quickly crawled through the door gap, and you could see Reiko's fallen body on the floor. It felt like a large hill to you, but for once, you had no time to panic. It's my sister, you thought to yourself, so it's my responsibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, the way Reiko fell eased your \"navigation\" towards her face. You reached out your hand to feel Reiko's forehead. Sure enough, it felt hot. You immediately knew what had happened: Reiko was running a fever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the distance, you could see the Yamamoto brothers from a distance, following you when you darted inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Hiroki? You scared us when you dashed inside the house like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiroshi asked as you slowly approached them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reiko's fallen sick. A high fever, in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at Reiko's prone body, you could not help but feel a sense of uselessness. If you were normal-sized,you would have helped Reiko towards her bed, but at your current size, you could not even lift up her pinkie finger without struggling, let alone help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of a brother am I at a time like this ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears start streaming down your face, as you continued your approach. By each passing second, your legs felt weaker and weaker. Eventually, as if your legs had given way, you fell straight down to your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei immediately rushed towards you as you kneeled down, silent and tears still streaming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki. Get a hold of yourself, man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shuhei ... this must be a form of punishment ... I have never been the best brother to Reiko ... she's the one looking after this house when our parents are away. She's the one who did all the cooking and cleaning. Now that she has fallen sick, I should be the one to look after her. But ... LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT US! My parents are not here. I have a sick sister who needs my attention, and I can't even GIVE THAT to her! I'M USELESS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei looked at you for a moment as you continued to wallow about in self-pity and helplessness. There was silence, then you could feel a big tight slap on your left cheek. The impact came from Shuhei's right hand, and he was looking at you in contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You disgust me, Hiroki ...\" Shuhei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shuhei!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiroshi saw the commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STAND BACK, BROTHER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei's loud voice took his brother by surprise, stunning him into silence and stillness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, as a younger sibling myself, I understand Reiko's plight. I remember when I was young, when I came down with a fever, I was home alone. Hiroshi was not around to take care of me. Heck, he was out playing football with his friends while I am at home running a high fever. By the time he got home, I had to be rushed to the hospital for medical attention. Hiroshi was behaving like you right now back then, blaming himself over and over for his uselessness. That ate me up inside. I did not blame my brother for abandoning me, but I blamed MYSELF for being such a burden. As a younger sibling, as annoying or bratty we may be, one thing we DO look out for is to avoid being a burden to our older siblings. My father always said older brothers or sisters are born first to protect their younger siblings. But I also believe that as younger siblings, we too have a duty to not be such a burden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went speechless as Shuhei continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Reiko may be sick, and yes, we ARE too tiny to help, but are we going to give up just like that? NO! I don't know about Reiko, but I'm sure she does not like being sick and being a burden. As her older brother, your duty is to reassure her that, and take care of her, no matter how or what you are right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y ... you are right, Shuhei ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stammered slowly, trying to recall Shuhei's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Hiroki? What are you going to do? Or do I have to slap you awake again before you will take ANY action?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei raised his hand again, ready to strike, but you raised out your own, signalling Shuhei to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ... I understand, Shuhei ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you got back up to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what I have to do now. I'm ... sorry for my actions ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say sorry AFTER Reiko gets better. We'll help, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei looked at Hiroshi, who had gone completely still during the exchange of words. Finally, realizing what had transpired, he nodded his head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way any of us can carry any of her fingers, much less her body. I'm going back to school to get help, as much as I don't want to. Hiroki, I will leave you to decide. Do you want to stay here, or do you want to follow me back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe decision is yours.</span></div></div>",

Taking Hiroshi's helmet, you quickly put it on as you scrambled onto Shuhei's bike, followed by the roaring of an engine. Within seconds, you were off back to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this person who can help, Hiroki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you have met her before, Shuhei.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I was thinking of asking my girlfriend for help ... she knows of our ... reduced stature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your girlfriend? Gee, you have not told us anything about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to surprise you, but ... fine, I'll say it. Mikako and I have been dating for the past 3 months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikako?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you remembered the girl that you had climbed before this whole incident happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shuhei, I ... I might be asking to get whacked if I say this, but ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, Hiroki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ... I was crawling about your girlfriend's body when she was having lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei said nothing.For a while, you would have expected him to get angry and yell, or push you off the bike, but Shuhei remained surprisingly calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was she? Climbing her, I mean ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei's tone was half-serious and half-cheeky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her body was soft, but she didn't notice me all this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! Mikako-chan can be so absent-minded sometimes. Well, I guess it just means I need to find other ways to get her attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ... you're not mad at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can consider the slap I gave you as punishment if you really want to apologize. We're even now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the two of you returned to the school yard. Shuhei then parked the bike below the shade of the nearest tree to the school gate. Luckily, the yard was empty, but when you looked at your watch, you started to panic. There was only 30 minutes left before school was over! You two have to move quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad news, Shuhei! We only have 30 minutes before all hell breaks loose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot! I'm going to look for Mikako-chan anyway.

Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you dashed across the school yard, and after reaching the school building, the two of you then rushed in through the cracked gap. Once again, you could feel your body tiring out again, but when you remembered Reiko's prone body and her high fever, you did your best to banish that thought away. Inside the main school building, the corridor was mostly empty. The two of you then headed towards the shoe lockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shuhei. Are you planning to hide inside Mikako's shoe or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei stopped to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, do you even play 'Ninja's Code' or anything? I'm here to \"borrow\" something, not hide in a shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei came to a particular shoe locker, and then signaled you to stay put, while he crept in through an opening. For a while, you had no idea what he meant when he mentioned 'Ninja's Code'. Sure, the ninjas in the game pulled off a couple of fancy tricks here and there, but it was only a game, you thought to yourself. Even if ninjas DO exist, you doubt any of them could pull off the tricks that you had seen while playing the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei eventually came out with a few pieces of string, coiled around his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"String? Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikako told me the owner of this particular locker keeps her sewing kit inside her locker. We'll need these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei returned back to the corridor, carrying the makeshift rope, with you in tow. Shuhei did not stop until he reached the main staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way we can climb that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't planning to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you could hear loud footsteps coming from behind you guys. It came from a female teacher, who appeared in her 30s. Although you could not see her face, but you could tell that she wore something typical of an office lady. As she got closer, you could see Shuhei tying the rope onto something. It was a sewing hook, but the sewing was right for YOUR standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the only path to the teacher's lounge. I figured there might be one or two teachers could ... assist us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei's tone suddenly became serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki, we only have one shot. I'm going to latch this to the teacher's stockings. Once so, start climbing the string. Do not stop until you are positively clinging to the teacher's stocking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and looking at how dangerously close the teacher's feet are approaching, you started to feel a little uneasy. Next moment, the teacher's black high heel shoe slammed right down a few inches in front of you. Once again, you had the feel of the massive size difference between normal people and your shrunken statures. Then, you remembered what Shuhei said, and you could see that he had already latched the rope onto the teacher's stocking. It was not long before the teacher lifted her foot up again, so Shuhei started climbing the string. You followed suit, even though from years of physical education classes, you had always been the worst climber. However, this time, you had to do it for Reiko's sake, and for your life if you are not careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the force of the teacher's leg movements made you feel like you had been yanked by a galloping horse or train. Even so, you did not stop climbing, only pausing when you realized you were getting too close to Shuhei. Shuhei eventually managed to grab hold of the stocking, and then gave you a free hand, helping you climb onto the nylon. After that, Shuhei promptly took the hook out, and rolled the string around his left arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might need this again later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the teacher continued walking, you had a look around your surroundings. The teacher had already climbed up the stairs to level 2. This is where your class is, and most likely, Yuriko and Mikako as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shuhei. We are here. Let's get off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. I think this teacher might take us right where we want to.

At least, the two of you now have the easy part to do: locate the classrooms and find your targets.

Without any time left to waste, the two of you agreed to split up to look for one of the two girls mentioned. Interestingly, Shuhei's clue to finding Mikako was the same for finding Yuriko: both ladies have a distinctive \"Chibi-Geko\" strap sticking out of their bags. Now, there is a problem: finding them among the 29 students seated in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking from row to row, you were beginning to lament your luck. Even for finding a \"Chibi-Geko\" strap, the task remains daunting.

There was no sound, but when you looked up, you felt some relief. Yuriko had definitely got the message, and as she started to peer down, you quickly and frantically waved your arms about. Yuriko said nothing, but as she reached to grab for her bag, you could see her opening up her left palm, as if signalling for you to hop on before gently placing you on the table, hidden from sight by her pencil case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a whole day of running about, it was some relief that you had a friendly giantess on your side. However, even though there was only five minutes left, class was not yet over. Even though you could have used your mobile phone all this time, it was certainly dangerous. Calling Yuriko to meet you would have her accidentally stepping on you by mistake, and it was forbidden to use mobile phones in class, even in silent mode. Lady Luck was smiling at you back then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school bell rang for the final time for the day, and almost everybody started scrambling for the exit. Seizing the opportunity, you sent a message to Shuhei to report things are fine. Yuriko then crouched her face closer to you, staring at your tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki-kun, how did you get so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that you could not communicate with Yuriko like this, you showed Yuriko your mobile phone. Yuriko nodded, as if she understands how you will communicate. You then started to input as much text as you can into the phone to explain the story, but primarily to get home and help Reiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh ... Takamoto-san ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA female voice came out, which caused Yuriko to turn to face the direction where the voice came from. It was Mikako Nagama, so that means that Shuhei was also successful in finding his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need formalities, just call me Yuriko. What is it, Mikako-kun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikako hesitated, blushing a little, before she whispered into Yuriko's ear. Yuriko's face went from shock to confusion as Mikako spoke. Finally, Mikako reached into her breast pocket, and pulled a tiny Shuhei out of it. Yuriko stared at Shuhei's tiny form, but said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Mikako-kun ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko pointed at her pencil case, and then removed it from her desk, revealing your tiny form to Mikako. As she saw you, Mikako became hesitant and started fidgeting. From your position, you could see Shuhei's smirk on his face. Obviously, he must have told her of your \"climbing adventure\" of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, this is getting weird ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko mumbled, very puzzled at the scene in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at home, Reiko was already lying in her bed, with Yuriko and Mikako tending to her. Reiko had a thermometer in her mouth, which Yuriko later took from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"38.3 degrees. You really have fallen sick, Reiko-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko looked at Reiko, who did not show any signs of recovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But ... I have dinner to prepare ... and it's my duty for laundry today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko then received a message on her mobile phone, and after seeing it, showed it to Reiko. Reiko then turned to look at you on the counter by her bed. As at your size, you were incapable of speaking verbally with her, so you had to rely on Yuriko to be your mouthpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message read, \"Don't worry, Reiko. We'll handle the chores. You just stay here and have a good rest. - Hiroki\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReiko nodded in agreement, and Yuriko then proceeded to tuck Reiko into her bed. Following that, Yuriko picked you off from the cupboard, and placed you gently on her left palm, leaving Reiko's room.</span></div></div>",

Looking at the living room, Yuriko was seated on a cushion facing a round table, and the three shrunken boys on the table. Mikako grabbed a cushion from the sofa nearby, and took her place at the table, facing Yuriko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iketani's imouto (younger sister in Japanese) is fast asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikako whispered, making sure her voice does not pierce the three tiny men on the table. You looked at her, and then bowed down. At your size, it was impossible to let hear you, so bowing to her was the only way to convey your thanks ... properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikako-kun. Hiroki-kun has explained everything to me: about your affiliation with the Technology Club and that you are familiar with tinies. Now, we are expecting an explanation from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko said briefly, in her normal voice. In order to make sure her voice does not hurt your ears, she had placed her left hand on top of you guys as a cover of sorts. It managed to block out most of the noise, but it still felt awfully loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Even though I swore an oath of silence, I have to break it now. Especially after what the Technology Club had done to Shuhei.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko nodded, and Mikako continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It began last year, at the former Midoriyama Girls' School, where I was last enrolled. After the first semester tests, I was approached by this senpai, and she asked me if I wanted to be 'a positive force on this Earth', as she puts it. I did not know what she meant by that, but after she started talking about a noble goal to save the world, I naively agreed. From there, this senpai gradually revealed the secrets of the Technology Club located at the basement of the former Midoriyama Girls' School coumpound. Even though the M &amp; A scheme meant the loss of Midoriyama Girls' School as an entity, the Technology Club operated in secret, even when the entire school compound was rebuilt, and I am fairly certain they had a hand with the construction. My job was a lab assistant in helping the Technology Club with various formulas and experiments, primarily in the robotics field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That still does not explain how you know about tinies, Mikako-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Technology Club has quite a following, and everybody has a rank, from the lowly E-rank to the chosen few of the A-rank. Each rank has a degree of knowledge of the workings within the Club. I only got my C-rank a few weeks ago, and it was here did my senpai showed me the so-called \"Inner Sanctum\". It was there did I noticed that they had succeeded in their \"shrinking project\", and I was a firsthand witness of the results: a few hypnotized and shrunken salarymen. With this secret, I was forced into an oath of silence, lest the 'Master Plan' gets jeopardized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really sure what it is. Only the A-ranked members and the Committee know the full details of the so-called 'Master Plan'. All I know is that it involved the shrinking project. I had no idea they will use it on students in the school, especially on the first day as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikako hung her head low in remorse. Now that the cat was out of the bag, there was no more hiding that Mikako had been a part of the Technology Club's 'Master Plan', albeit an unwitting part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Shuhei ... I didn't know what they had planned ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears started streaking down Mikako's face, as the sense of guilt in her started to grow. Shuhei could barely make out Mikako's face underneath Yuriko's hand, but he could sense the sadness in her voice. Slowly, he crept out of Yuriko's hand, and he could see Mikako's immense form, still sobbing. Hiroshi and you peered from the safety of Yuriko's palm, and even though you could not fully see what was going on, you could notice Shuhei leaping from the table, and onto Mikako's lap. Shuhei then gently placed his hand on Mikako's larger hand, and then gently stroked it. Despite their size differences, Shuhei was not afraid to risk everything for his girlfriend, even his safety. A few tear drops handed very close to Shuhei as Mikako continued sobbing, but Shuhei stood firm, refusing to back off or run back to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Shuhei has given you an answer. What are you going to do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko had seen the entire scene unfold, and although Yuriko and Mikako had just barely knew each other, she could see that Mikako has someone who does care for her regardless of the mistakes she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikako then wiped her face dry. After that, she gently picked up Shuhei from her lap, placing him on her open palm, and brought his tiny form to her face. In any situation, Shuhei would have wanted to give her a hug, but at his size, it was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ... you forgive me, Shuhei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikako looked on as Shuhei slowly approached her face, and gently planted a kiss on her cheek. Obviously, that was Shuhei's answer to Mikako. Looking from a distance, you could not help but feel a little envious of Shuhei. Even though both of you are of the same age, Shuhei was apparently more mature and brave than you were your entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, we'll leave them be for some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiroshi said, feeling proud of his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki-kun. Although I'm not familiar with the details, but from the looks of it, the 'Master Plan' must NOT happen. While the thought of giant girls is ... stimulating, to say the least, I don't want a world where people are dominated by their sizes. Whatever you decide, I will stick by you, Hiroki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was followed by a gentle tap on your shoulder. You looked behind for the source, and you could see Yuriko's finger that did it. Looking up, you saw Yuriko's smiling face, and although she did not speak, you could tell that Yuriko will support you all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that part of the truth is out, it was almost time to strike back at the Technology Club, and prevent their 'Master Plan' from being carried out. But at your current size, there might be a problem. Do you want to prepare first, or do you intend to strike while the Technology Club is making preparations? The decision is yours.</span></div></div>",

I say we hit them while they are making preparations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko nodded, understanding your choice. If what Mikako said was true, the Technology Club might still be in the midst of preparations, and a 'surgical strike' at them could cripple their efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will head out tonight. In the meantime, go ahead and make your preparations. We will definitely need Mikako's help with this one, since she is the most familiar with the insides of the Technology Club. In the meantime ... I need sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, you let off a yawn, and Yuriko could not help but giggle. It seems you looked really cute when you yawn. She gently placed you back on the table, and reached for her handkerchief, and laid it out for you as a makeshift bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just rest for now, Hiroki. I'll take care of Reiko for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko whispered, and after placing Hiroshi on the table as well, she took her leave and went to Reiko's room. Meanwhile, you decided to go and take a nap in preparation for tonight's investigation action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNighttime had fallen, and the school compound was empty ... or it seemed to be. Yuriko and Mikako were standing outside the school gate, which was obviously locked for security reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikako reached for her pouch which she carried, and pulled out what appears to be a card key (with a huge letter 'C' printed on it). She gently tapped the card at the door control, and it reacted with a loud beep, causing the gate to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Technology Club hacked into our school security system?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko was taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, the Technology Club was the one who provided the security controls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls then hurriedly headed to the school building before the guards notice the breach. Inside, both Yuriko and Mikako used the in-built flashlights in their cellphones to help illuminate the way. Mikako led the way, and promptly stopped at the janitor's closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The secret entrance is through here. Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikako opened the closet door, which was supposed to be locked at this time, surprising Yuriko again. The janitor's closet was the cover for a secret underground entrance towards the Technology Club's main compound. Once the two ladies have made it down a hidden passabe of steps, they were inside the compound. Compared to the rest of the school, the Technology Club's facilities are well-lit, which temporarily blinded Yuriko and Mikako as they approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were uneasy sounds of motors running in the background, not to mention footsteps of other Technology Club members in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How on earth could the school security guards miss something like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko asked, looking around and recalling what she had just seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Technology Club also runs a legitimate business front. A security company, to be exact. I'm not too sure about the details. Only the A-ranked members get information on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko then reached into her pocket, and picked you out and gently placing you on her palm. Mikako did likewise with the Yamamoto brothers inside her breast pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is as far as I could bring you, Hiroki.\" Mikako whispered. \"What's the plan now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I have been thinking ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around to face Shuhei as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Shuhei?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikako mentioned to me there are shrunken people working about in this compound, doing menial tasks. If that is true, then there must be some sort of ... tunnel network inside this whole compound. The three of us could use the subtle approach to accomplish this. I'm sure no one will notice us eavesdropping or snooping around their databases if they cannot see us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a valid point, Shuhei. However, I am more concerned if we get caught, either by the tiny 'drone-men' or by the giant girls inside this building.\" You then turned to Hiroshi. \"Hiroshi. You are the eldest here. Why don't you make a suggestion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shuhei's plan may be workable, but I am more concerned that time is not really on our side. Since Mikako mentioned that only A-ranked members know the true workings of this place, I'm sure at least one might be present right now. I say we either interrogate that person or swipe the pass card. It may not be a nice thing to to, but time is really not on our side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the one who called this investigation, Hiroki. You decide.\" Yuriko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour choice?</span></div></div>",

I say we go explore the tunnels first and then plot our next move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded after making your decision. After that, the two girls sneakily made their way around the compound, looking for what might be a tunnel entrance. Their search paid off, and sure enough, there was a door that was more suited for tiny people than for either Yuriko or Mikako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this is it, guys. Good hunting inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikako and Yuriko gently placed their palms closer onto the ground, allowing the three of you to disembark. The plan is that the three of you are going to look around inside the tunnels, while Yuriko and Mikako will circle around the area to avoid any patrols that might be present. Shuhei led the way, and pushed the door open. The tunnels were dark, and were barely any light from within. Quickly, all three of you reached out for your cellphones, and switched on the flashlight in-built into the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How anyone is able to move and walk around here is beyond me.\" Hiroshi remarked. Just then, as the three of you approached a junction, you could feel a source of light coming. The three of you quickly backed towards the side of a wall. The source of light came from another patrol incoming: two tiny guys. One was carrying an electric torch, the other with what appears to be an assault rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait for them to pass. Then we sneak up on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suggested. The Yamamoto brothers nodded in agreement with your decision. As the patrol passed by, the Yamamoto brothers swiftly knocked out the two guys with swift chops to their necks. Quickly, they picked up the electric torch and assault rifle. Hiroshi also noticed a pistol tucked away in one of the guys' uniforms, which he also took and handed it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firearms? This is a dangerous place indeed. Even though we are facing foes of our current size.\" Shuhei remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least now we have something for protection.\" You added. \"Hiroshi-san. You have the electric torch. You lead the way. We will cover you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expedition inside the tunnels of the continued until the three of you reached another T-junction.

Luckily for the three of you, there were barely any patrols around, so the path was clear. The light source was faint, but you could see the same kind of door when you guys first entered, only that one of the two doors was left ajar, explaining the source of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you exited the tunnels, taking a while to let your eyes get used to the light after being inside the dark for so long. The three of you appear to be in another room, but it appears to be empty.From your position, the left side has another door, only it was the size suitable for normal humans, On your right is what appears to be a stairwell as well as another tunnel entrance. As you looked upwards, there was a large sign that said \"Top Secret: Keep Out\". It seems you know where you guys should go next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached the tunnel entrance door, you could feel your ground shake, followed by loud sounds. It came from the stairwell, and you could see a normal-sized girl wearing the same school uniform coming up the stairs, and the ground shaking and loud sounds were caused by her footsteps. Strangely, she stopped walking right in front of the three of you. Her loafers felt like a size of a heavy tank to you guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you could barely see her face, so you tried to go around the side. However, before you could proceed, the girl simply shifted her left foot and dropped it down in front of you guys, blocking the way in the process. Taken aback, you looked up, and the girl was staring directly at the three of you. With her left hand, she started waving her finger about, signalling that the three of you are not going anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei and you then aimed your respective weapons at her, taking her aback if her facial appearance is any indication. Now comes the tricky part. One, neither of the weapons have been tested yet, and perhaps getting away from this giantess might save your behinds for a while. Then agaiin, the giantess is clearly not friendly, if her feet are any indication, and the only way to get by her is through the use of force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth are tough decisions, but you have to make the call.</span></div></div>",

Shuhei started firing shots at the shoe, but it apparently did nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it came down, all three of you scrambled away from the impact, but poor Hiroshi was not so lucky, being pinned underneath the heel of the shoe. The two of you could only watch in horror as Hiroshi gets grinded to a paste in front of you. Shuhei, clearly outraged at his brother's death, started charging at the shoe, firing his rifle until the magazine was empty. The giantess simply swung her foot towards Shuhei, and like someone being hit by an oncoming train, Shuhei was sent flying, his body making contact with the wall upon impact, before falling back down on the ground, motionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shuhei!\" You exclaimed as you rushed to your friend's side. Alas, the impact of hitting his head at such speed meant that Shuhei had already joined his brother into the embrace of death.

In one final step, she pinned you and Shuhei's lifeless body underneath the sole of her loafer, and pressing her entire weight on that position, your body could no longer handle the immense pressure, and you whited out, your body grinded into a pool of blood along with Shuhei's lifeless body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the two ladies were not as lucky either, as hearing the sound of the gunshots and following it to the source, they accidentally stumbled upon a patrol, who promptly subdued them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko and Mikako were never heard from again.

One of the doors at the end of the tunnel was left ajar, revealing the source of the light. However, as you could see what was behind the door, you guys sneaked towards the back of the still-closed door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting for a while, you then peered at whatever was behind the door, and then went inside. It turns out that what you had seen earlier had the silhouette was something unusual: a suit of armor, only slightly larger than your current size. Looking around, you found yourselves inside what appears to be an armory, but the size of the room was suitable for your current sizes. There were whole racks of weapons, from pistols to assault rifles and heavy weapons. The suit of armor you saw was placed at the center, probably as a showpiece to demonstrate the technological expertise of the Club. Near the end corner is a computer terminal, placed on a desk. All of the items were fitted for your current sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be where the Technology Club stores their weapons, and probably where this weapon came from.\" You said, looking at your pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't look like anybody is around. Come on, let's take a look around.\" Hiroshi said, and the three of you looked around the Technology Club's armory. Shuhei went to a rack of assault rifles similar to the one he had, and started looking around for more ammunition magazines. Hiroshi rummaged around the weapons cache, looking for a weapon for himself, while you headed to the computer terminal. However, despite your skills with using computers, most of the data inside the computer was highly encrypted, and the only thing you could work out was the weapons data of this particular armory. One thing that stood out was the blueprints for the suit of armor at the middle. There was a lot of technological jargon that you might ask Mikako about later, but the crucial thing you discovered was that the suit of armor was designed specifically to withstand being crushed by heavy objects. As you examine the statistics, you found a astounding discovery: a person wearing that suit could withstand being crushed by the feet of giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow ... that suit would certainly help things out for us.\" You exclaimed as you read the data. As you shut down the terminal, you saw a row of ammunition catridges on the desk. You looked up, and you saw Hiroshi placing down the last cartridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here. You will need these.\" Hiroshi said, pointing to your pistol. Hiroshi was carrying what appears to bea miniaturized minigun, with what appears to be a metallic oil drum-like backpack. \"Man, I thought this thing would be heavy when I first saw this. Imagine that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have something better: that suit of armor. It might increase our survivalbility.\" You pointed at the suit of armor, and telling the Yamamoto brothers of its properties, particularly its ability to withstand being crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds nice, Hiroki, but this thing is protected with some electronic field. You have to break it if you want to wear this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou headed towards the suit, and towards the console. Your coding skills were good, but the programming codes for the shield was also very well-written. You had to take a chance to decode and bring down the shield. After a while, you were done, and everything had to be left to the machine. Was it successful?</span></div></div>",

The power suit was now ready for one of you guys to use, which the Yamamoto brothers agreed that you should be the one wearing it, citing your ... physical limits. While flattered, you also felt somewhat insulted with the remark. You donned the power suit, with some help from the Yamamoto brothers, as it was not easy connecting the various interfaces inside the suit by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took 20 minutes to completely put you inside the power suit, but once inside, you could feel a sense of confidence. After all, now you were wearing something that could survive being crushed. Shuhei tossed you an assault rifle, which you managed to catch. It felt a little awkward (since you were not at least a head taller than the Yamamoto brothers) holding the rifle in your position, and even though you could move as per normal inside the suit, taking bigger strides than normal was going to take some getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you returned back into the tunnel, and headed to the left side, the only other exit in this section of the tunnel network. The three of you exited the tunnels, taking a while to let your eyes get used to the light after being inside the dark for so long. The three of you appear to be in another room, but it appears to be empty.From your position, the left side has another door, only it was the size suitable for normal humans, On your right is what appears to be a stairwell as well as another tunnel entrance. As you looked upwards, there was a large sign that said \"Top Secret: Keep Out\". It seems you know where you guys should go next.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs you approached the tunnel entrance door, you could feel your ground shake, followed by loud sounds. It came from the stairwell, and you could see a normal-sized girl wearing the same school uniform coming up the stairs, and the ground shaking and loud sounds were caused by her footsteps. Strangely, she stopped walking right in front of the three of you. Her loafers felt like a size of a heavy tank to you guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough your visor, you could see her face (albeit barely), so you tried to go around the side. However, before you could proceed, the girl simply shifted her left foot and dropped it down in front of you guys, blocking the way in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I recognize that suit!\" The girl said, almost piercing your eardrums. \"You two aren't part of the Technology Club, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you froze, and said nothing while the girl tried to recall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't ring a bell! Guess I have to dispose of you! Can't have you guys bellowing out our secrets, can we?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTerrified at the threat, Shuhei and you then aimed your respective weapons at her, taking her aback if her facial appearance is any indication. Now comes the tricky part. One, neither of the weapons have been tested yet, and perhaps getting away from this giantess might save your behinds for a while. Then agaiin, the giantess is clearly not friendly, if her feet are any indication, and only you are capable of surviving being crushed right now.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBoth are tough decisions, but you have to make the call.</span></div></div>",

Can I ask you guys to hold this place while I get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it fast, Hiroki! I have no idea what the Technology Club is gonna send here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and restarted the computer terminal again. You searched the desk, and to your delight, there was a portable hard drive inside one of the drawers, and it was still fresh (and suited for your size). Quickly, you plugged the device in, and started downloading the files onto the hard disk, only to find out that it required 10 minutes to complete the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bugger! 10 minutes!\" You exclaimed again. \"Well, at least this place has the weapons to keep us alive, even for a short while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time for any more smart remarks, as the first wave of attackers entered the armory: a bunch of sentry drones designed like mechanical pitbulls. Hiroshi wasted no time in firing his minigun, turning several of these mechanical dogs to scrap. Shuhei covered his brother, firing bursts of rounds with his assault rifle. Quickly, you grabbed your pistol, and joined in the firefight while the computer terminal does its work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not long before another wave of attackers came. This time, it was brainwashed students, shrunken to a similar size as yourself and armed with either stun rods or pistols. Hiroshi fired another burst of bullets, slowing them as they approached the armory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, try not to kill them. They are just brainwashed and not actually evil. Go for their arms or legs.\" You ordered, and the two brothers nodded. Shuhei was a crack shot with his assault rifle, and the two brothers worked well in tandem. Hiroshi's supressive fire managed to slow down the attackers, long enough for Shuhei to target their arms and legs for a shot. As for yourself, you had to stop any attackers that are getting too close to the computer terminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a minute left before the downloading process is complete, but the tide is turning. Both Yamamoto brothers are running out of bullets, and Hiroshi was firing his minigun in bursts. Shuhei was already down to his last magazine. The wave of sentry drones and brainwashed male students never seemed to end. Hastily, you rushed back to the terminal to have a look.

Just to make sure the damage was done, you fired a shot at the computer terminal, damaging it in the process. Hiroshi had dumped the minigun aside, taking an assault rifle (and some magazines) from the nearby weapon rack, and beckoned you to follow them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On Shuhei! Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei led the way back inside the tunnels, past the bodies of neutralized students and destroyed sentry drones. You knew you could not take the same way out, so you had to guess your way around the tunnels to find an exit. There was no shortage of sentry drones and brainwashed students out to disable the three of you, and at times, you guys had to run than fight. The real problem is whether the larger members of the Technology Club had also heard the alarm (the sound was awfully loud to your ears) and have they began searching for the intruders as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tunnel network around the Technology Club was vast, but despite the fact that the three of you had been running around for some time, there was no sign of a tunnel exit. Navigating in the dark was certainly not easy, and using the flashlights on the weapons is bound to draw attention. In addition, most of the tunnel doors appear to have been sealed shut. The Technology Club's security features had the three of you strangled in a noose, and it was a matter of time before the Technology Club tightened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you finally came to a particular tunnel entrance door. Strangely, it was not particularly sealed shut, though forcing it open would require force. You heard the sound of more sentry drones coming, so this was a risk to take. Gesturing the Yamamoto brothers, the three of you charged straight at the door. Strangely, the door was forced open, but you realized that the tunnel entrance was built above the floor, a considerable height in your terms.

After getting over the shock, you found yourself landing on something soft. The color resembled skin, and it was not until you noticed a very familiar pink bra cupping whatever you had landed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had somehow managed to land right into Yuriko's bosom, and onto her left breast. You looked up, and sure enough, Yuriko's eyes were staring right down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiro ... HMPH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko wanted to exclaim, but Mikako quickly gagged Yuriko's mouth with her hand. Mikako had also seen the three of you land in Yuriko's bosom, and while amused, cannot allow themselves to be compromised. Like the tiny brainwashed students, they had heard the alarm as well (though a fainter sound).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Yuriko. You need to handle three passengers for a while. Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikako led the way, while Yuriko (and the three passengers in her bosom) followed suit. Being familiar with the compound, Mikako led the rest of you inside what appears to be a small, dark room. It was not very big, about the size of a small bedroom, and there was a computer terminal, unfortunately the size suited for the two girls to use. The room was not well lit, so there was little chance of being discovered. At least it was large enough to contain two young schoolgirls inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikako went to the computer terminal desk, and took something out, while Yuriko carefully released her passengers out of her bosom, still embarrassed with what went down. Mikako then handed you what appears to be a computer laptop, miniaturized for your use at your current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" Yuriko asked, careful not to pierce your eardrums with the conversation..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My personal space.\" Mikako said. \"The Technology Club has quarters for senior staff, especially if they have to work on top-secret stuff. I got this when I received my C-class membership.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable.\" Yuriko remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki, I will need you to transfer your files from the hard drive to my computer. I will try and de-crypt them as much as I can.\" With that, Mikako used her cellphone to send a message to you, containing her e-mail address to transfer the files. In spite of the vast size differences, at least electronic communication is still possible, regardless of sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and the two of you began to start your work. Meanwhile, Yuriko went to have a little rest on Mikako's bed, while the Yamamoto brothers accompany Mikako. Transferring the files to Mikako was a slow process, even with the advent of more advance networking, and then there is the problem with de-crypting the data from the hard disk drive. As you finish transferring the last file, you suddenly began to feel sleepy, and then, your mind went blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were awoken by something nudging your head. As you regain consciousness, you noticed that it was Yuriko's pinkie finger gently nudging your head, being very careful not to squash you. As it turns out, Mikako had already finished de-crypting the data while you slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find anything, Mikako?\" Yuriko asked, looking at you before peering back at Mikako, still seated in front of the computer terminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is not much, unfortunately. Just a lot of weapons schematics and stuff. Although ... there is some kind of program software that I happened to find. It's some sort of ... virtual memory mumbo-jumbo that I am unable to explain. I know what it is, but I cannot explain it. Maybe it's best that I show you instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time is it now?\" Yuriko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, in the day.\" Mikako answered. \"Perfect timing too, since nobody besides the tiny male students working around at this hour. Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Yuriko held out her hand, allowing you to climb back aboard, which you did. Mikako opened the door, and just as she said, there was no one around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way.\" Mikako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(to be continued)</span></div></div>",

You were safe inside Yuriko's curled hand, albeit with some breathing room. In a way, this was a much better mode of travel, even though the softness of Yuriko's cleavage was ... unforgettable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikako stopped in front of door that labelled 'VR Facility' in kanji. Below it, a smaller green label tab with the kanji for 'Available' written on it. Mikako quietly slipped the tab aside, revealing a red label tab with 'In Session' in kanji on it. Slowly, she opened the door, peered around, and then quickly gestured Yuriko to enter. Quickly, Mikako locked the door, and switched on the lights. Once the lights were shone, what you saw immediately blew your eyes away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Yuriko's now open palm, you could see whole rows of what appears to be futuristic sarcophagi, with a lot of wiring connected to a central mainframe. All the sarcophagi were quite small in comparison to Yuriko, and you immediately knew who were meant to go inside those ... things. Mikako turned towards another room within the VR Facility, and as it turns out, was a monitoring facility, with several computers linked to the rows of sarcophagi-like boxes. Mikako immediately went to work, starting up the nearest available computer, and inserting the hard drive containing the files you collected into the system. After a while, one of the \"sarcophagi\" shone with a small, but very notable, green light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THERE!\" Mikako's sound over the broadcast suddenly took all of you by surprise. Yuriko quickly clasped her ears together, forgetting about you inside her palm momentarily. For a while, you had the pleasure of a full view of Yuriko's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH GOSH! SORRY!\" There was silence, and then you could feel yourself leaving Yuriko's ear, still inside her palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I forgot to adjust the mic volume.\" Mikako answered sheepishly. \"Yuriko, go ahead and place Hiroki inside that machine. The one flashing green.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko was about to ask what it was, but Mikako soon gave her the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a virtual reality simulation capsule, or VR capsule, as we call it. With this, you can experience the memories of whatever you found in those files. Just get in, lie down, and let the machine do the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko headed towards the target capsule, and gently let you down from her palm. You headed to the capsule, and opened it. The thought of entering the capsule felt creepy at first, but after mustering some courage, you went in. You laid down as Mikako order, and surprisingly, the interior of the capsule was not as bad as you thought, though it still felt a little creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuriko, close the capsule. You can retrieve Hiroki-kun later. Come join me here, and you can see the images too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko knelt down, and prepared to close the capsule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be back for you later, Hiroki-kun.\" She whispered, and her face was the last thing you saw before she closed the VR capsule shut. Immediately, everything felt cold and quiet. It was not long before you realize that there was some sort of helmet close to your head. Not knowing what might be in store, you quickly put the helmet-like device on. It was not long before your eyes were in sight of a blinding light. You wanted to close your eyes, but it was too late to remove the helmet. You were now being transported directly into the memory of the file you had found ...</span></div></div>",

There was no ceiling, and even though there was a floor, it was not anything special. You wondered if Mikako had tricked you, but suddenly, everything started turning wavy, and you felt like you were being pulled into a vortex. Then everything went black ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes, and you found yourself in a town of sorts. However, the architecture looked a lot like the sets from the Movie City in Osaka, where period dramas were filmed. Strangely, despite the appearance of a large town, there was no one in sight, even though the sun was high up in the sky. Something is amiss, you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down, and you found yourself wearing a tattered kimono and haori (Japanese baggy pants). You carried two swords, similar to a daisho pair in the period dramas. Curiously, you took one of the swords, and drew the sword out from its scabbard. Imagine your shock when you discover that it was a real sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" A familiar voice came from behind you. \"Can you stop admiring your sword and get ready? 'She' is almost here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around to face whoever spoke to you, and to your surprise. it looked like Shuhei, except he wore a chonmage hair style, wore similar clothes like you, and carried a long spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shuhei?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shuhei? Who's that?\" The person answered. \"I'm Sadauji. What, did you lose your memory, Harutoshi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could ask another question, you could hear some rumbling sounds. Surprisingly, it sounded like giant footsteps, as ever since you got smaller, you had gotten accustomed to that sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is starting to get way too familiar ...\" You mumbled to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, you could see a silhouette approaching the city, and in another surprise, the silhouette appeared humanoid. In fact, it felt eerily too similar to that of a female human being. As the silhouette got closer, the sound of the footsteps got louder, and the ground shook harder as the silhouette approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready!\" Sadauji said. raising his spear into a combat stance. You were never accustomed to kendo, but you decided to try and mimic some of the flashy sword movements you saw in the period dramas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the fog cleared up, and you could finally see whatever it was, which took you aback. It definitely looked like a human female in her early 20s, but 100 times bigger than a normal person. The figure was also butt-naked, with her breasts and womanhood in full show to you, with a crop of black hair, insanely long to be able to reach all the way to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were too stunned in your stance, admiring the figure in front of you in both awe and fear. Sadauji, however, did not seem fazed, aiming his long spear towards the giantess approaching the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko looked on at Mikako's screen, blushing at the sight in front of the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha ... what kind of lewd memory is this, Mikako-chan?\" Yuriko whispered, trying very hard not to raise her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. But we have no choice to keep watching.\" Mikako, as flustered as she was at seeing the butt-naked giantess, was trying to maintain composure so she can maintain the stability of the VR capsule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like where this is going ...\" Yuriko said ...</span></div></div>",

She was talking to another member, but there were too much jargon used that you had no idea what she was talking about. However, it appears like she was done talking, and she might leave again, a theory which you were proven right. Shizuka started walking again, and to the girls' horror, she was walking in the direction towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, there was a corner for them to hide, and Shizuka walked by without noticing either of them. Yuriko opened her hand, and you quickly signalled to her about your next course of action. Yuriko nodded, and gently walked towards Shizuka while Mikako waited at the corner. Yuriko crept closely behind Shizuka, much akin to the protagonist fron Ninja's Code. As soon as she got close, she reached her hand towards Shizuka's skirt pocket, allowing you to creep inside. Your tiny size allowed you to rummage around the skirt pocket, but asides a few coins, there was nothing resembling Mikako's card pass. You concluded that Shizuka must be carrying it in her breast pocket, a place not easily accessed, especially considering your mutual enmity and current sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawled out of the pocket, but Yuriko's hand was now further away. Making matters worse, Shizuka started picking up speed with her walking. You looked down, and trembled at the tremendous fall that awaits you if you jump. Hurriedly, Yuriko reached her hand out to pick you out of Shizuka's skirt pocket. Was she successful?</span></div></div>",

From the distance, you could see Yuriko's worried face, but after hearing footsteps, Yuriko had to turn away and hide. Meanwhile, your upper body was still poking out of Shizuka's skirt pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll is not lost, however. Since there was no way for Shizuka to hold that card pass all the time, and the card pass was not in her skirt pocket, there was only one place left for Shizuka to store her card pass: the breast pocket. Looking up, you noticed that Shizuka's long hair provides decent cover, and the uniform she is wearing seems easy to climb. Slowly, you got yourself out of her skirt pocket, and started climbing her back, using her hair as cover in case she starts probing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, you managed to climb up towards her shoulders, and in clear view of Shizuka's breast pocket ... and her breasts as well, cupped with a light purple bra. Resisting temptation, you could catch a glimpse of the pocket, and sure enough, the card pass is right there, with a giant 'A' labelled on it. Now comes the tricky part: Shizuka's walking motion is making your position very unstable, and with wrong timing, you could very well tumble right into Shizuka's breasts ... and into serious trouble. You positioned yourself, ready to make a plunge. After that, gravity starts to kick in, and you began your descent down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Now the question remaining is whether Lady Luck is smiling upon you today?</span></div></div>",

You tried to move it, and you noticed that it was not as heavy as you thought. You then thought of a new plan: drop the card out of Shizuka's pocket, and then get Yuriko to grab it before Shizuka knows it's missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the plan had to wait as you saw Shizuka's huge fingers reaching and taking the pass card away from the pocket. You had to wait for a loud beeping sound, before Shizuka replaced the card pass back in her pocket, taking you by surprise with the impact. You decided to take a look around at your surroundings, and to your surprise, you found yourself in some sort of conference room. Shizuka was seated at the table, with several giant-sized (in your perspective) ladies. Strangely, you could not find Hitomi among them. You can safely assume that these are the other 'A-ranked' members that Mikako mentioned earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies. This meeting is now in session.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud female voice boomed in the air. It seems that Shizuka is now in a meeting of sorts, and it might take some time before she is done here, putting the \"toss card pass out\" plan on hold. However, there was another opportunity for you. You took out your cellphone, and to your relief, it still had about 60% of power remaining. It was a matter of time before the meeting begins, and your cellphone capabilities presented you with two potential options. One, use the recording device to eavesdrop on this \"high-level conference\" and expose the plans of the Technology Club. Two, try and sneak Shizuka's pass card out by luring her out of the conference and then getting Yuriko to grab it. Both have their risks, but if successful, you believe the Technology Club's schemes could be exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

With your cellphone, you opened the application for voice recording, and held it out of the pocket to capture the sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ranked member, Rika Ayase, will begin the meeting.\" One of the voices said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am very pleased to report that the experiments of the shrinking ray have been a great success. As we speak, the preparations for the 'Master Plan' is already in motion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Plan? So the Technology Club does have something planned, but you need to find out what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is the progress on the clean up actions?\" Another voice asked.  \"No one must find out too much about the Master Plan, and the technologies we will be using?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regretfully, the clean up process has not been smooth. But we are doing our best to ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing your best is not enough!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizuka interrupted, standing up and slamming her hand down on the floor in the process. Her actions suddenly took you aback, but luckily, you were safe inside her pocket, and she had not noticed her \"passenger\" ... so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you even know the urgency of the Master Plan? All our weapons and technologies are waiting on the success of the shrinking ray. Do you have any idea what will happen if anyone, and I mean anyone, know about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kinugawa, I ... I ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Shizuka-chan.\" The second voice rang out, stopping the argument. \"I appreciate your concerns, but do not forget why this whole Technology Club was formed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To ... to help propel mankind into a new age?\" Shizuka murmured, somewhat embarrassed by her outburst. After a awkward silence, she sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Let Ayase-chan finish her job, though I agree that we must speed up the cleaning up operations. If only the world knows what we are doing over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause, and then the girl called Ayase continued following another question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any word on ... 'it'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ... It, Chairwoman? According to these reports ...\" Ayase panickedly flipped through her papers. \"We might have a problem. 'It' ... has been showing signs of awakening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As expected. Don't worry, Ayase-chan. When 'zero hour' really occurs, the Technology Club will be ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was too much jargon used for the rest of the meeting, but as you recorded the conversation, you could vaguely work out the details od the 'Master Plan'. Apparently, the shrinking ray technology is the key for the success of the 'Master Plan'. However, you need to decipher the jargon before you can figure out the missing parts of the 'Master Plan'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not long before the meeting ended, and Shizuka left the meeting. However, instead of following the crowd, Shizuka moved in a different direction, apparently going deeper inside the underground facilities of the Technology Club. She stopped in front of a door with the kanji for 'top secret' boldly painted on it. Shizuka reached for her pass card (you were still safe in your pocket), and tapped it on the card reader. The door then opened with a loud and slow whirling voice, and Shizuka entered. This place was less illuminated than the upper levels, and it appears to have no one working here. Shizuka eventually reached a dead end, with doors on both the left and right side. You were not familiar with this place, so you have to go with whatever Shizuka is planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich door did Shizuka choose to enter?</span></div></div>",

By this time, you had gotten used to it, and the only thing you need to watch out was where the card will land once Shizuka was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peered out of the pocket, and you could see Shizuka walking down some dark underground tunnel. It was not long before Shizuka entered a chamber of sorts. However, what you saw inside the chamber was nothing you have ever seen in your entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chamber area was huge, and from Shizuka's standing position, you could see what it was the Technology Club had contained. It was not something mechanical or futuristic, but it had the appearance of a human female ... assuming it was human sized in the first place. It was nearly a hundred times larger than the average human, and you can imagine how small you would have been in comparison. What you were to Shizuka, Shizuka is exactly that to whatever that thing was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Centuries ago ... right here on this very land, the great one, known in this country as 'the Oni', appeared upon this world, and began to spread fear and terror on the populace. The Oni would have had her way, if not for the interference of the hated descendant of the 'True Blood', and her samurai retainer. What they could not slay, they bind. The samurai warrior managed to wound the great one despite their size differences, allowing time for the 'True Blood' descendant to cast her binding spell, imprisoning the great one and ending the Oni's rampage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big question in your mind is why Shizuka started talking like that, especially with the tale of the Oni, presumably referring to whatever the Technology Club had imprisoned in this chamber. However, what was clear to you was that the Technology Club had kept this secret away, and when you looked at the still dormant Oni, there was a good reason why. Judging from the meeting you managed to tape earlier, you know that the Technology Club intends to deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon, that binding spell will fade ... and the great Oni shall rise once again to claim her rightful place as ruler of the human realm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour assumptions were soon proven true, and that the Technology Club had been planning all this time to possibly shrink the Oni as a last resort. However, what you are about to hear was truly not what you had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will personally see to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose few words spoken felt like a hard wedge driven down your ears and right down into your spine. As of now, you are the only one who knows of Shizuka's true intentions, and as you observed the dormant Oni, you could only fear the worst. At this time, your mind was in a state of assumptions and verifications, trying to piece all the pieces of the puzzle together. You have no idea how Shizuka intends to betray the Technology Club, but you know that she must be stopped before she unleashs the Oni onto the streets of Tokyo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizuka then turned around, and left the chamber, possibly to resume blending in with the Technology Club. At the same time, you had some time to counter Shizuka's intentions. Of course, all this will have to wait until you can re-establish contact with your allies. Safely inside Shizuka's breast pocket, you started planning.</span></div></div>",

Blushing, you looked away, focusing on the sight and smell of Mikako's pink panties. As it turns out, school was indeed over, and Mikako had already stopped walking. You had no idea why she had stopped, but then you heard the sound of rattling metal. You guessed that Mikako was home, and she was opening the door to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am home.\" Mikako said aloud. There was no response, which means nobody was home. Mikako quickly took off her shoes, and entered the house. You could hardly see anything from the view of the panties, but you could briefly see the floor tiles go by as Mikako continued walking. Mikako walked up a flight of stairs, and entered a room, which you presumed was her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikako then dropped her school bag onto the floor, and unknown to you, started stripping. From your view, you could see the overcoat from the uniform fall onto the floor, followed by the tie ribbon. The undershirt followed, and soon, you could see Mikako's hands reaching for her skirt. In the next instant, you saw the skirt drop down onto the floor, and you could see her legs gradually unslip from the skirt. You saw the hands return, and in the next instant, you started feeling like you are falling down. You looked up, and you could see Mikako's ass rising upwards. Mikako was taking off her panties as well ... with you inside as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the panties were off, Mikako quickly slipped her feet away from the panties, still wearing those socks. As you look up, you could see Mikako's legs extend right up to the ceiling. You could not see her face, but you could see that she was naked, wearing only a bra. Flustered at seeing Mikako's nude body, you buried your head inside Mikako's panties again, trying not to look. All you heard were footsteps, then the opening and closing of a nearby drawer. The sound of the drawer felt like the sound of furniture moving: very unpleasant. After a while, you mustered your courage again, and looked up at Mikako. Luckily for you, she had already changed clothes. All you noticed was that Mikako was wearing a sleeveless top and short shorts. Mikako walked towards her bed, and sat down. After that, she started to remove her socks from her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother voice rang out, coming from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikako-chan, are you home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice continued. Despite the panties distorting the voice, you could still make out that it belonged to a woman, probably in her early 20s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my room, Kanako onee-san.\" Mikako shouted back, almost blowing out your eardrums with her voice. It got so unbearable that you had to cover your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought back some goodies. Do you want some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice identified as belonging to someone named Kanako answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I will be right over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that instant, Mikako got off her bed, dropping her socks onto the clothing pile you were in, and left the room, slamming the door shut. You were all alone inside Mikako's room, and Mikako had been oblivious to her tiny passenger all this time. It might be some time before Mikako gets back, but whether she is the right person to help you out remains a question mark. You could stay inside the clothing pile, or you could leave it and explore and possibly getting Mikako's attention. The decision is yours.</span></div></div>",

From your view, you could see Mikako's huge form picking up her skirt, and following that, she dropped the skirt in a nearby light blue mesh basket. Strangely, she saved the panties for last (you along with it), and placed it on the very top of the clothing pile, now inside the light blue basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikako then leaned over to pick up the basket, bringing it up to her chest level. You could see the large \"You Can Fly\" print on her top, extruded by the size of her breasts. Mikako did not bother to look at her clothing pile, only that she had clothing to wash. Carrying her laundry basket, she left her room. As she walked, you finally got a look at Mikako's house. It was quite big, even for normal standards, which may indicate that her family is quite wealthy. Mikako then turned and walked down the stairs, the motion causing you to bump about uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikako then entered the main kitchen of the house, and you saw that Mikako was not alone. Inside was another woman, who looked no younger than 22. Her appearance really resembled Mikako, except for her longer hair, and her more \"mature\" figure, particularly her breasts, which looked much bigger than Mikako's. This woman must be the \"Kanako onee-san\" that Mikako answered earlier<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to take a shower. I will prepare dinner for us later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanako said, her voice ringing loudly in the air. In that instant, Kanako turned around, and entered the nearby bathroom, closing the door shut. As you saw Mikako's elder sister entering the shower, you suddenly felt a swift motion, as if you were pulled down by a powerful magnet. Mikako had dropped the clothing basket to the floor, and after regaining your composure, you saw Mikako facing a large washing machine. It was obvious that she was going to wash the clothes inside the pile. Mikako's fingers then reached for her panties, the very one you were hidden in. Looking around, you noticed that the meshes were large enough for you to climb down ... assuming you can safely land down there. That said, your window of opportunity is slim, so taking a risk might not be worth it. Did you?</span></div></div>",

Wasting no time, you headed towards the nearest climbable feature, and started making your way down the laundry basket. All this time, Mikako was busy loading her uniform inside the washing machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you landed on the floor, you saw Mikako's huge frame pressing some buttons, each responding with a loud \"beep\". After that, she reached back down, and took the laundry basket with her, and promptly walked away. You had planned to get Mikako's attention, but now that option was thrown out the window. Still wanting to get some attention, your only option left is the woman inside the shower: Kanako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you scrambled towards the bathroom, and quickly climbed up and down the step. It appears that luck is really on your side, and you were able to fit through the gap below the bathroom door. Once inside, you looked up, and what you saw could reduce a fully grown man to a stammering wreck. Kanako's huge frame was standing right in front of you, and she was still wearing her underwear, presumably still in the process of stripping. Kanako then proceeded to unstrap and remove her bra, exposing her breasts for your eyes to enjoy. For the second time in one day, you saw a girl taking off her panties right in front of you. Briefly, you were able to enjoy the sight of Kanako's naked body, and you quickly placed your hand over your face, fearing a nosebleed. Kanako then walked towards the nearby clothing hooks, and swapped her lingerie for a bath towel hanging by a hook. After that, she walked towards the main shower cubicle, and closed the curtain. All you could see was Kanako's silhouette behind the curtain, followed by the sound of water flowing inside the shower cubicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanako let off a sound of relief as she felt the cooling water splashing on her body. After seeing her naked body, you started visualizing Kanako's body reacting to the cold water. Still holding your hand over your face, you slowly walked forward towards the shower cubicle. However, now that your mind was clouded with thoughts of Kanako's body, it really depends on where your body wants to go now.

It turns out that cubicle had a step built in to prevent water from flowing out. You were drenched from the fall, and when you got back up to your feet, you found yourself surounded by water up to your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of you, underneath the huge waterfall that is the shower, Kanako's huge naked figure stood, letting the water rain down on her body. You watched the water flow down Kanako's body, from her head down to her beasts, down to her slender tummy and slowly flowing down her legs. Despite the water weighing down your movement, you gradually moved forward towards Kanako, like a moth towards a glowing light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanako's foot slamming down inches away from you suddenly gave you a rude wake-up call. As you saw Kanako's toes in front of you, you looked up and saw the great size difference between you and Mikako's sister.Water kept flowing down from Kanako's body, meaning a climb up Kanako's body is impossible. Kanako continued to hum a very familiar tune, completely oblivious to the tiny voyeur by her foot. More and more water continued to enter your clothing, weighing you down to an extent that you are unable to walk without wringing some water out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kanako was done with her shower, as the water stopped flowing. You knew that you could not climb the step out of the shower cubicle, so you had to bank on Kanako to give you \"a lift\" out. Looking up, you saw Kanako drying herself with her bath towel. As she started wrapping the bath towel around her body, you knew time was running out. Quickly, you grabbed hold of her foot, and started climbing up, not stopping until you reached the base. Kanako started walking, lifting her foot up, along with a tiny passenger. However, even after some wringing, water was still present inside your clothes, and gravity was starting to kick in. As Kanako walked, will the water in your clothes make you slip off her foot, or will you be able to hang on until you were out of the shower cubicle? You decide.</span></div></div>",

You noticed a trickle of blood coming down from your nose, and you quickly placed your hand over it, trying to stop the bleeding. From a distance, you could no longer hear the sound of water flowing, and you could see the hanging bath towel disappearing inside the shower curtain. Kanako was done with her shower. Unsure of what to do, you quickly dashed back inside the bra cup, and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Kanako's footsteps got louder and as her feet got closer, you could feel the ground tremble as Kanako approached. Seeing her fallen bra, Kanako picked it up. As she picked up her bra, you noticed the light getting brighter. Quickly, you grabbed hold of Kanako's bra fabric, and you got hoisted up like something from the amusement park. Kanako did not bother looking at the bra, and quickly changed, replacing her bath towel with her underwear. As she slipped her bra back on, you were \"thrown\" right into the bra cup, and the flesh that is Kanako's right breast started pressing on your body. Still oblivious to the tiny passenger inside her bra, Kanako continued to get changed. You were now trapped inside Kanako's bra, with her right breast for companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interior of Kanako's bra felt like an oven, cooking you inside. The heat became so unbearing that you started to climb out, using Kanako's flesh as a means to climb, avoiding her nipple to prevent startling her. Kanako was wearing a short sleeved white top over her underwear, and as you climbed out of Kanako's breasts and reached the base of her neck, you could smell something. Something good. Turning around, you saw that Kanako was cooking something on a kitchen stove. This was not tbe best time to reveal yourself, you thought to yourself. As you waited, the only thing you could do was to enjoy the smell of Kanako's cooking. Kanako's cooking skills are almost at par with Reiko's, and the temptation to crawl into the food became stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Kanako was done, and she placed the dishes on the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikako-chan! Dinner is ready!\" Kanako shouted, nearly piercing your eardrums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanako then took her seat at the dining table, waiting for her younger sister to show up. As Kanako waited, you feel that this might be the right time to escape and perhaps, reveal yourself, and maybe getting a meal too. Then again, everything has its risks, and you were not quite sure what might happen if you leave. Do you want to get off Kanako's body now?</span></div></div>",

Your stomach was growling, but you decided it was best to not reveal yourself. Slowly, you slid back underneath Kanako's shirt, being very careful not to startle her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sis!\" Mikako said as she entered the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikako sat down beside her sister on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Itadakimasu.\" Both sisters said before they started digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made you ill and uneasy as you saw the two sisters digging into the food. The sisters helped themselves to Kanako's cooking, taking pieces of sliced meat and chopped vegetables, most of which larger than you, and placed them in their mouths. The thought that it could have been you only added to the uneasiness, and even though you were hungry, you were not ready to die underneath the teeth of either of the Nagama sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had two more guys asking me out at the office this week.\" Kanako began. \"But I turned them both down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long do you want to keep being single, nee-san?\" Mikako said. \"Seriously, though, do you want Grandpa to nag at you again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikako, I'm 22.\" Kanako said. \"I still have a career to think about before I can think about settling down. Besides, none of the guys at the workplace are of any interest to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still as picky as ever.\" Mikako said. \"I know that with that figure of yours, every man in Japan will gladly eat out of your hand, but how long will that last?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanako placed a handful of rice into her mouth. Luckily for you, a grain fell into her cleavage, and none of the sisters noticed. You promptly took it, and started eating the grain of rice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until I find my own Mr. Right.\" Kanako said. \"How is Shuhei treating you anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikako paused, but said nothing. She gingerly reached for another piece of meat, and put it right in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is ... is everything alright, Mikako-chan?\" Kanako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ... I had a fight with Shuhei.\" Mikako muttered. \"Shizuka told me that Shuhei had been seeing Hitomi behind my back. When I saw the two together, I really thought he had cheated on me. We quarreled, and he said he never wanted to see me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikako took a brief pause before she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuriko was the one who cleared it up. It turned out that Shuhei and Hitomi were only just discussing homework, and Shizuka had set me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened?\" Kanako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh ... before Yuriko helped to clear up the misunderstanding, Shizuka made me do ... something.\" Mikako sheepishly said. \"And then Yuriko told me about the homework thing. It turned out Hitomi was asking around for help with homework.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You plan on apologizing to Shuhei?\" Kanako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ... I don't know if I will see Shuhei again, though ...\" Mikako slowly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hatred for Shizuka escalated further when you heard the conversation and about how she tried to break up Mikako and Shuhei. Also, it seemed like both Mikako and Shizuka know something about your shrinking, along with probably a lot of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Mikako placed her bowl and utensils down, and hurried out, leaving Kanako puzzled. Kanako continued eating her meal, still oblivious of the passenger inside her bra. You, however, knew that Mikako was the key to undoing your current shrunken state. Somehow, you have to get her attention, and at the same time not get killed. However, for now, you will have to wait till Kanako is asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours went by as you observed Kanako cleaning up the table, washing the dishes and then watching some television before she finally headed for her bed, ready to sleep. Imagine your surprise when Kanako took off the white top and placed it on her table. This was followed by her shorts, which she placed on top of her shirt. Letting off a loud yawn, Kanako crept on her bed, and laid there. After a while, Kanako was finally asleep, and you were able to crawl out of her bra. You got out, and you were treated to the amazing landscape that is Kanako's body. You noticed a trickle of blood coming out of your nose, and you quickly wiped it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an urge inside your body to have some \"fun\" with Kanako's body, but at the same time, you think that if there was anyone that can restore your size, it's Mikako. However, trying to go from Kanako's room to Mikako's room felt like tracking the entire length of Tokyo at your size. In addition, maybe Kanako will not mind if you had some \"fun\" with her body until the morning, and then you can try and get close to Mikako again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

Shaking off the pink fabric, you made a mad dash towards the exit, only for Mikako's skirt to be thrown right into your path, stopping you in your tracks. The undershirt and overcoat followed suit, and you could see Mikako slamming the door of the washing machine shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know very well what happens next, as from your view, you saw Mikako stand up, with only her lower body and upper legs visible to you. This was followed by several loud \"beeps\" coming from the top. Mikako was giving the washing machine input data to wash her clothing. After a brief pause, you could see water streaming in from below. The water started foaming, meaning it was soapy water. You realized what was going on, and quickly, you scrambled around the clothing pile, looking for a safe spot to wait out the \"washing ordeal\". By a stroke of luck, you managed to find Mikako's breast pocket in the overcoat. Seeing the water dampening the clothing, you wasted no time and crawled in, doing your best to seal the pocket. It was not long before you noticed your surroundings getting wet too. It was not long before the whole place got flooded with soapy water, and the washing machine began its work to rinse the clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ordeal was unpleasant, even from the safety of the breast pocket. You could see the water swirl around like a huge watery tornado, throwing Mikako's clothing around inside the washing machine. The constant swirling motion quickly showed its effect, overcoming your head with giddiness. There was no more sense of direction and balance, and you fainted inside Mikako's breast pocket. The washing machine remained oblivious, continuing the work that Mikako had programmed it to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a while before your mind finally regained consciousness, and you opened your eyes again. It was a blur, but you had your back on the ground, and it was still, which meant the washing ordeal was over. You started looking around for your glasses, and in a stroke of luck, you noticed your glasses on your stomach. Quickly, you took it, and placed it back in front of your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere you still inside the breast pocket?</span></div></div>",

You open your eyes, and to your surprise, you find yourself inside Mikako's large intestine.

You then continued walking forward through the large intestine. It was dry, and any water would have been absorbed by the bacteria surrounding it. As you continued your journey, you wondered how and why you were still alive and not yet digested. You finally came to a conclusion: you were too large to be absorbed, and you were pushed right into the large intestine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to walk all the way through the large intestine, and you were close to her rectum, and your exit out of Mikako's body.

Her eye at your size really seems intimidating, and you really want to panic, but you have resigned yourself to whatever fate that awaits you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki-kun?\" Mikako whispered, being careful not to raise her voice and rattle your eardrums. \"Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she cannot hear you, so you gingerly nodded your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I saw you, otherwise I might have accidentally eaten you.

Puzzled, you gave her a weird look, and scratched your head to make it \"believeable\", but Mikako simply smiled at you. She reached into her breast pocket with her left hand, which you notice had a rather noticable bulge in it, and pulled out another tiny guy from her pocket. Gently, she lowered her left hand into an open palm, and placed you on it. The other tiny guy then slid down her thumb and landed on her palm.

My brother and I were parking our bikes at the school carpark when we find ourselves getting smaller and smaller, along with our bikes. My brother and I decide to split up and search for clues. I rode around the school (which was a blast, by the way), and I kind of bumped into somebody's foot by accident. I blacked out, but I was lucky, since I bumped into my girlfriend's shoe of all people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Mikako, who simply smiled at you from above, and then back at Shuhei. If it was not for their size differences, they do make a photogenic couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is a surprise.\" You answered. \"OK, my turn. I found this underground lab of sorts, and this machine activated, and I found myself at this size. I almost got trampled, and if Mikako didn't see me, I would be going on a one way trip into Mikako's digestive system. I want to investigate the lair, but I don't think I can do this alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuhei nodded, and signalled to Mikako, who picked him up from her palm and brought him close to her ear, and relayed your story to her. Judging from the look on her face, Mikako did not appear surprised about your story, and after a while, placed Shuhei back onto her palm again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The underground lair you say, Hiroki, is actually a research facility.

The two of you continued talking and walking together all the way to the school grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school grounds was so big, you could not even put a word to describe it. The school compound also houses multiple blocks as opposed to just one in the past, and much of the school grounds had been refurbished. In the past, this was a prestigous girls' school until for some reason, enrolment declined. Never had you expected that such a huge and brand-new school compound was built on the so-called \"haunted\" school building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Daisuke looked around, it seems that there are more female students than males, even after the M &amp; A scheme. While Daisuke drooled over the prospects of getting a date, you looked as a huge board with your names allocated into different classes. It turns out, you, Daisuke and Yuriko, by a stroke of luck, were all allocated into class 2-C.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two toads still stick together, it seems!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember that annoying voice, and your biggest fears were confirmed when you turned around. It was Shizuka Kinugawa, one of the brightest but meanest girls in your old school. A social butterfly on the outside, \"pure evil\" on the inside as described by Daisuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew someone like you would still be around, though I wonder how that dumb Daisuke even made it through selection. Then again, it still gives me another chance to show my superiority around here. Just you wait and see, Iketani!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still as annoying as ever. You never change, Kinugawa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph! I have better things to do than chat with a bunch of outcasts as yourselves. I'm going to dominate class 2-C! You will see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizuka then walked off, with annoyed looks on Daisuke's face. Nothing eventful happens after finding out your class allocations, and the whole assembly went by quickly. It was soon time for class. Which class first?</span></div></div>",

You guys were learning about electronics, and your first task involves dismantling an electronic device provided on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile working on the device, you had not noticed that Shizuka had secretly plugged the device to an electric output, probably waiting for a chance to get back at you. She had calculated that if the device should suddenly overcharge, it would explode in your face, resulting in a very embarrassing situation for you. Secretly, she then flipped the switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZZAP!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then felt a huge surge of electronic energy flowing through you from your finger, the pain causing you to cry out. The next moment, you were blown away from your work desk and fell on the floor, but still conscious. Shizuka's plan had backfired, as everyone quickly rushed to your aid after the freak accident. To the amazement of everyone, the device did not explode, but it is too fried to do anything to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HIROKI! Are you all right? Speak to me man!\" Daisuke said with a panicking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, but I think I need to lie down ... \" you said with a very weak tone from the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe physics teacher saw everything, and told Yuriko to take you to the Health Room. Even though a girl was carrying you, the pain from the electic surge was too overwhelming for you to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, after a while, you were placed on a bed, still weary. You had a glimpse of the teacher examining you. Surprisingly, she looked only in her early 20s, and had a well-endowed figure. She had long black hair and very beautiful features on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, will he be all right?\" Yuriko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will be. Though the electric charge was enough to cause pain, I'm quite surprised that he actually managed to take all that and survive. Though not dangerous, that much electric power flowing through your body can kill if it strikes any vital organs. All his organs seem OK, so I'll say no harm done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear.\" Yuriko replied. Later, she noticed something about the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but I think I have seen you somewhere before,. Another thing, aren't you a little too young to be doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have. I'm a former student here, and the principal offered this job for me to fund my studies. I'm Motoko Kijima, nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you looked familiar. A member of the honor roll, and studying in a prestigious university. Wait, aren't you studying mechatronics, so how did you end up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was studying biology and human medicine, but I got bored and switched courses ... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou passed out, unable to continue hearing their conversation. The pain had subsided, but you felt a weird sensation going through your body while sleeping. Though not painful, it still felt a little funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up after a while. You looked at your watch, and realized you had slept for about two hours. You look up, and you still find yourself in the Health Room, though the ceiling looked way too high up for some reason. No one is around. You find your pillow missing, yet you were still sitting down on the bed. You stood up, and you finally realized what happened: you had shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou headed towards the edge of the bed, and carefully made your way down the bed. As you headed towards the door, you heard loud thumping sounds behind the door. Each thump sounded louder and louder, and the sound feels like it's coming this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens, and you saw a giant entering the room. You saw the giant's foot coming down towards you, you quickly dodged as the huge foot slammed down inches away from you. You had a look at the shoe, and then looked up. You knew who it was. It was ... </span></div></div>",

Wha ... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko rushed towards the now empty bed, her footsteps sounding like huge objects falling down from tremendous heights. She saw the empty bed, and of course, didn't find you there. Even if you had stayed on your bed, it would still be quite scary to look at Yuriko's now gigantic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother voice boomed from behind you, and you see another pair of feet, this one wearing a pair of black heels, the same pair that Ms. Kijima had worn. There's no doubt: it was Ms. Kijima. As she walked over you (without stepping on you) towards Yuriko, you then realized how small you were now and how easy it would be to get killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki's not in his bed! Did you see him, Ms. Kijima?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw him in this bed half an hour ago, but I got held up meeting the principal. He must have gone back to class.

After surveying the office, Ms. Kijima just silently got back to her desk and continued her work. It was as if you did not exist, as you saw for yourself. You have no idea how you got shrunk, but you need to get some help. You can try and go after Yuriko, get Ms. Kijima's attention over there, or find help somewhere else. Your call.</span></div></div>",

A huge din surrounded the air, but luckily for you and your ears, you can't really hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way around the corridor, hoping to look for a possible ally, but all you see are feet and lots of stomping all around you.

Though the impact was not as painful as you thought, the appearance of a carrier bag in front of you still took you aback. As you circled around the bag, you noticed that the bag is open, and the position of the strap makes it easy for you to crawl in. You look up, and you see a huge skirt blocking the view above you, the pinkish panties the main attraction inside the skirt.

You frantically waved your arms about, hoping your childhood friend would see you, but to no avail. Making matters worse, as Yuriko got back up to a standing position, her hand was also hanging downwards, which makes standing at your position impossible, causing you to fall off. If that happens, all your efforts would surely be in vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no chances, you started climbing up Yuriko's palm, and made your way through her uniform sleeve ad up her lower arm. You decided that if she cannot see you, you have to get closer to her face, mainly her eyes or ears. You had never been at the peak of physical fitness, but human skin is surprisingly soft and easy to grab. Using that advantage, you kept climbing Yuriko's lower arm, and made your way up towards her main elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly got the scare of your life when you saw the outline Yuriko's other hand slamming right below you. You thought that she might have seen you and mistaken you for a bug, but to your relief, she only started stratching with her fingers. You have to be slightly more careful at climbing Yuriko's arm now, as she could clearly feel you now, her scratching matches the position you were in a few moments ago. Even if she cannot see you, she can still feel you inside her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reach her shoulder, and you could see how small you were to Yuriko, like how an insect would see the human body as a landscape to move about. This also caused you to notice Yuriko's firm breasts down there, like the size of large and soft hills cupped by a pinkish-white bra. As tempting as that may be, you still wanted to get Yuriko's attention, and that involves climbing up towards her face, which could be more dangerous than climbing her arm.

Then again, Yuriko had been your closest friend since you two were children, and as tempting as it may be to explore Yuriko's body, she trusts you enough not to do anything funny while you were inside, as much as you were bored out of your mind inside the pocket after all this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth decisions felt like you had an angel and devil on your shoulder, each presenting their case, the former on staying put and the latter on leaving.

Straight above you was Shizuka's panties, while below you, Shizuka's fingers were still probing around, hoping to catch an itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing whatever pride you had left, you decided there was only one option left: crawl into Shizuka's panties. As embarrassing as it may sound or be, it was the only place Shizuka would not probe, at least not in public. Uncovering the light purple fabric, you opened a small gap, and wriggled inside. As you got inside the fabric, you could see the shape of Shizuka's fingers probing around. You watched in horror and prayed that Shizuka does not try to probe her panties as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the fingers moved away, and you heaved a sigh of relief. Shizuka started speaking, but being inside her panties, it was rather muffled, but you could still make out what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid bug must have flown away. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was one problem solved for now, but now you have another problem. You were inside Shizuka's panties, and it did not feel very comfortable inside. You looked up, and immediately blushed as you realized that it was Shizuka's privates right above you. You have always dreamed of getting \"inside\" Yuriko, but never in your life would you have thought about going \"inside\" Shizuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her privates again, you then remembered all the humiliation and tauntings that Shizuka had spewed at you all these years, never admitting that you were just better. A devious plan hatched inside your mind, and it involved going inside Shizuka.The choice is yours. Which \"entrance\" do you choose?</span></div></div>",

Avoiding the smaller hole that leads to Shizuka's anus, you decided to go for the \"bigger prize\": Shizuka's pussy. You're not sure what was going to happen if you go in, but you decided that you need to show Shizuka that being smaller does not necessarily mean you are powerless. Rubbing your hands together, you started climbing the light purple fabric that is Shizuka's panties, and got into position. You jumped towards Shizuka's crotch, grabbing onto a few strands of pubic hair. Luckily, Shizuka had not felt anything ... yet. Gently, you made your way down Shizuka's crotch, and made your way towards Shizuka's pussy. It looked like a fleshy cavern with lip-like features to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more you stared at the pussy, the more you are determined to do this. You placed your hands on each \"lip\", and placed your head inside the pussy. Looking up, you saw Shizuka's vagina. It looked like a red, fleshy vertical cavern in your position. You decided to go ahead with climbing, and even though you were not in the peak of physical fitness, somehow this empowered you with strength you never thought you have. Like the protagonist from \"Ninja's Code\", you mimiced the movements of vertical climbing, using the fleshy red walls to pull yourself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you climbed further up and deeper into Shizuka's vagina, your actions inevitably got Shizuka's attention. Shizuka found herself \"turned on\" for some reason, but as it was still in the middle of class, she decided to just wait until later before finding out what it was. Meanwhile, you managed to get yourself deep inside Shizuka's vagina. No man, or even their \"cocks\", has ever been this deep inside Shizuka before, you thought to yourself. Right up ahead of you is the gateway to Shizuka's womb: her cervix. Shizuka was already being turned on by your climbing, and you could continue this for a while, at least until lessons were over and Shizuka starts \"investigating\". Then again, vertical \"spleunking\" inside a girl's reproductive system has never been done before, and this could do wonders for your reports on biology in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is your decision?</span></div></div>",

However, instead of trying to go inside Shizuka's womb, you decided to have a little ... \"fun\" with Shizuka's cervix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching one hand out, you started grabbing the fleshy bulge, and using your fingers, started stroking the fleshy thing gently. Slowly, you applied more pressure as you could feel her cervix reacting to your little \"actions\". The muffled echo of Shizuka's moaning also meant that she is definitely feeling something touching her. Grinning, you kept your fingers on her cervix, continuing your little actions,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizuka, meanwhile, was already blushing red after feeling the effects of your stroking. Unable to take it any longer, she was forced to press her hand down on her skirt to try and resist the looks she was getting from her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shizuka-chan, Are you OK?\" Hitomi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N ... no ... there is something inside my ...\" Shizuka said, holding back trying to moan in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say it, then.\" Hitomi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Shizuka then started whispering into Hitomi's ear, and her words gave Hitomi a funny look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what!\" Hitomi exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHHH!\" Shizuka gestured with her other finger, still flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound resonated from the teacher's desk, with the teacher giving Shizuka and Hitomi \"the look\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sensei.\" Hitomi started. \"Is it all right if I accompany Shizuka-chan to the bathroom? I think something's not right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher said nothing, but simply beckoned them towards the door, as if telling them to just go. Hitomi thanked the teacher, and helped Shizuka out of the classroom, still feeling flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the vaginal passage, you could see thick liquid being oozed out of her cervix, and gradually spreading across the entire passage. The liquid was making the surroundings very slippery, and Shizuka's walking only means that it is getting very unstable inside. You had heard Hitomi saying that they were going to the bathroom, so it is highly likely you will get caught if you continued in there. You have had your fun, and a small measure of revenge against Shizuka, so maybe it's time to just get out of here before you get caught. Then again, you thought that you could always hide in her womb if either Shizuka or Hitomi's fingers started probing around. Your call.</span></div></div>",

After all, letting Shizuka speculate on what was inside her all this time would have been the perfect measure of revenge after all that torment she put you through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the thick liquid surrounding you to help, you slowly slid down the vaginal passage, careful not to go too fast or risk Shizuka reaching an orgasm too soon, as her moaning and the very thick smell lingering was any indication. You reached her pussy entrance, and this time, you had to use your legs to force open the lip-like features. As you gradually forced open the gap, you could see the thick liquid flowing down and touching Shizuka's panties. Perfect, you thought to yourself, an escape route. Slowly, you slid out through the gap, and landing yourself in a puddle of thick liquid inside Shizuka's panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair were still walking to the bathroom, so there was still an opening before Shizuka eventually sat down somewhere. Using the thick liquid as a means of direction, you made your way towards the left side of Shizuka's panties, and then sliding down the liquid all the way until you touched Shizuka's socks. From there, you grabbed the sock fabric, and gently climbed down. Shizuka's legs were still in motion, but you were getting used to the constant movement. You could see that Hitomi had already brought Shizuka right at the front door of the girl's bathroom. Seizing your only window of opportunity, you jumped down onto the floor, and landed as Shizuka's shoe started moving upwards and slamming down a distance away from you. After a while, the door closed shut. You were safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some time to pause, you took a sniff at your clothes. Damn, Shizuka smells tight, you thought to yourself. Inside the toilet, you could barely make out what Shizuka and Hitomi were saying, but it appears that Hitomi could not locate whatever that was causing Shizuka unwanted \"pleasure\". Grinning, you decided to make a move before the two giantesses locate you. More importantly, you needed to wash off the thick liquid all over your clothes and yourself. Luckily, the guys' bathroom is just a short distance away, even to your standards, so you crawled in underneath the door, and made yourself in.</span></div></div>",

Both of them were long gone by now, and looking at your surroundings, it appears that school was over, and most of the student body have already left. You wanted to go home too, but you were just too small to go down the stairs like this without suffering an injury, and finding someone to latch onto on the way out feels like a very daunting task. Besides, the only person you trust to carry you at your size was Yuriko, and she had probably gone home by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked on, you pondered over your next step. You remembered that the Teachers' Room was located on this floor, so maybe you could take a chance with one of the teachers that have not yet left. Then, you also remembered that there was also a series of lockers nearby.

Shizuka is definitely feeling you \"working\" on her cervix, but can do nothing as she is still seated for class. Shizuka pressed her hands down on her skirt, trying very hard not to give away anything. It was an unpleasant feeling for her, and an ironic one for someone who always had young male students eating our of her palm just to get in her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cervix opened up slightly, and you took the chance to crawl inside. What awaited you on the other side was ... not exactly what you expected. You left one red fleshy cavern, only to find yourself inside a much larger red fleshy cavern: Shizuka's womb. There are traces of gas that was unpleasant to your nose, but still tolerable to stay within. Looking around, you noticed what appears to be another fleshy cave entrance, only much smaller. You went forward to have a look, and you realized that it was the entrance to Shizuka's fallopian tubes, but ironically, you are too big to go through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizuka's \"pleasure\" started to take a wane after you went straight inside her cervix. Although still flustered, Shizuka could heave a little sigh of relief, for whatever that was wrecking havoc to her pleasure senses, it had subsided ... for now. There will be payback for whoever is behind this, Shizuka thought to herself, but for the moment, it will have to wait.

As for yourself, even tickling her toes had garnered no response from Yuriko. You wanted to sulk, but then you realized that your environment was starting to shake. Earthquakes were common in Japan, but this was no earthquake. Yuriko was walking ... with you still inside the shoe.

You have to hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you were suddenly taken aback when Yuriko suddenly got up of her seat, and the loud voice in the sky saying \"See you later, Minako!\" followed by another loud voice replying \"See you!\" back at Yuriko. By the time you reached the edge of the table, you could see Yuriko's huge frame towering over you, as she turned around and got ready to leave. You went for a leap and try to grab whatever you can, be it Yuriko's skirt or legs, but your lack of physical prowess reared its flaws right here. You could almost grab her skirt, but fingers could barely even get a grip on the fabric, before you started plummeting down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see that you were in for a very nasty landing onto the canteen floor, but you noticed a very strategically placed wet tissue nearby. Mimicing the protagonist from \"Ninja's Code\", you reached your arms out, and readied yourself for the landing by positioning your body so that your back will land first on the wet tissue. You were lucky that there was a long time frame for you at this size to carry out the Shinko no Hiyaku, or \"Faith Leap\" and avoid a potential death by falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed on the wet tissue safely, and without too much aching on your body, although it was your first time doing this in real life. You could care less about getting yourself dry, as you saw Yuriko's feet moving further and further away. You already knew that if you were to run, you may not catch after her, let alone getting help. On the other hand, you only trust Yuriko enough to help you out in your current state, so it might still be worth risking. Looking back, you noticed that Minako was still there, her feet still firmly on the ground and not moving. You do not know Minako very well, and less about what she might do to you at your size, but it seems she may be your only hope now. You have to decide now. Chase after Yuriko, or return to Minako.</span></div></div>",

Based on her body language, it looks like her mobile phone rang, and she had to answer it. Now's my chance, you thought to yourself, and started dashing towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou already knew the size difference between you and Yuriko, but you did not care, only that you wanted to get her attention. Your lack of exercise, for once, did nothing to try and stop you (not that it did not try), but as you got closer to Yuriko's legs, your thought was trying to latch onto Yuriko's sock, and then find a way to get her attention. You panted heavily, gasping for air, but you never stopped. Even ignoring the loud thumping sounds of the feet of others, you pressed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as soon as you got close, Yuriko was done taking with whoever it was on the phone. She slipped her mobile phone back into her skirt pocket, just as you leaped up to try and grab her sock. With one turn of her foot, you made contact with Yuriko's loafer instead of her sock as she started to walk away. There was no way you could latch onto her loafer, and your body was finally cracking under the strain of running so much without sufficient exercise. Helplessly, you watched as Yuriko's massive frame turned around the corner, and walked away, oblivious to your tiny self trying to latch onto her sock and get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wearily pressed your head on the cold, hard ground, and silently wept. Why does it always have to be like this, you thought to yourself. Ever since the two of you met as children, your relationship had always been so close, yet so far. Yuriko was very pretty, and she attracted a lot of interest from other guys. However, she had always considered you her best friend, and you remembered the time the two of you had a long chat over the phone after a male friend broke up with her. In contrast, you were pretty much the geeky boy whose only asset was intelligence. You always felt pressured that you were not good-looking enough to try and pursue Yuriko's heart. That long chat over the phone was your best shot, but you blew it by not taking advantage. Now, it feels like fate had just dealt you another blow, in that you were so close to getting Yuriko's attention, but failed in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wallowed in both fatigue and self-pity, all you did was lay on the back, looking at the ceiling that appeared like it was several miles high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead! Squish me! Why should I bother? I'm never going to get Yuriko's attention, or her heart! I'm better off dead, and how appropriate for me to die like an insignificant bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant shoe appeared in the sky, and looks like it was going to land on you. You simply closed your eyes, and waited for your demise.</span></div></div>",

Even fate won't allow me to die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou muttered in irritation as you slowly sat up. Yuriko was gone by now, and whoever had the chance to end your life, simply left your tiny body alone. You were still bitter about not getting Yuriko's attention, along with the frustration about your relationship with her, but at this time, it seems like fate had allowed you to live ... for now. Your body was still too weary to run or do anything, but you were still able to leave the cafeteria and head back to the main hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everybody went back to their respective classes, nobody noticed the tiny guy laying by the side of the hallway. The sound of the giants' footsteps was really uncomfortable to your ears, but at least you were still alive. At this time, you are starting to realize that perhaps not being able to get help is a sign that you are still needed at your size, somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all traces back to that girl who had dumped the liquid on you, and whatever that liquid was, it shrunk you. You were still unsure how or why such a thing can exist, but if there is a way to shrink someone, you theorized that there must be a way to enlarge someone as well. If there is a possibility of a growth potion, it might be the key to getting you back to normal size. If it does not, you have to start contemplating living your life at this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not like being small, but if this is what you have to live with for the rest of your life, you decide that you want it to be somewhere safe, and where you can properly survive. Then again, you have no clues on where to find that girl, or even how to concoct that mysterious shrinking liquid, let alone creating one to reverse its effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's your choice.</span></div></div>",

You started stroking the bulge slowly, like stroking a person's pet. Still nothing. You decided to stroke harder, and if still nothing, you will give up. You place your hands on the bulge again, and started moving it about like soldiers doing log exercises during training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear some giggling sounds from above, and you know that your host has felt your \"actions\".

Eventually, you could see the two log-sized fingers leaving the pocket. After seeing the fingers gone, you finally heaved a huge sigh of relief. If you were caught there and then, it would be embarrassing and stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you decided against playing with the bulge anymore, as it was confirmed that it WAS her breast nipple (she had forgotten to wear a bra), and touching it again will bring the two fingers back into the pocket, and you might not be as lucky the next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there was hardly any options left for you to do. Jumping out of the pocket will be too dangerous, and you risk the dangers of being only half an inch tall.

Imagine your surprise when you find that you are no longer in school, but in what appears to be a teenage girl's room. In addition, Minako had apparently taken off her uniform, and had hung it from a coat rack. There was no sign of Minako anywhere, so you had presumed that she is taking a bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you want to explore Minako's room, or do you want to play it safe and stay in the uniform pocket?</span></div></div>",

Slowly crawling down the uniform, you made it all the way down towards the skirt, and you noticed how high you are. If you were to fall down, you will surely meet a gruesome end, or so you thought. You closed your eyes, and let go of the uniform, falling straight down onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, you landed only with a minor thud, and upon impact, your feet did not feel as painful as you thought. That's when it occured to you: your weight is now proportional to your height, so there is no added weight upon impact. This new discovery now means that you need not worry about jumping down tables or chairs, as you will not feel as much pain as you did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako's room seemed just like any other teenage girl's bedroom, after a little bit of exploring. You do not know a lot about Minako (even though she is Yuriko's friend), but there are some attributes about her that you know about now. There are rows of CDs near the stereo, and from the looks of it, she listens to them often. There is a laptop on Minako's desk, which she must use for accessing the Internet. Minako is also fond of manga and anime like yourself, after you find an unfinished manga volume on the floor, and noticing a very large white cat plush with a little symbol on its forehead. However, it seems like your time alone may be at an end, as you could hear thumping sounds from behind the door. Minako must be done with her bath, it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako opened the door,and you could see her huge stature right in front of you. You could barely see her face, but what she wore was really surprising: a sailor fuku and matching penny loafers. You'd wonder by now if she wore anything but school uniforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe my old uniform still fits. People will think I'm crazy if I wear this out in public, but I really like this uniform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her room door, and now believing that she is alone, she started prancing about in her uniform, humming a familiar shojo anime theme song. You wanted to stay and watch her skirt flutter about and exposing her panties, but now you know her \"embarrassing\" secret, you would do best to get out of here. However, as Minako's feet get dangerously close to your position, does she notice you, or is she too busy prancing about?</span></div></div>",

The sound of the impact between Minako's loafers and the floor is a clear indication that you do NOT want to end up underneath her foot. You could feel her foot coming down again, so you quickly lunged towards the left, avoiding her foot in the process. Quickly, you ran away from the foot, but her foot only shifted towards your direction, and before you knew it, she was using her other foot to stomp on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though only three minutes have pass since Minako tried to crush you, you felt like you had ran for thirty minutes without stopping.

You were already exhausted from the stomping ordeal, but to end up inside Minako's stomach is not something you want. You started struggling, trying to break free from the strong grip of Minako's fingers. Minako's face did not budge, as if she enjoys seeing prey struggling before their end.

It was the same dish, but because the meat was under-cooked, you remember that you were stuck in the bathroom for the rest of the night. Still, Reiko had improved significantly, enough that Yuriko, who was three years her senior, turned to her to ask for cooking tips when her own parents started travelling for work reasons. Food had never tasted so good, you thought to yourself as you placed a spoonful of rice covered with gravy inside your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal was satisfying, you thought to yourself, letting off a burp in delight. However, it seems like there was no time to relax, as you heard the sound of a door opening and closing, followed by the sound of footsteps. Cautiously, you looked from behind the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her in both awe and terror, considering this was the person who almost crushed you to death before. She wore a bright orange dress, bright red sandal high heels, and carried a red purse inside her hands. Curiously, she did not move, as if she was waiting for someone. Ironically for you, if there was anyone that could get you out of here, it was Minako. You knew it was suicide to get Minako's attention again, but if she did not notice you, you could always easily ride between her toes until you were in familiar territory, assuming she goes there. Then again, perhaps you can return back to the house and hide out somewhere until she gets back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's your call.</span></div></div>",

Slowly, you approached Minako's enormous frame, being very careful for her not to notice you. Luckily for you, her mobile phone started ringing, and she answered it. Her voice and conversation were barely audible to your ears, but you were not after her attention. While she was busy, you slowly crept up towards the opening revealing the toes on her right foot, and crawled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako's choice of footwear contrasted heavily with Yuriko's. You have been to Yuriko's house multiple times, and you noticed that none of Yuriko's shoes were open-toed. Yuriko had always said that she never liked showing her feet, preferring covered shoes. Earlier, when you were escaping, you caught a glimpse of the rack of sandals and open-toed shoes on the shoe rack in the distance. Judging from the style of housing and clothing, Minako was definitely from a wealthy family, and those shoes might have been a sign of flaunting her wealth and taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako hung up her phone. Luckily for you, before she could look down at her feet, a large red sports car pulled up on the road. The sound of the engine drove an aural spear inside your head, and you had to cover your ears and eyes in both pain and discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YUICHI!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako exclaimed, driving another aural spear into your head. The car pulled up beside her, and Minako climbed inside it, oblivious to the tiny passenger riding on her right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're late, Yuichi! You know how much I hate waiting!\" Minako said, talking to the immense form of a man driving the vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, my honey!\" The man, identified as Yuichi, apologized. You watched from Minako's shoe as the large shoe dropped down on the pedal, and the two were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not bother too much about the two giants and their conversation above their heads, and the engine noise practically drowned out the chatter they had. However, you could still identify some of the topics they were talking about. You can very much confirm that Yuichi was Minako's boyfriend (despite their age gap), and that both of them were from wealthy families, and they were going on a date. This explains Minako's attire, and even though she looked really good, her nearly killing you back in her room made you very cautious about coming in contact with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car finally pulled to a stop, and the couple arrived at ...</span></div></div>",

It did not seem familiar at first, but when the couple started walking further inwards, where the bright lights were, you finally remembered where you were: the newly opened mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered the first time you were here, and though you wanted to just bring Yuriko here, Reiko insisted on tagging along. You did not mind spending time with your younger sister, but you had really wanted the chance to just be with Yuriko. Your first time here was uneventful, to say the least, as all you guys did was to grocery shopping followed by an ice cream treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of an ice cream treat, that was precisely what Yuichi gave to Minako. A white drop of melted cream fell from Minako's cone, and landed close to your position. You were tempted to lick it, but the giant couple started walking again, moving away from the drop. You cursed underneath your breath, but at the same time, thankful that neither of the giant couple saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuichi then took Minako to a clothing store. You had overheard the couple saying that Minako wanted another dress for some event organized by her father in a few weeks, so that was no surprise. The giant couple browsed around the clothing store, with Minako picking up several dresses from the racks. She then excused herself, and headed towards the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door closed shut, you quickly got away from her foot, and just in time as Minako started removing her sandal heels. Luckily for you, she was too engrossed with trying on the outfits to notice the tiny passenger that had hitched on her foot. As Minako continued to try on the dresses, she failed to notice her original orange dress falling off the coat hook, and onto the floor ... right where you were positioned. Your surroundings was nothing but orange now. You struggled to try and get to a safe corner and wait for Minako to put on her shoes again, but her dress made it difficult to move, let alone see, where the exit was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako then noticed that her orange dress had fallen off the coat hook. She crouched down, and started to pick it up. As the unending stretch of orange cloth gets removed from your head, you sprinted away underneath the cover, and towards her sandal heels. Minako turned her head around, but did she notice you?</span></div></div>",

The hand crashes down, and it was a while before you opened a small peek hole between your fingers. Luckily for you, Minako reached for something that looked like a bright metallic pin with her fingers, and promptly picked it up, completely oblivious to the tiny person that had taken cover underneath her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Minako got changed back to her original dress, you quietly crawled back to her shoe, sticking to the left side this time. Minako slipped her sandal heels back on again, still oblivious to the tiny passenger by her toes. Minako left the changing room, taking the dresses with her, probably with the intention to buy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and grumbled as you noticed Yuichi's massive frame handing a credit card to the cashier by the counter, upon which Minako gently pecked him on the cheek. For a geeky person like you, someone like Yuriko seems like an incompatible match, and a lot of people have given you crap for hanging around her, even though you two were childhood friends. As such, you find it uncomfortable to show your affection for her, and in turn, hard to confess without making you either a laughing stock or marked by jealous males wanting a shot at earning Yuriko's love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some shopping, the couple (and you in tow) headed towards one last stop: the arcade. The din surrounding the area was so uncomfortable that it made your head hurt, forcing you to cup your ears. Hurriedly, you reach in your pocket, and to your relief, you found a piece of tissue that you may have forgotten about. You tore the tissue in two, roll each torn piece into a ball, and then placed a ball in each ear. It was not much, but at least the sound was not as painful as you had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the noise problem dealt with, looking around was much easier now. You looked around, but the couple walked so fast that you could barely make out any of the towering figures above you. The couple then stopped at what appears to be a city-sized air hockey table to you. Yuichi went to the opposite way, and after a while, faint sounds of crashing sounds were heard, presumably the couple had started playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the couple continued their game, you hopped off Minako's foot and looked around some more. It took a while before you noticed a very familiar pair of legs and shoes wearing a very familiar pattern of socks. Immediately, you knew who it was: Yuriko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple were still engrossed in their game, but you had no idea how long before either call it quits and left. Then again, if the pair of legs really was Yuriko, your chances of survival are much higher compared to Minako, who had tried to kill you when she thought you were a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to make your choice before you get lost, alone and tiny on the arcade floor. Stay with Minako's toes, or go after Yuriko (presumably)?</span></div></div>",

The pair started walking towards the door, and the sound of the giants' footsteps made you really uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant couple were then led towards a table for two, and then sat down. High above the table, they started talking, and you decided to leave Minako's shoe for now. All you could see from underneath the table were multiple pairs of legs, as the giants and giantesses walked and talked above you. You looked at yourself, still wearing the school uniform that had shrunk with you. If you were to grow right now, you will stick out like a sore thumb. In addition, you have no idea what Yuichi will do to you if you had embarrassed him on his date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant couple continued talking about stuff while you stayed underneath the table, awaiting the moment when these two finally leave. You felt like you had made a bad decision by following the couple to the date, as it appeared to be no one available to help. Of course, most of it was because you had been staying hidden from sight. You thought about wanting to venture out, but the giant feet slamming about on the floor made you very uneasy.

It turned out to be Minako's mobile phone, and she answered it. Barely recovering from that aural din, you quickly sneaked back into the house, avoiding Minako's feet in the process. You traced your steps back towards the hole, and as you approached the hole, you noticed a red sports car pulling up. Minako got inside the car, and in a few seconds, they were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that it will be a while before Minako gets home, but you also know that you want to find a hiding spot where she cannot find you. Your intention is to get back to school the next day, and find someone else to help instead of Minako. With that, you crawled through the hole, and back in familiar grounds: Minako's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heaved a sigh of relief that nobody was home. You remembered the white cat plush that you hid from Minako's stomping, and gently stroked the fur. Then, you noticed the tag, on it its purchase price. 4800 yen. If you were going to spend that much money for Yuriko, you knew it had to be a birthday gift. Even though your father is a successful manga artist and your mother a fashion designer, they were always cautious when it comes to money despite their steady incomes. The most they will splurge on is on a family vacation, and even then, the furthest you had ever been was Seoul, when you were only 9 years old. The wealth disparity between your families presented itself in the form of a white cat plush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako had hung her uniform, and at your current size, there was no way you could go back and hide in there any more. You noticed Minako's bag, and to your disappointment, no openings. All had been zipped tightly, and your tiny frame was too small to even grab it, let alone pull it. You will have to wait until morning, and hope that Minako opens her bag sometime for you to sneak in and hide out until you get to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you wait, you noticed the manga tome that Minako had left lying on the floor. Despite its size, the page was actually light enough for you to flip the pages (though it was still too heavy for you to carry to a safe location). Surprisingly, it was one of your Dad's old works, 'The Alien Girlfriend'. You remembered your Dad doing a one-shot manga about a shoujo (girls) story, and this must probably be the one. While you waited for Minako to return home, you decided to have a look at one of your Dad's works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours went by until you heard the same engine sound pulling up from outside. This was followed by the jingling of keys from outside the house. Quickly, you stopped reading the manga, and ran back behind the white cat plush, as you heard footsteps approaching the room. The door opened, and ...</span></div></div>",

You stayed at your hiding spot, making sure Minako does not see you, lest she tries to crush you again. Minako closed the door, and then started stripping, removing the orange dress she had worn, revealing her reddish bra and panties underneath. You immediately close your eyes and look away, the sight of Minako in her undies was certainly tempting, but you also knew that leaving your hiding spot will lead to certain death. You turned back towards the light, opening a small peephole with your fingers even as you covered your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako then started to take off her bra, unknowingly exposing her bare breasts to a tiny \"guest\" hiding underneath her desk, and tossed it to the ground. You found it strange that Minako started stripping before heading to her dresser, but that was what she did. Minako pulled out a similar set of red undies, and then started taking off her panties. For a brief moment, you were probably the first man to have seen Minako naked, with full view of her womanhood, before she slipped on a cleaner pair of panties, followed by the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako let off a yawn, which felt like the sound of a jet flying above your head to your ears, and then proceeded to switch off her room lights before slumping onto her bed. It was not long before you heard snoring noises coming from the bed, which felt like a bunch of trains slowly pulling out of a station to you. It was only now did you feel safe enough to crawl out of your hiding spot. You noticed the bra and panties that had been left on the floor. It disgusted you a little to see Minako just chuck her brasserie on the floor and expect the maid to pick it up later. You slowly approached the brasserie. Minako was not Yuriko, but judging by the cup size, seems like both of them had similar bust sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Minako continued to sleep, you approached her brasserie, ready to explore it further, and then you noticed her purse strewn on the floor. You could choose to hide in it instead and hope that Minako will pick it up and bring it to school, as unlikely as that sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

I can walk by myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized the voice as Minako's, and as the door opened, you noticed the giant frame of Minako being held by a guy, presumably named Yuichi based on what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been stumbling ever since you got to the car! There's no way I'm letting you walk home like this,\" Yuichi said, as he gently sat Minako down on her bed, while you watched everything from behind Minako's white cat plush. \"Geez, it was just one whiskey bon-bon chocolate! How did you get drunk like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuichi ... do you like me?\" Minako asked. You watched the drama unfold, but chose to stay put. Minako was already pretty dangerous when sane, so there was no telling what she'll do to you in her current drunken state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get some rest, Minako,\" Yuichi dodged the question. \"You're drunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as he turned around and prepared to leave, he felt Minako's arms wrap around him. Minako, although still drunk, had that look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like me, Yuichi?\" Minako sounded slurry. \"I know you've been seeing Yuko behind my back, you two-timer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just discussing homework,\" Yuichi pleaded. \"You know I wouldn't do anything behind your back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuichi! You liar!\" Minako then forcefully dragged Yuichi onto the bed, and even though their voices was booming inside your ears, you still could not help but observe. Minako was surprisingly strong to be able to drag Yuichi onto her bed, and then force herself onto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako? What're you doing?\" Yuichi's voice certainly did not hide his fear of Minako, especially in her drunken stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to make you mine! Tonight!\" Minako declared. \"I'm going to make sure Yuko can never, ever take you away from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako! No! Don't do this!\" Yuichi was frightened now as Minako started to take her dress off in front of him, revealing her bra and panties. The sight before you was stimulating your senses hard, and you could feel your heart thumping as you watched the drama of these two giants unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like me now?\" Minako asked. \"You're the first person who has ever seen me like this! You should feel honored to see the heiress of the Ayasegawas in her bra and panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot quite, Minako, you thought to yourself. I had seen them, albeit unintentionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I like you! I like you!\" The fear in Yuichi's voice seemed to escalate the more he spoke, as he is fully aware of the consequences if anyone caught him like this. \"I beg you, please! Just, get some rest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho ... now you're begging me?\" Minako got up, but she still had Yuichi pinned under her legs. Then, she noticed Yuichi's pants. \"Hu hu hu ... you must have quite the goods down there! Now ... let me have a good look at them ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako! No! I'll be the one in trouble, not you!\" Yuichi exclaimed as Minako's hands reached for his pants. \"Please, just let me go now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Let you go?\" Minako answered. \"I already told you: I ain't letting you leave until I make sure Yuko can never, ever, take you away from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Alright! You win! You want to do this, fine!\" Yuichi exclaimed. \"But I ask you, just get off me. I'll take off my pants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And let you run away?\" Minako said. \"No way! You take your pants off right here, right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuichi had the look of surrender on his face as he reached for his pants buckle and loosened it. Maybe he had regretted going out with Minako, or maybe he did get seen with this Yuko girl, but whatever it is, it seemed like he had given up with convincing Minako to just let him go in her current drunken state. Carefully, he pulled his pants off his legs, allowing them to fall down as they reached his knees, letting gravity do the work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hu hu hu ... it's just as I expected,\" Minako said, as she saw the bulge coming out of Yuichi's briefs. Then, she placed her hands behind her back, and from your view, you could see her unfasten her bra, before she took it in her hands, exposing her bare breasts to Yuichi. She then threw the bra aside, and it landed just a short distance away from our position near the white cat plush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like my breasts, hmm?\" Minako asked seductively, while Yuichi looks on with a strange mixture of horror and pleasure. \"Much bigger and natural than Yuko's, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ...\" Yuichi had an answer so soft that it sounded natural to your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, to take it all off ... starting with you, Yuichi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of you wanted to stay and watch this drama continue, but another part of you has had enough, and just want to get out of here. While you and Yuichi were complete strangers, you cannot help but wonder if he even deserved this treatment. But then again, staying around could potentially scar you mentally for life, regardless of what she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's your call.</span></div></div>",

Trembling with fright, you watched in fear as she lifts up her large foot, and hovers it over you.Quietly, you closed your eyes, and feared the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, it felt that her shoe was so close to you. However, as you opened your eyes, imagine your surprise when you notice how close her shoe was to your tiny body. That was too close, you thought to yourself. You know that the next time, she might actually step on you for real, so you quickly got away from Minako, and ran towards the huge desk near the edge of Minako's room. Quickly, you hid behind one of the huge legs, and watched as Minako continued her silly prancing. You were lucky to escape back then, as you saw her foot slam down on your original position. If you had stayed there, you would have ended up as a bloody red stain on the carpet floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Minako gave up prancing about.  She then walked towards her stack of manga volumes, and picked up one book fro the stack, the book like the size of an apartment. She then walked towards her desk, and then sat down on the chair nearby. You were still at the desk watching as she walked towards the desk, and sat her huge frame on the nearby chair. As she sat down and started reading the volume, you stayed where you are, looking at her huge feet nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were never a fan of feet, but there was something about Minako's feet there that aroused your \"interests\" a little. Minako was still reading her book, and for some reason, she started taking her right foot off her shoe, only so slightly. However, as time passed, she kept on moving her right foot in and out of the shoe. You don't know why, but the sight of Minako's foot slipping in and out of the shoe had really got you turned on. Do you want to join in by entering the shoe, or do you think this is a bad idea?</span></div></div>",

You crawled underneath the cubicle door, and headed towards the main door. It was after you saw the door did you realize how small you were now. The main door itself was as tall as the Tokyo tower, and luckily for you, leaving the toilet does not involve any climbing; you simply crawled through the door gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small concrete cracks on the floor now felt like fissures to you, and you don't want to get stuck in them, especially when people start walking around. You carefully made your way on the floor, avoiding the cracks as you go. You walked on until you saw another door, and after squinting your eyes to have a look, you realize that it was the ladies' bathroom. You looked back, and the distance between both bathrooms seemed like a walk from your house to the convenience store a few blocks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was not much time to think, as you could hear loud thumping sounds from a distance. What was it?</span></div></div>",

As you could see a face in the distance, you knew who it was: Hitomi Kawasaki, Shizuka's best friend. While she hangs around with Shizuka, Hitomi is not as mean as her friend, from your knowledge. While you know she can help you, it will have to wait as she is running straight towards you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lunged away, narrowly avoiding her large feet pounding away on the floor. The sound of her feet pounding was unbearable, but at least you managed to avoid death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BATHROOM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Hitomi's massive form push the door to the ladies' bathroom, enter, and the door slamming shut with a loud thud. After that, you could hear footsteps moving about frantically inside. You were not surprised, as Hitomi had always been putting weird things inside her mouth, mostly goaded by Shizuka. From bugs, weird liquids, exotic \"food\", Hitomi had \"tasted\" them all, and you were surprised that after all that, all she gets are upset stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is the risk that Hitomi might swallow you if she sees you, but then again, at this time, some help is better than none. You could enter the bathroom and try and find Hitomi, wait for her to come out and try and get her attention. Then again, Hitomi might just make things worse for you, and maybe getting her help might be the worst decision you make in your life. What will you do?</span></div></div>",

It might not be the most comfortable way of transport (especially for your ears), but it beats walking around in your tiny form. You waited by the bathroom door, and you could hear Hitomi's voice from behind. It sounds like she had a bad case of the runs, probably caused by what she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you could hear flushing sounds, and you could tell Hitomi is done with her \"business\". You stood up, and got ready. Sure enough, Hitomi opens the bathroom door, and her giant loafer crashes right down in front of you. Ignoring the loud crashing sound, you scrambled up her shoe, and grabbed hold before Hitomi starts walking again, lest you fall off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to climb onto the top of Hitomi's shoe, and from there, you were temporarily safe, minus the stamping of her feet on the floor. With such an \"opportunity\", you decide to have a look up Hitomi's skirt, but the movement of her towering legs did not help much. As Hitomi walked on, all you could do now is go with the flow, going where Hitomi is walking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitomi is going ... </span></div></div>",

I apologize to those who had added to my story, but I really wish to rewrite it from the beginning. GP points will still be awarded for additions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis can be considered a prelude to my previous story, Shrunk In Japan.<br>\r\nLink: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1502010\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1502010</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is your first day at school in semi-futuristic Japan. Under weird circumstances, you have shrunk and now you must find a way to get back to normal, avoiding the perils of the tiny kind. Can you survive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<b>Hiroki Iketani</b> (main character) A 2nd year high school student being dragged into an upcoming mess. Physically weak but very intelligent.<br>\r\n<b>Yuriko Takamoto</b> Hiroki's childhood friend, knows each other like the backs of their hand. 2nd year high school student, borderline C-cup breasts, short hair, slim but not considered \"hot\".<br>\r\n<b>Reiko Iketani</b> Hiroki's sister, 1st year middle school student. Mature and serious for her age. Takes care of the house. No exact measurements yet.<br>\r\n<b>Shizuka Kinugawa</b> 2nd year high school student, your nemesis. A social butterfly with a mean streak. Full C-cup breasts, long hair, figure like a model.<br>\r\n<b>Hitomi Kawasaki</b> 2nd year high school student. Shizuka's best friend and lackey. Medium C-cup breasts, but excellent figure.<br>\r\n<b>Motoko Kijima</b> Temporary worker at school, serving as the school nurse.

B-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<b>Hiroshi and Shuhei Yamamoto</b> Neighbors and close guy friends. Hiroshi is a 3rd year student while Shuhei is a 2nd year student. They love their bikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES:<br>\r\n1. As much as possible, try not to kill off Hiroki.<br>\r\n2. No one-liner or two-liner chapters. Be creative, add more.
