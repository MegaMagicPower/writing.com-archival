Johnny did not move. \"I know what to do you smell like Test you look like him also lets se if you act like him who want a little kiss?\" said Sissy as she puckered her lips. \"Ahhhhhh\" thought Johnny as he jumped into the tub. Sissy giggled as she grabbed lufa to scrub him. \"Good boy Johnny\" said Sissy  with a grin. During the bath Sissy said things like \"when were done I'll dress you up you'll like that\" or \"I think you will look beautiful in a dress Johnny\" and sometimes \"I think I have some hair bow in my room pink I think\". Next she was done she took Johnny out of the tub and put him on a towel and took out a hairdryer and used it to dry his new fur and then took him back to her Room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then lets have some fun and play a game it's called doggie dress up first i will put you in ________\" said Sissy.</span></div></div>",

He tried to use the door but his new paws could not twist the knob and he could not open the window but then again Sissy's room was on the third floor so even if he could open the window he would die jumping from it. Just then the door opened and standing in the door was Sissy carrying a large brown box and closing the door behind her with her foot. As she puts the box down she opened it and took out a bright pink dog collar and put it on Johnny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There now oh don't you look cute and tomorrow we can go to the pet store and get you a name tag then it's off to the vet so you can get your shots\" said Sissy as she took out a hair brush from the box. \"Shots\" thought Johnny as Sissy brushed his new fur. \"There now I have this great nail polish made just for dog's\" said Sissy as she took a small pink bottle. \"Now hold still\" said Sissy as she painted Johnny's new longer nails pink. \"OK before you were cute now you're absolutely adorable\" said Sissy as she went to the box and took out a large dark red pillow and put it on the end of her bed. \"There now you have a nice little spot to sleep on and it's right next to mommy\" said Sissy in a baby voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night Sissy was wearing a light purple night gown and sitting at her make up table brushing her hair. Meanwhile Johnny was sitting on his pillow thinking up escape plans. At that moment with a small clanging sound Sissy put down her hairbrush and got into bed she set her alarm then put a small blanket over Johnny and gave him a kiss on the head lastly she pulled her own covers over herself. \"Now be quiet Johnny mommy needs her beauty sleep\" said Sissy. \"Obviously but you are going too need allot more then one night\" thought Johnny as he drifted into sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Johnny was awakened by the \"beep beep\" of Sissy's alarm clock at 6:00 AM. Sleepily Sissy opened her eyes and moved her arm and turned off her alarm she then got out of bed and stretched her arms she then began to gently pat Johnny on his head. \"Good morning Johnny now you wait right there while I go make you some breakfast\" said Sissy as she yawned and left the room. A few minutes later she returned with a dog bowl filled with dog food in her arms and she put it right next to Johnny's head and petted him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you enjoy that while I go get ready we have a very busy day ahead of us first the vet then the pet store to get you some things and then the rest of the day is ours\" said Sissy as she left the room to go the bathroom and brush her teeth. Now Johnny was starving so he ate the dog food happily. It was gone by the time Sissy came back looking much less tired as she went to the make up table and began to brush and style her hair after applying her lipstick and a little blush she went to her closet to put on some clothes she chose her usual clothes and then she began to pack her purse with her wallet, make up bag, cell phone and a few other items. \"OK all ready now lets get going\" said Sissy as she attached a leash to Johnny's collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSissy had to drag Johnny to the vets office as they sat their waiting Sissy was reading a magazine and Johnny was trying to get away but Sissy had tied his leash to one of the arms of her chair. \"Sissy the vet will see you and your dog now\" said the vets assistant. As they entered the room Sissy put Johnny on the examining table then the vet came in and spoke as he looked over his clipboard. \"OK we've got five shots to get out of the way\" said the vet as he put down his clipboard. \"Nurse\" called the vet then the nurse came in holding five needles. \"OK Johnny now be a big dog and take your shots\" said Sissy. By the time all Five shots had been done poor Johnny was howling. \"Ok now then were done for today you can pay the receptionists on your way out\" said the vet. Sissy paid the receptionist and left with Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Johnny lets go the pet store\" said Sissy in an excited voice as they turned a corner. Soon after <br>\r\njohnny found him self in front of a large pet store there first stop was to stop in the part of the store where they sold dog tags for the color and shape Sissy chose a red one shaped like a fire hydrant. \"Now please write my name is Johnny my owner is Sissy Blakely and write down this number and address\" said Sissy as she handed a piece of paper to the man who engraved the dog tags. \"Can do that will be ten dollars and it will be ready in half an hour\" said the man. \"OK see you in half an hour\" said Sissy to the man \"Now come on Johnny\" said Sissy. Over the next half hour Johnny was pulled through the store while Sissy grabbed things like chew toys, dog food and dog shampoo. Soon Sissy was measuring Johnny for pet clothes. Then after Sissy was satisfied with what she had bought she picked up Johnny's new dog tag and at last they went home for the day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With all the commotion of the past few hours, being held against his will, nearly married, and being late to show, Chip was too tired to attend his own after party and planned on going right to his hotel room. But at the same time there qas one thing he wanted to do before midnight, and his milestone of a birthday was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier in the day,Chip had it all planned out, after his show he'd purposely \"accidentally\" invite top many back to his party, which would cause more trouble than any bodyguard had figured and it would give him just a few seconds to get close enough to the refreshments, grab what he wanted, and head back to his room. This was still the plan, but there was one thing he forgot about; Guy. Or as, he was often called \"a guy from the record company\" as a bit of a joke on Chip's part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burnette in red was tired, so he was slower as he left the party. His prize safe, cold and slightly wet in one of his baggy jean pockets. So as he slipped out the door into the hall, and over the rest of the party that took up a good two other whole hallways, he hadnt noticed until it was too late he almost bumped into The Guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite them being the same height, the blonde easily could still look down on the young pop star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, Chip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know, just getting a drink...\" Chip tried to act natural. He wasn't a good liar, but he kept going, \"just a soda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm, it better be. Remember what we talked about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I turned 21 today-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chip, baby; drinking is for the stupid, ugly, and non-famous.\" The man said peering through the top of his sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, but Britney-Britney,-\" Chip muttered as he was walked down to a quieter hallway. They had a whole elevator ride to hash this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Britney-Britney isn't under out contract, she can do whatever her contract says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never even signed a contract,\" Chip said as he leaned against the wall, watching Guy push the call button for the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but your grandfather did. Good thinking too, I know how much you like singing an' dancing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's what Im good at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. And though your father was a bit of a flop, your grandfather had the foresight to sign over ever male decentent- so you can keep singing and dancing, and making folks happy without having to worry about small things like where you sleep or where you're next meal comes from. You know we take good care of our stars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but its just one beer and the law says-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHIP!\" The elevator came down and Guy stepped in grapping the pop singer by the arm. Chip felt his heart race a little as the doors shut and Guy's gaze from behind his shades got dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many times do I need to remind you? I know your head's only good for holding hair and not brains- but THE LAWS DON'T APPLY TO YOU. Only our laws- do you think drinking would look \"good\"? Or \"cool\"?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to try-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S WHAT YOUR FANS ARE GOING TO THINK! And we can't have that now, can we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I-I guess not..\" Chip clung to the wall as the elevator took off and in seconds The Guy's face fell, his shades were back up and it was almost like nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I wanted to here, now lemme see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChip frowned as he pulled a can of now lukewarm Buddy Beer from his pocket. The Guy took it and smiled, the elevator was coming up on Chip's floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a good, little pop star. Now, you get some sleep, you look tired, and you know you got that early date with Miss Britney in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChip sighed as the doors opened in the ding, \"yeah...yeah..,G'night Guy.\" He yawned as he left. Guy smiled \"Night, kid. Sleep tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the doors shut, his smile faded, and he cracked open the beer. It was because of this company that Chip Skylark The First, who signed the contact during prohibition, married Sophie Tucker, (another singer at the time) and retired being well-known until his death. It was because of them Chip Skylark The Second, was even vaguely famous as he had no talent, and it was because of them Chip Skylark The Third would follow the same path, and they weren't going to have alcohol mess it up.</span></div></div>",

They had their oldest daughter, Kelly, their son, Budrick, better known as Bud, and his twin sister, Budrika.  The reason we've never seen her in the show is because she was the one with the common sense.  She preferred not to be a part of her family's typical shenanigans.  The only member of the family she felt close with was her twin brother.  Though they loved each other, they often got into silly arguments over topics such as how many cents their father made in a week, how much candy their mother ate in the course of an hour, and how many sexually transmitted diseases Kelly had from random strangers.  Considering Bud and Budrika were the smartest two in all of Bundy history, they had their dysfunctional ways.  Bud was a horny teenager with a desire to \"get some\", yet as hard as he tried, he never could.  In fact, Budrika once tried to set up a date for him with one of her friends, but it unfortunately did not work out.  Budrika, on the other hand, was not interested in sex yet.  She was what you might call underdeveloped.  Boys didn't pay much attention to her, except when they wanted help with their assignments.  The twins were the top two students on Polk High's honor roll.  People often had a hard time believing they came from the most inhumane family in America.</span></div></div>",

But everyone knew it wasn't right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo in the year 1912, a new Lord Graystoke stepped out of his parents jungle home one last time, wearing a suit twenty-years out of date he stood as professionally as a man raised mainly by slumping apes, and party by pictures and books of other men could have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood on deck against the railing of the ship, until his jungle home faded from his eyes into mist. The crew was respectful of this strangely, the leading being an old sliverback- er, old graying man, who had known his parents Micheal who once fancied himslef a pirate and may have set a ship on fire when he accidently fired into some gunpowder about twenty years ago. Micheal took him aside a few nights and would explain things Jane had not, or could not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the ship landed in England, Tarzan knew what his place was to be in this world. As Micheal said, his parents were Lord John Clayton, and Lady Alice. They were a viscount and viscountess, which was somewhat important people, they'd been trusted with going to a place called Afirca (Micheal showed him it on the map, it wasn't far from the massive island Tarzan grew up on) and were expected to return to England when Tarzan was five. Of course they never made it. Tarzan also took up a new name, like his father and a distant cousin, he took up the name John, but refused the surname Clayton as he refused relations to the horried man who nearly killed all he loved, his own cousin as he found out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen docking he was in wonder and to behold at all of the sunlight, and brick and people, though land was little harder walk on for a moment. He was even more surpised there were people not only to greet Jane, but himslef as well, a pointy, serious man in a very nice suit approached. He took one look at this unmannered, fighting stance, the long savage locks, and those curious and confused childish eyes and knew exactly who it was. <br>\r\n\"Lord Graystoke, sire its wonder to finally see you.\" And he showed proper respect with a small bow. Tarzan stared a bit confused, glanced sideways at Jane whom was chatting with her friends excitedly and returned. Slowly and carefully he extended his hand. <br>\r\n\"Uh-John...\" and waited for a handshake that would never come. The man simply rose and politely returned it back to Tarzan very carefully. <br>\r\n\"My Lord, I am the caretaker of your parents estate, Mr. Hobkins.\" He chuckled politely as he added this next part \"and it seems like we have a lot to do, my Lord. Would you be coming with me to return home now, sire?\" He spoke as if speaking to someone who was at least a decade younger than a man in his twenties</span></div></div>",

He knew doing their homework together ment the stronger two (Ashley in her bow and Bruce with his bowl-cut) allowing the weaker ones to copy off the answers. He knew this seeing their perfect grades. Lenny, who lacked common sense, could probably only get B-marks if he tried on his own, the same with Constance, but it was David's prefect grades that tipped him off to what the children were doing. If those public school morons even tried doing their job David would've been in a different class than the rest of his children. A less than prefect class taught in a trailer or a mostly unused part of the school. They couldn't have that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat David was gifted in height was at the price of his intelligence. His siblings protected him very well, he almost always had a smile- never fully grasping the idea of things. Only that Father told them do something, it should be done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now his children protected David as they stood around him in their little nightgowns and bathrobes, all planing to take the punishment for David's accident. They came to him this late saying they all had wet the bed.<br>\r\n\"My children,\" Father adressed slowly, removing his pipe from his mouth \"leave me alone with David.\"<br>\r\nAll pf their tiny eyes got wide and everyone spoke at once, David had never talked to father himself and the others knew it was bad then- \"NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a puff of fire the children slowly went out of Father's study in a single line with heads hung. As each left David the scene became more clear and Father now just had one boy in front of him. The ten-year-old shook with fear as between his robe one could clearly see a wet patch on pajama pants that was growing again and even leaking a vit on to the tile.<br>\r\n\"Y-yes Father?\" David tried sounding as respectable as his siblings, but it was lost between held back tears.<br>\r\n\"Oh my son,\" Father said sitting back in his armchair</span></div></div>",

Writers also do not like short, abrupt lazy chapters. Stop doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) In the past you might have got a writer just by starting an interactive. This is 2016 and that will almost never work unless you have actual writing. A high chapter count will get people to check an interactive, but if its full of junk no one will add anything good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) If you are running an interactive please apply quality control. It is worth deleting one line spam chapters and lazily slapped together chapters so that the interactive can draw in those who actually want tot write. Monitor your interactive so that spammers do not overrun it or destroy good storyline. If you are a user, don\u2019t bother bumping a dead interactive unless you are willing to write an actual story chapter. People will not add to someone else\u2019s option chapters in this day and age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Writers are drawn to actual storyline and writing. If starting a storyline all by yourself is too daunting, team up with a like minded friend. This is a fun writing experience in itself, but can encourage others to try their luck, writers are drawn to actual writing. Other additions should be welcome but remember: apply quality control or you risk being buried in sludge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) If you do find someone to write with, feel free to email them to make sure your on the same page idea wise and to exchange ideas and keep a branch on tone. Be wary of writing with anyone who refuses to respond to their writing email as they will generally just do whatever the fuck they want regardless of what your going for. But with open writers, try and be flexible and be willing to compromise.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A square man in a no nonsense gray trench coat and fedora walking your way down the street was nothing to sneeze at. Even more so when you take in the fact that the Gangreen Gang was closely behind him. But none of them had their normal smug, snake-like looks of planned evil for the man. Each one was battered and bruised to a point: Ace was silently bemoaning the damage done to his trademark shades, Grubber had more bends to him than normal, Big Billy was a little sore, even Arturo, and Snake were sure something was ingured. No one spoke a word as Jack Wednesday, truant office, lead them from the local preschools parking lot to a car just as square and gray as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandford, you're sitting up front.\" Spoke gary man in a rapid, but monotone, no nonsense voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-it's-\" Snake went to correct, normally his friends woild laugh at his name, but Jack had them all quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't ask what you perfered to be called,\" he turned around and leaned in close to the boys, easily intimidateding them all with their prides still hurt \"you will be addressed by your legal name only, the ones on your birth records-those who have them- from now on and you punks will answer to them. Now Sandford, front seat. The one next to the steering wheel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a single complaint, Snake slithered past the man and into the front seat as the other four found ways to fit in the back seat. Ace's legs were almost to his chin, Bobby took up two seats, to Arturo had to sit on Grubber, Mr. Wednesday watched them as he fixed his mirrors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seatbelts, boys. We're going home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,- we live-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was not asking for your home addresses, Ace. I was telling you boys to put your seat belts on as it is very clear raising yourselfs has not lead to an ideal situation for anyone, as I said, we are going home. We will eat a balanced meal consisting for at least four basic food groups, and figure out whst to do about farthering your education.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The four basic food groups dose not refer to pizza, Grubber. You boys will learn that, come hell or high water.\" Jack said ss he put the car in drive and sped off, being sure to do the speed limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA car ride had never felt so long, awkward and quiet. Once in a while the boys would exchange looks, or look to Ace. But the oldest of the green-skinned gang never glanced back, or even moved his head from the headrest and staring up at the ceiling. He didn't even seemed bothered by his black locks in his eyes instead of their normal brushed to the side or back where he liked them. Once in a while, Big Billy or Lil' Arturo would dare risk it and poke him to make sure he was still awake, just in case one of those dodge balls did some damage to his brain. But really, this happened a few times before: it was like broken shades made for a broken Ace. At least until he could get a hold of a new or spare pair from his stash at the dump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the front seat, Snake fidgeted quietly for a few minutes, drumming the ends of his cushion a few times as he eyes wandered around. Wednesday would glance at him if his eyes fell on the man, so he quickly looked away from that. With his eyes up front again they fell on the radio in seconds. He was the only one in the car with a smile across his all-too-long face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car almost jumped off the road at the high volume and quickness that loud rock music filled the small space. Seat-belts or not the passage joined in the jump and some even kept jumping, enjoying the tunes and the level they were being played at. Snake, on the other hand,didn't even get a second to sit back and enjoy as he found he was scolded in unison but Mr. Wednesday and Ace:<br>\r\n\"Turn that down or off-\"<br>\r\n\"Turn that carp off-\"<br>\r\nand even then Snake heard none of it over the music, what got him to obey was a hard smack to the back of his head from the backseat. When the radio clicked off, there was still noise going on as Arturo and Grubber spent an extra few seconds head-banging and or humming alone, seemingly deaf to the fact that the song had stopped. Grubber came to figure it out and second before and gripped Arturo's head.<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" He looked around, and his eyes landed in the mirror as those square, unhappy eyes looked back at him, Arutro was quick to fold his hands into his lap instead of out and making an \"you rock\" or other symbols with his hands. \"Eh-eh-eh- we okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside for Billy making a few uneasy whimpers from the tension and being stuck in such a tiny car, everyone else held their breath as Mr. Wednesday, never taking his eyes off the road, and using the mirror to look back at them, slowly and safely pulled over to the shoulder as busy traffic sped by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you boys have gone undisciplined for a while, and I was hoping to survive the car ride before any rules were set in stone. That radio stunt could've distracted me worse and we could all be on the side of the road, and spread across some other punks windshield. Which implies what?\"<br>\r\nBilly really thought about it for a second, but wasn't sure what 'implied' meant, Snake tried to answer but he didn't even open his mouth before the man went on.<br>\r\n\"That's right, at least half of us would be roadkill or at least badly injured- seeing as you boys are already injured from those super-powered-princesses and their teachers' little game, I doubt you'd want more injuries today. Speaking of injuries, Ace-\" He turned his mirror just a bit back to the oldest, who now sat straight-up with his hands between his knees and his eyes clearly wide as his bent sunglasses rested folded and hooked onto the neckline of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was only-\" He still tried to turn on his charm, but the man went on.<br>\r\n\"-If you touch Sanford or the other boys like that again, you won't be happy with what I'm going to do. Because you need to learn-\"<br>\r\nAce had heard this before, plenty of times from a number of those annoying reasonable adults, and as the man went on and on and Ace stopped listening, his mind tried telling himself this guy was bluffing like the others. Push him far enough and he wouldn't do a thing but yell. He knew it had to be a bluff. But then again, no one told his heart rate that as the eyes stared him down and him alone. He felt things slow down a little as his heart-rate picked up. He wasn't even facing the backseat and it had Ace in this state. He knew he wasn't a wuss, give him a chance and he could probably smooth talk the guy. But Wednesday wasn't letting that happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I make myself clear? You can understand that, Ace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only snapped back into thought after hearing his name, \"Crystal, mistah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Answered Wednesday as he turned the car from park into drive, \"I'm glad we understand each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car ride rolled on for about only a few more seconds before it stopped again, this time for good. The gang watched with confused looks as Wednesday large frame stepped out of the car.<br>\r\n\"Hey, lookit!\" Billy pointed forward with a big smile at the large sign in front of the car that read \"Townsvile Dump\", naturally he as the first one to start getting out of the car, but due to the size of the doors he was the last one to actually step outside. Jack checked his watch as he waited for the boy to come to him at the entrance.<br>\r\n\"As you boy know, trust is something you earn, given this I will trust you to go into your little hangout and collect any things you need, but I will be accompanying you to the actual building. It'd be crazy to let you go in alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know-\" Arutro started but was cut off this time by Ace.<br>\r\n\"Let's just get this over with guys..\" and he lead the way in the front while Mr. Wednesday picked the the pace at the back. The sun starting to turn orange and shin on the piles of trash almost made the place look nice, every used car beamed a different shade, and even the rust seemed to have a nice calming look, if only it could do something for the smell.<br>\r\nThis hangout, or hideout, from location to its deign, seemed fitting Jack thought. It was a rundown little shack clearly put together with scraps of unfinished wood, some of it nailed in place, while the majority of pieces where held up on good-faith. A clear reminder that, no matter height, or sizes, or looks, these were in fact children he was dealing with. A fact even shown in their criminal records of petty theft, assault, and vandalism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChildren got bored and would often act on impulse leading to such acts; tormenting older people for \"kicks\", or spray-painting things from names to pictures on building sides. Children even often hung out in or around convenience stores, buying snacks and treats, and when they had no money, children would sometimes steal these snacks. It in no way warranted the treatment they got from the Powerpuff Girls. Though, he supposed to preschool-aged little girls, anyone over the age of twelve seemed like fully capable adults, who thought ahead with each plan they made and understood their actions would lead to consequences. It still didn't explain the reactions of the other law enforces in this town, but he supposed that's what you got with a feeble, old man in office. In his day there probably wasn't a line between children and adult criminals. He might not have even be a ware they were children. He supposed Ace could pass for just barely a legal adult, while those like Arutro, Grubber, and William were too...unique-looking for their age to be determined aside for in their teeth and birth-records (those who possessed them, Grubber was very hard to track down). But Jack watched them slink inside like the hurt children they were, he made a mental note that some of their injuries would need minor treatment, at least for a few days.</span></div></div>",

But we were having a very hard time with the training aspect of becoming a spy in fact we were failing at the traininh but there was no way would give up that when Mr. Lewis seid had an idea that could make the training easier and would allow us to become proper spies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mr. Lewis what do you have in mind?\" I politely asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ladies I figured the best way to solve your training problem, would be to use this...\" Jerry Lewis pull out a strange device from his desk drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm what is that thing you're holding?\" Stella asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was about to say. This is a Rejuvenation Ray and it would allow for you ladies to be reverted back to your late teen's early twenties. The only question I have is who would like to be rejuvinated first.\" Jerry Lewis explained <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">Stella</span>, <span class=\"cblue\">Carmen</span>, and I took some to discuss who should go first, I suggested I should go first since Samantha was the team leader of our daughters spy team i was surprised to hear <span class=\"cblue\">Carmen</span> and <span class=\"chotpink\">Stella</span> agree with my suggestion and since we were in agreement I gave Mr. Lewis our answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Lewis i would like to be the one to be rejuvinated first. just one question will it hurt?\" I answered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jerry Lewis shook his head no then answered \"No in fact it'll feel like years are melting away. Just one other question before i use the Rejuvenation Ray what age would you like to be rejuvinated to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think about that real quick and then I decided on eighteen and answered Mr. Lewis question \"I would like to be reverted/rejuvinated back to eighteen years old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthat when Jerry Lewis fired the Rejuvenation Ray at me and it in indeed felt like the years had melted away in fact i felt great Jerry had even brought out a full-length mirror so that I could take a look at myself and sure enough I looked like I did when I was 18 years. I looked over at <span class=\"cblue\">Carmen</span> and <span class=\"chotpink\">Stella</span> who had shocked expressions on there face I guess they were shocked at how young I now was/looked. I told them that they needed to decide who would be next to get rejuvinated because i was going to go train even hard to become a spy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwho should be rejuvenated next<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"chotpink\">Stella</span> <span class=\"cblack\">should get rejuvenated next?</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cblack\">or</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cblue\">Carmen</span> <span class=\"cblack\">should get rejuvenated next?</span></b></span></div></div>",

Ten minutes. 15 minutes. Suddenly, the silence was broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Mr. White, but shouldn't the train have been here, like 10 minutes ago?\", Todd asked from underneath the track bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalter just looked confused and turned his head to Mike who gave him a fatigued look back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening, yo?\", Jesse asked as well. \"Mr. White?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalter started to look more concerned, but after a few more minutes, he waved at Mike and Kobi to join up with them underneath the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two men walked up to Walter, Kobi said: \"Looks like it ain't happening today after all, folks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this makes no sense...\", Walter said nervously. \"What could have gone wrong? Mike?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike looked out into the desert, looked like he was thinking things over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I am going to kill her!\" He suddenly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jesse exclaimed. \"Wait...Woah, woah, wow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has fucked with us for the last time now, and now my patience has run out, Kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cell phone rang. It was Walter's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Walter answered and continued in a sarcastic voice: \"Oh, hi Lydia. Guess what? Your train never came through here, and Mike is about to come pay you a visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, NO, NO!\" Lydia's squeeky voice was loud enough to be heard by everybody, even without speaker phone. \"There must have been a change in my company's shipping plan, which my boss didn't tell me about. There is no way, I could have known!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like, she is telling the truth.\" Jesse remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless\", Walter countered. \"We need a plan to get a hold of her again, cause without that Methlamine, we got no grounds for continuing our business. And we need a plan fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
