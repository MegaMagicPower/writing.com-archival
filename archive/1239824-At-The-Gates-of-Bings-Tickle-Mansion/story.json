A monolithic and modern structure stands before you.

Bi-tri-quad-and quint clawed feet are all represented in abundance, and come in countless sizes and varieties. One pair of pudgy green specimens which rest alone against the far wall are large enough to make a comfortable chair, and are orientated that they might have been intended to be used as such. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Awed by the sheer scale of the perfect green soles, you approach in a daze. You intentionally flick your tail over the various prepared soles as you pass, dispelling any suspicions you might have had that they might not have been organic as you feel them squirm in your wake, various clawed soles tugging pointlessly as the restraints holding them back.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your designated targets are almost as big as you are and thoughtfully arrayed at an angle. The ending halves of the toes are embedded in the floor, while the back end of the heel is trapped in the wall, using the angles of the room itself as an ample restraint. The arches are so deep that you could sit in them like a chair.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>They must be super-sensetized if they rarely actually touch the ground... </i>You think, reaching out a clawed hand to explore the region and test you're hypothesis. Before you even make contact, the entire fleshy green expanse trembles slightly, making an obvious but highly futile attempt to contract and pull away. <i>What?  You're kidding me! If the skin-thickness level is at all relative to the size of these babies, not to mention how all the extra weight of whatever they're supposed to be attached to might have increased the toughness level beyond the norm, then the owner must be ticklish as hell.

The entire foot shakes and trembles with barely-suprressed strength and conviction as you tease it, swirling your claws in increasingly expansive random patterns. The whole thing is impressively soft, and incapable of offering the slightest resistance to your merciless, relentless hands, which explore every inch of the exposed soles. You delight in the way you can gently trace your hands over it and feel is shake, seeing the individual muscles and tendons flex as it pulls on the very floor, unable to offer the slightest resistance or objection to your crawling hands.      </span></div></div>",

It looks just like an old arcade game-a slanting, brightly decorated oblong box on legs with a screen. Looking bizarrley out of place are a pair of lightly fur covered, darkly padded feet potruding from the top, surrounded by several neatly arranged tickle tools. Bemused, you read the words engraved on the wall at head height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So, you think your a skilled tickler, huh?

A digital clock lights up underneathe the notice, counting down from five minutes. Hesitantly, you scratch lightly at the arch of one soft sole. It feels real, flexing sand wiggling despite the fact that  there's no room for somebody to sit or hide in the machine. Deciding not to question it, you dig deeper into the lovely curves, while laughter begins to emerge from two speakers set on the sides of the stand. Shaking your head and smiling, you begin to scratch more rapidly, the lightly pitched laughter increasing to match. This sure didn't feel like some kind of cheap machine. The bar at the back of the box begins to slowly fill with yellow, and you gleefully pull back the toes on one foot, picking up a toothbrush. The paw still waggles and jerkes about, trying to shake your fingers as they press into the sensetive digits, but the light gigling increases drastically when you begin to enthusiastilcly scrub away at the base of the toes. Chuckling a bit yourself, you start playfully nibbling at the base of the dark, main foot pad. As you begin to clean in between the toes energeticlly with the toothbrush, carfeully teasin in every little sensetive fold and niche, there is a loud <i>ding! </i>over the sounds of hysterical laughter. The bar has filled completely and the timer goes, signaling you to stop tickling. You put the toothbrush back, as a drawr marked 'Here is your prize!' pops open. You turn and slowly stride away from the game, examining the item. It's a small, circular pad, the underside of which is covered in bristles, with sveral small straps dangling from it. You hit a small button on the back, and the arrayed forest of bristles, whurring, move in opposite circles, while the straps tighten slightly. The directions on the back read 1. Attach firmly to body area with straps. 2. Activate. 3. Remove after desired affect had been acheived. Do not use  on face.<br>\r\nStill smiling at the gadget, you look around, wondering what to do next.    </span></div></div>",

You are asked questions. Questions that hardly have to do with tickling at all. Finally, the dragon asks you to go lay down on the table. She presses a button on the side, and the metal cuffs slide into place. You feel them slide into place on your wings and feet. \"Your tickler will be here in a few minutes\". And with that, the elderly she-dragon leaves the room, leaving you restrained on a table next to a warm fireplace. The heat soothes you, and it encourages you to think about your past. You are a noctowl, living with 1 sister and two brothers living in a large sycamore tree. Your family is poor, and they had recently heard about Bing's tickle mansion. They decided to send you, because they believed the more ticklish you were, the more money you earned. Of course, you know that's not true, but it's worth it for a new home. A knock on the door sends you reeling back into reality, and you here a voice say,\" hello, i'm tangrowth and i'll be your client for the day. Now, let me see your record...\" A large mess of vines walks into the room, and it gives you chills down your spine when you look at it's vines. They all look super ticklish! \"Ah,\" the grass-type says,\" i think i'll start with...hmmm... Yes, ingenious!\" You realize he is walking to your feet! you try to lean your head up to see what's going on, but a vine gently pushes it back down. \"Now now, just relax...\" After a few tense moments, you feel a tingling sensation on your right foot. CYou wiggle your foot to get it off. No good. Another vine joins in, attacking the dead center of your foot. You begin to giggle. \"Come on, that's not laughing!\" The tangrowth teases. He adds another vine to your other foot, sending you into loud bits of giggling. \"Heehehehaha!heheheheeeheehee! Hahaha!\" After at least fifteen minutes of him going around your feet in a delicate manner, the sensations stop. A blindfold is placed over your eyes. Uh-oh, this is gonna get better! You can't see where you'll be tickled next, so you almost jump a little when a vine begins to massage you soft, feathery belly. \"Hahahahehehehahahahahaaahahehehahehahahs! HHAHAHAHAA!\" The vines gently glide along the dead center of your tummy like tiny green ice skaters. HAHAHAHAAAHAAHAAHHAHAHEHEHEHAHAHAHAHAAHAA !\" Now you are gasping for breath. The vines continue, but lower, just below your hipbones. The vines cease their torturous act. They then move onto your wingpits, which is easily by far your most ticklish spot. It continues to tickle, giving you considerable amounts of laughter. Next, you feel a belt being placed on you, and when it turns on, you feel laughter on waves you'd never thought could be reached before. It doesn't stop there, however. Vines come out, tickling your feet, sides, privates, and belly all over. You can't stop laughing, this is the most intense you have ever been tickled in your life. After hours of this amazingly powerful form of torture, the vines recede, one by one, until nothing is left and your restraints are unlocked. You are given your requested money, and the tangrowth leaves the room. Now done with this strange place, you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your guide leads you down the left corridor you go past rows of doors, all of them closed. You try to see through the clouded glass windows but can't make anything out. Eventually you come to an open door and an empty room. \"If you would like to step inside and remove all your clothing the Professor will be with you shortly.\" Says the whatever it is before moving back down from where you came from. Stepping into the room the first thing you notice is a table, dead centre in the room. It's padded and covered with restraints as well as an assortment of joints and stuff underneath the table. It seems as though it can be move into different positions to allow access to different part of the victims body. In one corner there is a desk with a computor and normal desk items and in the other corner is a...what the heck is that? There's an odd machine almost like an MRI scanner but somethings different about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, better get out of these clothes,\" you think. You kick of your shoes and then remove your shirt. Then in one move you pull down your pants and boxers stepping out of them and removing your socks along the way. Unsure of what to do with them you dump your clothes next to the desk and sit up on the padded table waiting for the Proffesor, your hands automatically covering your groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the door opens and a human man walks in. Hes about 30 with short black hair and is wearing a white lab coat. \"Ah you must be Alex. I'm Professor Alex Miller!\" He says with a warm smile and extends his hand \"no need to be shy, im a professional, I've seen it all before,\" and eventually you uncover your groin to shake his hand. \"Now thank you for volunteering with us today, all you have to do is stay for the entire procedure and you'll get paid. Unfortunetly, if you bottle out mid way through then no money for you. We're going to start by mapping out your tickle areas. This will provide us with information on which prototypes will be best to test on you as well as what to expect so our results are accurate. To do this we use that big machine over there.\" He motions to the MRI thing you noticed earlier. \"What does that do?\" You ask<br>\r\n\"Well first we strap this funny looking hat to your head to measure your brain waves. Then this machine will scan you to find ever neuron receptor site on your body that responds to tickling. Once these are located, what can only be described as, a tickling laser will target and stimulate each and every one, at a time. The hat will then measure how much your brain reacts to the stimulation. The greater the reaction the more ticklish you'll be in that area.\" <br>\r\n\"Erm ok, so how long will that take?\" You ask, it sounds quite complex. <br>\r\n\"It's actually pretty fast, you'll have an odd tingling sensation for about 5 seconds and then your done. Now if you'd like to lie upon the bed we can begin.\" You walk over to the 'bed' which is basically just a clear plastic rectangle sticking out the machine. You are instructed to lie down flat on your back with your arms above your head and once down you attempt to get some comfort on the cold hard surface but it's pretty much in vain. \"Yeah sorry about that.\" Says Alex \"but we need a see through surface so that the lasers can get the whole of your body, try not to fidget too much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your in position Alex flicks some switches and you move into the machine. It's lit well and the 'bed your lying on is surrounded by a glass tube. Past the glass is a frame with a lots of mini dots seemingly randomly placed about it. You assume this is where the tickle lasers come form. Also attached to the frame is a thin box that is the length of your whole body. Alex closes over a door sealing you inside and you notice that the inside of the door is also covered in dots and has a thin box across it. \"Hey can you hear me?\" Alex's voice can be heard coming from speakers from somwhere inside. \"Yeah!\" You respond<br>\r\n\"Ok, good. If you feel above you, you should find that hat I was talking about, could you put it on and fasten the chin strap. You feel about and manage to get it on, it's leathery with lots of wires sticking out, you can't see it but you still feel silly for wearing it. \"Now I'm going to start up the machine, stay as still as you can,\" a humming starts and you stiffen, concentrating on not moving. The box suddenly shines a thin red strip of light across your body and then the entire frame it's attached to rotates moving it across your body. The same happens at your feet and once it's circled you it stops. Next, the lasers begin and although you can't see them you can certainty feel the effects. The lasers are one at a time but,happen so quickly that it feels like ants are simultaneously crawling across your entire body, you have to bite your tongue to stop yourself from giggling and moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter, 5 ticklishly long seconds it finally stops,  you take off the hat and then the 'bed slides you back out the machine. \"Well done, come look at this.\" Alex leads you over to the computer and on the screen is a 3d image of your body coloured a bit like a thermal camera would with a scale on the side, only instead of temperature it's ticklishness and God you where ticklish. You had always known but seeing it on the screen like this really hit home, you had tickle spots you never knew you had! \"This is astonishing! Virtually every inch of your body is ticklish. Most of it is above average!\" Alex starts to get excited \"you know if all goes well then I might have to make you an offer to become a permanent tester for our tickling tools, gadgets and gizmos,\" <br>\r\n\"Erm that's all well and good,\" you interrupt \"but can I get dressed yet?\" You where still stark naked it it was beginning to feel awkward. <br>\r\n\"Oh so sorry,\" Alex says and starts rummaging through one of the draws of the desk, \"here this should fit nicely,\" he produces a pair of blue speedos which you stare at before giving him an odd look \"I know, but we need access to most of your body so as little clothing as possible makes it much easier.\" He says. With a sigh you take the speedos and turn around to put them on. They're actually quite comfortable and fit you very well just as Alex said they would, he must have done this a lot to be able to guess your size so accurately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" Alex says \"looking at your tickle body chart I have 3 alpha stage products in mind.\":<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~\"Firstly we have the tickle soap: it is prank soap that people can use to mess with their friends. When someone uses it to wash then little nano bots are rubbed off and attach to the area that the soap has cleaned. They will then tickle that area after a delay of two hours. The purpose is so the person has a shower in the morning and uses the soap to wash their body. Then when they go out for the day they'll have a sudden embarrassing tickle attack all over their body in public. Quite clever, eh? The nano bots are harmless and eventually just fall off the body and decay, also for testing purposes the delay has been shortened to 5 minuets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~\"your feet seem quite ticklish so I'd like to test the tickle socks on you also. They're another pranking product. We have artificially created cilia cells and integrated them into the sock fibres. So these socks are covered in microscopic little hairs. They are designed to respond to certain wavelengths that will be emitted from remote and respond by waving about in random patterns across every part of the foot the cilia touch, so that would include everywhere from the ankles down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~\"finally, we have a new restraint system to test out. These consists of cuffs that go around you wrists, biceps, waist, thighs and ankles. They interact with the earth magnetic field too fix them selves in place so need for rope or chains. They can be moved into any position and stay there, suspending the victim midair if wanted. So I could have you hogtied 3 foot of the ground and no rope hanging from the ceiling and getting in the way. Now don't think you'll be getting a brake. We need a thrashing victim to test out the strength of these cuffs so I'll be personally tickling you silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he finishes explains the door opens and in comes the creature that led you here before, \"here's the alpha stage products you asked for babe,\" it says as it hands over 3 different sized boxers to Alex \"thanks honey,\" Alex says as he takes them and puts them on the desk, \"are we still on for dinner tonight?\" It asks<br>\r\n\"You know it,\" Alex responded with a smile. With that it left. <br>\r\n\"Honey?\" you ask<br>\r\n\"\"Yeah we're dating,\" he says happily \"is't she beautiful?\" Well now you know it's a she. \"So then!\" Alex says getting back to the point \"which do you want to start with?\"</span></div></div>",

She types in a few characters and presses some other, more exotic buttons. She then grins up at you. \"Down the hallway to the left. Room #347. Take this security pass; just slide it into the treminal beside the door. Good luck!\" She exclaims brightly, while you thank her and walk away, down the white-washed, sterile hallway. Arriving at laboratory 347, you square yourself, and swipe in the card. With a beep, the door is suddenly just<i> open</i>, and you walk into the small room beyond, which resembles a dentist's reception desk. Yet another receptionest greets you warmly, before pressing a button and opening a closet to the left. \"If you would please change into these miss-and just these-we can commence testing ASAP.\" A liitle screen wall has also unfolded and curled around, giving you a nice private area to change out of your day clothes and into the two pieces of comfortable fabric, which covers roughly the same body area as a small bikini. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still feeling pangs of worry at what you've signed up for, you leave your clothes in a bin and begin to move into the next room. \"Please ly down on the table, and we can begin. Relax, you'll do fine!\" Says the receptionest as you complete your instructions. The 'table' is shaped like an 'x', and looks like it was made out of the exact same piece of material as the smooth white floor. You lie down and stretch out, jumping a bit as small portions of its surface seem to instantly liquify and envelope sections of your arms, legs, and torso.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Beginning overall ticklishness test. Stage one.\" Buzzes a mechanical voice, and you suddnely jump as something small applies pressure to your instep; which slowly moves down your foot. You kick your leg spasmodically, bubbling over with a steady stream of cute giggles as the sensations limn every nerve down your entire leg. It is soon mirrored on the other foot, and your laughter redoubles. Several other tendrils join the probing instruments, tracing plain vertical lines on each smooth, creamy sole. You are acutely aware of their individual paths, and your unending torrent of giggling testifies to just how sensitive you are down there. It keeps up for several minutes, but then you feel the tendrils- craning your head, you can clearly see that it's part of the bizarre furniture itself that's tickling you-moving uop to your ankles, kneading and tracing, but don't spend nearly the time. Your knees-front and back-are soon subject to their squeezing and prodding, and you start really laughing and reflexively tugging at the restraints, unprepared for their sensetivitie. The tendrils elongate, dragging their tips along your long, tanned legs, until they come to your thighs and alter tact, squeezing instead of lightly brushing and scratching. It already seem like it's been going in for ages, the steady, incessant feelings almost as bad as the shorter, more intense experiences you've been put through by friends and family members in the past. Soon though, their back onto still more sensitive ground, and you laugh louder when you feel them dragging along your toned belly, again and again. Two thick bands hold you steady while another inserts itself into you deep navel, throughorly explouring every fold and section of the side. They begin to move on, while it seams the machine has forgotten something, briefly sending two thick tentacles back to explore your shapely hips, while the others poke about your ribs.You feel the table contracting slightly, forcing your back into a bridge position in midair, and allowinganother cluster of the things free acces to your back and shoulders. The others lengthen still further, scratching rhythmically at your exposed underarms at length. To finish, they all play all about your neck, arms and ears, leaving barely a square millimeter of skin untouched. Breathing heavily, but surprised by how enjoyable that was, you look to a screen built into the wall nearby, displaying reading of your various body sections and the overall sensetivity located therien. It states that you are in the higher echelons of those tested and several options for the makeup of your immediate next test. Wondering how to acces it, the table suddenly reverts to its normal shape, freeing you. You collect yourself and, after thinking it out, sellect:</span></div></div>",

The texture feels good and slightly tickly against your bare feet as you walk over and sit down in the giant chair the receptionist beckons to. There is another one like it, only opposite you and on the other side of a small table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese aren't the only furnishings however. Towards the back of the room is a table that looks like something from a doctor's office: the bed patients sit on. The examination table has a set of stocks at the foot of it, and a pair of manacles at the head with chains attached to the floor. You notice an extra touch: clasps on the sides of the table, meant to keep your wings from covering your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any questions before I leave?\" asks the receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes actually. What happens now?\" you respond. She doesn't exactly make it too obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, sorry. Let me explain; in a few minutes, one of our examiners will come sit with you and ask a few questions. After that, she will ask you to lie on that examination table back there, strap you, and tickle you according to your answers.\" The explanation is a little cryptic and long, but you get the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind her, the receptionist promptly leaves to the other visitors in the lobby. You relax in the giant comfy chair, letting the excitement and nervousness wash over you. It helps that the carpet and walls of the room are solid colors, as it distracts you less from your bubble of focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too long after you settle down, the examiner comes enters the room and smiles warmly. She's a human, slightly shorter than you and very slim. Her brown hair falls to her shoulders and her turquoise eyes are filled with a calm happiness that seems to emanate from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. You're here to have your ticklishness tested, right?\" You nod. \"Of corse you are,\" she continues. Smiling at you, she makes her way to the chair opposite you and sits. A clipboard is held in her left arm, with a pen and a few sheets of paper. Looking through them, she says \"I'm going to ask you a few questions. We simply want to make sure you're comfortable. First of all, your age?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fourteen,\" you answer. Dragons always strike out at a very young age, which seems an odd practice but too deeply ingrained to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm. And where were you born?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe questions carry on like that for a while, personal but unrelated to tickling. Slowly though, the questions become things like \"Have you ever been bound while being tickled?\" and \"Have you every tickled someone else?\" (the answer to both of them being yes). As the examiner nears the part where your test begins, she gets up and moves over towards the examination table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Well, according to these results you are <i>hyper</i> ticklish all over, no one spot being less ticklish than any other.\" This is true: the slightest touch anywhere causes you to burst out giggling, and you have no preferences as to where you are tickled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, if you could please lie down we'll begin with the next part of your test: the examination.\" She says it with a look of absolute calm, which in turns helps settles you a bit. Walking over, you stretch yourself out on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe examiner locks your feet in the stocks, then uses the same key to shackle your wrists. Even your wings are pulled taught by the restraints on either side of the bed. Once finished, you are spread taught out open and exposed on the examination table, with your arms high above your head. Your ankles are locked in the stocks far away from each other, exposing your thighs and knees. Defenseless much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm going to tickle you all over your body for ten minutes,\" says your tester. \"If the data I get is insufficient, the process will be repeated. If you truly are unable to endure any more, yell mansion.\" And with that, she starts reaching for your...</span></div></div>",

The darker the shade of red on the tablet, the more ticklish. Of course there is light red ticklishness on the feet and toes, along with yellow(medium) on the hips and thighs. But now you know how to scare the girl.You finally enter the room, and you clap your hands together at the plethora of devices and tools at your disposal. The girl is particularly hot. Her body is very well in shape, curves and all. Her boobs are huge, and sexy. Her striking green eyes are wide open, as she frantically searches the room for an explanation to her current situation. Her hair is long and black. Your favorite feature, however, is her deep navel, deeper than any navel you've ever seen. You look back at the tablet and notice her name, Sabrina. The creature who took you here stands by the doorway. \"You have thirty minutes to show us what you can do, if you break the laughter scale, you can expect a chance to tickle one of our best ladies. She is very hard to crack, but if you can break the laughter scale on this one, you'll get a CHANCE at her.\" You smile mischievously. \"Who is she? And how do I get a 100% chance at tickling her\" you ask curiously. The secretary bluntly say, \"Break the scale first.\" she slams the door shut. The girl swallows, \"Tickle? What does she mean tickle?\" You snicker. \"I think you already know the answer to that question\" you hiss as you fold a blindfold over the girl's eyes. You decide to tease her first. \"I know that you are most ticklish on your legs and lower body, so I won't tickle your upper body at all\" you lie. You see the girl's face relax as she lies back to you, \"Oh no, not my lower body!\" You laugh again, knowing that the girl is completely oblivious to your plans. You begin stroking her thighs as she giggles, almost enjoying her reduced tickle sentence...for now. She tenses up and begins laughing as you move to her feet, but not even close to halfway through the laughing scale. \"HAHHAHAHAHAH OH NOHOHOHO\" she exaggerates her laughter, trying to pretend that she has ticklish lower body. Suddenly, without warning, you jump up to her boobs and begin lightly tickling them with you nails. \"ohohoho HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA YOU LIHAHAHAHAHAR\" she cries. You move to her armpits and begin squeezing her armpits. \"AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH STAHAHAHAHAHAHAHP SCREHEHEHEHEWW YOHOHOHOHU\"</span></div></div>",

She's about four feet tall, with tiny C-cup breasts and smooth, shapely legs. Everything about her is petite, from her waistline to her arms. She's dressed only in her bra and panties, the restraints around her wrists and ankles keeping her in the chair and preventing her from removing the blindfold she's wearing. What can be seen of her face reveals a sharp cuteness about her.<br>\r\nThe recliner's set back, allowing free access to her little pink feet, and her restraints place most of her body in the same accessibility.<br>\r\n\"Wh-who's there?\" She squeaks again, her tail curling against her small body. She sounds scared. Maybe you should take off the blindfold so she'll be a little calmed.<br>\r\nOr you could jump right into the tickling, allowing her anxiety to boost her ticklishness.</span></div></div>",

Pease don't, I'm just too ticklish!\" <i>Really? Huh, not much of a test in that case</i>. You think, but decide not to question your good fortune. \"All the more luck for me! Just try to relax and enjoy yourself.\" Before you can start, though, a recorded voice says; \"Before you commence, the goal of this test is to asess the willpower and endurance of the PT. In a moment, the device will activate fully. You must turn the crank, thereby producing a continous light tickle. Miss Fieldsprite, you may stop the tickle at any time by saying 'hallelujah', but remember a harder tickle will be administered later if you choose to do this.

Thusly, this test will ensure you have the determination to use whatever is available to cause someone to give in. Better time means a higher score. Good luck.

She bursts out laughing, but soon devolves into an unending stream of giigles interspersed with rapid pleading, and somethig about quitting on her first day on the job. She squirms to one side to escape one set of feathers, only for the opposing quartet to press in harder. She jumps an inch offf the seat as a result, and pulls on her trapped paws with all her leg strength, but the small, fuzzy little extremities refuse to budge, let alone come back through the straps. \"Hahahahaha! Stohohohop! Pleheehease! You Win-eeheeheeheeee!\" She pleads, and you respond by telling her that she doesn't have to put up witht this, that if she wants it to stop, all she needs to say is hallelujah. \"C'mon, are you sure you don't like this? You're laughing<i> so </i>hard... Aww, is de wittle mousey girl ticklish? Does this tickle a bit? You know, if you want it to stop, you only have to say the magic word...\" You alternate between taunting and reasoning, trying anything and everything you've learned over the years by speaking to a victim, trying to make her more ticklish and destroy her resolve. <i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually</i>, it works. With one final, rebellios spasm, she snaps and cries :\"Okayhahahay! Hallallujah! Stohohop! Pleheease!\" You go on for a few seconds, enjying yourself, but then remember the timer, and abruplty stop in mid crank. \"Congratulations. You have done well on this test.

Sitting in the darkness, you listen to the sounds of twin pairs of heavy footsteps aproaching, clamouring nearby, and then slowly receding again. Sighing with releife, you open the door a crack, and peek out. The tigress is standing right outside, hands on slender hips. \"Now where have those bozos got to?\" She grunmbles. \"How long does it take them to apprehend a few intruders? (<i>sigh</i>) I'll think I'll wait for them here.\" She takes a seat on a stone bench right out side your hiding place. Pulling back from the door, your head bumps against a pair of somethings hanging from the ceiling. Examination shows them to be leather restraints and cuffs. Suddenly, a wicked idea barges into your mind. \"Hey, Hobbes.\" You say slyly. \"How's about a little revenge on our friend out there? Maybe teach her a lesson or two where setting huge, ravening monsters on unlucky people are concerned.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Er, what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just watch.\" You find the light-switch, flick it, and swing the door open. The tigress turns at the noise, and youv'e grabbed her and yanked her inside before she can scream. Swiftly clapping the leather cuffs over her wrists, hoisting her arms above her head, you procede to bind her foot-paws a similiar was to the floor, but with her legs held wider and with less wriggle room. \"Right,\" You say regarding her triumphantly. \"I think its my duty, as a nice person, to teach you a few things about kidnapping and sending monsters after unfortunate people.\" She just stares at you, looking more than a little scared to be at your mercy and with her sidekicks so far away. \"As we are at Bing's Tickle Mansion, I think I should start your instruction by tickling you.\" Her eyes widen and she lets out a little gasp as yoiu poke her in the belly. Seeing this, you put a hand to each of her sides, holding them steady while you enthusiastically dig a thumbclaw into a pair of sensitive spots just above her waist. 'Hahahah! I'msohohosohorry!Pleeheehesestohohop!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Join in Hobbes, it's even funner than it looks.\" Initially he seems reluctant, many people are when it comes to tickle-torture, but he soon gets going pretty hard on your captive's helpless armpits, scratching with his short little claws while you go at her belly and sides. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After an undisturbed while, you let up the punishment. Exhausted by your sctions, she hangs, almost limp, in her restraints. You cup her delicate chin in your hand, forcing her to look you in the eye. \"Now, I expect that you work here.\" She nods. \"Good. Tell me, where are the dungeons? Or wherever it is that you keep your captives awaiting tickling?\" She sighs. \"From here? Go down the opposite corridor from this room, you should come to a spiral staircase. Follow it down and you'll be at the dungeons.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good.

And remember, if it turns out that you've lied to us or sent us into a trap, we know right where to find you.\" You give her armpit one last scratch, making her jump, before striding from the small room, Hobbes in tow.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Hobbes virtually collapses next to you. \"I think (pant) we lost them (pant pant).\" He Gasps. It seems he's right; as there's no sign of the three any-where. Collecting yourselves, you eventually catch you breathe and continue on.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Rounding a bend, you step into a rectangular room, more of a wider stretch of hallway, really, with two rows of pillars running through it. The nearest one looks broken or somehow damaged, but a quick inspection shows that it was built with two large sections that fold out near the base, with holes in them closer to the floor. Idly wondering what that could be disigned for, but not giving it much thought, you press on, Hobbes almost literally on your tail. Suddenly, the calm quiet of the hallway is cut into by \"Eeeck! C'mon Rise- please don't tickle meheeheehee!\" At the last pair of pillars, a creature resembling a small fox-type furry with reddish fur is trapped in the columm itself, with just her paws and head sticking out, and her white belly showing though a squareish gap cut into her confines. A similar furry, also with white on the tips of her ears,tail and belly, but with golden-bronze fur, is engrossed with tickling the helpless vixen. \"Cootchie-cootchie -coo, Set. I think some revenge is in order after what <i>you</i> did to <i>me</i> back there.\" She purrs, tickling her captive's left foot-paw with one hand while running the other's pionter digit down her soft belly. \"Hahahahaha!\" Is all she gets as a replie. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Grinning, you motion for Hobbes to be quiet and walk up behind the golden-furred gal. So engaged with tickling, she doesn't hear you. In fact, it's only when you put your paws to her sides and start tickling her enthusiastically that she acknowledges you, witch she does by leaping up a foot into the air, and bringing her arms in towards her body in a futile gesture to lessen the tickling. \"What the-hahhaha! Whos there?\" She squeaks, falling to her knees, and then the floor, to escape your tickling hands. \"Oh, I just thought I'd interupt you to tell you that that's no way to tickle someone; and I suppose I'll have to demonstrate to you how to do it otherwise.\" Standing up, the vixen would be under five feet tall, much smaller than you, and your alot stronger than she is. Kneeling down, you stradle her waist, then sieze her wrists with your hands, before putting them both in one of your paws and pinning them above her head. \"For starters,your only spider tickling her belly, like this.\" You waggle your fingers against her side, making her giggle. \"That's great to begin with, but if you want to really tickle someone, try this.\" You form your right hand into a 'pincer' shape and start going at her side, digging in the thumb. This causes her to burst out laughing and squirm wildly, trying to break free of your grip. \"Wow!\" You exclaim. \"You really are ticklish! I think I better give you a few more lessons, and maybe punish you for tickling that helpless girl over there like that.\"   <br>\r\n      <br>\r\n <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Remembered Set. <i>She always was too sensitive down there for her own good</i>.<i>If I can just get them in a head-lock or something...  </i> She swiftly scrambled into a kneeling position, whilst Rise recovered and came at her again. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It went back and forth, om and on, as they both tried to pin the other and get at her most ticklish spots without leaving themselves vulnerable to the same treatment. Eventually, Set gambled by diving around her sister, snatching at her small padded feet. \"Eeep! Nohohohoho! NOT THERE!\" Screams Rise, falling to the side and shaking with laughter as her twin scribbles all over with her nails. At any moment now, she would have to say the word, have to give in... Out of the corner of her foggy vision, she noticed her tormentors feet waving as she sought a better tickling angle, and reached for them, grabbing them in a headlock identical to the one being opposed on her own limbs. They stayed like that for several long moments, each laughing almost too much to continue tickling the other, while unable to break free and knowing their only hope lay in lasting longer than their enemie. At nearly the exact same moment, they both give a final squirm and go slack, rolling away from each other and gasping \"Uncle.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whowee!\" You exclaim. \"I think we oughta call that a draw. What do you think, Hobbes?\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll have to agree with you there, man. They each broke in the exact same moment! So, what should we do now?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Oh, not put either of them in the stocks now. The important thing is too find my friend and a way out of here.\" You reply, helping the twins to their feet and pulling out some water bottles. \"Thirsty? Well, guys, there seems to be yet another fork in the road up ahead- maybe the architect was cross-eyed or something- which way should we go?\"</span></div></div>",

As the screams of laughter escelate, you run faster. Rounding a sharp bend, you see you've come to a small clearing. The edges of the open space are composed of virtual walls of vines. While many reamain still, blocking off both vision and movement, a few have reached out in places to entrap and tickle a group of unforetunate female furries that appear to have wanderd in here. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To your immediate left, a bunny girl is virtually mummified in the wall of vegetation, just her head and huge feet potruding from either end. A cluster of vine tips dance all about the surface of the trapped feet, causing the poor girl to howl with laughter and squeeze her eyes shut, while a bigger, stonger pair holds her toes back, making the enormeous soles more sensitive to the tickle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Farther away, and to the right, a blonde bob-cat is lying stretched out on the grass, held there by more vines than seems sticktly neccesary. While her own paws are undergoing a tickle assault, her upperbody is suffering far worse. Enough vines to almost completely obscure her bob and weave in the air around her, trailing tips on her belly, prodding her ribs, scratching her under-arms, and tickling in seemingly any other conceivable way. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Getting over you surprise that the plants themslves will tickle people her, you reach into your backpack and pull out a short machette.

Her writhing about in her little cocoon doesn't disrupt you that much, as it's tight enough to make much thashing an impossibilitie. Your sudden attack on the plants seems to come as a surprise to whatever force controls them, and they are thrown ito disarray as you cut through their tough fibers with ease. Having freed the bunny, who's now lying on the ground trying to catch her breath, you fight at a few remaining vines attempting to entrap you and cross to the bobcat.

After all, you don't know anything about them, or if they'd be willing to help you find your friend. You give them your name, but then tell them \"Actually, I'd like to know a little bit more about the two of you first. What are you guys doing in Bing's Mansion, and how'd you get caught up in those vines?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls look at each other for a moment, then turn back to you. Chloey, the bunny girl, speaks up. \"Well, you did just save us. I suppose that's fair. Me and Claire came to the mansion looking to be hired. See, I'm a pretty good botanist, and Claire here is an expert in anthro anatomy. And, well\u2026 we both have a healthy interest in tickling.\" Chloey grinned and blushed slightly. \"We both figured we could get jobs here doing something. I know they genetically engineer a bunch of tickling plants here, and I wanted to work on that. And with Claire's knowledge of anthro physiology, she'd be great at a ton of stuff: advanced tickle techniques, medicines to make someone more ticklish\u2026 and probably more ideas she could tell you. She'd never say it, but she's kind of a genius.\" Chloey told you happily, seeming to enjoy the chance to tell their story, eagerly chatting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she talked, you took the opportunity to examine them a bit, hopefully somewhat subtly as the two of you sat on the grass. Chloey looked to be on the short side, with dark brown fur and a white furred front, dark brown eyes, and a long brunette ponytail down her back. She wore a long sleeved shirt and a pair of jeans, but wore nothing on her long bunny feet. You suppose there's no way a rabbit like her would be able to wear shoes anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was a blonde bobcat, about as tall as you. She had light colored, spotted fur on her entire body (that you could see, anyway), short blonde hair, and light colored grey eyes, almost silver. She wore a black sleeveless tank top that came down to the bottom of her ribs, as well as jeans, and you noticed she also went barefoot, her cat paws sticking out from the bottom of the jeans. Her clothing left her arms, underarms, as well as her entire midriff exposed, you noticed. It left a lot of exposed fur, almost as if she were just asking to be tickled\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull yourself out of your thorough examination of the two cute girls as you notice Chloey had finished describing themselves. \"Oh. Wow, you two sound pretty impressive.\" You say slowly, hoping they didn't notice how you were checking them out just now. Chloey seemed not to notice, although you thought you saw a curious, knowing look from Claire. \"But that still doesn't explain how you got stuck in those vines. If you're a botanist, shouldn't you know better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well\u2026\" Chloey said in an embarrassed tone. \"I wanted to take a closer look. I'd never seen actual tickling vines up close! And these have already made significant improvements from the ones I've studied: they can determine which spots on a victim's body are most ticklish and exploit them, but not so hard that they make the victim pass out and\u2026 uhh, anyway, I got too excited, and took us too close.\" The bunny girl's ears drooped at the admission. \"They got me, and it would have been ok until they got to my feet, I'm just so ticklish there\u2026\" She said, wiggling her feet at you as she told you about them. \"And luckily Claire's feet aren't ticklish, but just about every other inch of her is, so\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to tell him that, Chloey!\" The bobcat girl admonished her friend. \"Anyway, thanks for getting us out of there. It was a huge help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like you mind!\" Chloey retorted. \"Claire's even more tickle-obsessed than I am. The only way to keep her from pouncing me is to tickle her first. You should watch out around her!\" Chloey grinned, and it seemed like the two were about to get into a playful fight the way they bantered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\u2026 anyway. You're welcome to come along with us to get farther into the mansion. Just in case we run into anything else\u2026 ticklish.\" Claire told you, inviting you along. \"Want to join up for a little while?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you prepare to touch down, the air, undisturbed by sapient language, suddenly resonates with -gasp!- laughter.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Hahahahaaaa! Wait! HA-HA! Waitwaitwaitwaitwait! Comeback come-<i>back</i>! Ahahahah!\"  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The pleas rapidly fade as you descend, ducking into a sculpted grassy hollow in the ground. Irked, you look around wildly for the source of the noise. Just yell out your position over the intercom, why don't they? Still, it's silent now; and slowly you begin to relax. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey-wait no! Nohohoho-ahahah! Help, for sky's sake! Ahahaha!\" the call spikes up once again, and your sharp ears fully register as originating behind you... Which is occupied by a blank stone wall, grown with creepers. Curious, you straighten up and listen in, straining to hear a renewed sound of laughter. You wait a few seconds and-there! Someone calling out for help and laughing like crazy; <i>behind</i> the wall.   <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bemused and a little wary, you swoop up again, wanting to quiet them down if nothing else.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Efficiently, you shoot out over the wall, re-bound off the rampart, and descend on the other side. The laughing is definitely growing louder, you note, passing the bottom of the wall and continuing past the cliff overhang. Said laughing transforms into gasping breaths amidst the squawking of gulls as you ease into a hover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Under the lip of the overhanging cliff, a metallic birdcage, large enough to hold you fairly comfortably and weathered by years under the influence of sea foam, hangs on a chain. Inside, clutching at the bars and slowly giggling herself back to sensibility is an avian; a sparrow, to be exact. Humanoid, she's completely covered in short brown feathers, flecked with white and patched in russet, accept for her bare feet, while a veritable mane of longer, dark auburn plumes sprouting from her head give the illusion of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She swipes one hand over her head -unlike you, there is little difference between her wings and her arms proper- and grips the cage bars with the other as you drift in closer. You notice that she seems to be siting fairly comfortably on a hanging bench-like piece of wood suspended in the cage centre, but that her feet protrude form the bottom of the cage, somehow trapped between the bars, with her two biggest, middling toes clamped to the metal constraints.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks-(hehehe) thank sky you're here! Quick, you gotta spring me before they get back!\" She declares, fluttering nervously in the confines. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How? And before who gets back?\" After carefully testing the chain, you alight on the top of the cage. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The seagulls of course and -look, you're new here, right?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Why do you say that?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 'I've already been here a few months, training, and we don't get many dragons. I'de recognize you if you'd been here before. You must be a recent hire-on.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh, yeeeaaah, sure.  This is my first day.\" You say, deciding to take the chance and run with it. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well as to why i'm here, I, uh, I got in trouble earlier.\" The cage creaks as she shifts below you. \"One of my captives got the drop on my when I let them out for a second, and locked me in a seismic sarcophagus-\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"A what?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"It's a contraption kinda like a really airy, roomy coffin. Only the inside is covered in feathers or brushes or whatever, and it vibrates and shakes. Tickles like crazy. Anyhow, they locked me up tight and got to a portal before I could manage to get the safe word out and sound an alarm.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah. I...See.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And now, I've been sentenced to have my feet coated in oil and been left to hang out here.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"While, if you don't mind my, saying, that doesn't sound so bad.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 She squeaks indignantly. \"While I do mind! This isn't crude crap on my paws; it's Aerial Oil. Sea birds get a bit on their wings and they start flying better than ever; every flying carrion muncher on this coast is a junkie for the stuff. I've had whole flocks of the little devils buzzing around my feet, trying to press their wings in as much as possible to get at the oil. Good thing for me I managed to catch your attention just now, or I'de have been here the rest of the day too. I've been stuck here all day.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"All da- How long, exactly?\" You ask, wondering if you should switch the topic to the dungeons or any recent imports of tickling subjects, including possibly your friend.        <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"A couple of hours. I was supposed to have been pulled up and let out most of an hour ago- up apparently it slipped somebody's mind. But now that you're here, you can go in and talk to my boss and get them to pull me up, right?\"   <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Erm, uh, it depends, where do you work in there?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"In a sublevel above the prison cells proper; it shouldn't be hard to find.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's... Good to know. But what was your name again? I'll probably have tot ell them to jog their memory.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Whoops! Sorry; I don't think I told you. It's Cameilia.\"</span></div></div>",
