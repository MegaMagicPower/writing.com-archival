No one picked on him, but they didn't pay alot of attention to him either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike turned to see his best friend Josh jogging up to him. Josh was 5'2 with shaggy blond hair. They had been friends for a couple years and treated each other like brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up Josh?\" Mike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, did you want to come by my house later today? I just got that new video game, \"Zombies Attack 5\" yesterday and you know we;ve been waiting forever for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't need to think about it Josh. I'll be by right after school\". Josh smiled and quickly headed toward his class before he was late. Even though they were friends, the only times they saw each other during school was in between classes and lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike knew Josh had gotten a head start once school got out. As Mike walked along the sidewalk, he noticed something shining in front  of him. He stopped and picked it up. It was a stone, but it was glowing green. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost alien-like or something\" he muttered to himself. He still thought it was cool, so he put it in his pocket and walked towards Josh's house.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Mike walked along, he became aware that his shoes seemed more uncomfortable. Like they were getting tighter or something... It wasn't painful yet, so he kept going. Maybe his feet were swelling? His teacher sometimes complained about that. It had never happened to him before, but hey, first time for everything. <br>\r\nActually, all his clothes were starting to feel tighter. His shirt seemed a size too small for him. His pants, too. It was getting more difficult to walk as they started clinging tighter and tighter, until a loud \"Riii-iiip\" alerted him that his shirt had gotten torn. And it kept going, as tears appeared all over his shirt, getting bigger as the shirt lost the battle against his growing body. His pants were made of tougher denim, but they couldn't hold out either. His shoes split from top to sole, exposing his growing toes to the air, his socks never stood a chance. Scared and unsure what else to do, Mike tried to unbuckle his pants to relieve the painful pressure, but as he fumbled with them, they began to snap and pop, finally freeing his lower body. As he grew, his clothes were completely shredded and fell off of him. His underwear, with the elastic waistband growing to compensate, but even it couldn't contain his bigger and bigger body, and finally snapped with a 'Twang!', falling off and leaving the poor frightened boy completely naked as he continued to grow. He was now twenty feet tall, and could see that the roof of the house he was standing in front of had some NERF toys stuck on it. Then he shuddered, as his body briefly glowed green, and he shot up to fifty feet tall. Now the top of the house only came up to his naked waist, and he was very frightened. What had happened? What caused this? <br>\r\nThen he remembered the rock. Quickly, he knelt down and searched the rags that had once been his pants, but he couldn't find it. He turned and looked at his right hip, which was were the pocket with the rock had been resting. There was a green mark on his bare skin, and it was already fading. At least he knew what had caused this... <br>\r\nHe fell down on his must larger rear end, and looked around, feeling miserable and trying to cover his nakedness. <br>\r\nWhat could he do now? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh greeted Mike eagerly. He always liked spending time with him, they had a lot of fun together. He hated that they couldn't hang out during school, but that just meant that they had to use the time they had as much as they could. There was just one chair in the spare room that Josh's parents had set up the TV and game system, so Josh generously let Mike have it, and sat in front of him, his friend's legs on either side of him. He turned the game system on, they got started, and were soon absorbed with the task of slaying the virtual undead. So focused was Mike that he didn't notice at first that he was starting to sink deeper into the chair. Josh was in the zone, and only started to notice the ripping noises coming from both sides when an especially loud 'Riiii-iiip!' tore Mike's pants off completely. By this time the other, once-shorter blond had already noticed and was staring in disbelief as he grew right out of his shirt. Of course his underpants were quickly gone, and he was now completely naked as he made frightened noises. The chair creaked, groaned, and finally broke apart under his growing weight, and he was now sitting on the broken remains on the floor. Josh saw his friend's legs were growing on either side of him, and he was quickly filling the small room. Even in the craziness of the situation, Josh realized that he might soon get squashed by his enlarging buddy. Mike also noticed his peril, and tried to keep his bigger self from hurting Josh as he filled the space, but the best he could do was just keep his legs away. As a result, Josh was pressed up against the soft flesh of his friend's package. Soon Mike was breaking through the walls and ceiling, the floor making sounds like it was soon going to collapse. Josh was pressed up against a wall, both he and Mike blushing as they felt what he was being pressed against, although he was grateful that the cock and balls were too soft to crush him, but this was just way too freaky. Finally, the wall behind Mike broke, and he fell tumbling out the back, and staggered to get up, finally crawling to the wreckage to frantically check for his little friend Josh. <br>\r\n\"Down here...\" The weak voice told him, and he looked down to see that Josh was clinging to his cock, having grabbed on to avoid falling down into the rubble that was half of his house. <br>\r\nMike... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mike had tried to show Josh the cool rock he'd found, but when he reached into his pocket he couldn't find it. Josh had just laughed it off and teased Mike about 'imaginary rocks'. Mike figured it must have just fallen out, and they spent the rest of the afternoon destroying zombies. He made sure that Josh was coming over for the Big Weekend sleepover at his house, and double-checked with Josh's mom to be sure. Eventually, he hugged Josh goodbye when his curfew rolled around, and walked home. The instant he got inside the house, he was scooped up in a huge pair of arms.<br>\r\n\"I gotcha!\" Mike recognized the voice and the arms let out a cry of delight. <br>\r\n\"Mickey!\" It was Mike's big brother Mickey, home from college for the week. He'd volunteered to babysit Mike while their father went on his business trip, and Mike was looking forward to spending a whole seven days with his big brother. Mickey was seven years older than Mike, and 7'3, and probably the coolest brother ever. He didn't think Mike was a pest or acted like he was too cool to play with him, he was always wrestling and tickling and gently teasing him. And he was the reason for the Big Weekend. Since tomorrow was Friday, that meant the Big Weekend could begin as soon as he got home from school the next day! Last time Mickey had cooked them hamburgers and ordered pizza, and they'd played games and watched movies until they couldn't stay up any longer, and Mickey had tucked them in together. He couldn't wait! Mike giggled as his brother pretended to growl and tickled him all over. When he was finally out of breath, Mickey carried him upstairs, tickled him a little more, and then kissed him goodnight. <br>\r\n\"Go to sleep, shrimp. Big day tomorrow, remember?\" Mickey ruffled his hair, tucked him in, then turned out the light and left him alone. Mike honestly tried to get to sleep, but he was way too excited. It was the Big Weekend! How could a kid sleep knowing it was so close? He squirmed underneath the blanket. Maybe if he just got more comfortable... The lad knew he would be much more comfy if he slept in the nude, even if he would get in trouble if someone found out he did it. Mike knew it was naughty, but if nobody found out, then who would care? Mickey wouldn't barge in on him, and he could just get dressed in the morning... So he began stripping out of his bed-time clothes, starting with his shirt, then his pants, and finally, his underwear. <br>\r\nAh, that was better...! He wiggled back and forth, enjoying the feeling of the blanket and sheets on his bare skin. Going nude always made him feel so free and happy and comfortable. Mike always liked being naked best, but it was hard to find opportunity. He wound up taking extra-long baths, just enjoying the feeling of having his skin free to the air and water. His dad would scold him when he tried to go naked in the house, and Mickey would just laugh and tell him to put his clothes back on. The downside to being naked was that it left him a unprotected from even the lightest spankings, which his dad and even Mickey gave him to send him scurrying off to get dressed again. Mike pouted in the dark. It wasn't fair. The Big Weekend would be completely perfect if he could be naked along with everything else. For now, he knew he should just get to sleep, and so he sighed and rolled over, easily drifting off now that he didn't have any clothes on. <br>\r\nIt was too bad that he was tucked in so tight, otherwise the blanket might have fallen off and showed the green mark on his thigh, the one that glowed and then faded as he fell asleep. <br>\r\nUnder the covers, Mike began to grow. It was a process that took hours, so the changes were hardly noticeable to anyone watching. As it was, Mike's young body began to expand, gradually filling up all the space on the bed as he slowly grew too big to stay on it. His leg and arm were soon over the side, and the rest of him followed after a while, the bed creaking and finally being crushed under his increasing weight. He muttered and rolled over when that happened, but did not wake yet. He eventually was sleeping in the fetal position, as his body was now the size of the entire room. When he kept growing after that, he began to awaken, as walls began to break and cracks appeared in the floor. Mickey awoke instantly and ran up to his little brother's room to see what was the matter. To his distress, he couldn't open the door. He had no way of knowing that this was because it was currently being blocked by Mike's bigger and bigger body. Finally, with an alarming crash, the floor gave out, and so did many of the inner walls of the house. Mickey had to struggle back to his feet, and raced downstairs, confronted by the sight of his sleepy, confused, towering naked little brother filling up most of the space in the house. <br>\r\nAs Mike began to wake up... </span></div></div>",

Why are you so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMickey tried to open his mouth to say something, anything, but all that came out was a squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mickey?\" Mike tried again, to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 7th grader veered his legs to face his smaller older brother, and as he sat criss cross in the center of the living room, he distracted himself with all the damage he had caused in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Mike said, his voice booming in Mickey's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands, which were cradled towards his chest, jutted out to touch the debris that laid hanging around the hole he made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't -\" Mickey tried, his voice rising, but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be a dream,\" Mike said to himself, feeling the rough ridges of the wood he smashed before turning to face his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I'm not the shortest anymore,\" he teased, to which Mickey shook in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike noticed his older brother trembling at the sight of him and placed his oversized hand gently on the side of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMickey, who was used to towering over his brother and not one to be intimidated with his muscles, tried to answer:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine.

There's no way I could actually grow like this in real life!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMickey paled. His kid brother, the one he had played with for years on end and would never hurt a fly, just destroyed part of the house and thought it was a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Mickey tried, \"you could feel me. And you could also feel the TV and couch. How could this be a dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike shrugged, \"What else could explain this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys stayed silent for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, there's the answer to that. But now the Big Weekend can begin!\" He said, and Mickey shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe when I wake up I could even tell Mickey about this,\" he muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll start by...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If he was quick enough, he could push all his weight on Mike's torso and pin him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMickey's smirk turned into a grin. He could do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMickey circled around the taller boy for momentum.

When Mickey jumped, he watched as his younger brother's eyes seemed to twinkle at his challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut would it work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMickey fell latitudinal on Mike's stomach, to which both boys exhaled softly on impact. Mickey reoriented himself, and with less than two minutes left, scooted to his giant brother's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if I straddle your neck and shoulders for ten seconds without you moving, I win, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta do it quick\" Mike said, \"you have less than 40 seconds left,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith haste, the older brother slid to the younger one's neck, pinning it as he would when Mike was smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started counting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he make it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he reached the double doors to the school, he took in a deep breath, and was ready to face the day by the time he pushed open the doors. The seventeen year old was halfway through his senior year, and nothing was going to get in his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning David!\" the principal greeted as he went to his locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Mr. Gershowitz!\" He responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen quickly flipped through his combination before flinging the locker door open. Today was his easy day, which meant he could go home early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet!\" He said to himself when he realized this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up David?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid turned around and bumped into his friend Jack. Jack was about  6'2, four inches taller than David, but was much skinnier. His maroon skin gleamed in the hallway's fluorescent light, and as David turned around Jack put his calloused hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for gym class, my guy?\" He asked with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I am!\" He replied, \"See you at the bleachers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs David waved goodbye to his friend, he decided to roam around the halls of the second and third floors, since he had a bit of time left before the bell rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jogged up the stairs and began browsing through the second floor. As he walked around, he'd wave and greet anyone who caught his eye. And, of course, being the guy that he was, everyone would greet him back. He even caught a few girls blushing as he walked by them, which gave his confidence even more of a boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he went to the third floor, he was greeting more of the underclassmen, but that didn't seem to stop him. In fact, a lot of his friends like Jake were also underclassmen - their ages didn't matter so much to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he wrapped up his journey on the third floor, he heard a conversation coming from some freshman that piqued his interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear about what's happening on the fourth floor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid paused. <i>We don't have a fourth floor,</i> he thought to himself. He kept listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I have. Apparently there's a pool and everything.\"<br>\r\n\"What's a fourth flo-\"<br>\r\n\"Shhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huddle of underclassmen started whispering. If there was a fourth floor, these guys sure did believe it existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid went closer to their huddle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you reach the fourth floor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe freshmen jumped as David gave them a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, well...\" This one girl, Amy, stammered, \"Apparently you need one of the elevator keys to get to it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy turned pink as David patted her on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy in the circle pitched in, \"We think it's a new STEM lab, but don't tell anyone! I don't think it'll be ready 'til next year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, Brad. Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warning bell rang overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, that's my cue!

Besides, you could do it just as well as I, and I'm pretty sure there isn't one to begin with,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tips of David's ears turned pink, \"Aww, c'mon dude! You know I gotta ask Mr. Rogers if I can skip. Besides, you didn't think I was going there all by myself, didja?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake smirked, \"Good point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And stop calling them freshies, a couple months ago you still <i>were</i> one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake shrugged, \"Agree to disagree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, the P.E teacher sounded her whistle. The two boys stood and raced down to the gymnasium floor, where it turned out they'd be playing Jake's personal favorite - dodgeball. As the gymnasium filled with the sounds of bouncy balls hitting walls, floors, and even other people, David still couldn't help but get the fourth floor off his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Jake and Cody were the only ones left for their respective teams, David being the last one out before the showdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't avoid me forever, my guy,\" Cody teased as he gripped the red balls in his hands tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For someone who only has one thing on his mind 24/7, dodgeball sure comes easy to you,\" Jake kidded, his hands empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody got his pitching hand ready, and hurled the first ball towards Jake's torso. Jake dodged to the left, and managed to grab the ball in midair as it bounced off the wall. Cody took his moment of haste as an opportunity and threw his other ball, sailing closer to Jake's head, as he barely managed to suck as the ball hissed above him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody cursed silently to himself. There were so many balls on Jake' side, and he had thrown his last one. Jake took his moment of vulnerability to throw two jet-fast balls, one to Cody's left and one to Cody's right. As Cody squeezed his way between the two, Jake snatched up another ball that set it's course towards Cody's torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThe ball hit Cody's abdomen as the bell rang for the end of first period. Jake's team cheered as he basked in the glory of their last target being hit. As both teams cleaned up the balls, Jake made his way to David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were great out there, man!\" David said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say? I fend pretty well for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'll see you in study hall?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fourth floor, dude. I'm coming with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs David waved a temporary goodbye to Jake after the both of them changed, he made his way to his next class - Literature. Except this time, like many, he wasn't going to stay in that class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr.Rogers?\" David asked, putting his backpack on his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need, David! I already told you, since you took the test early you could go to the study hall until we take it in two classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid smiled, as he slugged his backpack on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mr.Rogers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bell for second period rang, David raced from the third floor to the first, where he found his friend Jake waiting with the key around his lanyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took you so long?\" He joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I'm on the third floor!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touch\u00e9.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys, with the slips from the Study Hall, made their way to the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd, I hadn't seen that button before,\" Jake said as he pressed the \"4\" button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be new,\" David smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sophomore sighed, \"Y'know, I hate when you're right sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Score one for the freshmen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\"</span></div></div>",

He had already told the nurses his plan (they were his alibi, after all) and a he walked down the halls, he saw Mr. Burns struggling with the projector cart. A lightbulb flashed in his head as he entered the classroom and discarded the tissue in the trash can next to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Ms. Nalu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you per chance have a key to the elevator?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Nalu stammered, \"Why, y-yes I do David. What do you need it for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Burns said that he needed one to carry the projector up, and I was too meek to tell him to ask the front office,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Nalu rolled her eyes, \"Again? That man always finds a way to lose his keys! Very well then, just give it to me by the end of the period,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ms.Nalu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid got the keys and power walked out of the study hall. He made sure to ask Mr. Burns to help him, and once they managed to get it in the elevator, brought him to the third floor. Mr. Burns, as David had predicted, did be have his elevator keys on him, so he was very grateful for David's help. As he waved to him goodbye, he noticed that one of the elevator buttons had a green border and the number \"4\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Checkmate,\" he said to himself, clicking the button as he went higher in the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ding!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator opened, and David gasped at what he saw. The freshman could've never anticipated something like this! There were three counters set up in a U with liquid vials, protractors, and electron microscopes in the very dim room on floor 4. David ha wondered what looked different about the building from the outside of the school, but he realized that this must've been the bump on the left side of the building - the only room to be built so far over the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice!\" He said, as he took out his phone and snapped a picture. \"Now Jake will have to believe me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he turned around to get back into the elevator...</span></div></div>",

He had been bored ever since he stepped foot in this building. He looked around his desk, wanting to look at something other than a screen. His eyes fell on a picture of him and his two sons, Henry and Matt. Henry, who was ten, had bright red hair and Matt, who was 15, had shaggy black hair. Bill was smiling and Henry and Matt were making goofy faces. Bill was proud of his sons. Unlike his co-workers kids, Matt and Henry got along really well and hardly ever argued. He was so proud of his boys and hoped they wouldn't end up in a dumb ass job that he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe always wished that something would come along that would change his life. Hell, winning the lottery would send him bouncing off of the walls. Sure, he was making a good amount of money, but he didn't really have a fun time doing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill\". Bill snappe dout of his daydream and looked up to see his co-worker Daniel standing in the doorway. Daniel was one of Bills closest friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Daniel, what's up?\" Bill asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wanted to let you know, this came for you a couple of minutes ago\". Daniel handed Bill a green envelope <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Dan\". Daniel nodded and headed out. Bill was confused about what this letter was. He didn't order anything and most of his mail was sent to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid back in his chair, putting his hands on his gut, deciding what to do. he finally opened it and was greeted with three small packs of green powder. There was also a note inside. Bill pulled it out and read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heard you wanted a BIG change in your life. Take one of these and watch you r dreams come true. As for the other two packs, you can decide what to do with them. Maybe let your sons have a BIG change too? Just mix the powder in a drink and have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it. No name or return address, Bill knew it had to be someone who knew him or they wouldn't have known about his sons or that he was bored out of his mind at his job.

Either one was a favorite of Bill. Maybe this was the \"big\" change the note was talking about, a new kind of flavor is being test.<br>\r\n\"Well, got nothing else to do now.\" said Bill as he open up one of the bags of powder and put it in already open bottle of water.

This stuff is just food coloring.\" thought Bill, \"Someone actually think I would believe that this stuff was some kind of magic powder that would grant my wish and get a cheap laugh from me.

They were all doing their work, with dull expressions on their faces. \"Well,\" thought Bill as he look at the remainder of his green water, \"It's still drinkable, the jerk could have easily put in dirt in it. Might as well enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Bill continue to drink until his bottle was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burp,\" went Bill after refreshing himself.

He could feel from the top of his head to both his pinky toes. He felt himself getting hotter to the point he started to sweet about. He also had odd feeling of being bit heavier. Whoever said that bottle water was good for you, and low in carbs, was seeing bull.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I hope this passes soon,\" said Bill, feeling a tingly heat in his ears.</span></div></div>",

Bills socks,'shorts and shirt ripped off. He had to stretch his legs out, showing off his slightly hairy legs and bare feet. After more growth, he finally stopped, his boxers miraculously holding on to his giant groin. He looked for his sons, who weren't on the floor where he left them. He looked around, knowing his head was on the ceiling and his legs stretched out to the walls.

The foot pushed me and pushed me until I was up against the wall, my face buried in my dad's foot. I looked to my left to see Henry in the same situation. Then I looked down. I was a little embarrassed to see my dick fully erect, boning my dad's sole. Yes I admit I have a macro foot fetish, and I sometimes fantasized about my dad. Plus I'm pretty sure dad is a microphile who enjoys tiny people, so no doubt he got some growing serum or something along those lines.

I got this new growth powder from work...\" Dad told his story about why he could barely fit in our living room. All the couches were pushed away from his powerful legs, and his feet barely reached the wall as I clearly demonstrated. After some more explaining, he stopped and said, \"Hold on. Why are you both erect at the sight of me...?\" My boner didn't die down, and Henry was just going through puberty, so this was probably his first erection, and I'm guessing he has the giant fetish too. He was confused. \"Dad, I... I don't know what's going on... Why is it all stiff and hard?\" Dad didn't lecture him about sex and whatnot so he only asked \"How do you feel about me being a giant with my feet pressed on you?\" he only responded by saying it's exciting and pleasurable, and that was all Dad needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad reached over and picked us both up in his giant hands. It was a little akward, but dad brought us up to his face and said, \"I don't want you guys to get hurt, but while I'm your big giant dad, why don't we have a little fun?\" I was getting hard reeeeaaaaaly fast, so Henry and I both said yes. \"Good, then why don't we play a game.\" he put us down on the floor, and bent his legs so that he was hugging his knees. He stretched his legs slightly until his bare feet were tilted over us, his heels on the carpet so the toes pointed diagonally upwards. \"Here's a game for you two. Whoever loves my smelly feet the most will get to be anywhere on my body for a few hours. The loser gets to be put somewhere of my choice.\" I was staring at the gargantuan feet, the smell filling my nostrils. It was definitely alright with me. I looked over at Henry, who was touching Dad's feet with his hands, amazed by the excitement it all brings. He inhaled the foot odor, and the look in his eyes said it all: he is totally in love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad said \"show love anyway you can. 3 2 1...go!\" I wrapped my arms around the big foot. I hugged and squeezed the foot like it was the very thing that kept me alive. I felt the rush and hugged the foot more, diggig my face into the soles, inhaling and enjoying every breath. Dad said \"Henry's in the lead. Love more, Matt!\" I looked over at Henry, who was already climbing on the foot licking and sucking the way there, and wrapping his body around Dad's big toe, literally making out with it. I didn't want to be put underneath dad's ass or in his boxers, so I tried the best I could to lick every inch of his foot. Meanwhile, dad was smiling, having as much fun as we were watching the tow of us compete in a giant foot licking competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes had passed... </span></div></div>",

It's gonna be a big surprise.\" He carefully covered for the fact that even he had no idea what the 'BIG change' was. He wasn't worried that it was poison, at most he feared it was just a prank.

There were startled cries of fear, but they became all the louder as the growing continued, and the three of them began to break out of the house. They all expected to be crushed against the roof or at least hurt by the falling debris, but they emerged entirely unscathed. They were now twice the size of their ruined house, and staring at the suburbia they called home for a few stunned moments before both boys fearfully clung to their father. Henry's freckled body, with just a bit of baby-fat still clinging to him, was exposed alongside Matt's more athletic form. Bill was no Adonis, but he was still in good shape for a man his age, and he reflexively hugged both boys to him as he looked around. Oddly, he didn't feel at all afraid. Instead, he chuckled. Matt and Henry looked up at their father, confused. <br>\r\n\"Don't worry, boys...\" He rubbed their shoulders, and their fear faded in the face of his confidence. \"It's fine.

He picked it up and saw it was his boyfriend, Chad, texting him to remind him to stop by the Chem lab and pick up his project for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling out the door, Steven looked to the sky. Same as always, slightly cloudy and sunny. He waled over to the Chemab and swiped himself in. From there he began searching for Chad's project. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man I'm a Political Science major, I should not be allowed in here. Where is his lab again?\" Steven opened a door and flicked on the light. \"Man they run so many wires in here it's amazing no one trips and dies.\" He carefully weaved his way around the wires and desks until he came to a shelf with vials on it marked 'Chad'. He reached to grab them but they were just a hair too far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Chad's 6''2' self would shove them so high. C'mon!\" He jumped a little, shaking the shelf and spilling the contents of Vhad's project all over himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn damn damn damn!\" Steven sweated as he stood up, trying to use his shirt to clean his face. As he struggled to brace himself he grabbed an exposed sure, sending and electric shock through his body. He fell over, unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up he found himself in a nearby hospital, with Chad looming worriedly over him. It sent a surge of warmth through Steven's heart to see the muscular, short blonde haired guy, and knowing that he cared about him more than the smashed project. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steve! Are you ok?\" Chad asked in a rush. \"Yeah I'm fine.

Eventually, Steven spoke up. \"So, what exactly was that stuff?\" Chad fidgeted his hands on the steering wheel, before taking a deep breath. He looked over to Steven, who was staring out at the road, more curious than worried. Chad slumped in his seat as he turned his head back to the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you know about hormones?\" Steven shook his head. \"Right, right. PolySci, not Biomed.\" He sighed again before continuing. \"We were specifically looking at hormones that dictate growth, muscle development, bone growth, even body fat accumulation. Mostly how to fix them when they aren't working. What spilled all over you was a formula to essentially kickstart the given hormones into working.\" Steven remained silent for a while, as Chad turned the wheel in order to drive into their apartment's lot. Chad grabbed both of their things, letting Steven grab the keys to their apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Steven thought about what Chad had said. He wanted to know more about what it was. \"Did it work?\" Steven wasn't sure whether he was more curious or afraid of the answer. He sat down on the living room futon waiting for Chad's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad set their things down, sitting next to Steven on the futon. \"We haven't tested on anything other than mice, but it did what it was supposed to do. Sometimes it even exceeded what we had hoped for.\" Chad was beginning to get excited over his research - he was rather proud of it, after all - before realizing that hearing what a technical wonder the formula was, probably wasn't what Steven wanted to hear. \"Don't worry, though!\" Chad continued, sheepishly trying to comfort his boyfriend. \"Even though I'm not sure which formula you got on you, you'll definitely be fine. The electricity probably rendered it inert anyways. It-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" Steven interrupted, eyebrows raised quizzically. \"You seriously don't even know what you were having me grab for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven, I'm sorry.\" Chad was becoming increasingly upset for letting something happen to one of the people he cared the most for. \"I shouldn't have had you get my things, and I hate myself for letting you get hurt. We switch around what each member of the team is working on, so I really don't know what got on you. But I do know you'll be okay.\" He looked back at Steven. \"And if something does happen, I swear, I will do everything to fix it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not worried. Actually, you're worrying more than I am.\" Steven smiled. \"Even if anything happens, I know you're more than capable of making it better.\" He leaned over, sitting up in order to give his boyfriend a peck on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven waved to Chad as he got off of the futon. \"Anyways, I'm gonna get some sleep before I turn into a giant rat monster.\" Chad jumped, causing Steven's smile to turn into outright laughter. \"Jeez, I'm joking. Love you, you dumb scientist.\" With that, Steven went down the hall to their shared bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad stayed out on the futon, even though his boyfriend didn't care, he was pretty distressed. Honestly, there was no telling what would happen. Did the electricity dampen it, or would it amplify the effects? Would there be any effect at all? Chad curled up on the futon, dozing off, concerned. </span></div></div>",

He would always getting involved with so many things and with his skills he had taught by the leaders of the group.  Jason was so excited this much, he was heading over to the camping trip for the first time, even so that he\u2019ll be going along without his family by his side.  He\u2019ll be sure enjoy this and take this as a great opportunity to experience and find out more about this trip as it happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkipping over to the trip, and it was the first day in.  The boys have set up the tent to sleep in, and other uses like a camping fire to feed.  Of course they had to find some fish or other in order to get fed, and Jason had kindly volunteered to catch it as much as he can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry!  I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019ll some fish as quickly as I can.\u201d  Jason told the rest of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he left the camping area and headed over to the lake.  Luckily, it only took about five minutes to find it, and soon he stood close to it and sets the fishing rod and see how many he can catch before it will be time to head back.  He\u2019s actually a good fisher, hence that his father is a fisherman himself.  He had managed to catch a couple of fish, and once he caught the fifth, it was enough and Jason carried over to himself back to camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not before he couldn\u2019t see where he was going, due to the fishes in his way, and that\u2019s when he tripped over a log sticking out and he falls over to the ground.  That caused himself a sigh for a bit, but he wouldn\u2019t want to complain and tries to gather the fishes, when there\u2019s something shiny from underneath one fish.  He was both confused and curious when he picks a shiny item up and takes a closer to see what it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... this looks amazing!  I don\u2019t how or what it came from, but it still in good condition by the looks of things.\u201d  Jason looked amazed when upon seeing an item itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was something he had never seen anything quite like it before, and thought it must be valuable as far as he was concerned.  Again, he would take another closer look when suddenly, it flash brightly and it got right into Jason\u2019s eyes.  He jumped heavily and sort out his eyes to get back to his full vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d  He was deeply confused, but soon followed by his own body had started to feel warm and strange straight after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what he is getting worried, he would have to try and leave it as quickly as he can.  But as far as this thing flash to him, it can be too late and something\u2019s happening to Jason quite quickly.  When did he start growing taller?</span></div></div>",

The boy's name was Chris and he was orphaned at 6 years old. His parents were coming home from a movie when they were hit by a drunk driver. Since Chris didn't have any nearby relatives, he was put in an orphanage. When he was 11, he was adopted by a couple, Bobby and Kristin. But, as Chris learned in his first week, they weren't very loving people. They didn't want a child. They wanted a slave that they didn't have to pay for. So Chris was stuck doing everything around the house and even if he screwed up the slightest, he was punished. It was mostly a harsh beating with whatever the two adults could get their hand on. But if they were in a good mood, they would just lock Chris in his room for a couple of hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam knew he had to protect this kid. There was no way he would let Chris in that house any longer. But if he took Chris out, where would he go? Would Sam have to care for him until Chris could fend for himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave right now\" Sam said, as Jim nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin an hour, Sam was on Earth. He made himself 50 feet tall, but could always grow more if need be. None of the humans below his feet paid attention to him. Sam smiled. Invisibility was one of the coolest powers he had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked around 19 years old and had short black hair. He had on a white t-shirt and a pair of jeans. Carefully, he started walking around the streets, looking for the house Chris lived in. </span></div></div>",

Sam began following the sound, quickly walking down the streets while being careful not to step on anyone. He arrived at a park where he found the source of the crying. Curled up behind a bench was Chris, his hands covering his face as he cried. As Sam saw this child crying, he felt anger towards the couple who have hurt this child, but that was dwarfed by the need to protect the child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't Cry little one.\" Sam said, his deep voice startling Chris who looked up. As he looked up Sam felt a twitch goes through his heart as he saw a large bruise on Chris's left eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?\" Chis looked around with fear, scared of the origins of the deep, yet somewhat caring voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam sighed as he remembered that Chris couldn't see him, with that he undid the invisibility he had so that Chris could see him. Chris strained his neck as he looked up at the giant who couldn't have been older than 19, maybe 20 if Chris were to guess. As he stared with wonder at the giant, He watched as the giant raised his hand and brought it closer to Chris's face. Instinctively Chris moved back, fear filling him up as he saw the giant hand near his face, though he stopped when he heard the giant say;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I won't hurt you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Chris closed his eyes as the massive teen pressed his finger with such gentleness that it was almost like a soft breeze brushed his face. When he opened his eye's he was amazed to see and feel that the bruises he had were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd feel better without those marks on you.\" Sam said as smiled at the small child, though Chris was still wondering whether he really did trust this giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh--Who are you?\" Chris asked, fear in his voice despite the apparent gentleness of the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Sam and I'm your guardian angel, sent to keep you safe.\" Sam said lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris could just stare at this giant and began thinking of what Sam said. It was then that...</span></div></div>",

My best idea would be to care for you myself. I could rewrite history and make it so that I adopted you.

Looking up at the clock, then at the television, his Dad answered, \"Well, movie is over, it's late, and time for bed. Night Matt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night, Dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt headed up the stairs, depressed. He had  just watched an old movie called Big, where a kid his age made a wish and grew into an adult over night. Matt like the movie, though he didn't know why the kid wanted to go back to being young again. I mean, he got to live like he wanted, and got to play with toys for a living, and he got to play with BOOBS!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt had just started getting interested in the opposite sex, and was paying particular attention to the girls in his grade who were developing, especial in the chest. But being the shortest guy in his class wasn't conducive to getting to know the early developers better. Worse yet, Matt's Dad was IT savvy, so Matt never got to use the internet to learn more about the fascinating world of BOOBS!!! In fact, if Matt had been awake during the scene where Tom Hanks fondled Elizabeth Perkins' bra clad breasts, he would have probably turned the television off followed by an uncomfortable talk with Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was big,\" Matt muttered to himself before climbing into bed and falling fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Matt woke up, feeling strange. Maybe...maybe his wish had come true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly ran to the bathroom and looked into the mirror to discover that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing had changed. Nothing at all. He wasn't older. He wasn't bigger. The old pajamas he had gone to bed with still fit just fine. He was still Matt, the shortest guy in his class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Matt trudged back to his room. And almost fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of his room was floating flat screen television, with a man's face taking up the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling, Matt?\" the man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, fine,\" Matt said. Matt looked around at the rest of his room, then back at the screen. \"I'm dreaming, aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're quite wide awake,\" the man on the screen said. \"But the world you went to sleep in didn't have technology like this, did it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt thought he should be freaking out, be he wasn't. He wasn't convinced he wasn't dreaming, but dream or not, nothing seemed to be threatening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said in my world,\" Matt began. \"You mean this is a different world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face on the floating television screen nodded. \"Our world is similar to yours, except the inhabitants of our world are approximately an eleventh of the size of the inhabitants of your world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, wait a minute, you mean like Lilliput?\" Matt asked, suddenly remembering his wish to be Big; He must be dreaming. \"So that would make me a giant in your world. But...well, you look like my size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just an illusion,\" the man on the screen said. \"Because your mind doesn't expect people significantly smaller than yourself, you assume that I'm your size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt nodded. \"So, um, how did I get in your world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We brought you here,\" the man answered simply. \"It is your fourteenth birthday, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt nodded. It was his birthday today. \"So, did you bring me to your world for a reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our world has always had a gentle giant to watch over it. Even in modern times, when our world is united and our technology is advanced and we really don't need a giant, we still bring one over. And it is always a gentle being who wants to be big. So on the event of his fourteenth birthday, we bring him to our world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" was all Matt had to say. He looked around and said, \"So, you brought my bedroom as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man shook his head. \"We constructed a duplicate of your room, so that you would feel more comfortable. We know it will take time to adjust to your new setting. And we have a guide. Are you ready to meet her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Matt was sure this was a dream. But it sure felt real. He nodded, and the screen disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, this is a dream,\" Matt said. \"I should be waking up at any minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you, over here,\" a tiny voice shouted. Matt turned around and his jaw dropped. Standing on his desk was a six inch...</span></div></div>",

Chris gave Zach hard time calling him shrimp and knocking his books out of hands. When Zach tried pick them up, Chris would step on his hand. Zachary began to get red with humiliation and then bully laughed and walked off. Zach quickly grabbed his jacket and backpack and ran to the exit. He was tired of bullies like Chris always picking on others and getting away with it. As he was walking home from school he stopped at his favorite store. It featured special items such as rare antiques and unusual things as well. The clerk who Zach liked was there, Hey Zachary what can do for you today young man? You look kinda down, what's wrong buddy? Chris is wrong that's what!? Zachary replied in frustration. He always picking on me just cause I'm short. I'm tired of bullies like him. I'm sorry said the clerk, come with young man I have something that might just help you out. Zachary followed his friend to the back of the store and the man handed him a small pouch. What is this, Zachary asked? This is a special powder that will make your \"biggest\" dreams come true. Cool! Zachary then put the pouch in his pocket, and asked how it works. Just go home and mix it with water and drink it and that's it. Thank you very much Zach said with a big smile and went straight home. About an hour later he arrived and was lucky that no one was home. He grabbed a glass and filled it with water and he pulled out the pouch and poured about half the powder and mixed it together. He smelled hmmm, smells like cherry, he then took a sip, wow that's good. He then took a bigger drink. Wow I feel different.

He looked down at his feet, they began to get longer and wider. After about a minute he passed out. A couple hours later he awoke and when he sat up his head smacked into the ceiling. Wow! That hurt he said, After his eyes adjusted and he was fully awake he looked around his room and everything seemed smaller. His feet and legs were hanging over his bed and his arms were lying on the floor. When he stood up, he had to lower his head so he wouldn't hit his head again. He looked at himself in the mirror and was amazed by what he saw. YES! It worked his voice boomed. He grabbed the measuring tape that was on his dresser and he measured himself. 15' 3\", He had grown 10 feet. Zach smiled, no one will ever pick on me or my friends ever again.

Zachary had snuck up from behind the bully and he looked down at Chris with his arms folded. The other boy glanced up and when Zach smiled at him and gestured he be quiet and pointed down at Chris.

Well well I get to beat on two of you, said Chris. So Zachary, I guess you didn't learn anything from yesterday and then Chris turned around to give Zach a shove and when he put his hand out, he touched Zach's right sneaker and when he couldn't budge it he turned around. GULP! Chris was shocked at the sight that laid before his eyes, his worst nightmare come true, Zach was a giant. Zachary was just standing there with his arms folded and smiling.

I won't hurt you even though you deserve it, but I will make sure you will not bully anyone ever again. He then turned him around still dangling and he told Chris to apologize for picking on the other boy. Chris not wanting to anger Zach sincerely apologized to the boy (Andy 10) for bullying him. Andy smiled and he looked at Zach, thank you for helping me. No problem he said I've been wanting to stop this bully for a long time. Now as he lifted Chris higher into the air, you will apologize to me and promise to never bully anyone ever again or I will let go! O-kay he cried, I am so sorry Zach and I swear I will never bully anyone ever again. Zach then lowered the bully and released him like he said he would. Chris quickly stood up and he looked back at Zach still shocked by how big Zach had become. Remember what you promised Chris, I\"LL BE WATCHING! Then Chris ran off crying. Zach had felt good for he had stopped a bully. Andy approached him and gave him a fist bump when Zach held his giant fist out. Then the boy left and that's when Zach made his mission to stop all bullies. He stood up to his full 55ft frame and began walking towards where?</span></div></div>",

He walked down by the water like he always loved to do. Only now when he walked his feet made enormous prints, but the water felt nice even though now the water only came up to his ankles which when he was smaller came up to his neck. He sat down and tried to relax when he looked around. Some people were swimming while others were playing and yes some people noticed him as well. He waved at them and smiled, some waved back as they figured he was friendly even for a giant. He then looked to his left and spotted what look like three older teens around 18 or 19 all standing around a young woman who looked to be about 18 as well. The 3 men were each taking turns kicking sand at her and laughing. So Zach scooped up a great big handful of sand and he stood up behind the 3 teenagers and dumped the sand on top of them covering them until they were buried in it up to their necks. Hey! They all yelled and when they looked up to see a giant 13 year old standing above them they all freaked out. Zach then looked at the young lady and asked are you okay? Um, yes she said and gave him a smile, thank you for helping me she said. What is your name young giant she asked. My name is Zach and your welcome he replied. Then he turned his attention to three bullies, he laid on his belly and he then looked at them, and grabbed another hand full of sand, now you will apologize for what you did or I will be forced to completely bury you all in the sand and then I will proceed until you can no longer breath its your choice. Well he said what's going to be?</span></div></div>",

He slowly began to open his hand and began tipping it when. The three teens seeing he meant business looked at the young woman again. We sincerely apologize to you it will never happen again we promise. Zach was pleased this time. NICELY DONE! He responded. He moved his arm away from the man and dropped the sand on the beach. He then took his hand and scooped all three teens out of the sand. They all screamed as raised them up into the air. NOW! He said firmly you guys will never bother this young woman, RIGHT! he said loudly. Oh yeah we promise big guy never again they said nervously. Good now get out of here! Zach dropped all three teens and they ran off immediately. The woman whos name is Sally again thanked Zach and not only that Zachary got cheers from other people who were watching as well.

Zachary asked. He stood like a god next to the fair midway. You see Zachary had grown so much that he knew could cause damage seeing the narrow paths between rides and food vendors. Zachary dropped to the ground causing a minor quake. The two boys climbed off Zach's shoulders, sliding down his long arm. Wee! cried the boys as they made it to the ground and backed up. Hang in there big buddy we will bring you some food. THANK YOU MY LITTLE FRIENDS. Zachary looked around as people gathered. Hey it's megaboy, some of the kids yelled as they recognized him from the news. HELLO EVERYONE! Zachary then let out a big yawn. I think I am going to rest here for awhile ,please don't get so close he asked I don't want to hurt anyone. Zachary stretched his 125 foot frame out as it took up the whole midway. Some people ran away while other like the kids had decided to have some fun. Zachary fell asleep and became an unexpected attraction. Zach woke as he heard screaming.

Oh cool mega boy is awake, his eyes are so big cried the same boy there like a pair of cool mirrors. Yeah I can see my reflection.  HEY GET DOWN! Zachary yelled. The boys then took off running. Then Zach had three more kids in his right ear. That is who was screaming as they were yelling and walking around his cave sized ear. Zachary gently took his finger and well picked them out and put him back on the ground. The kids ran after Zachary stared down at them. He raised his head up. He saw more kids who were stuck in his belly button and down by his feet three others exploring his shoes as they were lying on their sides. Zachary at first was annoyed that they disturbed him as he slept but now felt honored as he found it exciting to see that these kids were having fun and exploring their giant hero. CAN I HELP YOU OUT THERE KIDS? Zachary spoke as he looked at the kids in his belly button. Yes they squealed back, please save us mega-boy. Zachary lent them a hand as he placed his giant pointer finger in the pit that was his belly button. He slowly lifted all the kids and sit them on his chest. They all cheered and said Thank you! Some of the girls kissed his cheek as he raised his head. Zachary felt confident and enjoyed the fact he was like a big role model. Zachary just sat up and watched the last 3 kids who were still on his shoe.  All of them was climbing his laces like a rope ladder. Zachary decided to have a little fun as he would slowly raise his foot upwards causing the kids to slip and slide down his shoe. OOPS! Zachary said as he giggled. He let the kids continue to have fun as he looked around at the fairgrounds looking for his two friends. That was when he spotted?</span></div></div>",

Zachary not wanting to hurt the kids who were still playing on his sneaker. Just watched patiently as GRRRR his stomach growled! People hearing this as they walked by jumped. Finally as the burger got close enough Zachary reached for the big burger, MMM! Zach exclaimed. THIS IS YUMMY! HOW DID YOU GUYS DO THIS? The boys explained that there was a food stand that specialized in giant foods for large groups. So we asked the cooks if they could make one for a giant hero and when we told them it was for you they did it without hesitation. That is not all we got you this as a tub full of soda was right behind it. THANKS YOU BOYS, YOU ARE THE BEST.  HOW WOULD YOU BOYS LIKE TO BE MY TEAMMATES? The boys smiled and got excited, yes we would love it. Zachary reached into his pocket where he hid the the magic powder that made him a giant and he handed it to Cody the taller blond boy.

As far as where to go, he figured out the plan and smiled in a curious thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... I\u2019m sure the city has got a lot more things to help than where I am I suppose?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he shrugged and headed away from the park, and carefully walking through the streets again, with each step causing the ground to shake, and comes with loud booms as well.  The only thing different than he last walk was that he had grown so much again.  He was 30 feet when he entered the park, now he left and headed towards the city, standing at 55 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pace however wasn\u2019t that long indeed, and it only took a couple of minutes later where Zach had arrived at the city, and the views from there is absolutely stunning, when he can look down to the streets in all.  There so many people and vehicles going about, and the crowd were all in awe when seeing a giant 12 year old boy at the scene.  Though he wouldn\u2019t mean any harm, he just come here to have a look in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, this looks so beautiful where I\u2019m standing.  No wonder why any person would want to be so big like me in the first place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach says with a bright smile to his face and he felt it was his miniature city attraction that looked familiar.  He was beginning to enjoy this feeling, when he can hear the alarm had gone off from one of its stores.  That and followed by its screams meant something\u2019s gone wrong, and Zach W wants to find out himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...?  What\u2019s going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge youngster was starting to feel curious and goes over to see where the alarm came from.

But knowing he had to get used to his size very well, he had to try and avoid getting hit by the ceiling and the door frame.  So he went down and crawls out of the room and through the hallway as quickly as he can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite he had great difficulty of getting himself through, he eventually got out of the house without a single damaged caused and looked around to see Chris is still humiliating the smaller kid at the pathway.

Chris Meanwhile was about to beat up a kid, when a huge shadow had casted above him.  He could\u2019ve wondered if it was raining or dark?  But as soon as he turned around, he see\u2019s a familiar face confronted him, but looked very large, in fact Chris\u2019s came up to a person\u2019s thighs by 10 feet.  He looked up and his face lit up in shock and couldn\u2019t what he just saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, let go of the kid, now!\u201d  Zach says in a stern look to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to his disbelief, Chris nodded so worryingly and letting the go and ran off from the distance.

B...But how is it possible?\u201d  Chris looks shaken from seeing a kid like Zach looking huge than he was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... I guess it\u2019s all this time that you\u2019re picking with a wrong kid like me.  Now that I\u2019m bigger than you, I think it\u2019s time to teach you a lesson, shall we?\u201d  That smirked look on Zach\u2019s face says it all, as he would try and come closer and giving Chris the humiliation like he\u2019s never done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris had to try and pleaded out from this, but Zach wasn\u2019t convinced and was able to lift a bully up from underneath the shoulders and giving him the taste of his own.

The shuttle, which was more like a dissolving capsule, he landed in was hidden by cloaking and landed without a sound or notice under any optical surveillance. The island he stayed in was small and was abandoned due to its constant flooding since the nightly high tide practically drowned the island. It was the perfect place to hide him, until he grew. His growth rate makes his size triple every year. This eventually led to his discovery two years ago when he was around 166 ft. tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's now at a staggering height of nearly 1500 ft. His body can no longer be held in the confines of the island, but the government refuses to move him to a different location. Battle ships, helicopters, and planes ready to bomb him are constantly shifting to his area then being replaced by the next watch team. During the night he has search lights blinding his view on all sides as. As a final measure if necessary, an H-Bomb was placed into his heart and another along his spine connecting to his brain, as a final resort if he needed to be subdued and the President agreed to do so. If his height reached beyond 10,000 ft. it was agreed that the bombs would be detonated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut none of them cared that he was not the type to hurt another living being. His heart beat the same as everyone on this planet, even if it could fit a person within it. He knew exactly what it meant to die. A few animals that survived the constant flooding shared their food with him, although he did not need to eat. They stayed in a cave along a small mountain on the island. During his stay one night he had already grown to the point he could barely fit in the opening to the cave. He was going through another growth spurt when a bird laying on his back which grazed against the ceiling was crushed between the two surfaces. This bird taught him to sing with the morning sunrise and to whistle in a language all with feathered wings knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was very handsome for a humanoid alien. He had shoulder length spiky blue hair that was tougher than most metals, but softer than downed pillows. His eyes were violet with small white splotches and dots. He was well built and somehow his body was able to maintain and increase in muscle mass even though he did not need to eat. One main part of him that did make him apart from the average human is the fact that he had long pointed ears that reached back behind his head. The only article of clothing he wore was a silver lined, skin-tight, blue pair of shorts that reached half-way to his knees with a black mark running down each side. Scientists were not sure how it could increase with his size, they did know that the material was indestructible after many tests. The only reason they called him Kiel was because his name was marked in silver letters along the lining on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScientists were brought to him as soon as he was discovered and maintained, although he did not put in much of a struggle. His blood type was called the 'Secondary 0' as it could be used in any transfusion including Bombay blood. His brain waves were on par with some of the most intelligent minds in history. And although his size increased beyond any natural level, which still cannot be explained, his weight does not impact his surroundings. At his current weight he could topple a building yet his weight is halted when he is just about to destroy an object or organism. Trees bend but never break under him and his footsteps are soundless. Scientists and high ranking officers know this, but the lower grunts and civilians do not; as Kiel's size increases so does his hearing. For now he is able to hear everything within a 37 mile radius. He can hear every little conversation and can listen in on selected ones while fading out others. He was also able to see better a great distance away and focus in on the smallest of details. With his eyes closed he's even able to see the outlines of what people are shaped like by listening to the vibrations around them, 'three people live in that house, a couple and their new baby. I'm glad they're happy.' He used to silently cry under his arms when hearing some of the hurtful or inappropriate things, but he ignores them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now Kiel is carefully biding his time and hoping for someone to take pity on him or just listen to him. To try and know him for something more than what doesn't belong. Maybe as someone who others can possibly depend on. He doesn't want to destroy or kill, he wants to belong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently his hopes have been answered. The government has posted him as 'Until further notice, Harmless'. He heard this over a radio station he listened to the waves of. The ships that survey him are going to start round trip tours of him as they circle the island and switch. As if the cameras and satellites were not enough. But, the reason he was beginning to brighten his mood was that they were allowing other kids his age to come to the island and see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat radio announcement was a week and a half ago. Kiel was in his usual position siting on the small stretch of land with his knees bent in and his arms wrapped around his legs. He listened to the birds singing on his hand as a scientist, or more preferably his doctor, checked him. \"Spread out your leg Kiel...Kiel...spread your legs out...\" a man in a blue coat with a writing pad commanded from the deck of a nearby ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh! Oh...sorry doctor Mick...\" he let his leg out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, another 17 feet until your fourteenth birthday it seems,\" he tried to joke as he jotted down on his notepad. Kiel gave a meek smile as he pulled his leg back under his arms. \"The third tour is today, not many came yesterday and the day before, but maybe you'll be lucky today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I hope so...\" Kiel spoke quietly to himself, his eyes gleaming with a sad and distant wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go everyone, I'm done with my analysis...bye Kiel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, bye, doctor Mick.\" The boat went back to shore as the usual ships went around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost four which meant the hour long tour would come soon. Four tour boats will sail between the sixteen army boats and stare at Kiel, take pictures, and comment. Some mean, some sexual, some destructive, but only from the ones he wanted to be friends with would he hear piteous. On the first day of the tours no one said anything and he could clearly see every single person on each boat. Most of them still came the second day, but this time were less afraid. And now it was hopefully the day he would hear one kind word from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a little afraid of females because they were the ones that said more inappropriate things, although not the most inappropriate compared to some of the really scary men. He knew who would try to take advantage of him. He also didn't want to spend time with someone older than him because he didn't want them to feel uncomfortable. So he was directed to one group of people, those around his age and were also boys. He had one person in particular he was sure would be the one he'd want to connect with. He had been on the tours since the first day. And he heard him talk before with his friends at school about how sorry he felt for him. Out of the corner of his eye Kiel could see the sorry look the boy hid from the adults...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Look at that FREAK!\" a tall, chunky redheaded boy called out from the lower balcony of the boat, sneering and pointing a long, skinny finger towards the enormous figure sitting on the island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" his shorter and thinner blonde-haired friend agreed. \"Have you ever seen anything like him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" the redhead shook his head. \"He almost looks like something out of a bad 50's sci-fi TV show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or one of those stupid role-playing games,\" the blonde boy suggested. \"Either way, he's certainly weird. Why do you think he's so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beats me,\" Redhead shrugged. \"Hey, what do you think he does when he has to take a dump?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlondie started smirking. \"Probably just pulls down those stupid blue shorts of his and squats over the ocean.\" He started laughing derisively at his example of juvenile humor. \"I'm glad I'm not a fish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever the case,\" Redhead said as a crooked smile started to form across his face, \"he's not natural, that's for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Blondie nodded, \"I hear he's not even from Earth! That's why he's a FREAK!\" The boy climbed up on the second rail, leaning his torso out over the water as far as he could go. He cupped his hands around his mouth, yelling at the top of his lungs, \"YOU HEAR THAT? GO BACK TO WHEREVER YOU CAME FROM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH!\" His pudgy friend had joined him, one sneakered foot on the railing and another sticking out in the air behind him. \"GET OUT OF OUR COUNTRY AND OFF OF OUR PLANET, YOU GIANT ALIEN FREAK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason!\" a squat middle-aged woman called down from the upper deck, where her and the other school group parents who were acting as chaperones on this trip were watching the boys from while lying on a series of deck chairs, absorbing the sun using reflectors. \"Get down from that railing or you'll fall off into the ocean! Besides, you're way too far away; that boy can't hear you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back from the group of jeering boys, a moderately-tall, athletically-built olive-skinned boy leaned against the wall of the boat and watched his classmates (he no longer called them his \"friends\") make complete fools of themselves. Jonah had listened intently to last week's radio broadcast and knew that what the chaperone said was wrong, that Kiel, the giant boy, could actually hear each individual comment that was being said on any of the ships circling the island, as well as pinpoint the exact person saying it, using his unbelievable eagle-eye vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of it made any logical sense; it was all beyond any current human comprehension, Jonah knew. That's why he had been looking forward to this school trip so much ever since six weeks ago when his teachers had said they would spend a week visiting Ko Pilikua Moena (\"The Giant's Bed\", as Kiel's island had come to be known since his discovery). He wanted to meet the giant boy, perhaps get the chance to talk to him and learn more about his kind. If he was lucky enough, he might even discover what was going on inside his continuously growing body that had caused all this in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the trip had not been as enjoyable as Jonah had hoped it would be. First of all, the school chaperones immediately decided against bringing the ships to the shore, demanding that the ship's captain only circle the island at a circumference of no closer than 500 yards. Jonah felt torn apart inside; he was closer than nearly any other civilian (certainly any kid or teenager) had ever gotten to the giant, close enough to see the details of his form and hear his breathing and his surprisingly quiet voice, but he was not close enough. He might as well have been watching Kiel on a television special, sitting on his couch back home in Honolulu.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding to Jonah's disappointment was the fact that every one of the other boys in the class had come to a consensus that they should mock the poor giant endlessly, taunting him however they could and making fun of his appearance at every opportunity. Even the adults on the ship, when they thought none of the kids were around, whispered hurtful or incredibly offensive statements to each other concerning Kiel. Jonah had heard one of these comments, and he felt like crying because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only time that Jonah spoke up in defense of Kiel, the other boys immediately seized the opportunity to single him out, making fun of him and calling him an \"alien-lover\" and \"mini-Freak\". One particularly foul-mouthed boy even suggested that Jonah had a secret desire to the giant boy to scoop him up and use him as a sex-toy. Jonah had fairly thick skin, he thought, and he didn't take their insults directed towards him very seriously, knowing that they were just being stupid, immature jerks. But he couldn't help but continue to feel sorry for the massive boy they were mocking, wondering how it must feel to live all alone in a world that continuously shrank around him, not having any friends or family to support him anywhere on the planet. Kiel's situation seemed incredibly sad to Jonah, and at the same time made him want to meet the boy all the more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedhead and Blondie wrapped up their yelling and jumped down from the railing. \"C'mon,\" Redhead said, motioning for his friend to follow, \"let's go inside, downstairs to the room with the glass floor on bottom deck of the boat. We might be able to see if he's left any trash or whatever in the water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" his blonde friend agreed. \"I bet we'll see huge petrified turds on the ocean floor! Or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the obnoxious boys ran off, heading to the interior of the ship, Jonah closed his eyes and sighed, dismayed by the incredible levels of immaturity they had displayed. \"Am I the only boy in the entire freshman class who doesn't think jokes about fecal matter are funny?\" he thought to himself. At least they were gone, and he was alone on the lower balcony now. He walked up to the same railing where the two boys had been standing and gently leaned against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing aside the thick black hair that had fallen into his eyes again, he looked out across the surface of the water towards the island, watching keenly as the giant boy sat there, doing nothing, apparently. Jonah could make out the lean, rippling muscles in Kiel's upper body and his powerful, sequoia-like legs. Even from this far a distance, Jonah got the impression that the giant had a tender demeanor and attitude, and that he always tried to carefully avoid intruding on any animal or plants on his island, even in addition to the mystical powers that kept his large size from hurting anyone or anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as Jonah continued to watch Kiel, the one thing that he felt more than anything was how lonely the giant looked. He sat silently, his thick arms wrapped around his knees and his eyes barely open, seemingly on the verge of tears. Sometimes a bird or small mammal would start to climb on his foot, and he'd carefully pick them up and bring them towards his face, murmuring something softly as he did. This was the closest he ever came to smiling, his eyes lighting up if only for a second. But the animals would always end up flying away or scurrying off, leaving Kiel all alone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonah propped his chin up with his arm as he continued to lean against the railing. \"What a poor, noble soul,\" he thought to himself. \"I can't imagine how I'd survive so alone, so far away from my home and all the people I know and love. I wish I could be there, walking around on the island. I wish I could talk to him...\" Damn those stupid chaperones and their rash decision to restrict the group from visiting the island itself. As Jonah looked at his watch, realizing it was almost time for the ships to leave for the day, he consoled himself with the fact that his school group still had two more days of tours left, and that he still had a few more opportunities to observe the giant.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiel had watched all this unfold, sitting down in his usual spot on the highest point of the island. He did his best to ignore the hurtful comments of the ignorant boys and close-minded adults, but their negativity and their hostility did get to him, at least a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something different about this time, though. Something that stirred a feeling inside him, a feeling of... what was it again? Hope? It had been so long since he had felt that way about anything in his life. But here, on one of these ships, above all the insults, jeers and screaming of a thousand detractors, Kiel detected a single quiet, contemplative voice, one that spoke with optimism, with a sense of longing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could talk to him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may not have seemed like much, but these words represented the exact kind of sentiment that Kiel had been looking and hoping for all this time. He narrowed his vision, scanning the row of tour boats out in the distance, and identified the source of the one positive statement: the smooth, somewhat-rounded face of a teenaged boy who leaned against a railing on the lower balcony of the ship he was on. Based on the boy's facial features and skin tone, Kiel quickly determined that the boy had to be Japanese-American in origin, perhaps with some native Hawaiian thrown in there as well. He seemed around the same age as Kiel, maybe a few months older, a year at most. He stood around 5' 10\", making him a little taller than most of the other boys in his group, though not enough to make any sort of real difference to Kiel himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat probably captured Kiel's attention the most, however, was how inquisitive and interested the boy seemed to be. He didn't shout or yell like the other boys, or run around crazily, or make jokes. Instead, he waited for the rest of the boys to leave before really saying much of anything at all. As Kiel looked at the boy, he realized that he had actually been on the boat during both of the first two days of the tours, and remembered that the other boys had called him Jonah (along with some other not-so-nice names that Kiel had chosen to ignore). He didn't remember hearing much of anything from him then, perhaps a quiet word of protest. At the time Kiel had wondered why the boy had not joined in with the others, but this explained it. Like Kiel, Jonah was gentle, not wanting to attack or make fun of something (or someone) he didn't comprehend, but instead having a burning desire to explore and become more understanding of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiel got lost in contemplation, and the sound of the tour boats blasting their horns startled him. The horns blew three long tones, signaling that the tour ships were about to leave the area and head back to the harbor. Kiel quickly snapped back to the situation at hand, and when he realized what was happening, he began to feel sad that the boats were leaving. Had they already been here for an hour, he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful feeling suddenly built up inside Kiel's heart, surprising the giant with its intensity and its urgency. He now realized that he had to give Jonah some sort of signal, some indication that Kiel had picked up his good intentions and knew that they were like-hearted souls. He racked his brain, trying to think of something he could possibly do to demonstrate this, but absolutely nothing came to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with no other ideas, Kiel decided to just turn his head and look directly at Jonah, making eye contact with him. He figured that the boy probably wouldn't think someone as big as Kiel could possibly be looking directly at him and him alone, but he could come up with nothing else. Kiel did his best to convey a sense of friendliness in his expression and a desire for the two of them to meet and talk. For a moment, he thought he saw Jonah's eyes widen, and his mouth begin to open, possibly about to say something. But just at that moment, the ship abruptly changed directions, turning around and speeding off into the distance, back to the island of Kauai where it had departed from, several dozen miles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Kiel turned his eyes back to his own island and looked down at the ground. He bent his head in between his knees and wrapped his hands behind his neck, softly sobbing as his enormous body bobbed up and down, ever so slightly. Another day had come and gone, and nothing had changed. He still was growing out of control. He still heard the hurtful mocking of thousands of people daily. And he still was just as alone as ever.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I swear, Cory,\" Jonah exclaimed into his cell phone, his voice getting faster and higher in tone as he got more and more excited, \"he was looking directly at me! Me and me alone! I could just... feel it--- in his eyes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second's pause preceded his older brother's slightly lower-pitched, monotone voice, and the single-word question it asked: \"Who?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonah stopped pacing around the hotel room, smacking his forehead with his hand. \"Who?! Who have we been talking about for the last fifteen minutes, Cory? Who's been on the local news every week for the past two years?  Who's the whole reason my  class went on a trip to Kauai in the first place?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore silence answered him. \"Uhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Kiel, Cory,\" Jonah groaned in frustration, a little surprised at his brother's display of either ignorance or forgetfulness. \"The fifteen-hundred-foot tall boy with the long blue hair. Remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Cory's voice suddenly clicked in recollection. \"Oh yeah, I forgot that's where you guys were going. Sorry about that.\" Through the phone, Jonah could hear the sound of computer keys clicking away at an incredibly fast pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cory,\" he grinned and shook his head, \"can't you do the polite thing and get off of the computer for even a few minutes, so you can properly talk to your favorite little brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my only little brother,\" Cory reminded him. \"And no, I can't. I've got a big assignment for my Java class due in two hours. It's worth a quarter of my grade, and I still need to finish writing four subroutines, scan for any possible bugs, and pray to God it all compiles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonah chuckled. \"Okay, fine, I'll give you a pass.\" He wasn't surprised. As smart and as talented a programmer as Cory was, he wouldn't be Cory if he weren't scrambling to complete some major project at the very last minute. The same kinda thing at the end of his senior year almost kept him from passing physics (and, thus, graduating from high school), and, though few in his family dared to bring it up, everyone knew that lack of preparation and scrambling to meet deadlines were the two main reasons why he had been rejected by Stanford, MIT, and UC-Berkley, and forced to attend Hawaii Pacific University, his safety school, despite getting a 1580 on the SAT. Though Cory maintained that he had wanted to be close to home anyways (and Jonah was certainly glad to have him stay in Honolulu), and HPU had a reasonably decent computer science program that Cory seemed to be doing well in, Jonah knew that his older brother's ambitions were certainly higher than just staying in the Islands all his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways,\" Cory talked as he continued to type away, \"how exactly do you know that this mega boy was looking at you specifically? Weren't there something like a dozen other tour boats right around yours? Not to mention the Navy and Coast Guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only four touring ships,\" Jonah answered, exhaling a little, \"and the military ships kept their distance the entire time. I can't say for sure why I know he was looking at me, Cory. I just know that he was. I sensed it, felt it in every part of my body. And you want to know something else? He's an extraordinarily kind person. He wouldn't-- actually, no, he COULDN'T hurt even a fly. He's just lonely; he needs a friend or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Cory said, \"I'm not sure exactly how a fifteen-hundred-foot tall boy befriends anyone. But I guess even a giant like him could use a buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Jonah paused, stepping out onto the second-floor balcony of the hotel room, looking down onto the beach below. The waves of the ocean gently washed upon the shore below, the waters as calm as he'd seen in weeks. Looking out towards the horizon, he knew that Kiel's island was only thirty or so miles away, off to the northeast. There had to be a way for him to get out there. It was certainly too far to swim, even for someone as experienced as he was, but maybe... If he just could get his hands on something like-- like a small motorboat, perhaps the ones that he had seen for rent back at Nawiliwili Harbor... He pictured himself sailing across the waters of the Pacific, the wind at his back, soon coming ashore on the giant's island, much to the big boy's surprise... If he put his mind to it, Jonah knew he could make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jonah? Are you listening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonah snapped back to the conversation, unaware that Cory had gone on talking while he had been lost in his imagination. \"Uh... yeah. I'm here, Cory. Sorry about that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGentle laughter filled his ears. \"Now look who's not paying attention to his favorite older brother.\" In his mind Jonah saw Cory's bright, wide smile as his brother leaned forward and playfully mussed his hair. The thought made him feel a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my only older brother,\" Jonah reminded him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't I just use that line not even five minutes ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maayyyybeee...\" Jonah smirked as he blushed a little. \"But you know what? You're still my favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, buddy,\" Cory said, his voice warm and appreciative. \"I hope you have fun tomorrow. Do you think they'll finally let you go scuba diving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonah's eyes suddenly lit up. \"Oh yeah! They said they'd let anyone who was certified get in the water tomorrow. I think me and a couple of other guys and girls are planning on it. I'd almost forgotten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like fun. Just don't go and swim too close to the island. Kiel might just reach out and scoop you out of the water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonah rolled his eyes. If only, he thought. \"I'll keep that in mind. Good night, Cory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonah flipped shut his phone and shoved it into the front pocket of his jeans. As he leaned against the balcony rail, a sudden gust of wind came up from the ocean, blowing his hair back into his eyes. Jonah just stood and absorbed the wind, wondering if that same gust might have travelled all the way from Kiel's island, if it had circulated through his two massive lungs, exhaled by the boy before making its way across the sea. It didn't really matter, Jonah realized, but the thought stirred something inside of him, a feeling he couldn't quite place a finger on. The only thing he knew was that he liked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the hotel room door flying open interrupted his thoughts. Jonah turned around to see several boys, including the loud, obnoxious jock he had been forced to share a room with this week, stumble in. The group was shouting and yelling all sorts of annoying and offensive things. Jonah sighed. It looked like his private contemplation time was over. Now it was time to come crashing back down to reality.</span></div></div>",
