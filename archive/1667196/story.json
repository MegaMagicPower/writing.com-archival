In the bathroom he stepped on the scale to see how much he weighed, the number blinked before they stopped and the screen went black. Wow 215 pounds, he had always been big but it was getting a bit out of hand. He told himself that he would lose weight but just didn't really care too much about it. He shrugged, and went to take his shower. He realized he got tired faster and that his body didn't like standing to long so he rinsed and got out. He went to put his shirt on and it was bit tight, so we're his pants. They weren't to tight but they were tight enough to strain on his stomach. Darth Vader's helmet was a bit strengthen out on his shirt, but he didn't really realize it that much. He went down stairs to the smell of bacon and pancakes, his mom always feed him well. His parents were both journalists and had to travel a bunch for their job, which meant they gave Alex all the food he wanted, as kinda a sorry note for not being there for you. But when his mom was home she always made tons of food, and it was all for Alex. Do to them being occasional News Anchors they had to keep up appearances and because of that they are like rabbits. When they went out to eat Alex would finish of his dad's and moms plate when he was done. This morning his mom made more then usual and so in respect to her he ate all of it. In total 7 pieces of bacon and 11 pancakes. When he finished up his mom told him that she was going to Africa with his Dad for 2 months for work. This was usual to Alex except this time he was old enough to watch himself. You see he turned 16 two weeks ago and now could drive himself to school. So they decided he was old enough. They left him 1,500 money wise for food and gas and then the next day they were gone. When Alex wakes up he sees a note his mother left that said. </span></div></div>",

She was sitting at home, in her couch, with a gamecube controller connected to her Nintendo Wii.  She was playing one of the more strategic games ever concived, Pikmin 2.<br>\r\nNow, she was commanding a bunch of Pikmin against a boss - a snake-like creature with the head of a bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Purple! Do that sumo-stomp! Smack it!\", Erika cheered as her little Pikmin army attacked. From the hallway, one of her older brothers, Joe, came into the room. He was in his pj's, and looked half-asleep. He looked at his \"big\" sister, and noticed she was in HER jammies, which were naturally tighter on her large frame. \"Erika, what are you doing? It's the middle of the night!\", her brother said, rubbing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika paused her game, and turned to her brother. Even though she was the fattest in her school, she had one of the most beautiful faces of anybody. She brushed aside some of her hair, and replied, \"If you had bothered to look at the clock, Joe, you would know that in this world, it's actually 4:30.\" <br>\r\nJoe blinked, and checked the clock; she was right. \"Oh, sorry. I guess I'm still half-asleep.\"<br>\r\n\"It's ok,\" she said. \"You have an excuse, considering how late you stayed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe resumed her battle; the snake-bird shook off the Pikmin and burrowed underground.  Joe watched his sister battle. \"How come you're so into this game?\", he asked. \"I thought you'd be more into Halo and stuff.\"<br>\r\n\"Just because I'm playing one game doesn't mean it's my new favorite, Joe,\" she answered, not taking her eyes off the TV screen. \"But to answer your question, what's not to like? You play as an alien, you meet and fight all these cool animals - like the Snagret I'm gonna beat -, and you control an army of small, colorful, singing walking plant-minions. It's a dream come true!\"<br>\r\nJoe chuckled. \"Well, don't get too sucked in; remember you have school.\"<br>\r\nErika paused. \"Oh my gosh, you sounded just like mom for a second.\"  <br>\r\nThey both laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow before we continue, one quick question.

Luckily for her a family friend was able to get her to a refugee camp. She remained there for a few months until she was adopted by an American family called the Griffons. They were very nice people who treated her with love and compassion. Another thing to note is that they were all pretty fat with even the youngest member of the family being 300lbs Abital herself remain skinny do to her high metabolism but she didn't mind them being fat since they were pretty nice to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile growing up in America she developed a love for video games and went to the same class as Erika's brothers in college. After a few classes together Luke got the courage to ask her out and she accepted and after going on more dates they officially became a couple and started living in the same house with his brother Joe. Eventually he introduced her to his family and since she grew up around fat people she got along well with Erika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo anyway back to the story. Erika said good morning to Abital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning to you too Erika, you seem to be in a pleasant mood in spite of playing video games in the middle of the night\" said Abital as she was pouring cereal in a bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, did I keep you awake\" said Erika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you only keep me up for a little bit. But Luke being the heavy sleeper that he is could stay asleep even if a rock and roll concert would be playing right next door\" said Abital causing her and Erika to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika then looked at the clock and saw it 7:45 am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I should be going right now if I don't want to be late for school\" said Erika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a few minutes and I will drive you to school\" said Abital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you don't have to do that\" said Erika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense child and besides I need to go out and do some groceries for tonight's dinner\" Abital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes Abital finished her cereal and put some clothes on and drove Erika to school.</span></div></div>",

He comes from a big family - he has a big sister, Jane, a big brother named Ethan, and a little sister named Harriet.  Normally, he's been fairly fit for his age; he's a member of his elementary school's soccer team.  But lately, he's been getting a little round, and nobody knows why. It could be that he's just been getting hungrier because he's growing.....or maybe it could have something to do with his big sister Jane secretly giving him fatty foods before he goes to sleep...<br>\r\n Gender: boy<br>\r\n Age: 7 years<br>\r\n Size: chubby<br>\r\n Likes: playing video games, soccer, being with his family, hugs, doing a good job<br>\r\n favorite food: candy, pizza, junk food, food Jane gives him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina: Nina's best described as someone who's \"wise beyond her years.\"  She's very intelligent; by 2nd grade, she was already reading books like Harry Potter and other big novels!  She's also been gaining alot of weight.  Of course, some of the children at her school make fun of her because she's fat; however, she doesn't really care about them teasing her.  In fact, a part of her kinda likes them calling her a \"big, fat piggy\".  All the teachers know that Nina wants to gain weight, and although many have warned her about it, she's assured them that it's a personal choice.  So they're ok; in fact, once in a while, one of the teachers might treat her by giving her some food!<br>\r\n Gender: girl<br>\r\n Age: 6 years<br>\r\n Size: fat<br>\r\n Likes: eating, getting bigger, reading, being teased about her fat<br>\r\n favorite food: fried chicken<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE:<br>\r\nNina's main storyline is currently undergoing edits, to improve both grammar and fluidity of the story.

It was summer vacation and her parents decided to stay home this year. Would't be so bad if not all of her friends were on vacation at the same time. All friends she had were gone at vacation. She liked it too do things with her friends but now they were all gone. She also liked it to do some exercise what was easy since the had a big yard and some exercise stuff outside but it was too hot for exercise. Even for Katie. She only wore a bikini and even now she was sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men i'm so boooored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's noting for you Katie. Normal you're so active.\" Her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's much too hot for that.\" Katie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie looked like a smaller younger version of her mother. It was strange that she had't anything in looks compared with her dad. He always liked it to train with her and do things with her. Her mother wore big sunglasses and a big hat that gave her some shade.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You could call a friend.\" Her mother suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are all on vacation. Why can't we go too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie stop whining! We can't go away every vacation. Besides we went on vacation many times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. When i was 0, 1, 2 and 3. I remember so much of that.\" She said snappish but soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh besides an old friend of me is coming today. She has a daughter who's also coming. You two could hang out together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Katie said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was very nice and polite and had many friends and also easily made friends. So maybe she could make a new friend.  <br>\r\nShe walked too the garage. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What are you going too do?\" Her mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open the hose too cool off. Could't you buy a swimming pool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how much that cost and how much work it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie walked over too the garage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour later Katie heard a car coming. She excited waited what kind of girl it was. First a chubby tall woman came out with blond hair also with big sunglasses and blond hair. <br>\r\nBehind her came a girl about Katie's age. She was fat. She had white hair that fall around a fat face. She had flabby arms and a big potbelly that stuck out forward with rubbing thighs. She smiled friendly.<br>\r\nKatie polite introduce herself, but seeing this girl... she doubted this girl did much activity. But still at least someone to hang out with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello you must be Katie. I'm Salie Marsh and this is my daughter Caroline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaroline friendly stuck out her hand. Katie shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two go play.\" Katie's mother said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Katie said and ran into the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a while she stopped so Caroline could catch up with her.Caroline was kind of slow. She was breathing heavily when she finally reached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't do much exercise do you?\" Katie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(puf puf) No. Not really. But you are way too thin.\"   </span></div></div>",

Wanna join?\" With an anticipation of eating and trying out new yummy food, Max said yes with the happiest smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast forward to Saturday afternoon. Jane and Max went to the new buffet place where they have all kinds of food. They're glad that although there's a fair amount of people there, they were still able to pick a seat with less people around. Immediately, the sibilings went out and grabbed their first plate. When they got back to the booth, Jane was surprised that Max had almost twice the amount of food on his plate compares to her's and she's kind of proud at the same time. After Max relentlessly chowed down the chickens, porks, potatoes, spaghetti and rice on his plate, he went out for his 2nd. He piled his 2nd plate even higher than the first one with mash potatkes, macaroni and cheese, fried chickens and other fattening food. Half way through his 2nd helping however, Max had slowed down because of his belly started expending to the point where it's hard to breathe because of his jeans. Jane, while is on her 2nd plate as well, had less food than her little brother, told him to unbottin his jeans to feel more comfortable. After Max did so, he signed out in relieve and finished the 2nd plate in no time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext time Max came back, he had his 3rd plate with mere fries and a lot of bacons and also his desert, which was 2 slices of fattening chocolate cakes, a lot of brownes and couple scoops of iced cream. After he finished his bacons and fries fairly sluggishly and wanted to start working on his deserts, he let out a bassive burp that smelled like pork and chicken which shocked the unprepaired Jane and some people sitting around them. \"Ugh! Thats better. Now there's more room for the desert\" Says Max. After he finished all those cakes and ice creams and fattening brownies, he let out another burp and him and Jane started heading out for the car. The most awkward part for him was that it took him almost 2 mins to botton up his jeans and the zipper didn't even go all tbe way up because of his bloated stomach and it makes him very uncomfortable. When they finally made it to Jane's car, Max literally farted right after they got in and poor Jane had to open the window in disgust. They both had a really good time at the buffet place and will definitely go back sometime in the near future. \"Do you want some curly fries before we head home?\" Asked Jane. \"Well, urb.. i can never say no to that!\" Exclaims Max, while still rubbing his swollen belly and burping...</span></div></div>",

First stood Sandrina, the class princess and self-proclaimed prettiest girl in the school.  She had a frown which would easily have earned her a time-out form any mother, which was framed by her neck-length shiny black hair.  She had her hands on her hips, showcasing her slim frame underneath her expensive-looking clothes.<br>\r\nBehind her stood Hannah, a stuck-up blonde-haired girl whose personality could be best summed up with the words \"pet parrot\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Sandrina,\" Nina greeted with absolute disinterest.  \"To what do I owe the pleasure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you stand being so fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump child resisted the urge to shoot a comeback, and resumed reading in her bean bag chair.  <i>'Just ignore them, Nina,</i> she reminded herself.  <i>'If you fight, they'll only push back harder.'</i><br>\r\nSandrina pouted, frustrated in her efforts to tease the fatty before her.  Feeling ignored, she opted a different approach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you reading there?\", the snobby girl asked, obviously probing for weaknesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina presented the cover to them, eyeing the two expectantly.  \"See for yourself,\" she beckoned.  <br>\r\nAt that moment, Sandra and Hannah froze; they had forgotten, Nina was the only person in the class who could read fluently.  Sandrina steeled herself, ready to meet the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry... Potter... and the... pri-zon-er... of.. Azaband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina tried very hard not to laugh.  \"Try again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Prisoner of...Abbakand,\" Hannah tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina snorted, obviously trying her hardest to not giggle aloud.  Sandrina noticed, and put on the defensive.  \"What's so funny?!,\" she angrily protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Az-ka-ban,\" Nina enunciated for them. \"Prisoner of Azkaban.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares about the stupid book, anyway!?\", Sandrina replied with a huff.  She turned away and stormed off walked away, Hannah close on her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, because I'm apparently the only one who can read them,\" Nina answered quietly out of earshot.  She sighed, and cracked open the book to where she had left off.  Before she resumed, however, her mind flashed back to a single quote...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'...you fat pig...'</i>, she thought to herself.  The thought of it made her smile and giggle to herself.  What the local bullies hadn't quite caught on was that their teasing Nina about her weight only had the opposite effect of what they'd intended.  She actually rather liked their attempts at insults and name-calling.  She wasn't quite sure why, but...it made her feel happy, being called out for being the fatty she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pleasant smile, she reached her hand in her bag for a chocolate bar. At that same moment, she felt her clothes tighten, and heard a soft \"pop\".  A button of her blouse popped off and landed in the book sitting right on her knees.  She blushed slightly, not expecting to pop a button so soon.  She sat up, and saw some of her fat belly already poking out of the blouse.  <br>\r\n\"Well, there goes the first one,\" she said with a giggle, feeling terribly excited about her growth.  Her blouse already felt tight, and she suspected it wouldn't take long before she popped another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the chocolate, and quickly stuffed the whole bar in her mouth like a pig, chewing it a few times before gulping it down.  She licked her lips as her thoughts turned towards dinner; her father had promised that they would be having more fried chicken tonight, and her father always kept his promises.  <br>\r\nBoth her parents knew that their daughter liked being big and stuffing her face, and although her father was somewhat more open-minded about it, her mother had taken quite a lot of arguing to to accept her daughter's wishes.  <br>\r\nThat being said, just because she accepted it didn't mean her mother was entirely happy with Nina's choice-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ringing of the bell snapped Nina out of her thoughts, and brought her back to the present.  It was time for class.  Following her claassmates, she entered the classroom and took her seat behind her desk in the front row. <br>\r\n\"All right class,\" the teacher announced, \"we have reading practice today!\" This brought out moans from everyone, Sandrina and Hannah among them.  Nina, on the other hand, smiled happily.  Taking note to cover up her popped button as best she could, lest the teacher spotted it, she pulled out her pencil and prepared for the day. </span></div></div>",

They knew what it meant - at last, it was time.....for recess.  Everyone dropped what they were doing and raced outside to the playground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone, that is, except for Nina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. McCoy looked at her star pupil, as Nina retreated to the reading area. The reading corner was situated in the corner of the classroom.  Two bookcases were used as makeshift walls, with enough space between them like a doorway for anyone entering.  Due to the corner's relatively small area, there were no normal chairs in the corner.  Instead, bean bag chairs were used, to offer the kids a place to relax as they read. <br>\r\nIt was Nina's favorite place in the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, unable to resist an iota of pride - already at age 6, and she was reading full-length novels!  Mrs. McCoy watched as the fat little girl flopped into the bean bag chair, unwrapping another chocolate bar.  She also knew about Nina's desire to get bigger, although she wasn't as angry or scared as Nina's mother was when she first heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Nina? Aren't you coming outside?\", Mrs. McCoy asked her cheerfully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you,\" Nina replied, looking up from her book.  \"I'd rather stay in here and read, if that's ok, ma'am.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's perfectly fine, Nina,\" Mrs. McCoy replied, \" but be careful not to get chocolate all over those pages now.  It's important to take care of books.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina nodded; \"Don't worry, there's a cover on just in case!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer teacher smiled, and went outside to watch all the other children.  She didn't have to worry about Nina; were it not for the school lessons, she'd be sitting there for hours reading.<br>\r\nNina placed her chocolate bar on a nearby paper plate, and sat up more on her bean bag, grateful for their existence.  She stretched her arms up, making her shirt ride up and exposing the bottom of her belly.  Then she leaned back into the chair, and resumed reading while devouring her chocolate.</span></div></div>",

Maybe it would behoove her to wait until she was home to eat, she contemplated. She knew her mother didn't liked it when her clothes ripped or lost buttons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First thing I'll do when i get home is pull off this blouse, grab a big bowl of snacks and a big glass of cola, and continue reading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid deeper into her bean bag chair, and lost herself in the pages of the book until she heard the school bell. She sighed somewhat sadly, slid a makeshift paper bookmark where she stopped in the book, and waddled back to her seat. <br>\r\nSoon the other kids returned to the classroom.  Mrs. McCoy followed behind, smiling warmly as she caught Nina taking care of the books as she put them up.<br>\r\n\"Teacher's pet,\" Hannah whispered as she passed by Nina, prompting a frown from Nina as the class returned to their seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina returned her gaze to the board, focusing on the lessons. She was fairly good in most subjects, save for physical education. Even without Nina's will to grow bigger and her already portly size, she'd never really been one for physical activity. It seemed a waste of effort, to her; she was always exhausted by the end of it, and she knew she would probably fail most P.E. activities. Fortunately for her, all her other grades were good, so she felt she could skip fussing over one class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina was pulled from her focus by a painful pinch on the back of her neck. She looked at the ground, and found a small rubber band. Looking over her shoulder revealed the source of the disturbance \u2013 Hannah, with a sly grin her face.  Her grin quickly turned to fear, though, as she found herself under the teacher's gaze.  Several minutes later, Hannah was sitting in the hallway outside the classroom, while the lesson went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was mostly uneventful; simple mathematic calculations, a brief discourse of animals, and then a free period.  While most of the children used free time to play games or draw, Nina spent her time in her usual place reading.  A passing glance revealed Sandrina and Hannah scowling in the corner.  Nina allowed herself some relief knowing Mrs McCoy was in the classroom; while the two kids were obviously in a rotten mood from the day's events, they weren't so stupid to attempt to tease Nina in front of a teacher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the bell heralded the end of another school day.  Nina pushed the book back in her backpack, and started towards the door.  However, she was stopped by Mrs. McCoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a moment please, Nina.  I want to speak with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the classroom had emptied, she knelt down to Nina's level, a more serious expression on her face.<br>\r\n\"All right Nina, we're alone now and no one will overhear anything, so you can be totally honest. You can tell me anything you like. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina nodded, curious as to where this conversation was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nina,\" Mrs. McCoy began, \"I've noticed you've been getting teased by the other kids. I saw Sandrina during recess today, and I get the feeling that this isn't the first time this has happened. Is this true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you mean them teasing me about my size, then yes it has happened before,\" Nina replied.  \"But in all honesty, I actually don't mind it much.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've already mentioned to you about me wanting to get bigger, right? So really, their insults are more like compliments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're not bothered by it, then I won't interfere,\" Mrs. McCoy replied. \"But if you ever need help or if they do anything to hurt you, then you let me know, all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am,\" Nina answered with a reassuring smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl. Oh! Speaking of your weight, I have a little something for you!\" Mrs. McCoy reached into a small bag, and pulled out three massive chocolate bars! Nina did her best not to drool at the sight.  \"Oh thank you!\", she exclaimed.  \"Thank you so much, Mrs. McCoy!  Chocolate is my favorite!\"<br>\r\nShe paused, and shyly added, \"Well, after fried chicken. And pizza...and cheesecake...and ice cream...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. McCoy chuckled in response.  \"Anything for my star student! Now you head on home. And remember, don't be afraid to come tell me if you get bullied. See you tomorrow, Nina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina grabbed her backpack and waddled her way out as quickly as she could. Outside in the school parking lot, she managed to find her mother waving her over, and she happily jumped into her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello honey. How was school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fine, Mommy. But...I lost another button on my blouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie,\" her mother complained, \"that's the fourth one you've popped this month.  You know I can't keep repairing your clothes forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, mom, it was an accident...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, sweetie. We'll get it fixed when we get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother began the long drive home. Nina undid some of the buttons on her blouse, her belly pushing out as she got comfortable.  Shethen opened her book \u2013 and one of her secret present chocolate bars \u2013 and resumed reading as they returned home.</span></div></div>",

Mom went into the kitchen to set down her purse and things from work; Nina walked into the living room, set down her backpack, and flopped down on the couch, exhausted from school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey? Would you like something to eat while you rest?\", Nina's mom asked from inside the kitchen.  \"Yes please!\", Nina replied happily.<br>\r\n\"What would you like?\"<br>\r\n'''Hm...could we maybe have some burgers, or maybe some ice cream?\"<br>\r\nHer mother shook her head.  \"Cheeseburgers will spoil your appetite, but you may have some ice cream.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, mom!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina sighed and took off her coat.  She sat on the couch, laid back on one of the throw-pillows and closed her eyes, letting her mind relax from the day.  She awoke several minutes later when she felt something cold on her lap: the ice cream bucket.<br>\r\n\"Make sure not to spill any of it on the couch, ok?\", her mom cautioned as she turned back to the kitchen. \"And make sure to save some room for dinner when dad comes home.\"<br>\r\nNina happily grabbed the bucket of ice cream, and dug in.  Scoop after scoop disappeared down her throat as she savored the cooling sensation it gave her as it slipped down her throat and entered her belly.  After several hours, the ice cream left over was inside Nina's bloated belly; she started looking like one of the bean-bag chairs at her school!  Nina's mom, in the meantime, was flipping through channels to see what was on TV, and the two awaited the return of Nina's father.</span></div></div>",

Nina couldn't think of any channel more boring; her grandmother always cautioned her against buying from TV. Truthfully, Nina never planned to (except the occasional protein shake or anything that could aid her in her weight gain goal), but her mother would occasionally make a couple of purchases from the channel.<br>\r\nAs she reached for her backpack to pull out her book, she suddenly remembered the chocolate she had been given after class. She contemplated whether to eat them or not, when suddenly the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and excited raced to the door as fast as her weight would allow.<br>\r\n\"Well at least that's some exercise she does.\" Her mother muttered under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy! Daddy!\", Nina cheered as she raced to her father, who scooped her into his arms happily.  He used to be able to lift her up, but lately it had become harder to do so, so instead he opted to simply kneel to her level and hug her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  How's my big girl?\", Nina's father greeted, giving his daughter's tummy a friendly pinch, eliciting a giggle.<br>\r\nNina's mother entered the room, and kissed her husband. Nina gave a wide grin, and took her place back before the television.  Whenever dad returned home, it was sure that dinner was to follow shortly. In the meantime, she relaxed on the couch and distracted herself with the television.  She moved a hand to her stomach, feeling how nice and soft she had grown...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey, you fat pig!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina blushed again as she recalled Sandrina's comment from earlier.  She smiled, hugging her plump body, feeling her fat oozing against her arms.  <br>\r\n<i>'I'm gonna get so big and fat...'</i>, she thought to herself. The thought excited her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nina!  Dinner time!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNina snapped out of her fantasies, and headed to the dining room.  She was starving, and her daydreams had renewed her vigor.  Upon seeing the dining table, she beheld six platters \u2013 3 for her, and 3 for her parents. While Nina's father was more relaxed and accepting of her wishes, her mother was more health-concours, and tended to only eat light. As such, she avoided greasy food as much as possible, to Nina's chagrin' however, Nina made up for it by increasing her portions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight they dined on mashed potatoes, salads for mom, and - as she was promised - fried chicken.  As Nina hungrily filled her plate, her mother spoke up.  \"Nina, sweetie, remember leave some for everyone else.\"<br>\r\n\"I will, mom,\" Nina replied, already hungrily devouring her meal with haste.<br>\r\nHer mother sighed, an air of mild annoyance and disappointment about her.<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" father chimed in attempting to lighten the mood, \"at least she has a healthy appetite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She sure does...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina hungrily devoured as much as she could; with each bite she gulped down, she could feel her belly stretch out and expand bit by bit.  As she slipped the last piece on her plate past her lips, she swallowed it down and laid back, her hands resting on her swollen belly.</span></div></div>",

Nina's relaxed smile quickly disappearing, replaced with a concerned expression.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Nina,\" her mother asked, \"Your father and I have something we need to ask you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina sat up straight with some difficulty.  For a split second, she was worried she might've overstepped herself, and made her mother reconsider about her weight. It had taken a lot of time and effort, enduring punishments and lectures, before Nina had finally convinced her mother it was <i>her</i> desire, and even longer before mother finally agreed to allow her to gain as she wished.  Nina shuddered at the prospect of having to go through all that again...<br>\r\nWhich made the next sentence her mother spoke all the more surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you think if we took another child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina dropped her silverware on the table, the fork rattling as it danced on the tabletop. She stared in stunned silence as she processed what she had just been told...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...mom's having a baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dad bust out laughing, but quickly restrained himself under the glare from his wife.  \"No, Mom's not having a baby <i>yet</i>.  We wanted to talk about it with you, first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina groaned in her seat.  \"Why'd ya go and get me all excited like that?  I have always wanted a little sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it could also be a boy.\" Her mother replied, smiling.<br>\r\n\"Or two.\" Her father added.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I hope not. Just one is already a lot of work, boy or girl.\"<br>\r\n\"Or triplets!\" Nina cheered.<br>\r\n\"Stop it.  That's not funny.\"<br>\r\nNina giggled in response.  \"Seriously, though, I wouldn't mind a little brother or sister.  What stopped you from making one before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there were some issues,\" Nina's mother explained.  \"There were problems at work, your father had been looking for a new job, and then we found out you were wanting to gain weight, so there was so much to process. We didn't know if we could handle another baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Of course, she couldn't leave that out of it,'</i> Nina thought to herself, restraining her urge to groan at her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...is everything ok to do it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well honey, we'll do our best. If the doctor is right, we should do it now. But even if i get pregnant, it'll-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Still be nine months before it's born,\" Nina finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl,\" her father said, ruffling the hair on her head.  \"Now go ahead and clean up your plate. It's almost bedtime, and you've got school tomorrow, young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina nodded, licking her plates clean and stacking them for the dishwasher.  With some difficulty balancing the extra weight in her belly, she got on her feet and  her mother guided her upstairs for a bath. After she was completely clean (<i>paying extra attention to her stuffed belly</i>), she dried herself off, and donned her pj's. She giggled as she saw her belly poking out between the pants and shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee!  Oops!  Looks like I ate a bit too much today,\" Nina said proudly, patting her bloated gut.  Her mother knelt down to inspect, a slight frown on her face.<br>\r\n\"Oh no...well, we'll get some new clothes tomorrow after school, all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina nodded, and after brushing her teeth, she was tucked into bed.  After giving her mother a good night kiss, the lights turned off and she was left to herself.   <br>\r\nShe closed her eyes, and rested her hands on her bloated belly.  She listened to the soft gurgling sound it made as her meal digested within her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...goodnight, you <i>fat little piggy</i>,\" Nina said to herself as she drifted off to sleep.  \"You'll be nice and round in no time...\"</span></div></div>",

So she closed her book, and looked up to see a boy, standing next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...H-hello...\" the boy said shyly. <br>\r\nNina was confused; \"...hello.\", she replied. \"Um, is there something I can help you with?\"<br>\r\n\"Um, n-no...\", the boy answered, \"...I was just going to ask, um...w-would you mind if I sat with you in lunch?\" <br>\r\nNina was surprised. Normally, on the popularity scale, she was fairly low, due to her extra size.  But here was someone asking to sit with her, and they <i>weren't</i> poking fun at her weight. <br>\r\n\"Well, ok. I don't know why you're asking, though, but sure, I don't mind if you sit with me.\"<br>\r\nThe boy smiled and said \"Thanks\", sounding relieved. He then walked away, but Nina saw a blush on his face just before he turned away.<br>\r\nNina thought for a moment, and then opened her book. She was momentarily startled when she saw that, instead of complete words in her book, they were now just gibberish and squiggles! \"Wha?!\", she said aloud, shocked at the change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she realized, she was in her room, in her pajamas, on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must've had a dream\", she concluded quietly. \"But that was weird. Why would the text just suddenly jumble up?\"  She shrugged it off, and was about to fall asleep when she heard an ever-familiar growl.

Whereas walking on one's toes, in the classic cartoon style, would work better for a lighter individual, Nina had observed that walking as such would make more noise, since her weight would be more focused.  Instead, walking flat-footed would spread the weight across the foot, thus making less noise for someone her size.<br>\r\nShe proceeded out her room and to the stairs, listening carefully to her surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no sound; her parents were still asleep.  Good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow came the hard part: the stairs.  If there was any part of her voyage that could fail, this was the danger zone.  <br>\r\nSlowly she stepped on the first stair, a small creak created as her weight pushed against the floorboards.  As she headed further downstairs, she could hear a creak each time she put her feet down. Fortunately, her parents didn't seem to wake up. Finally, after half an hour of sneaking, Nina made it downstairs, and not a peep from her parents room.  Quiet as a mouse (<i>a very big and round mouse</i>), she snuck into the kitchen and closed the door behind her to minimize the noises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Phase 1, complete'</i>, Nina thought to herself proudly.  <i>'Now for phase 2...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the cupboard, and began scavenging for treats.  Quickly and quietly, she ripped open a pretzel pack, and crammed as many pretzels in her mouth as possible. Soon she emptied the two pretzel packs there, and had moved onto the cookie jar.  Plopping them into her waiting maw one at a time, she allowed herself a soft moan as she immersed herself in the chocolatey, gooey goodness she was consuming.  Soon, the entire contents of the cookie jar had found their way within her growing stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina burped quietly, a tender hand on her belly.  She was no longer full, but something else was motivating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to eat more. <br>\r\nShe wanted to eat until her belly burst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to get fat.<br>\r\nSo fat.  <br>\r\nMuch fatter then she was now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a fat little piggy.  <br>\r\nAnd she wanted to be a good little piggy.<br>\r\nAll good little piggies were nice and fat.<br>\r\nAnd to get fatter, she needed to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the refrigerator and began filling herself with everything she could fit inside.  Bacon, cheese, cherry tomatoes, all went into her mouth.  She gobbled up leaves of lettuce in between chugging the dressing. She slurped down the ketchup and mayonnaise as well, moaning as she felt the gooey condiments squish down into her belly.   She found linked sausages, and swallowed them whole, link after link squeezing down her throat, down her esophagus, and plopping into her belly, one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't enough.  Nina wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina opened a bottle of soda and started to chug it down.  She whimpered softly as she felt her belly fill with the bubbling pop.  With great difficulty, the last of the soda disappeared down her throat, and she tossed the empty bottle aside.  She filled herself with more and more; cherry tomatoes, cans of fruit, sticks of butter...even the rest of the ice cream soon was consumed by the ravenous little girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, a belch escaped her lips, signaling she had eaten enough.  Nina rested against the cupboards, dazed from her feeding frenzy.  She moaned softly as she strained her eyes open.  The refrigerator door hung open; it was almost empty now.  All around her, empty boxes and cans littered the floor, crumbs coating around her mouth and on her chest.  Her belly now pushed her shirt up around her chest, sagging on her thighs.  As she placed a hand on her stomach, she swore she could almost feel the sausages and tomatoes underneath her skin, churning inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\" Nina quietly exclaimed in shock.  \"...did I really just eat all of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winced suddenly, as the soreness of her 'snack' had caught up with her.  Her emotions were a complex mixture.  On the one hand, when her parents woke up tomorrow, she was sure to get a stern lecture about her actions.  But on the one hand...knowing just how far she'd let herself go...<br>\r\n...it made her feel good.<br>\r\nShe ate so much...the soreness she felt was a good soreness. She really felt like a fat pig now.  She had eaten almost everything in the kitchen, just as midnight snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'There isn't anything left for breakfast,'</i> she mused as she rubbed her bloated gut, <i>'...but at the same time, I think I can afford to skip breakfast tomorrow.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting the food coma she found herself in, Nina waited five minutes before she found the strength to get up.  Quietly, she took all the empty bags, boxes, cans and garbage,  and threw it in the trash bin.  Then, her belly sloshing with each step, she made her way upstairs as quietly as her fattening body would allow her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rational part of her mind was swamped with dread at what her parents would do.  After fighting for so long to convince them to allow her to get bigger, she had gone and done the one thing that might make them change their mind.  Without a sound, she snuck back into her room and closed the door behind her.   <i>'Well, it won't do me good to fret over it now,'</i> she reasoned.  <i>'What's done is done...I'll have to take my medicine as it comes.  Who knows, I might get out of this intact.'</i><br>\r\nShe crawled back into bed, turning over onto her back.  Her bloated belly rose up like a small mountain over her.  Overcome by the food coma from the massive amount she had consumed, Nina passed out within the minute, and slept while her gurgling stomach digested her huge meal...</span></div></div>",

She was growing into a big, fat piggy, just like she wanted.  Each insult turned into a compliment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wow, Nina!  You must've grown as big as a whale!  You look amazing!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey, Nina!  You must've eaten a lot to fill that wonderful belly of yours!  Looking amazing!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I love how your tight clothes show off your soft curves and beautiful body!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina smiled, her plump and thick hips swaying and jiggling with each step, and entered the classroom, full of love in more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered, the bullies Sandrina and Hannah crossed her gaze again.  Nina smiled inside, waiting for what wonderful compliments she'd receive from them today.  She knew that if the two of them knew she liked their insults, they would change tactics and try to hurt her some other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she didn't want to stop receiving their compliments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Mrs. McCoy arrived, and class was ready to begin.  Nina and the rest of the class took their seats, with Nina just barely squeezing into hers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see a F, i see a A and a T. It's fat, it's fat, it's you. I can see your fat lard ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina looked over her shoulder, and saw it was Sandrina with a smirk on her face. She looked down and saw some of her soft flab was poking out from below her shirt.  <br>\r\nIt wasn't until Sandrina gave it a painful pinch that Nina suddenly regretted not wearing a coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I see a F, i see a A, i see\u2013\"</i>Sandrina started, but was suddenly interrupted by Nina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2013Yeah, I heard, Sandrina,\" Nina answered slightly meaner than she intended.  \"I see a F for you, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina looked confusedly at the fat little pig in front of her.  Then she remembered yesterday's lesson, and delivered an angry glare at Nina as McCoy began the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello you all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Mrs. McCoy all kids said polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. You'll be receiving your grades from spelling <i>Hannah give me that rubber band!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah guiltily handed the rubber band to Mrs. McCoy, under the gaze of all the giggling students who had turned to see her. Not that it would matter much; she probably had another dozen in her pocket, ready to use.<br>\r\nAfter Mrs. McCoy turned her back, Hannah shot Nina a hateful glare, and ran her finger across her throat.  Nina quietly turned away, more than a little uneasy at Hannah's illogically threatening...well, threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. McCoy had begun passing out the graded papers to the class.  Nina had of course received a perfect A.  However, not everyone was so lucky...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A F!\" Sandrina screamed, as Nina struggled to resist saying 'I called it'.  \"Are your serious?!  How do I have a F?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about less teasing, less disrupting my class,  and more studying. Unless you <i>want</i> spend another year here?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day went on as normal \u2013 the same classes, the same results.   All the while, Nina made sure she was within sight of her teacher, and as far away from Hanna and Sandrina as possible.  She knew the two would be more than upset after the day's events, and she wanted to avoid provoking a confrontation.  She hoped she could avoid them during recess...</span></div></div>",

Hannah and Sandrina sat in the corner of the room, plotting their revenge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nina's gonna regret making fun of us...\" Sandrina quietly declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it she never seems to get upset whenever we tease her?\", Hannah asked. \"It's like she's, I dunno...tuning us out, or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina huffed, a scowl on her face. \"She might think she's better than us, but she's not perfect.  There has to be a way to get to her. There's got to, I just know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But whenever we try making fun of her, she either blows it off or teases us back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina closed her eyes, deep in thought.  Everyone knew being fat was gross and unhealthy, she thought, so Nina <i>had</i> to be just as disgusted with herself as everyone else was.  <i>'But how can we get her to see it?'</i>, she thought.  <i>'We'll have to shove her fatness in her face, in a way that hits her directly...but how can we do-?</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it hit her.  \"Hey, Hannah!  What if we made her fatter?\", Sandrina proposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Make her fatter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina turned to Hannah. \"Hear me out.  Whenever we try to tease her, she blows it off or tosses a comeback at us, right?\"  <br>\r\nHannah nodded, attempting to follow the logic being thrown at her.<br>\r\n\"So what we need is more people behind us!  If everyone in school's making fun of her, then she'll finally realize what a fat cow she is!  So if we make her bigger, then more people would notice and start making fun of her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah thought a moment, processing Sandrina's idea. \"That makes sense...we can't handle her when it's just the two of us, but if we have more people on our side, then we have more firepower!\"  <br>\r\nHer face lit up with a devious grin; however, immediately afterwards, the deviousness faded in place of concern.  \"But Sandrina... do you think we'll be able to pull it off?  What if Nina caches us?  Or worse...Mrs. McCoy herself?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we can pull it off, Hannah.  We'll have to be sneaky about it, and slip her extra food where she won't notice.  My big brother works at the cafeteria, if you'll remember; I bet he can give Nina slightly more for her lunches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe we could act friendly?  Maybe offer her our lunches, so she gets 3 times the normal amount?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  So what do you say, Hannah?  Wanna try it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah answered....</span></div></div>",

Nina is pretty smart; I don't think she'll believe it if we suddenly start acting nice to her...she'd probably suspect a trap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...we gotta make it convincing.  Make it seem like we're being forced to be around her, or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat there, plotting their revenge.  Then suddenly, Sandrina had another idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Nina was admiring herself. She pushed her hands deep against her fat belly, feeling her soft skin and warm body. The chocolate Mrs McCoy gave her really helped; she could feel her body was bigger.  She smiled, and slapped her belly softly, making it jiggle like gelatin. She giggled, and sat back in her usual spot in the reading corner.  She pulled out her book, opened it to where she left off, and resumed reading...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHow're we getting to King's Cross tomorrow, Dad?\" asked Fred as they dug into a sumptuous pudding.<br>\r\n\"The Ministry's providing a couple of cars,\" said Mr. Weasley.<br>\r\nEveryone looked up at him.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" said Percy curiously.<br>\r\n\"It's because of you, Perce,\" said George seriously. \"And there'll be little flags on the hoods, with HB on them-\"<br>\r\n\"-for Humongous Bighead,\" said Fred.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunch time!\", Mrs. McCoy called, pulling Nina out of her reading trance.  As the children headed for the cafeteria, they all lined up with their plates. As Nina approached the servers, one of the cafeteria staff - an older boy - smiled pleasantly at her, and gave her an extra helping. Nina was confused' she hadn't done anything to warrant any special treatment.<br>\r\n\"Between you and me,\" the boy added in response, \"we're probably going to have leftovers for today.  So here's a little extra for you.  You look like you could use it!\"  <br>\r\nNina blushed, unsure of whether to take the comment as a genuine concern or if he was told to do so by someone else.  Nevertheless, she smiled, and took her seat, ready to gobble up her food.  With the first bite, she noticed the food tasted off...it seemed sweeter than usual, she thought. She looked around, but none of the other kids seemed to notice.  <i>'Perhaps it was just my imagination?'</i>, she considered.  Nina shrugged, and resumed eating.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the cafeteria, Sandrina and Hannah were quietly munching on their own lunch while quietly observing their chosen target.<br>\r\n\"It worked,\" Sandrina observed. <br>\r\n\"She didn't even question it,\" Hannah added.  \"She just dug right into it, the fat pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my brother was able to get her food extra-buttered, to make it even fattier.  And we were able to successfully sneak it to her without her questioning it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good, but...is there anything else we should try?  I mean, extra food during lunch would help, but I don't think she'll fatten up fast enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina grinned, an expression of cunning on her face.  \"Worry not, Hannah.  I've got it all planned out.\"  With that, she stood up, taking her lunch with her.  'C'mon, follow my lead.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah followed, not willing to question the logic of her better.  Casually, the pair walked right up to Nina.  Nina noticed, and immediately prepared for the worst.  It was Sandrina who spoke up first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, listen.  I'm calling a truce, ok?\", Sandrina assured, in a stern yet serious tone of voice.  \"We wanna talk with you about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina stared at them like she had just been slapped in the face with a fish.  \"...you're joking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we're serious!\", Hannah added, somewhat unsure at the situation, but following as she was told.  \"L-look, can we just talk without the whole fatty stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina nudged Hannah with her elbow, taking a seat across from Nina.  In a single fluid motion, she pulled her F-grade assignment out, and placed it facing Nina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So look.  I have an F. And what do you have?  An A+.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...ok...\" Nina cautiously replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina groaned in frustraion.  \"Ok, listen.  Everything I'm going to say stays between us, ok?  No telling the teachers, no telling other students, nobody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina nodded.  Clearly something was wrong; this was not Sandrina's typical attitude, that was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...are s-smarter than me.  And honestly, if I keep getting poor grades, then my parents are gonna kill me.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, mine too,\" Hannah parroted.<br>\r\n\"So I tell you this because I don't want you thinking I'm asking to be your friend, ok?  We just...we need you h-help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina held up a finger, processing the situation as it was being explained to her.  \"Wait...are you asking me to tutor you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina raised an eyebrow.  \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean teaching you.  You're asking me if I'll help you study for the reading and writing lessons we have.  Is that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina nodded.  \"Y-yes.  Look, I know we've said some things, and you're probably the last person we'd expect to ask for help.  But...please?  At least help us get to C-level.  And then we can go back to how we were before, and you don't have to help us anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina almost couldn't believe what she was hearing.  The <i>bullies</i> were coming to her for <i>help</i>?  The rational part of herself ran over the evidence.  Either this was a 1-in-1,000,000 event...or this was a trap.<br>\r\n\"...I dunno,\" Nina cautiously answered. \"Who's to say I'd be the best tutor for you?  You could still end up failing, even with my help.  Besides, I've never tutored anyone before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina gritted her teeth inside her mouth.  <i>'TAKE IT ALREADY!'</i><br>\r\n\"If we don't do anything, we'll fail for sure.  Please, at least give it a try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina bore a look of uncertainty.  Sandrina, having frustrated all her resources, pulled out her trump card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look...if you agree to help us, then...w-we'll not tease you f-for the rest of the week.  A-and if it works, and we get good grades, then we'll not tease you for the month.  How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you're not exactly selling me on this,\" Nina replied, not too eager to lose her daily compliments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that Hannah buckled.  \"Look, what do you want from us, free food?\"<br>\r\nThat stopped both of them.  Sandrina was almost about to pull Hannah away to chastise her, when Nina suddenly spoke.<br>\r\n\"...free food?\"<br>\r\nSandrina was momentarily stunned, but ran with it. \"If you help us, we'll give you our lunches here at school, and I'll have my mom buy you some fried chicken.  Do we have a deal?\"</span></div></div>",

She stuck out a chubby hand to shake.  \"Deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina shook the fat-fingered hand, disgusted on the inside but glad that her ruse had worked.  \"Wonderful!  Tha-...th-thank you, Nina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina nodded.  \"So what time would be good for you?  I'm free all week; do you wanna meet up after school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...h-how about you come over to my house after school today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\", Nina replied happily, digging into her lunch again.  \"I'll ask mom when she picks me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, sounds good.  We'll talk more later,\" Sandrina replied, getting up and dragging Hannah away with her.  Nina's rational mind instantly pointed out how foolish she had been, but she paused upon noticing that Hannah and Sandrina had left their lunches...just as they said they would...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn private, Sandrina growled to Hannah as quiet as she could.  <i>\"WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, SAYING THAT?!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah froze in place.  \"Sh-she went for it, didn't she?  She's a pig, food's the only thing she'd go for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You almost blew our cover with that!  You're lucky I was here to sweet-talk her into accepting that deal.  If I hadn't been there, she'd have called us out, and we'd have to start all over again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah dipped her head in shame.  Sandrina forced herself to relax, and started again.  \"Still...we got lucky that she went for it.  Now we'll have Nina in a place we can get her food more easily, and this plan'll go smoother and quicker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<b>Later...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina felt uneasy.  While Sandrina and Hannah had both demonstrated unusual clarity and, dare she say, enthusiasm for being tutored, she couldn't help but be wary.  She <i>was</i>, after all, traveling into the heart of enemy territory alone with no backup.  Even if it was under peaceful pretenses, if something were to happen, she'd be completely isolated until her parents returned to pick her up.<br>\r\nOn the plus side, the lure of free food plus the fact that she hadn't eaten since leaving school was making her eager to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Nina's rational fears and stomach's desires were satisfied, as they stopped in front of Sandrina's house.  A mid-sized 2-story house lay before them, with Sandrina on the steps waving her arms in the air.  Nina's mother helped her out of the car, ensured her daughter had the phone ready, and then drove off, leaving Nina alone to enter the bully's home...</span></div></div>",

She blushed and let out an awkward laugh.  \"Eheh...s-sorry, I usually have dinner around this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah got a smile on her face, while Sandrina kept things cordial.  \"It's fine; my brother is getting some food at KFC, so he should be back in a few minutes. In the meantime, you can start helping us get better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.  Alright, let's get some pencils and paper, then we can get to work on this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three took refuge in the dining room.  Despite her \"mean girl\" appearance, Sandrina's home life was very...ordinary.  She had one brother, two parents, and a sister who apparently lived out of town and never visited them.  While she was a bully at school, at home she was...polite, if nothing else.  She never once teased her or called her names, like she would normally do in school.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they practiced reading, writing, and spelling, Sandrina spoke up.<br>\r\n\"Nina, how do you know so much?  You're the same age as us, but you're so far ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina paused, contemplating the question.  \"...I'm not entirely sure.  I suppose it's just because I liked reading, so I had more practice.  Since I read more, I got used to the words faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So because you read more books, you can spell easier?\", Hannah clarified, still somewhat unconvinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the best explanation I could see.  The more you expose yourself to the words, the easier it gets to understand them.  I started with basic children's books, then moved on to actual books with no pictures, and now I'm reading grown-up books.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that book you read!  The Prisoner of Abbadon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina's head hit the desk as she held her giggling in as much as she could.  She didn't do a very good job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Az-ka-ban, Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three practiced until another half-hour had passed, when Nina was surprised to see Sandrina's brother \u2013 the boy from the cafeteria \u2013 walking in with five buckets of fried chicken.  Nina was shocked.  The same guy here was giving her extra yummy food...twice in the same day.<br>\r\nHe placed the buckets on the table in a row. Hannah and Sandrina both took a bucket at the end; they knew the other buckets were meant for Nina, and had been specially buttered up for her.  Nina tentatively grabbed one of the buckets and started eating; she had never eaten <i>in front</i> of strangers before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they resumed the lesson, Sandrina noticed Nina eating a bit slower than she normally did in school.  \"You don't have to be shy about it,\" she replied.  \"Like I said, we won't be teasing you for it.  If you're hungry, then eat.\"   Nina nodded, and quickened her pace as they practiced.  In a few minutes, to everyone's surprise, she had cleaned out the entire bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a pig.\" Hannah whispered a little louder than intended, making the target uneasy.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I was hungry...\" Nina replied apologetically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina elbowed Hannah, glaring at her.  Hannah took the cue, and added a quick \"sorry\".  <br>\r\n\"It's ok, Nina,\" Sandrina comfortingly assured her.  \"She's just not used to the whole 'business' part of this arrangement.  The other three buckets there are also for you, if you want... You don't have to feel ashamed for being hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina still felt unsure; while Hannah had momentarily lapsed back into the bully mindset she typically associated with them, Sandrina seemed to be acting more cordial and respectable.  Her stomach begging to be filled, yet her rationality keeping her cautious, she opted to trust Sandrina, and resumed her eating while the tutoring proceeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah and Sandrina continued following Nina's directions, writing out the words, pronouncing them, and using them in sentences.  All the while, Nina was kept well-fed; after the chicken was gone, she was given specially-prepared hot dogs and ice cream.  All of which ended up inside her growing belly.  After another hour of tutoring and stuffing herself, Nina leaned back in her chair, a tender hand placed on her gut.  A soft moan escaped her lips, drawing some concern from Sandrina and Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right?\" Sandrina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...ooh...I think I ate a bit too much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina got up to look over the results.  Nina's belly had almost doubled in circumference; her clothes, which had been fairly loose when she arrived, were now snugly fitting against her body, albeit her belly did poke out from below her shirt a bit.  Her pants were struggling to keep her thick thighs contained, and her belt had all but given up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina smiled.  \"I think that'll probably be enough for the night.  Here, let me get your phone, if you wanna call for your parents.\"  She procured Nina's cell phone from her bag, and held it out to Nina.  Nina weakly nodded, and took the phone, as Sandrina dragged Hannah away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey!\"</i> Hannah quietly protested.  <i>\"This is going great!  She's blowing up like a balloon!  Why are we stopping now?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We've fed her enough for today,\"</i> Sandrina explained, <i>\"if we try to feed her more, she'll either throw up or get suspicious.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\"<br>\r\n\"We have to play this safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah nodded, and the two eventually returned to watch over Nina as her father came to pick her up.  They watched her, weakened and trapped in her seat by her weight...stuffed like a pig...her belly begging to be touche\u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'\u2013Woah, where did THAT thought come from,\"</i> Sandrina stopped herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<b>The Next Day...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sandrina and Hannah walked to class, they found themselves greeting a slightly plumper Nina in the reading corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Nina,\" Sandrina calmly greeted.  To her surprise, though, Nina replied a bit bashfully.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sandrina...uh, sorry for eating all your food yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina was shocked; this was not how Nina usually responded when they greeted her.  Had her plan made such a difference so soon?<br>\r\n\"It's fine, that was the deal.  Same time tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina nodded, and added, \"Oh, and if you want to keep teasing me, that's fine.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A full week had passed, and Nina was caught off guard as she entered the reading corner.  There, where she normally sat, was a bucket of chicken.  There was even a note on the bucket noting it was specifically for her; someone had apparently left her a present.<br>\r\nNina contemplated for a moment who would leave her this extra gift, during school no less.  Logically, it must have been from someone who wished to not be known, whether by her or others.  Without further evidence, she opted to not flog a gift horse in the mouth, and moved the bucket next to the bean bag chair.  There, she took her seat, opened the bucket, and began devouring a drumstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bullies' plot to fatten her up had been a resounding success' over the course of the past three days, an extra 15 pounds had <i>somehow</i> found their way onto Nina's frame.  Not that she minded, of course; to Nina, every extra pound she acquired was just another bit of her body to love.  Even if she was wearing clothes that would've fit better on 12-year olds, she continued her usual pattern of eating as she pleased.<br>\r\nThe chicken slid down her thirst, lightly coating her lips in buttery grease.  She licked her lips in an attempt to clean them off, and was about to start on a second piece when someone interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened to lunchtime, Nina?\", Mrs. McCoy asked Nina, who froze in embarrassment.  <br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry, ma'am,\" she apologized. \"I found this in my seat, along with a little note that said it was a present for me. I was going to save it for later, but...\"  <br>\r\nAs if on cue, a soft growl from her stomach betrayed her hungry motives.  <br>\r\nMrs. McCoy smiled and patted Nina's head. \"Ok, you can eat it. But next time, I would suggest you ask me before you dig in.\"  <br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am, Mrs. McCoy! Sorry again,\" Nina said politely, and returned to eating her chicken, while finishing up the 3rd Harry Potter book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina had arrived a little late, but made it in time to avoid missing any crucial bits of the lesson. After the lecture, Hannah greeted her superior. \"Sandrina, where were you?  I thought you said we were going to plan out our next move for the weekend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I had forgotten my homework at home,\" Sandrina replied.  \"But yes, I had an idea about how to handl\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Wait,\" Hannah interrupted, \"you...you actually completed the homework?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Sandrina was confused.  Then, registering what her friend had said, she answered.  \"Oh, yeah!  I know, right?  I actually managed to finish it this time!  But who knows if the grade'll be any different from usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah shook her head, as if clearing her head of distractions.  \"Aaaaaanyway, I snuck the chicken into school without anyone noticing, just like you said.  And Nina ate it all up before class began.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, she finished the whole bucket that fast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?  What a pig.\"  Hannah rolled her eyes in disgust.  \"So now what do we do?  We can't feed her over the weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Sandrina corrected, \"I have a plan about that.  We'll be able to keep her eating lots over the weekend, and all without anyone suspecting a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, how?\", Hannah asked, wide-eyed and curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sleepover?\", Nina questioned as she finished the last of her lunch and started on Sandrina's.  Once again, they had met up during lunch for a meeting, with Sandrina and Hannah opposite their tutor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's not like that, honest,\" Sandrina defended.  \"I was figuring it'd be a little more, um...like it would help us both out, uh...what's the word?\"<br>\r\n\"Beneficial?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that! I was figuring it would be be-ne-fi-cial for both of us.  You could tutor us over the weekend, and... maybe I could ask mom if she'd take us to a buffet, or maybe go to the movies or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina closed her eyes as she munched on her second lunch.  \"...ok then, I'll ask mum to drop me off tonight then?\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds good! Thanks again, Nina\", Sandrina politely replied.  The two then left Nina alone to finish her meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina closed her eyes, shaking her head slightly.  <i>'Yeah, they're up to something,'</i> Nina deduced.  <i>'Even if they were desperate, a sleepover would be the last thing they'd ask of me.'</i>  Nina pushed the last bit of Sandrina's lunch past her lips, stacking the empty tray atop hers.  <i>'No good letting them know I'm suspicious now, though,'</i> Nina mused as she began to dig into the 3rd tray of food. <i>'For the time being, let's proceed and see what they have planned...'</i></span></div></div>",

You can just go and make a sister or brother for me. All right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom blushed and drove away while Nina walked too Sandrina's house. It did feel a bit strange. The two mean girls who always teased her at school asked for her help and she said yes. Well the food tasted great. Nina felt her belly that felt bigger. Strange she could't have eaten that much. She lifted her shoulders and knocked on the door. This Time Sandrina's mother opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah you must be Nina. Sandrina said you would come. Seems like you have a healthy appetite. It's so nice you want too tutor Sandrina and Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well eh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know they give you food in return but still i think it's very nice what you do. So in a half hour i take you three too an all you can eat buffet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina and Hannah walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're ready too study. Let's start.\" Sandrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls went sitting at the kitchen table and Sandrina's mother looked at them. Nina was hungryt but wanted too wait until they were at the all you can eat buffet . Hannah at the other hand could't wait to stuff Nina and hardly paid any attention to what Nina said while Sandrina listened interested too what Nina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's strange. Were does she worry about? Hannah thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right girls it's dinner time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls fast got up and walked too the car. Nina liked Sandrina's mother. he seemed a lot nicer then Sandrina. Of course when she was here Sandrina and Hannah did't act mean. Probably since else i could go and they really need that tutoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right girls get out.\" Sandrina's mother said while she stopped for an all you can buffet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina licked her lips. She knew already what she would take. An all you could eat buffet with chicken. She liked KFC the best but she also liked any other kind of chicken just not so much if KFC.<br>\r\nThe four of them walked inside. Hannah looked over at Nina<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood that fat pig seems really hungry. Maybe she puts them out of business. Let's see how much that fatso can eat. Just look at that gut. Soon it will be much bigger. Hannah thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took a seat and a menu card. Nina fast looked through the menu and already saw a all you can eat with chicken. She knew what too take and closed the menu and waited patient until Sandrina and Hanah were done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will it be Miss?\" A waiter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For me please the cow steak. What do you three want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want the deer steak with mushrooms.\" Sandrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take the all you can eat shrimp menu.\" Hannah said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina looked at her friend and asked on a whispering tone: \"An all you can eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just addicted too shrimps.\" Hannah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take The all you can eat chicken menu.\" Nina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they waited for the food Hannah tried to ask about Hannah's book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it with that prisoner of Azkaban?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that ended well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is actually that evil wizard? The he who must not be named. Who is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well almost no one dares to speak out his name. The mostly say: You know who, or the dark lord, or lord of the darkness, But.. his real name is... Voldemort.\"   <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Is he also in Azkaban?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. But Azkaban is full with his henchmen.. When he tried to kill Harry his power turned back and destroyed him while Harry got off with just a scare in the form of a lightning bolt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah now knew for sure she was gonna read that book once. But she thought for now it was a bit difficult for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Nina, i think Harry Potter is a bit difficult for us. Do you know some easier books for us?\" Sandrina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust at that moment the food arrived.    </span></div></div>",

Sandrina realized that when she was full, Nina was FULL.  So she pulled her hand off Nina's stomach, and got ready to go to the car.  Slowly, Nina stood up, groaning from all the food and soda inside her, trying to fit snugly in her tummy.  She had to waddle, with Sandrina and Hannah helping support her so she wouldn't collapse, all the way to the car.  When she got there, Sandrina helped her in the back seat.  Fortunately, there was plenty of room in the car, and Nina could lay down, rubbing her belly all the way to the house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got there...</span></div></div>",

Her belly hurt but it also felt good in one way. Feeling so stuffed. But she felt too stuffed too move.<br>\r\nSandrina's mother was also amazed about how much the kid had eaten. She had eaten 10 full size chicken meals. More then any normal adult could eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done?\" She asked Nina friendly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*burp* Excuse me.

I think i never before saw a kid eat that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Nina said and let out a little belch followed by an: \"Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina's mother fast drove home. hen they arrived Nina was able too waddle on her own. <br>\r\nThe three girls fast went upstairs to brush their teeth. In the meantime Sandrina's mother put two extra mattresses in Sandrina's room and some blankets so the kids could sleep in the same room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe how much that kid eats. She might be one of the best students but she has also one of the best appetites i've ever seen. Well that's not so strange if you see how fat she is. I sure hope that her tutoring helps Sandrina. Her grades seems too be only going down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina and Hannah put on their nighties. Nina wore some pyjama's. Her big belly poked out. She suddenly remembered her mother told her they would  go shopping but they both forget when she told her mother about the tutoring, and now with all the food inside her belly her old pyjama's really were much too small.<br>\r\nSandrina and Hannah looked interested at Nina's huge belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going too be good.\" Hannah whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them went too Sandrina's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh men i'm so tired.\" Nina mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your belly needs to deal with all that food.\" Sandrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina slapped her belly. Hard and tight like a drum. But she knew that would soon change. After a good night sleep her belly would become soft again and all the fat would be spread over her body. With a grin she fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the night she woke up. It took her a few seconds too notice were she was. She before of course never thought she would ever sleep over at Sandrina's house. She curled up ready to fell asleep again when she heard a mumbling sound. She went sitting up straight and listened. Sandrina mumbled a bit in her sleep. Nina remembered some people talked in their sleep. She wondered what she said. and listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we feed her. We'll fatten her up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Nina put up big eyes. This sounder interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll fatten up Nina so we can tease her when she's really fat. We gonna make her so fat. We will fatten her up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina turned and stopped talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why they asked me too tutor them. Funny. The want to harm me but instead they did me a favor. I want to be fattened up. Poor Sandrina. Poor Hannah. Their plan is't gonna work. I like it they wanted to fatten me up. Well of course it explains all that food i got. Of course. Her brother works with the school lunches no wonder i got more. And i bet they made it extra greasy. That was pretty smart Sandrina, thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina started too think what too do now. Nina tried to fatten her up but she liked it so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i want to become fatter so i will stay tutor them. Then i can get fatter and they maybe finally get a good grade. everyone wins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she knew the plan of both girls she fell asleep with a smile.          </span></div></div>",

It was a huge amount. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do some guests come over?\" Nina asked looking at all the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. This is all for you. Our way too say thank you for tutoring us. Besides if you gonna teach us the whole day you must have enough strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina grinned. They obviously tried to fatten her up with all this food. Keep her strength up. If she tutored them she was only sitting on her butt. Don't need much strength for that. But it was funny too see how hard they tried. But when she took another look at the food she started to doubt if she could eat it all. It was a lot of food. Even if she was some kind of living garbage bin but this was a lot of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want you to eat this all. I mean we promised you a lot of food if you would tutor us. So here is the food. Eat it all and then tutor us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina took one look at the food. It was all fatty food. So obvious. Did they really thought she was that stupid. Almost sad. She grinned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right i'll try to eat it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina loved eating and gaining so why not give her best. She looked at the food decided what too take first. She saw a few cheeseburgers and took them and ripped pieces of them like a wild animal. After the went too her belly she started to eat the hot dogs wit a lot of the mayonnaise filled with liquid lard what Nina did't knew of course.<br>\r\nShe wondered how long they were busy making all this food. They must already long have woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really eat's this all. She's such a fat pig.\" Hannah whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina pushed Hannah and hold a finger against her lips. Soon Nina would be so fat the whole class would tease her. Like when she needed too drag her belly over the floor. Yeah well if that would ever happen it would take a long time. But she would like to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina was still eating everything in sight. She was more hungry then she thought. knowing that all this food would make her fatter only made her happy. She devoured a whole plate of brownies and went on with the pie. Grabbing it with both hands, opening her mouth as wide if possible and cramming as much in her mouth if she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina walked a moment away from Nina's feast to get some papers and pencils for when Nina was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina enjoyed some more chicken nuggets and a stack of pancakes.

What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how much you fed her? She almost threw up! We want to fatten her, remember? If she throws up she loses all those calories. Then she never gains weight. So don't push her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. It's just that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes time for someone to fatten up. Don't worry. We have a few more years to fatten her up. Anyway until the end of elementary school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean if she stays at school. I doubt that. She's a lot smarter then the rest. I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina slowly nodded. It was true. Nina was very good at school. Except maybe gymnastics but who cares about those grades when you have good grades for everything else. Maybe she would skip some classes. She heard some people could do that. If anyone could do it it was Nina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine but we still have a whole year. Still even if she skips some classes we can still fatten her up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suppose she goes too another school. For smart kids. Then what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we can't tease her anyway. Can we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Yeah. That's true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But for now she says here so i will fatten her up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we prepare some more food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... Better not.\" Sandrina said doubting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? You want too fatten her right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but we said we would give her food if she would tutor us. If we give her food again without her tutoring us don't you think that's gonna be a bit suspicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we need again to let her tutor us. I hate it. It's useless writing words and rewrite them if there wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand but else she won't believe us. She's smart. we can give her a bag of pretzels while she's tutoring us but if she does't tutor us and does eat she knows we're trying something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina sighed. she put her elbows on the table and let her chin rest an her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can watch a movie tonight.

If you have a better grade that means it works. If not... well then at least you've tried.

Harry said disbelieving.<br>\r\nThe creature looked up and spread his fingers so two huge brown eyes got visible and a noise that looked as regards too shape and size like a substantial tomato.\" She stopped reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\" Sandrina asked still with her eyes closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you have any imagination you could shape those words too an image.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not good in that...

Dinner's ready!\"  Nina was now hungry again; her breakfast had digested, and now she had plenty of room.  She and the others got up and went to go eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina eagerly dove into the chicken and buttery foods. She ate like it would disappear if she didn't!  With each bite, she could feel herself growing bigger. After the first and 2nd courses, Nina was easily twice as large as she was when she first began tutoring them. Her belly now had an actual fat roll, and her tighs and arms were softened as well as fattened.  After she had eaten all the leftovers, she asked for MORE! Sandrina was surprised.<br>\r\nWhat they didn't know was that Nina was pushing herself to cram in more and more; she wanted to convince them she was really hungry, so that they'd try having her eat more than usual. She was, after all, only a child, so she didn't have enough strength to eat more than she could handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Nina leaned back, her hands on her pillow-sized stomach. \"Oh em gee!,\" Sandrina said in amazement. \"I had no idea anyone could eat that much!\" Nina looked at her, one eyebrow cocked up in fake suspicion. Sandrina quickly covered her mouth, realising what she just said could've tipped off Nina to her plan. \"Um...that is...i mean, um...\", she tried covering.  But Nina laughed, clutching her bloated belly. \"It's ok, just kidding. It surprises all.\"<br>\r\nSandrina sighed, relieved her cover wasn't blown. She was scared what Nina might do if she found out. 'she could squish me, if I'm not careful', she thought. 'And she's big enough to!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, Nina, Sandrina, and Hannah went into Sandrina's room.

After that she poured the rest of the entire bottle over Nina's popcorn along with a normal portion of salt. Salt would't fatten her up and if it was too salt she would't eat it.  <br>\r\nSandrina took three glass and a bottle of cola and the DVD and Hannah took the three bowls of popcorn up too Sandrina's room where Nina was still reading. <br>\r\nSandrina put the DVD in the DVD player Hannah gave everyone their glass of Cola and a bowl of popcorn ans a minute later they were all three watching.

She looked around; Sandrina and Hannah were still fast asleep. Nina thought, and decided to try something different.  Today was Sunday, last day of the sleepover.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina quietly managed to stand, and noted how much heavier she had gotten - she must've put on another 10-15 lbs from last night. She was still mobile, for now.<br>\r\nQuietly, she walked downstairs into the kitchen. She saw the bottles, and knew they had buttered her popcorn up.  But unfortunately, they'd used it all up, so she'd have to use solid butter.  She got some ingredients from the pantry, and turned on the stove.  She was making breakfast.<br>\r\n\"They've been cooking breakfast for me since I came,\" Nina thought. \"What would they do if I cooked? That'll be interesting.  Besides, they've worked so hard fattening me up; it'll be nice to treat them to a little 'thank-you'!\"<br>\r\nNina made a full breakfast - little sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs (buttered and salted), and pancakes with syrup and butter -, enough for everyone. Just in case, she cooked a lot extra, in case she got hungry.<br>\r\nNina remembered that breakfast was a very high-calorie meal, since it was meant to provide fuel for most of the day.  As a result, breakfast food was much fattier than normal foods. Nina also knew that one reason people gain is because people don't always use all the calories they take in.  And so, she concluded, one way to get fat is by eating a large breakfast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, everything was prepared. Now Nina wondered just how Sandrina and Hannah would react to this; naturally, they'd be surprised, but what else?<br>\r\n\"Perhaps they'd get frustrated that I beat 'em to it,\" Nina pondered. \"Then again, they might try to secretly make my portion more fattening than it already is.  Or maybe they'll be so surprised and caught off-guard, they won't know what to do!  Well, whatever happens, I'll have to wait and see.\"<br>\r\nNina heard footsteps; they were coming.

But at the other hand both were very hungry and all the food looked very good. Maybe just a bit of everything. Besides they were both slender. One time would't change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother learned me too make those things.\" Nina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Nina finally convinced her mother she really wanted to gain her mother decided it would be better to learn her a bit how too cook. Better that then that she would try too cook without any experience and mould set the kitchen on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina just took a bit of everything. She did't want to eat too much. At least not of this greasy stuff. She wanted to keep her slender body. She looked at Nina who friendly looked back. Just one moment she thought Nina might wanna fatten her up as payback but Nina could't know that she and Hannah tried too fatten her up... could she?<br>\r\nShe took one small bite and her eyes flew open. This tasted really good. It was very good. If her mother cooked like this for her it was't strange Nina was so fat.<br>\r\nSandrina had trouble too not take any more but years denying herself fatty food just too stay slender gave her a strong will. Hannah also liked Nina's cooking but also tried to take not too much. <br>\r\nNina of course did't mind about this. How fattier how better. She started to eat everything Sandrina and Hannah did't eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your mother learned you how too cook?\" Sandrina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Sometimes i make my own breakfast.\" Nina said with full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina saw how some grease dripped from Nina's chin. Her finger caught it and she licked it. Don't even spill a drop. <br>\r\nNina made sure that she ate all the food the others did't eat till the last crumb was gone. Too her own surprise she was able too finish it all. But thinking about how much she had eaten yesterday and the day before yesterday she understood how it was possible.<br>\r\nAfter breakfast Nina put everything in the dishwasher.

Then, she and her mom got in the car and drove away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the car, Nina got hungry. So they stopped midway at Burger King for a small salad, a Triple cheese Whopper, Chicken and french fries, and an extra-large soda. (No doubt who got what.)<br>\r\nWhile they ate, Nina's mom spoke up. \"Honey, we need to talk.\", she said.

She expected her mom would get pregnant sooner or later but still now she heard it she was surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally. I thought i would never get a sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could also be a brother.\" Her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know what it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No honey. I don't know yet what it is. We know it when it's born. Before that we can only guess. Well there is a test where you can see if it's a boy or a girl but that's not 100%. Even if we do that test the baby must be a few months old but we think it's better too let it be a surprise. So we know it over nine months. If everything goes all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom can't you decide if you want to get a boy or a girl. You know... all that genetic stuff. Could't you decide that it's gonna be a boy or a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that's still something we can't do yet. Well even if we could i would't have done it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we can make a bomb that can kill hundreds of innocent people but we can make something that can't decide or someone get's a boy or a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i know. But anyway soon you're gonna be the big sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm gonna be a really big, big sister, and with big i mean fat! Nina thought. But staying mobile could become a problem. For one way she wanted too become so fat she would become immobile but as long if she had no one to care about her it could become a problem. Of course there were her parents but Nina was aware they would't be always stay here. Once they would die. She knew that. What would happen then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nina i want you too be a nice big sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will mommy, i will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up Nina i know you now think you will be but know that little brothers or sisters can be annoying sometimes. Especially in the start the baby needs a lot of care so we can't always help you. Sometimes the baby could bite you or hurt you not on purpose maybe but no matter what happens you're a lot older then him or her so you should know the best. With the baby you also need too share. That might be hard for you since you never needed too share.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina thought about what her mother said. Being an only child she was everything for her parents and did't have too share. That would become different now. But she thought she would be able too make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do my best mommy. I hope it's a sister, and you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i don't care or if it's a boy or a girl as long if it's healthy. Of course i would like it to know how it's too raise a boy. But another girl would be also nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well mom maybe you can. Maybe you get a twin! A boy and a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well honey i don't think i have that much luck. But who knows. But still that baby or babies need to grow and get born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina finished the last part of her lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure were hungry. Did't you had breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... i did. But after that i tutored them aaaand i have't eaten since then.\"     <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"I'm so glad that  you tutor some other girls. You're so smart and now you can help others with it. We're still thinking about sending you too a special school. But for now we first worry about this little person.\" She said and patter her belly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNina squinted with one of her eyes. She wondered or compared too height and size of her mother her mothers belly would be bigger then hers after nine months pregnancy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nina ate 2 of the 5 buckets of chicken her dad bought; he was excited about the new baby, too, and had decided to throw a small celebration with a bunch of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, as her parents tucked her in and went to bed, Nina pondered about the past weekend's events.

I heard about people who are hungry like a horse but looks like you ate the horse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you step on a scale it shouted:\"People one at a time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike every day Nina enjoyed the teasing without showing it. Just acting like she did't cared at all. But she noticed she missed someone important. Sandrina was no where too be heard. Then she saw her standing next too Hannah. While she was normally bully number one today she seemed to be too busy too tease her. She was looking at the pages of Nina's tutoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you watching at those stupid things?\" Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoping to learn something. The teacher called yesterday about my grades. My dad was very angry. I need to get at least a C- or it's no T.V, Internet,music and no asking friends over for two whole weeks. Well except maybe Nina because she's tutoring me. I sure hope her lessons worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first lessons at school went on like normal. The Mrs. McCoy handed every one a paper for the test. She started and Nina fast wrote the first word down. She then looked at Sandrina. There was something new at her. Normally she seemed very stressed while doing a test. Now she seemed a lot more relaxed. Like she worried less. It went on like that the whole test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right that was it. Hand in your dictations and then you can do something for yourself.\" Mrs McCoy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina looked for a quiet spot to read her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna do something Sandrina?\" Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks i'm busy reading a book.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reading a book? You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i started in one yesterday after you left. It's pretty cool. It's about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care.Talk too me when you act normal again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina lifted her shoulders and walked over with her book next too Nina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can i sit here?\" She asked and pointed too the empty space next too Nina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina looked up and said: \"Sure. No one else is sitting here.\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later it was recess. But when Sandrina ran too the door Mrs. McCoy hold her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandrina. Can i talk with you for a moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina heard this and decided too also stay. After all the others were gone Mrs. McCoy saw Nina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nina can you go? I wanna have a talk with Sandrina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's about the grade for her test I think i also need to hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. McCoy looked at Sandrina who nodded and then she thought why not. Nina was't someone who would tell the whole play ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandrina. You have... a B-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina looked up at her test and took it and hold it tight to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going from the lowest grade too a B-  is a big step. How did you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tutored her!\" Nina said loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well then you did a good job Nina. I think you might thank her Sandrina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Nina !\" Sandrina shouted and she really mend it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls walked out. Sandrina had a problem. She always teased Nina and Nina now helped her too get a B-. Only because she wanted too fatten Nina up too tease her more. She felt bad about this. Suddenly she understand that what she felt for Nina was friendship. She looked at the fat girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Well he can keep making my food more greasy. I love it to be fat and becoming fatter and i thought it tasted better anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear that. But what do we do with Hannah. She did't seem too happy that i was playing with your fat. Not that i did't enjoyed it. Maybe we should tell her you love being fat. I mean since i'm not gonna fatten you up without you knowing and wanting it. But Hannah... i mean... i now know you like it but... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I think we should tell Hannah. That and that we're friends now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is't gonna like that. Oh well. That's her problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment they heard the school bell and the other kids came in for lunch. <br>\r\nNina and Sandrina were first in line and Sandrina's brother made sure Nina's lunch was greasy and a lot. They waited until Hannah was done and went sitting on the same table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Hannah.\" Sandrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Hannah asked looking angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Nina and i... We're friends now!\" Sandrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of Hannah's lunch went down the wrong way and she started to cough. When she got herself under control she looked angry at Nina and Sandrina in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really.\" She said with an evil grin. \"Did she also tell you we were fattening you up. We gave you all the food so you would fatten up nice and then we and others could tease you even more how fat you are. Did you friend told you that too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she did.\" Nina said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And guess what she does't mind. All this time we got it all wrong. Nina likes it to be fat and become fatter. She likes it to be fattened up. All this time we teased her by saying how fat she was and calling her names she enjoyed it. So even if you want to hurt her by fattening her up you're doing her a favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You expect me too believe that? Telling me you like it too be fat just so that i stop. You must be ridiculous if you thought that i believed that. That Sandrina is such a wimp she even likes you does't want too say i do. I will get you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't you got a good grade?\" Sandrina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know yet and i does't matter if i have a F- or a A+. Got it. I still don't like you two what ever grade you helped me too got! Get it. Now i want to eat somewhere alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngry she walked away leaving Sandrina and Nina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought she took that pretty well.\"Nina said and giggled together with Sandrina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanna looked angry at the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... So you like it too be fat. Like if i believe that. Good i will play along. I'm gonna thank you for tutoring me. I will thank you very good you like it to be fat and become fatter. I will make you fatter.\" She said on a whispering tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly a very evil plan started to come up in the head of the little girl. A wicked mean and evil plan.    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have up to two hours to eat as many whole cooked chickens as possible. You have to eat all the meat you can reach, ok?  Once you've finished one, then anotnher will be given.  You're allowed a short break after the first hour, and you can have as much soda as you like to wash it down.  But remember - if at any time you throw up, or if you choose to give up, you'll lose the challenge, and you'll have to pay for your meal.  If you can beat our record though, you'll get $2,000 in cash, a free laptop, AND your name on our winners board!\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds delicious,\" Nina said, making everyone laugh out loud. \"So what's the previous record?\"<br>\r\n\"Our current record is three chickens.

A big room full of chairs, tables, desks, old books and comics and hundreds kinds of strange stuff. On the desk was even a hand grenade.<br>\r\nBut Hannah took her too another room. There was a bed and a few books and even a small T.V. on a small table There was also a mirror a closet, a fire place and a few chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here feel this bed. It's very comfy.\" Hannah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina was glad she could lay a bit since she was still so stuffed. She lay down and closed her eyes. Hannah touched her arms. Suddenly she heard a click. Then she noticed she was stuck. Hannah handcuffed her too some pipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you think? My uncle works with the police. I could get some handcuffs. Don't try too scream. I won't do you any good. No one can hear you. Even if they do my mother is too scared too come up here.

I made it from milk, sugar, butter, and melted ice cream!\" She grabbed a big cup, filled it with the shake, and poured it into Nina's mouth.

She heard a: 'Bang' sound when Hannah threw the empty container too a corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait. This is't over. This was just an appetizer. You like it too be fat. Well you gonna like it here a lot. Since i make sure you get very fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah left and closed the door. Not that it was of any use since Nina's hands were still handcuffed too the bed At least she locked one of her hands right and the other left. She was thankful for that or else she needed to lie on her side the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well so Hannah is gonna fatten me up. Well she does her best. I hope it works since i want too become fat so i hope she fattens me up really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange. It's not so bad here. Books, Even a T.V. and hee a mirror. Nice of you Hannah now i can see how much i grow. But it's strange. If you want to keep someone captured then why give her a T.V and books. Probably this is a guest room or Hannah is't so bad like she wants everyone too think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yawned. She was kind of sleepy after eating so much. She wondered of Hannah would come back soon. She decided to sleep a bit so her food got digested. It could take some time before Hannah came back. She could't move her hands much but a bit of pulling and some help of her feet she was able to get a blanket over her fat body. It was't so bad here. <br>\r\nThe only thing she did't like were the handcuffs. She could hardly move her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Those things came from her uncle. A police man. They are made so the gangster's or thief's can't move much. Maybe if i see Hannah the next time i can ask her to take away the handcuffs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes. Felt how stuffed her belly was. Took with the mirror another look at her huge belly. <br>\r\nShe did't mind Hannah fattening her up. But she worried a bit if she would maybe become immobile when she would came out of here. Would she come ever out of here? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did her remind of a book she once read. Flowers in the attic. About four kids. When their dad dies their mother takes them too her parents. Her parents did't liked it that she married that man since it was her half-uncle. So her parents hated her. Their grandmother knows they come and she locks the children in the attic. Their mother promises that it's only for a few days until her dad will love her again. Her dad starts to love her again but he does't seem to know he has grandchildren. He says the only good thing about the relation between her and his half-brother that they never had kids. Those kids need to stay hidden until grandfather dies. Those days became weeks. Those weeks became months. Those months became years. Those kids stayed there for three years, four months and sixteen days. Until they finally escaped. Three of them. Since one of them died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that's what's gonna happen too me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose kids got each day a picnic basket white food. Always cold food. She reminded that the cheeseburgers were kind of warm so she would have warm food too and a lot of food. Not like those children. While she thought about this she slowly fell asleep. Dreaming of food and become fatter  <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Her tried to rub in her eyes but her hands were still handcuffed too the bed. She looked at Hannah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Hannah... listen... about this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will make you fat. You like that? Right? You said you liked that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i do! I wish that tiny brain of you finally understood that! I was just wondering... could you lose the handcuffs. I don't like it that i can't move. I mean it's not like i can leave the room so... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. Since the door of the room is locked and the door at the end of the stair i guess i could do that but don't try anything smart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the cease and unlocked the handcuffs. Nina rubbed over her wrists a few times. The she looked at Hannah. She had a wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what i have here. A bag of liquid fat. Do you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know. I never tasted it. But you know what they say you need to try everything once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah angry put a funnel in Nina's mouth. and poured the stuff in Nina's mouth. Nina swallowed it and liked the taste. Fast she start swallowing and started too suck at the end of the funnel. She felt how the lard went down her throat and liked it. She loved the taste. Liquid lard was fattening of course. She could almost feel her belly expand.<br>\r\nFinally the bag was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you full little Piggy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No i'm not. More food. I want more food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah went out and closed the door and walked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that fat pig is still hungry. Just wait til she's so fat she can't move.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard the door bell. She walked over too the door and opened it. A man was standing in the doorway<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. You must be Hannah. I'm the father of Nina. Is she still here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah put on a worried smile. She was a pretty good actor. A way too always get out of trouble. Well almost always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did't she get home? She left a few hours ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On her own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! My dad would take her. He would come near your house when he went too work. I guess he dropped her there off. about the beginning of your street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's about 100 meter from our house. She has walked home from there so many times. What could have happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know but like i said she left a few hours ago. I'm sorry but i can't help you. I knew for sure my dad dropped her off. My dad is very responsible.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Nina's father left. For some reason Hannah did't felt bad. Why should she? It was all Nina's fault!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took two boxes of Donuts and took them upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey fatso here are two boxes of donuts. How does that sound?\"     <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"That sounds delicious.\" Nina said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sitting in a chair. She opened her mouth and Hannah started to stuff donut's in the tiny mouth of the fat girl. After the last was gone Nina's pans button was suddenly blown off and her belly flowed out like a river. Her zipper was pushed all the way down. Hanna felt a lot better. However her shirt was also tight. <br>\r\nHannah kept stuffing burgers in Nina's mouth. <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

She did't have too move. She got more then enough food and there were books and there was also a T.V. She wondered why. It was't out of the kindness of Hannah's hart. Probably to keep her distracted or else Nina would get so bored she would look for a plan too escape. Hannah knew Nina was pretty smart. Maybe even smart enough too find a way too escape. <br>\r\nNina Noticed the plates filled with fatty goodies on the table. Probably made extra fattening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like i like them.\" Nina said and carried the plates one by one over too the T.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she turned the T.V on until she found some fun cartoons too watch and during that eat the fatty goodies enjoying them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Sandrina. We're glad you got a B-  but that does't wanted too say that everything is fine now. You need to keep doing your best!\" Sandrina's mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will mom. But i think i know a lot more words now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway keep doing your best, else ask Nina if she wants too tutor you some more. I'm sure i can get some food for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will ask her.\" Sandrina said kissed her mom and got out of the car and walked too the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did knew a lot more words. She did read some books. Maybe Harry Potter was a bit too difficult for her but she could read some easy kid books with not too much difficult words<br>\r\nShe looked around were Nina was. Hannah did't wanted to hang out with her and if she need to be honest she did't want anymore too. She got a  bit worried when she did't saw Nina.<br>\r\nWorried she walked in the classroom. While the others walked in she walked too Mrs. McCoy and asked her where Nina was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will tell you all.\" She whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina walked worried back. Mrs. McCoy seemed so worried. Sandrina walked to her seat and looked at Nina's empty seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh listen up everyone. Something bad has happened. Nina disappeared yesterday. We don't know what happened to her or why. We want to ask everyone who might know something to tell us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina remembered Nina went over too Hannah. She looked over too her and saw her mean smile.  She knew for sure Hannah had something too do with it. She would found out too. But how.<br>\r\nhe snapped her fingers. Hannah used to be her best friend. She knew after Monday she had ballet practice. Not because she wanted but her mother wanted her too. Her brother had soccer practice. Her big sisters maybe were home but ignored her. Their mother normally went shopping until it was time too pick them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough time to take a look inside.\"She said so soft no one heard it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew where they left the key. She wanted to help her best friend and besides that she could use some extra tutoring.<br>\r\nShe knew going in someones home was a crime but holding someone against their will was a way bigger crime. Besides she was under aged. She would't be punished that much. She also was't planning to steal anything so it would be that much trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why Hannah why did you kidnapped her?\" Sandrina asked herself.<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

You're safe!\" Her mother yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents both hugged her so tight Nina almost could't breathe. Her parents seemed to be so glad she was safe and sound they did't even mind how much heavier she had gotten. <br>\r\nSandrina looked at the parents who were so happy to have their daughter back. She felt happy by what she had done. Something good. She helped people. She liked the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandrina!

Hannah's parents were shocked when they saw that Nina really was at their attic. They never suspected Hannah would do anything like that. They started to apologize. <br>\r\nA few minutes later they were all in the living room drinking coffee or tea waiting until Hannah came home. It did't took long after a few minutes the heard the front door and Hannah's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello i'm home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into the living room. Saw her parents, hen the police and the Nina, Sandrina and Nina's parents and she knew she was in big trouble.

This is child abuse!\" Hannah screamed when they took her back in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina's mother looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" She asked. \"Why did you kidnapped her and what did you do too her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that lard ball never seemed to mind our teasing so Sandrina and i tried to fatten her up so she will be so fat we could tease her more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina's parents looked at Sandrina.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"I admit i did that. But i'm really sorry. Besides i confessed and i stopped.\" Sandrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she did't kidnapped or force feed me. She just gave me food that i liked too eat. But what you did...\" Nana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what. You turned Sandrina in just such a big loser like you who likes reading. Then you lied too me telling she liked being called fat so we would stop teasing her. Well if she liked being fat i decided i would make her fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does like it too be fat.\" Nina's mother said softly.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"Why did she else eat all the food we gave her even while she knew it was kind of fattening.\" Sandrina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's mouth fell open. She thought that Nina and Sandrina lied about Nina liked it to be fed so she would stop teasing. But She did't thought Nina's mother lied. She had done that fat pig a pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do i get this right young lady? You tease her and just because she did reacted you tried to fatten her up and when she told you she liked it you decided to kidnap her and fatten her up here?\" Her father yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And handcuffed her.\" Sandrina added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah could't remember ever seeing her parents that angry. She let her head hung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do i need to go too prison?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think she should!\" Nina said. \"If i remember right she can only go too prison if the victim, i believe that's me charge the person and i don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart girl.\" One of the police said. \"Besides she's under aged so we can't do much. But if you want to take my advice lock that kid in her room for the next twelve years. Oh and take away her handcuffs. I wonder how she get those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police walked out.<br>\r\nHannah's parents looked at Sandrina Nina and her parents.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry about what happened. We did't raised her like this and i hope you can forgive us. I can ensure you it will never happen again.\" Hannah's father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there's anything we can do for you tell us. But for now could you please leave we need too punish our daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah shivered.<br>\r\nSandrina, Nina and her parents drove too Sandrina's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandrina is there anything we can do too thank you for saving Nina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in a few days we have a dictation and i could use a little tutoring...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you first thing after school tomorrow!\" Nina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And i think that we can have some KFC tonight for dinner.\" Nina's father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yahoo.\" Nina cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina rubbed her belly. She did't told anyone but one of the reasons she did't charged Hannah because Hannah gave her what she wanted. A lot of fat on her body.<br>\r\nNina's parents first drove too Sandrina's home too drop her of and tell her parents what happened.

I want to get fatter but if i get too big... and whit my appetite i will keep gaining. I don'twant too be here all alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you would have people who took care of you? Then what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then i would't care becoming immobile. Then i don't need too walk anyway. See that was so easy by Hannah. She fed me. I don't needed to do anything. All that fattening what you and Hannah did speed up my gaining. Also taking me closer too immobility.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Well i could help take care of you.\" Sandrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Nina asked. \"You would do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i don't see why not. You're my friend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawled on Nina's bed Put her hands right and left from Nina's head. and looked at her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will help you.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment she let herself fall down on Nina's tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee this feels nice!\" Sandrina said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawled under Nina's blanket on her belly. Nina liked the feeling of someone on top of her belly. Sandrina liked the feeling of something so soft. She turned on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That body of you fells great. Besides... if you become immobile... I mean you're not gonna stop school. I mean you're the best in our class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Well i don't know. I mean i'm pretty smart. But the best of the class i don't know. I'm bad at gymnastics. No wonder when you're so fat if i am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the best at everything else. Nina. Believe me. You should't stop school. You're a genius. You could become famous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to stop school... But i i can't fit through the door anymore how am i suppose to get too school then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home school!\" Sandrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home school. I heard about that. Kids who get school at home. Maybe that's a possibility. But i don't know how that works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara does. She's my cousin. They also call her: The one armed bandit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do they call her that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She lost one arm in an accident. They could save her life but she lost her left arm except for about two inches. Well she had a bit trouble in the start. She got home schooled for a few months before she finally dared to go too back too school. She is now on a special school wit other kids that have problems but don't worry. She's now pretty used to this. She can even laugh about her nickname: The one armed bandit. Anyway she was home schooled for some time. She could help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do you see her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's no problem. She lives just a few houses further. We can walk from my house. But i will take care of you if you become that fat. Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Thanks.  Hmmm i wonder how  Hannah is doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh pretty bad. Her parents were furious. I never saw them that angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina crawled of Nina's belly and crawled back in her sleeping bag that felt a lot less better then Nina's belly. But both girls soon were asleep.</span></div></div>",

Nina's parents were off, so Nina was ok with her friend talking to her class.<br>\r\nAs Sandrina sat down and told some of the kids what happened, a most unusual sight greeted them. Hannah's mom walked inside, and spoke quietly with Mrs. McCoy. She was followed by Hannah, but she had a slight pot belly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina chuckled; who would've guessed Hannah would get bigger?  She walked over to the girl.<br>\r\nHannah's shirt was slightly tighter around her middle. Her skinny jeans were now cutting into her sides, and she was noticeably rounder.  But she still wore that same scowl.<br>\r\n\"What happened to YOU, Hannah?\", Sandrina asked, chuckling at the irony.<br>\r\n\"This is my punishment,\" she replied. \"Mum said if I was so eager to fatten up another kid, then I shouldn't mind getting fat myself. So she's making me eat more; right now, she's talking to the teacher about making me eat in class and at lunch.\"<br>\r\nAt this point, Sandrina couldn't hold it in. \"Omg!\", she cried out laughing. \"Out of all the people, who knew it'd be YOU who gets fatter?!\" At that point, all the kids were laughing at the now-plumper child who, for so long, made it her life goal to make fun of and pick on those who were fatter. Hannah looked to her mother, as if asking her to lift her punishment. Her mother replied with a look that could only be described as saying \"You get what you deserve\". Hannah grunted, and stomped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina finally composed herself. \"Wait 'till Nina hears this,\" she thought.</span></div></div>",

She smiled and Sandrina nodded too Hannah. Nina turned her head and when he saw Hannah she froze. She could't help it and started laughing. he need to hold herself up at the table. A lot of other kids were also laughing at Hannah so no one noticed one extra laughing kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see it Nina? Hannah's punishment is getting fat. She needs to become fat.\" Sandrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina looked at the belly Hannah started too show. She remembered all the liquid lard she was fed. Of course that stuff was really fattening. Who knows maybe her parents even did some weight gain stuff in her food. Anyway Hannah's parents were good at fattening up their daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right everyone take your seats.\" Mrs. McCoy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll kids took their seats but it took some time before all were done laughing. Mrs. McCoy let them laugh. She of course heard what happened and did't felt the smallest piece of regret for Hannah. Hannah totally deserved this.<br>\r\nShe just started the normal lessons.<br>\r\n During free time Nina and Sandrina finally had time to talk too each other. The both were in the reading corner what became their favorite spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told everyone what happened. However most were side tracked when they saw Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it. She doe look kind of good. Just wait till her feet get sore from carrying all that weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome other kids were teasing Hannah. No wonder she always teased other kids and now they finally had a chance to tease her back. She maybe was't fat yet but the others understood she would be soon. But it would take some time until she would reached Nina's size. Apart from the fact Nina was still gaining and did't planned to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what do we gonna do?\" Nina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Do you want to tease her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. That's not really my nature. But i don't know maybe we should... help her.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What? Nina did you lose your mind? Were talking about Hannah here yeah. Hannah who always teased you and called you names. Does that ring a bell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I liked those names remember. Besides you also used to tease me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right but i'm really sorry about that and i apologized. I don't think Hannah i ready too do that. Too be honest i think Hannah hates you now even more then before. I mean her fattening you up did't work. She did you a pleasure and thanks too your escape she now has a punishment that's in her eyes worse then that. Besides that calling names i now know you like that but you realized they were meant mean don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course i do... but still... Well she probably hates me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much will her parents fatten her up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know. Maybe too immobility. Or maybe until she reaches my size. Well in a short time that won't be a difference anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah looked a lot like a ball full of misery and if she had't been so mean before some of the kids would now feel sorry for her. Hannah liked it too tease but she never had been teased before. This was new for her and she did't liked it. How could her parents do this too her? Would they ever stop? Even if they did she need too lose all that extra weight she gained. She heard gaining weight was easy but losing a  lot harder. Especially when you're a toddler. She could cry.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

(Of course, she wasn't as huge as she thought; she was only slightly chubby.)  After two minutes of the abuse, and her pride and self-esteem crushed, she figured hiding inside was better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went inside, and sat away in a corner. Immediately, she heard voices, and looked to see Nina and Sandrina talking near the books. Hate and anger creeped into her, mostly from the memory of her backfiring plan. However, she decided to listen in; she always wondered why Nina preferred indoors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina and Nina were looking at a Star Wars book. It was a novel version of Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith.  Sandrina was snuggled up next to Nina, and reading over her shoulder. <br>\r\n\"So this is different from the movie?\", Sandrina asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. They go a little more in-depth into the characters here, and there's also some scenes that couldn't make it in the film.\", Nina replied.<br>\r\nThe two suuddenly noticed Hannah in the corner, who quickly turned away, pretending like she wasn't looking.  Sandrina turned to Nina and whispered, \"How come you were wanting to be nice to her, anyway?\"<br>\r\n\"I figure if we try to be nice, maybe she'll soften up, no pun intended. How can we expect her to change and be nicer if we don't try, too?\"<br>\r\n\"I would've thought that teasing'd work.\"<br>\r\n\"Teasing's just gonna hurt her. The only way we can help is if we forgive her and treat her like we want her to treat us.\"<br>\r\n\"Forgive her? After what she did to you?!\"<br>\r\n\"It's hard, I know. But if we don't let go of it, then she'll never get better.\"<br>\r\nSandrina thought a moment. Then she said, \"For a little girl, you're pretty wise.\"<br>\r\nNina shrugged; \"I've just had time to think.\" </span></div></div>",

How are you?\" Nina asked friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU!\" Hannah yelled with a face full of anger. \"HOW COULD YOU DO THIS? YOU DESTROYED MY LIFE, AND NOW YOU'RE ASKING HOW I AM. DO YOU WANNA HURT ME EVEN MORE? DO YOU REALLY GO TOO THE BONE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No. I just wanted...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT! YOU FAT LARD BALL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee Take it easy. I don't know if you noticed but no one outside likes you and they have a good reason too dislike you. Now inside you are screaming and being mean too the only person in the whole school that might wanna be nice too you, and i wonder why she wants too.\" Sandrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna be nice too me?\" Hannah asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm sorry that you parents forced you too gain weight but i wanted too just escape from that room. How was i suppose too know you parents would force you too gain? I thought they forbid you too watch T.V and hang out with your friends...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They did! I can't watch T.V or see my friends or play at the computer and i also can't do a lot of other things but gaining weight is the main thing. I mean just look at how big my belly is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina leaned over too Hannah so her huge belly brushed against Hannah's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See how big my belly is.\" She said proudly.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah looked at Nina's huge belly that made her own belly looked small.<br>\r\nNina's belly was partly bare since all the stuffing of Sandrina, Hannah and the eating contest put a lot of extra weight on the little girls frame without buying  new clothes Nina was squeezed in her clothes that were several sizes too small so her fat hang out everywhere but no one put much attention to that because of Hannah's transformation. Nina liked it too show it but she knew she needed new clothes. Tomorrow Nina's mother would take her clothes shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Nina. Does your mother have any old clothes from you. I might need them.\" Hannah said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i can ask her and cheer up. Being fat is't so bad. It also has its good sides.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really well i can't believe fat has any good things. That's why i did't believed you really liked it. All my life i tried to stay slim so that even when i was a teenager and young woman i still would have a slender beautiful body instead of those flabby bellies and hanging tits a lot of girls have those days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well being too thin also is't too good. I once saw that on T.V. It was called anorexia. Men i saw girls that were nothing more then just skin and bones. By some of those girls you almost saw bones sticking out of their bodies. Iehw! Then i rather be fat.\" Sandrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you can better try too like it. since i don't think you parents are gonna stop soon, and if they keep this up long enough it's gonna take a lot of work too get it all off.\" Nina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fair. Why do i have too gain. I mean i did a lot of work too keep this body. Hundreds of other girls just stuff their faces, don't care about their weight and stay thin or become normal sized. Why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh because you kidnapped someone and locked her up somewhere against her will and fattened her up. What did you expected what  would happen?\" Sandrina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But look at the nice things of fat!\" Nina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like name one?\" Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels very, very, very soft. Better then any mattress i ever felt.\" Sandrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you don't have too watch your figure you can eat what you want. All the candy, fatty, greasy and other food you did't eat because it would make you fat. You can eat it all and as much if you can.\" Nina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i guess that's true.\" Hannah said while she poked in her belly fat. </span></div></div>",

Nina took her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better can go back to our seats.\" Becky said. \"Class is starting soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah looked back with a painful look at her face. After talking with Nina and Sandrina she realized that becoming fat maybe was't so bad. It was something she just had too accept and make the best thing of it. Of course if there became a chance she could stop gaining she would take it but until then.<br>\r\nProblem was that anyway the kids would start teasing her again. She never realized how painful all that teasing was. Nina could be so lucky she liked it to be called fat. She knew one thing for sure. She would never tease a fat girl again for as long if she lived. Perhaps she should't tease anyone ever again. It was't fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first kids came in and started to tease her. Soon a big group was standing around her. Nina looked from her seat at Hannah. She did't thought she could do much. She could go over there and tell her too stop but the kids teased her because she was getting fat. Not because she kidnapped Nina. Sure her punishment that she needed to gain weight was because of kidnapping and fattening Nina but that was't something the kids would care about. Not even if Nina forgive her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee little piggy. You need to gonna eat a lot so you get big , strong and FAT!\" One said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee jelly belly! Soon a pot belly.\" A girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-A-T what doe that spell Hannah.' Another said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The she remembered what Nina said. \"You're not so different.\" Was she. She was maybe a few pounds heavier but that was't so different. She felt in her pocket and found were she looked for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink! Oink! Little piggy! Oink! Auw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole class stopped what they were doing and looked at the boy. Hannah hit him with one of her rubber bands and pretty nasty. The boy started too cry and ran away. Hannah fast curled another band around her hand in a way that when you let go with one finger it flew right at the one you were pointing at with high speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody want one? You just have too ask!\" Hannah said snappish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one of them forget how good Hannah was at shooting rubber bands and no one wanted to feel that again. Most went too their desk. After Mrs. McCoy walked in the last one also went to their seat. She was surprised no one was teasing Hannah anymore. Well soon it was lunch and she got order's from Hannah's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah in the meantime was occupied with her own thoughts. Sure since the first day she met Nina she teased her because she was fat and with lunch she was always eating a lot. Now she knew that was because Nina wanted to gain. But now she was a bit confused. She had always been mean to her and even kidnapped her and thanks too that she needed to get fat and Nina was now nice too her. Now she knew how teasing felt she decided too stop doing it. Well except if someone else started teasing her first. She knew the teasing would start again . That rubber band hold them of for one time but she knew bullies well enough too know that they would continue. Nina was right. becoming fat was't so different but you could make it different. Nina and Sandrina were the only two people that wanted to talk too her. Besides Sandrina used to be her friend. <br>\r\nToday was a busy day. The day of a new life. The start with one new and one old friend. The start of becoming fat and to become a plus sized model or like Nina said: a BBW that stand for Big Beautiful Woman. She thought about looking that up at her computer when she remembered her parents forbid her to use it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina was also surprised at what happened. Hannah seemed to have really changed when they talked too her during recess. She saw when Hannah shoot that rubber band but at the other hand those kids were really mean to her. She thought Hannah could become pretty nice. After all Sandrina did also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina was also happy she might get her old friend back maybe a bit nicer. She knew she changed since she started to hang out with Nina but she liked it and felt a lot better. But she hoped Nina did't forget to help her study after school. She still needed some help.<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Her mother talked with the school, and after she explained, they agreed to feed her more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah started out with a cheeseburger and some fries, and ate them like usual. But after she finished, another plate was given to her. She knew she had to eat more, but she wasn't as upset as she was before. So she ate more.  After each plate was cleaned, another came.  Hannah was determined, and ate as much as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 5 plates, she finally asked to stop. It wasn't as much as Nina could've eaten, but slimmer Hannah felt like she was going to pop. <br>\r\nNina and Sandrina watched, silently rooting for her.  After Hannah stopped, Sandrina went over and offered her a belly rub.  Hannah only nodded, too stuffed to talk. When Sandrina's hands touched her soft, tight stomach, and started massaging, Hannah relaxed. It was somewhat uncomfortable, having someone touching her belly, but it really soothed her full tummy and relaxed her.<br>\r\nNina smiled.  Then an idea came to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch, they intercepted Hannah.<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks for the tummy rub, Sandrina.\", Hannah shyly said. She was still partly ashamed of her new girth, but she was getting more used to it.<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" she replied. \"Uh, we were wanting to ask something.\"</span></div></div>",

They know what i did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's true. I really don't think my parents like her.\" Nina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right. Did't thought about that. Well we could also study at my house. I mean i don't think they really know what happened or care about you. Besides you came over more often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i can't come over! I'm grounded. Part of my punishment. No T.V, no Internet, no friends. So i can't come over even if i wanted too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too bad. Well it's not really playing with friends. It's studying. Perhaps you mother thinks that's all right. After all your grades don't exactly take you too university. Nothing personal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe. I still don't see how writing words help us doing better? Unless it are the words for the next dictation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that would work even better. Well i think it's because some words have the same way you write them. Like father, mother and both have the T and the H after each other like many other words. Lot of those spelling is easy to learn if you write it a few times even if it is in another word. Or if you read those words in a book!\" Nina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why i started reading. You know it's pretty funny sometimes. I like those books from Roahl Dahl. He writes pretty good.\" Sandrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he does. He's worlds most famous writer of books for kids,and he even writes books for adults. Too bad he died. But he lives forever in thanks too his books.\" Nina said with a sad look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo kids walked by. Nina could hear them talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Nina can now tease another fatty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah is now what she never wanted to be. Ha ha haa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah just don't listen too them Hannah. I'm sure anything is gonna turn out fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah wished she could use her computer too look at BBW. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh lunch is over.\" Hannah said. \"Well i will ask my mom. But don't count on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day went on like normal and during the lessons the other kids could't tease Hannah and she was thank full for that. As soon as the school bell rang she ran over too her mother happy she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you seem more happy too see me then when i left you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh mommy i was wondering if i could go with Sandrina too study for the dictation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Hannah. We were clear about this. No playing with friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B... but this is't playing. We're really gonna study i promise. Besides you were't too happy with my grades.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... \" Hannah saw her mother was doubting. \"I guess if you're really gonna studying... But i tell her mother too check on you and you eat fatty food there. I will tell her about you're punishment and if i don't see any improvement in your grades it stops and you will be punished more and be honest... you have't much left.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah gulped and really hoped Nina's tutoring would help while her mother talked with Sandrina's mother.        </span></div></div>",

She was a bit surprised at this but it seemed Nina's tutoring really helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will see it at the next dictation.\" Hannah thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she wrote on her paper BBW. Then she wrote the same letters under each other and finished the words<br>\r\nBig<br>\r\nBeautiful<br>\r\nWoman<br>\r\nShe could't wait too see this. Point was that she was't allowed too use her computer, Sandrina's mother knew about her punishment so she would't be able too use her computer, they did't had a computer in class (even if they had they would be allowed to go on the Internet with it) and she was't allowed too go too anyone else. She was also grounded so she could't look somewhere else. If there were really BBW models she must be able to find somewhere what about it. But she was stuck at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah i have some food for you.\" Sandrina's mother said and put a bucket of KFC on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina looked at it almost drooling. She knew Hannah was punished but seeing her eating her favorite food was hard. But suddenly Sandrina's mother put another bucket on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is for you Nina. It would be a bit mean to let you see her eating your favorite food without you having any of it.  She also gave some KFC too Sandrina however it was less then Hannah and Nina got but that was fine with her. After all she did't had such a big tummy as Nina, was't gaining or punished.<br>\r\nAfter three hours Hannah's mother arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah i see you got some food to eat. Good, good. But we also have some delicious food at home. Well i heard you all three have been studying. I hope it was't a waste of time. Well we'll see you two tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Sandrina. Bye Nina!\" Hannah managed to say before her mother dragged her out.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"All right i think we learned enough for today.\" Sandrina said and picked up some paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i think so too. So what do you wanna do now?\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Well visit Sara. Remember. The one armed bandit. My cousin. Lives just a few houses further. She was home schooled for some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. I almost forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom we're gonna visit Sara. We wanna ask her some thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" Sandrina's mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls walked over too Sara's house. Nina saw a girl sitting in the garden reading a book. she had blond hair till her her shoulders and was average sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Sara!\" Sandrina yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked up and waved with her right hand. Did't had much choice. There was nothing left of her left arm except a small piece of about two inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHello Sara this is Nina. My friend. We wanted to know something about home schooling. I thought you have been it a while so... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that was after i just lost my arm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did that happened?\" Nina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrorist attack. Well i guess i can be glad it was only my arm. However i had a lot of trouble with it first. But now i think about this it were probably more psychical problems. I hated my one arm and did't want anybody to see it and wanted to go anywhere were other people were. Not too the mall, not too the restaurant and not even school. Maybe i was a bit over reacting but i mean come on i just lost my arm. So my parents hired some one to teach me. But my parents let me met some other kids that also lost limbs so i discovered i was acting a bit like a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You parents hired someone. Why did't they schooled you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can't. You can't just teach some one you need to be a qualified teacher if you really home school somebody. But you can hire them. Like my parents did. Why by the way? Do you want to be home schooled?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well want to be is't the right word. But you can see i'm pretty fat. But i wanna become fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never heard about someone who wanna get fatter on purpose. But i wanna do that you go girl. But that doesn't really explain too me why you want to be home schooled. Unless you wanted to stay home so you can stuff your face all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! But it's just is... my feet are getting sore. Feet and legs need to hold your weight but if get fatter and you weigh too much they can't support you. If they can't support you you well won't be able too walk except with help. So i might be home schooled in some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well during the day you parents can hire a teacher until i come.\" Sandrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like anything would turn out fine. Nina knew her parents would't be happy if she would be so fat she would be immobile but she knew her parents earned enough money to hire someone and they knew how smart she was. She knew they would hire a teacher for her if she would't be able to go too school anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now what do you wanna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since anything seem to turn out fine. I would like to eat something. Do your mother has some more of that KFC?\"<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"Hee i like KFC. Wait for me!\" Sara yelled. </span></div></div>",

Her parents had gone to McDonald's, and requested a super-sized cheeseburger meal for their daughter, which came with a huge bucket of fries and a soda drink easily four times bigger than the average drink.  They brought it home, of course - they still cared about their daughter, and knew it'd be easier on her to stuff herself at home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah had eaten all of the fries, and was halfway through the coke and just started the super-sized burger.  She leaned back to take a break. Her stomach was full already from eating the fries, and stuck out in a big pot-belly, stretch marks covering the bottom of her belly. She moaned quietly, putting a tender hand on her bloated gut. She sincerely hoped her parents would give her a break, and let her finish the titanic meal later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hannah tried to rub her tummy, her mother walked in.  Hannah turned to her, and gave her a pleading look. <br>\r\n\"Getting full?\", her mother asked.<br>\r\nHannah nodded, clutching her belly in her hands.<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" her mother said. It wouldn't have done any good if she threw up everything she ate. \"You eat a few more bites, and well help you get dressed for bed.\"<br>\r\nHannah breathed out in relief, smiling gratefully. She grabbed the huge burger with both hands - it was almost as big as her teddy bear! - and took a big bite out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she finished her second bite, and leaned back moaning.  Hannah's father took the burger into the kitchen to wrap it up. Hannah's mom held the coke to her daughter's mouth, and the bloated little girl drank, as if it'd help ease her tummy's pain.  Her mom helped her get up, and helped her upstairs.  Hannah got into her pj's, which were already getting tight, and struggled into the bed.  Hannah's mom covered her up, and tucked her in. <br>\r\n\"Listen, Hannah,\" her mother said, trying to talk to her daughter, \"I'm not doing this because I hate you, ok? You have to understand, it's wrong to kidnap someone, and even more to force-feed them against their will. I'm trying to help you understand what people like that go through, and the only real way to teach you is for you to fatten up and see what it's like. It's not because I hate you, sweetheart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed a hand on Hannah's belly, which could be seen even through the blankets, and gently massaged it, rubbing in little circles. \"I don't hate you, honey.\" Hannah raised her arms, and her mom leaned in, hugging her daughter. She let go, and got off the bed. \"Goodnight, mm,\" Hannah said. <br>\r\nHannah's mom wished her good night, and closed the door. Under the covers, Hannah continued rubbing her belly, as she drifted off to sleep...</span></div></div>",

I wanna be there when it opens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's eyes flew open. The super market was next too the school. Then parents could buy groceries before or after school. Pretty smart. It opened at 8:00 clock and school started at 8:30.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh mommy... could i go shopping with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's mother looked at her daughter. Hannah was grounded but a trip too the super market just before school... what harm could it do? After all she could help carry it too the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i guess that's all right. If you like it you can pick out some fatty treats for you. I do mean fatty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Yeah! I know. Oh my tummy is gonna be a hill of stretchmarks.\" Hannah mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know what i heard something about a lotion that will prevent stretch marks. I guess i could buy that for you. But you're still grounded and still need to gain. I heard you have a dictation today. Let's hope i hear a good grade on Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's a good grade... what then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i guess i could let you study with Sandrina and Nina. If not.... then... well i don't know what yet. We'll see but you not gonna like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah swallowed her last bite and stood up to go too the car. While her mother drove too the store Hannah counted some of her allowance. she had a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Hannah. You can look for some fatty snacks you like.\" Her mother said while they got out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah ran through the store straight too the magazines. She ignored the model magazines with stick figures and looked further. Finally she saw what she wanted. A Magazine called BBW and SSBBW's. Fast she took it and ran too the cash register too pay for it. Hannah and her sisters got pretty much allowance. After she bought it she hide it under her shirt so her mother would't see it. She kept the cash-register slip just too be safe. After that she walked back in and picked out some of the fattiest snacks she always wanted but never took before and took them too her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah nice Hannah. I found that lotion for you. Just rub it on your belly after you ate and it will prevent stretch marks. I want your belly to be fat it does't have to be full of red stretch marks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah followed her mom and they did groceries without a problem and also went past the cash registers and took the groceries too the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah you can better go. It's almost time for school. Oh and don't forget your lotion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah ran too school. Just when she arrived the other kids ran inside. Fast she ran too her class and took her seat. Too bad. Now she needed to wait to watch the magazine and too show it too Nina and Sandrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning class.\" Mrs McCoy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Mrs. McCoy.\" All kids chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hart of Mrs. McCoy got warm seeing how all kids seemed to like her. Since she was young she liked little kids. When she was younger she was many times a babysitter. And now she was teacher and she liked all kids.

When it's time for lunch, we'll hand your drawings to me. Then I'll put them on the wall, and make a big mural from them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina got out color pencils - she never liked using crayons - and an eraser. She was a fairly good artist for her age, and had even made scrapbooks from her drawings. Sandrina sat down next to her, and got out crayons. She had seen Nina's artwork, and was interested in watching her work. (And maybe giving Nina a belly rub).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah approached the two girls, slowly, because she had several helpings of eggs and bacon in her belly. Moving around with all this extra weight was more difficult than she thought. \"Um, is it ok if I can draw with you?\", she asked.  Nina smiled. \"Of course you can!\", she replied. \"The more the merrier!\", she added, jiggling her belly to complete the pun. Sandrina and Hannah chuckled at it, and Hannah grunted as she sat down. <br>\r\nShe let out a moan as she put a hand on her larger belly. \"How do you move with this?\", she asked Nina, suddenly realizing that the obese girl might take her comment as an insult.  But to her relief, Nina answered calmly, \"I try not to. It's alot of work moving around with this, so I try to avoid moving around too much.\" She looked to Hannah and asked, \"Did you eat recently?\" Hannah nodded. \"That explains it,\" Nina said. \"It's a little easier to move after you let your stomach digest your meal. Then not only is it a bit lighter, but you have more energy.  You need to rest some, and let your meal settle.\"<br>\r\n\"That reminds me,\" Mrs. McCoy said, approaching Hannah with a bowl of ice cream. \"Your mother's wanting you to eat more, so she gave me a tub of ice cream for you to eat through the day. Here's some for you. I'll check up on you after a while, and I'll give you more when it's empty, ok?\"<br>\r\nHannah nodded, taking the spoon and eating a bite. The teacher walked away, and Hannah sighed. \"I just don't get why I have to eat ALL the time.  I mean, isn't it the same as eating really fatty food in normal meals?\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's a way you can fit more food in your belly\", Sandrina replied.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Nina added. \"That's one way. Sometimes, in the summer, I had a day where I'd just snack nonstop so that there was always food coming in. If I could get used to having alot of food inside me, then I wouldn't get so many tummyaches.  And it worked! Have you ever noticed I never seem to get tummyaches?\"<br>\r\nHannah and Sandrina's ears perked up when they heard this. It was true - she had never had a single stomachache all month! \"Wow!\", Hannah said. \"Well, then I guess I got to stomach this.\" And with that, she took another mouthful.<br>\r\n\"Be careful, now.\" Nina warned. \"Take your time with it; don't rush.\"</span></div></div>",

Are you trying too read and draw at the same time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i guess that too but what i really try is too get a good picture of some characters in this book I'm reading. It has no drawings but a lot of good descriptions. So i wanna try with help of those descriptions and drawing them too see how they look. I have always trouble putting those things of a description together in my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a funny idea. Maybe i should try doing that too.

Besides i can't draw since i am too busy finishing this ice cream. Not my fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina stopped one moment and looked at Nina's drawing. It was a drawing about a few highly obese girls. However even while they seemed so fat they could hardly move the seemed very happy. That was clear. Nina colored another piece of her drawing when she saw Sandrina watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Mrs. McCoy said draws whatever comes into you head. Well we've been pretty busy with weight gain those last days. I don't think I've ever gained so much in such a short time.\" Nina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you two gained. I didn't gain any, or else not much weight those last days.\" Sandrina said.<br>\r\n\"Nothing personal. I like you two. I really do but I'm not planning to gain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have too. It's always nice to have a friend who's also a bit different from me. I once heard that a group of five friends who are each different from each other together have great power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like: a smart kid, a muscled kid, a fashion doll, a fat kid and a coven member?\" Sandrina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah for example. But of course that's just a story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah  took her last bite of ice cream but Mrs McCoy fast filled it again. She was still kind of angry at Hannah for what she did too Nina. Even while it seemed Nina had forgiven her, god might know why, that didn't want to say she would forgive Hannah too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandrina almost lost all attention to her own drawing when she saw Nina's drawing. It was very good. You could clearly see how fat those girls were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah almost forgot what was still tucked under her shirt. She just wanted to tell them When Mrs, McCoy yelled: \"Lunchtime!\" <br>\r\n    <br>\r\nAll kids stood up and handed their drawings to Mrs. McCoy. She gladly took them and looked at them. When Hannah gave her drawing she looked longer at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're very good Nina. You should do something with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i don't know. I'm a bit shy if i need too show my work too complete strange adults.\"   <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"Hey piggy. Gonna eat yourself fat a lunch again today?\" Two kids asked while the walked past Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah thought about the time she used too tease Nina like this. It was high time to watch that magazine.</span></div></div>",

Hannah turned to her, and Nina pointed to her top lip. Hannah touched hers, and then realized she had an ice cream mustache. <br>\r\nShe quickly licked it away, and turned back to her meal: a double-cheeseburger with ketchup and mustard, a fair amount of fries (definitely more than they'd give someone her age), and a 1-liter bottle of cherry soda, instead of the usual milk carton. Hannah was about to eat, when she noticed Nina was eating.....nothing?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I thought you were trying to get fat.\", Hannah stated, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" Nina replied. \"If you're referring to the lack of food in front of me, I'll let you know that Sandrina is getting my lunch for me. She offered to get them so that I wouldn't have to stand in line for so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Hannah replied. She shrugged, and dug into her large meal. <br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, Sandrina came in, holding four plates like a waitress. \"Order up!\", she said playfully, making Nina giggle. She placed three down in front of Nina, and took the last for herself. Nina started gorging herself on the chicken and burgers, pausing once in a while to take a large drink of milk. As the two girls stuffed themselves, Nina noticed that Hannah was trying to keep up, matching Nina's pace. She smiled to herself, pleased at the thought of Hannah trying to keep pace with a fat girl like herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs lunch drew to a close, both girls were stuffed to the brim. Hannah was cradling her swollen gut, rubbing it to try to ease the load she ate. Sandrina was massaging Nina's massive stomach, squeezing and rubbing her fat rolls. Nina let out a groan; she was truly living up to the phrase \"fat n' happy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch...</span></div></div>",

Nina wanted to take her Harry Potter book out of her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look what i found just before school!\" Hannah said pulling the magazine from under her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! BBW and SSBBW's!\" Nina said. \"Cooooooool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah opened it and all three looked at pictures of obese woman's.Looking interested at it. Nina because she wanted too become and too see them. Sandrina because her best friends wanted too look like this and she also thought they looked good. Hannah because she needed to become fat and wanted to be a model and now she could maybe do both. But she must admit they looked really good with the clothes they wore and all the extra fat. All love handles, folds and flab looked good. Hannah really liked it. She might enjoy becoming fat and become a super sized model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they look really good!\" Sandrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... before you said yesterday that fat people could also do model i never thought it was possible and now... i see i was very wrong. Those woman look great. The look beautiful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I think they look beautiful. Sandrina and you think so too but a lot of people don't think that fat people are beautiful. You were one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah noticed Nina was right. Did't see wanted to fatten Nina so she could tease her about it. If she wanted to become fat and they teased her about being fat then was't it obvious she liked the  insults. No wonder she did't mind the teasing. These woman looked great. Why not become fat. Her mother forced her too it so she would become it anyway, why not like it. She could become such a BBW or SSBBW. Why not. She had a nice face, fat or not and nice hair and a perfect skin.<br>\r\nShe suddenly remembered the lotion and started to rub it on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Nina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's a special lotion that prevents stretch marks. My mom bought it for me since i gained. But she did't thought i need to have stretch marks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina started gaining at very young age and her body was already used too her growing frame and her skin grew with her and her fat. This way she did't had any stretch marks and she was thankful for that. She knew that if she would ever lose that weight (not that she wated that but who knew) she would have a lot of extra skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're gonna become a plus size model?\" Sandrina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i can try. Not anybody can become a model. But i'm gonna try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mother like that?\" Sandrina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care! She forced me to fatten she needs to learn how too life with what happens then. She brought this up against herself. How do your parents think about your weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they know. I told them. Sure they were't happy with it. Especially my mother. But i really wanted to do it. After a lot of arguing my father and finally my mother agreed. My father does't talk much about it. My mother does let me notice every now and then but does't make too much trouble about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange that you were punished because of what you did to Nina and now you her friend. Not that you had much choice. No one else wants too talk too you anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well guess i can be glad Nina did't let me go too jail. But you forgive me no body else did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some people have more trouble to forgive someone. I don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing you bought this book.

She smiled broadly, and said, \"Well then you'd better be careful; hippos cause more deaths every year than lions do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause from the startled kid.  \"...then I messed up that insult, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n\"yes,\" Nina replied, \"yes you did.\"<br>\r\n\"...right...\".

The TV was on the Weather channel, talking about an approaching storm which would hit sometime that week. Her mother was watching intently, so she would know how heavily to prepare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah took another bite of her cheeseburger, and chewed slowly. She had already eaten a large amount of food, so she was incredibly full. But she couldn't focus on her belly at the moment; her mind was preoccupied with the awful realization she had made, and with an unusual hatred towards herself. How could she be so selfish and stupid? She had treated Nina like trash, when she was trying to be her friend - even after Hannah had kidnapped the girl, locked her up in her attic, and tried to force-feed her until she couldn't move!<br>\r\nHannah looked down at her belly, angry with herself and her actions. 'I deserve this,' she thought to herself. 'I should be fat...I should be treated the same way that I treated her...I...'<br>\r\nScowling slightly, she forced herself to take another bite. Stuffed to the brim on one side, and full of self-loathing on the other, she pressed on, forcing herself to finish every single bite of her meal. Finally, after a few more minutes, she swallowed the last bite of her meal, and leaned back. She hiccuped slightly, feeling awful both in her belly and in her heart...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the phone rang, jolting Hannah out of her self-loathing.  She glanced at the phone, only to turn away, figuring that the caller wanted to speak to her parents. She looked downwards, hateful emotions weling up against herself. Even her parents hated her. She deserved this hatred; that was how it had to be for a filthy, rotten girl like her. She didn't even have the energy to push herself up. She slumped forward, resting her palms on her ball-like stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to lay down when her mother, who had answered the phone, gestured over to her. \"It's Nina,\" she replied coldly, holding the phone before the chubby little girl. \"She wants to talk with you.\"<br>\r\nHannah glumly accepted the phone, and said, slowly, \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hannah,\" came a cheerful, pleasant reply. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Uh, why did you call me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to see how you were feeling. You seemed a bit down before, so I was a little worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down? I guess I am a bit down,\" Hannah replied, frowning still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then I think I have a surprise that'll cheer you up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah opened her eyes slightly more, interest showing. \"What would that be?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a sleepover planned for tonight! I talked with your mom, and she said it was fine if you come over to my house tomorrow night after school! Yaaaay!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah chuckled slightly at Nina's hyperactive, silly tone. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Check with your mom, if you don't believe it; but in any case, I was going to ask you. Would it make you feel better if I invited you over tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah paused, thinking. Why would Nina let her sleep over with her? Hadn't she been the one who kidnapped her, and tried to stuff her like a turkey?! Still...she knew Nina wasn't one to lie...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...ok,\" came the reply. Nina cheered on the other side. \"Alright! I'll check with ya tomorrow, kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah agreed.

Be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll admit some of the things you've done haven't been very nice, but a bad person? That's pushing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah let those words sink in. She smiled, tears filling her eyes. \"Thanks. Listen, I'll talk to you later. I don't think my mom wants me talking on the phone very long.\" Hannah hung up the phone, and darted up to her room. She plopped herself down on her bed, noticing that the mattress heaved slightly under her upon impact. She wanted to cry. There was someone who <i>didn't</i> hate her. Someone <i>didn't</i> think she was a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but why?</span></div></div>",

Sure, you kidnapped me and fed me like the fat little piggy I am (Nina flicked her hair in a manner meant to look silly), but you didn't actually hurt me any.

I enjoyed being fed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Hannah looked like she was about to break down in front of Nina. But Nina quickly stopped her. \"Hey. Normally, I'm all for letting out your emotions, but I don't think you'd want to cry in front of all these bozoes here, so...how about we all meet up during recess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah blinked hard, and nodded excitedly.</span></div></div>",

Nina, Hannah, and of course Sandrina, were too busy to think what they could do at the sleepover.<br>\r\nDuring recess, the trio stayed in the reading corner, and of course Hannah got some insults. She thought she more or less deserved them so she didn't do anything about it.<br>\r\nFinally, the kids were waiting for Nina's mother would pick them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get why your mother allowed a sleepover. I thought she was angry at you.\" Sandrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well I called her mother, and since I was the same girl that was kidnapped, she decided that it was fine. Lucky for you is't it?\" Nina said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Hannah, you've really gained weight. I can see your belly pushing against your clothes.\" Sandrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina did't respond, since she saw her mother and ran over to her and hugged her. Then she pushed her ear to her mother's belly and listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Her mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna hear the baby!\" Nina said excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nina, that baby isn't a baby yet. It's still just a few cells now. After three months, it's finally some kind of baby, and even then it will take some time until you're able to feel him or her moving, and I never heard you could hear a baby talking from inside the womb.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that. I'm just impatient; I wanna meet my baby sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could also be a brother Nina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or two, or both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, I hope not. Now go get your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah and Sandrina already walked over to Nina, and together they walked too the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about.\" Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother is pregnant. After nine months, it'll get born. Then I'm gonna be the big sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you will be a great big sister.\" Hannah mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll sure be really big. Or more really fat!\" Sandrina said with a giggle, and softly patted Nina's belly, making Nina giggle happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina's mother sighed when she heard that. Even her friends liked her fat. She still was't fond of Nina's fat. When her daughter first told her she wanted to be fat her mother did't knew what she heard. She punished Nina several times for telling her she really wanted to be fat. She finally accepted it, but that didn't mean she liked it. At least she'd now have at least another child that hopefully would't wanna be fat. After all, Nina was in some points a good roll model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, what do we have for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Hannah's mother told me that the food need to be greasy, so who wants KFC?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MEEEEE!!!\" All three the girls shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina loved KFC and she hardly could believe how much of it she had eaten the past time. First when Sandrina and Hannah wanted to fatten her up, the chicken chow down competition and her parents because her mother got pregnant and to make her feel better after they rescued her from Hannah and also sandrina's mother gave her some KFC last time they were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know they say you are what you eat, Nina. So why are't you a chicken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm more of a pig, aren't I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls started to laugh.  </span></div></div>",

My name is hungry belly, and you should stop worrying so much over the past!  Also, I wanna eat food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah laughed, and smiled at Nina's random, silly, but surprisingly good acting.  She smiled, and nodded.  \"Ok.

But your mother and I never were on the same page.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is't that in a lot of families?\" Nina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... not in all but in a lot of families, yes! Say Nina are you really gonna eat all that? I don't mind at all, don't get me wrong but I would a bit surprised that all that food fits in your tummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... there's only one way too find out.\" Nina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo surprise except a hand full of fries and six chicken nuggets, eaten by her grandmother all the food ended up in Nina's tummy. However her tummy was swollen and bloated. But Nina felt fantastic.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well let's go to your house. I need to talk to your parents about putting a young child at a diet. Perhaps I can talk them out of it. It is a idiot idea. Besides you want to gain weight not lose it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell that too my mom!\" Nina mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later they were back at Nina's house and rang the doorbell.

So, she got up and walked downstairs quietly - there was still the chance her parents were still asleep, and she didn't want to wake them up just yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nina entered the kitchen, and opened the fridge.  Her parents had good jobs, and so their fridge and pantry were literally stuffed to the brim with food and drinks.  She thought for a moment, and decided to pull a trick that she had read about online.  She looked at the clock - 4:30 a.m.!  That was plenty time.<br>\r\nShe grabbed the bacon from the fridge, and cooked 15 slices - 4 each for her parents, and seven for her.  Then, without cleaning the frying pan, she began cooking scrambled eggs.  She had heard that with this process, the extra grease and fat left behind by the bacon would coat and mix with the egs, thus making them even more fattening.  By this time, her parents had woken up.  Dad walked into the kitchen and was caught off guard. \"Nina?  What are you doin'?\"  Nina left the eggs to cook, and sat down on a chair. \"I was cooking breakfast, daddy.  You were both asleep when I woke up, so I thought it'd be nice for me to cook something for you two, for a chane.\"<br>\r\nHer dad hugged her; \"Aw, honey that's sweet of you!  Thanks, Nina.\", he said, hugging his chubby daughter tightly.  Nina hugged back, and resumed cooking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the eggs were done, everyone ate a quick breakfast; Nina's dad intentionally gave a little of his portion to Nina, as a thank-you for cooking.  She happily devoured all of hers and the bit her dad gave her.  Nina's mom knew that her husband's feeding Nina more food wasn't helping her weight, but she let it go since Nina did deserve a thank-you for the meal.  After the meal, Nina cleaned herself up (except for her hair; she liked it short, frazzled and messy just like it was), and headed off to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt school...</span></div></div>",

Sheala did. Her grandparents loved her. Terra thought her grandfather probably liked her but her grandmother wore the pants in the family. She always had to say something bad about Terra and never said anything nice to her and insulted her while she praised Sheala for everything she did. This happened as long if Terra could remember. Not that she blamed Sheala. It was't her fault her grandparents liked her more. She just acted like any other young girl. Not her fault. But it stayed a fact.

But...perhaps Aunt Paula was one of those people who felt that Lunchtime as an important meal that wasn't to be skipped...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could go and eat like a normal girl, for once, and make a good impression...or she could do what she usually did, and if Aunt Paula had any issues with her skipping lunch, then she could talk to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but what to do?</span></div></div>",

When she reached the table she put up big eyes. There were three sandwiches on her plate, two wraps and a big piece of pie on a plate standing in front of her. It seemed about two times as big as a lunch for a normal kid. She hardly ever ate lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you like it. Remember i don't want to throw away food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheala grinned while she ate one of her sausages. Aunt Paula would make sure that Terra needed to clean her plate because she needed to gain. She at the other hand did't have too finish. After all she was't such a fast eater and she knew that Terra would continue playing video games as fast if she could leave the table. After she left she could just stop eating if she wanted. But there was more. Terra was really thin and she could believe she was underweight. Sheala was't so skinny. She was slender with a nice flat belly and told her aunt she did't wanted to gain. She did't wanted to end up fat herself. So she made sure aunt Paula baked her food in oil and made it not very fattening while aunt Paula made her own and Terra's food  baked in butter and very fattening. Sheala smiled so mean she looked like a vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh aunt Paula... this is a bit much. I don't know if i can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey i worked very hard on that food. You don't want to hurt my feelings by not eating it would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra grind one's teeth and took a bit of her first sandwich and forget how angry she was. It tasted delicious. Even worth for pausing the game. If her mother made her food so good she never would skip lunch. No wonder her aunt was fat. If the food she got tasted so good she was sure she also would be fat.<br>\r\nSheala at the other hand also enjoyed her food. It was't so fattening but it still tasted very good. She could't wait until her sister would be fatter. <br>\r\nTerra fast finished her food and looked at her sister. Sheala had only eaten one and a half sandwich one wrap and the pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want you can finish your game.\" Aunt Paula said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I normally eat alone. So if you're done eating you can leave if you want. Terra fast got up and went back too the T.V too continue her game. After she was gone Sheala shoved her plate away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was delicious aunt Paula but i have enough. I'm still little. I don't have such a big stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i put this in the fridge for tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we fooled her good. It's really good you're doing this. We were so worried about her, and you cook so much better then our mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah my big sister. Well maybe i'm bigger now.\" She sad and patted her belly. \"Back then... You look a lot like you mother you know that. Except for your eyes. You got your eyes from your father. Anyway when we were young i liked it to cook. I could't do everything of course our mother helped a lot but while i grew older i could do more on my own and when i was about a teenager i could easily cook a good meal. So good my parents decided that i could cook a few days in the week. Since i liked it to cook i agreed. Everyone liked it but your mother... well she never liked cooking so much. Too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheala listened. She thought too maybe asked her aunt some recipe's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i go to my room. I still need to unpack some things.\" She said and walked upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her room she carefully got her laptop. Her parents thought she was too young for that, but she whined so much so long she finally gave her one so she would stop whining. Her parents were surprised how carefully Sheala was with her laptop. Slowly she started to surf on the web. </span></div></div>",

She was almot to the last part of the level, and she didn't want to waste her time on having to do everything over again.  <br>\r\nShe piloted the UFO Kirby through the level, until a sword-weilding enemy jumped up and hit her.  The next thing she saw was Kirby falling to the ground, and the star that held the UFO power-up flying away.  She recovered, but before she could get up, the star flew offscreen.  Terra decided that the star was too much trouble to retrieve at this time, and turned her attention to the sword enemy.  She ran to him, and made kirby start sucking in air.  The sword enemy was swept off his feet, and sailed into Kirby's mouth.  She pressed down, making Kirby swallow, and then watched as Kirby did a pose with his new sword and hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she paused.  The sight of Kirby eating brought bac the memory of the delicious-tasting meal she had during lunch.  She knew she had alread eaten, so she wasn't [i]too[/i] hungry... but the lure of the delicious food was very compelling to the young girl's mind.  She was torn between getting some more to eat, and wanting to finish her game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well,\" she thought to herself, \"I don't think getting a snack would hurt me much...I mean, I could play my game and still eat that delectable food...\"  She noticed she was drooling slightly, and quickly slurped it back.

Maybe there would be something to eat there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Jackpot!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was full of delicious food. Her mouth started to water. She did't see Aunt Paula, but she did't think aunt Paula would mind if she ate some. If she did she would apologize. What was the worst that could happen? That she could ground her; that was't such a big deal. She did't mind staying at home as long if she could play her games.<br>\r\nShe picked up a plate of spinach pillows. She remembered her aunt made those. She baked some bacon and made some spinach and put in small square pieces of puff pastry and fold the corners together so it looked like a pillow, and put in in 20 minutes in the oven at 220 degree. It was delicious, whether it was warm or cold, and it tasted pretty good. Too bad her parents never made it.<br>\r\nShe picked up the plate with five of the spinach pillows and walked back too the couch. She did't notice the door too the hallway was open and her aunt saw her taking the food. She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right; eat it all up, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAunt Paula did't know why but when Sheala told her to make her sister gain some weight she felt something inside her. She liked the idea of fattening a girl. At the same time, she was doing Terra and her parents a favor. Or so she thought; at least she tried to do the right thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheala was in her room, shutting down her laptop. She was really glad her parents gave it to her; it took a lot of whining to get it, but it was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how long it will took until i will see some result at Terra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Terra never gained a pound, even while not doing anything but sit on her skinny butt playing games. It was't fair how she was able too stay thin, while other worked so hard to stay thin and even then could't do it. Sheal had heard that every person's body was different; some gained faster than other people, or in different places. That bit of information made Sheala wonder where Terra would get her fat.<br>\r\nShe did't felt really bad about what she did. She just wanted to take revenge since Terra always got things her way and then her parents would realize they spoiled her too much. Maybe then she could also have things her way for a while. That was killing two birds with one stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would Terra react if she notice she does't fit her clothes anymore?\" She asked and wondered. \"I hope she fattens fast. Well, Aunt Paula said the food was very fattening, and I've never seen Terra eating lunch before. And my, it was a big lunch! And she ate it all up till the last crumb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stretched herself once and heard a soft: crack!<br>\r\nShe hadn't used many of her muscles lately.  It was maybe smart to also do some exercise. Aunt Paula said she did't made Sheala's food fattening, but better safe then sorry. Besides, some exercise could't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

She could tell that Aunt Paula had stopped using this room for a while; there were cobwebs and dust covering alot of things.  But Sheala found some dumbells and a treadmill, and started an excercise routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, she stopped, convinced that a full hour of excercise was good enough for the day.  She knew that she had to pace herself, so she wasn't worn out.  She stumbled upstairs, but was too tired to climb the stairs.  The ony place she could see that she could relax was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey sis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheala ooked at Terra.  She was still her same skinny size. (Hey, it's still the first day!  What're you expecting, a magic pill or something?)<br>\r\nHowever, her mouth was surrounded by a small grouping of crumbs, likely from eating.  Sheala saw that Terra had been slowly letting the cooking get to her; there were not only empty plates and wrappers next to her, but there was also a bucket empty next to her, and she was starting to snack on her second bucket of what could only be chicken nuggets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheala was caught off guard.  \"Wow, sis.  Quite a bit of snacking you've been doing, eh?\", she said.  That was all she could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra blushed slightly. \"Yeah.  I'm sorry; it's just...the food was really tasty.  I couldn't help myself; I kept wanting another piece....and another....and another....so eah...sorry about the mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheala sighed; \"Why are you apologizing to me?  I'd be more concerned about Aunt Paula; I don't think she'd like  you messing up her furniture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra sighed. \"Yeah...I know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an interesting idea entered Sheala's mind.  Perhaps she could speed up the process by keeping her sister eating!  If left alone, Terra'd stop after a certant amount; but if she could entice her to eat more, then she wouldn't stop.  And Sheala knew that if Terra was going to gain weight, then it was also important for her to eat MORE as well as eat fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, sis,\" Sheala said politely.  \"Tell ya what; I'm sure you're still wanting a bit more to eat, right?\"<br>\r\nTerra paused; she was a bit hungry. \"Yeah,\" she replied.<br>\r\n\"Well, how about I'll go and take this trash away while you eat s'more food?\", the yunger sister said.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?  I mean, I don't wanna spoil my appetite before dinner...\"<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Terra.  We're talking about you.  We both know you can stomach quite a bit, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah....allright! Thanks sis.\", Terra aggreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheala smiled to herself, and took the trash and empty containers out of the living room.  Things were starting to pick up some...</span></div></div>",

It seems she like it's way more then that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm glad there's finally someone who also eats it. You know cooking is my hobby. But i'm all alone here. It's fine. I can do what i want. But i must admit i was lonely sometimes. So when your mother called i was glad i would finally have some company. Thanks to your sister... i can also cook without bothering about leftovers like normally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but i'm still watching my figure. You know. I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I know. But your sister is underweight. Well with how she eats she won't stay underweight for long. You know it's strange but i like it making a girl plump up a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheala looked surprised at her aunt but thought not too much of it. Even if her food was fattening she did't eat that much. She also worked out a whole hour today. Maybe she would gain some muscle. That would't be too bad. Never wrong being a bit healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you were in the training room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Was't i suppose to be there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's fine. I never use that room. I'm not really the exercise person. But if you want too use it no problem. You can even have all the stuff in there. It's more or less not mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah it's from your mother and our parents. Your grandparents. But after they moved the could't take all this stuff so the decided to leave it here. Your mother was planning to take some stuff but she never picked it up. I never used it so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They moved? I thought kids left their parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. They do. I did. But I liked this place.

Could you make some more snacks for Terra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid i'm already busy with that. Wait a sec.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned too the counter and poured some water out of a pan and after that threw spaghetti on a plate. Did a lot of butter on it and a lot of fattening tomato sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sauce is my own creation. very fattening.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheala also took a fork and knife and walked over too Terra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go. Some delicious spaghetti with sauce.\" Sheala said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks squirt. Hee sorry that you could't go to grandma but admit it's not so bad here either.\" Terra said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. I'm glad we stay here.\"<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\"Well i was here before but that's long ago. You can't remember. You can swim here.

While Kirby was doing the little dance he always does after a level, Terra heard from the kitchen, \"DINNER TIME!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra waited until she reurned to the level-select menu, and saved her game.  Then she stood up and started for the kitchen.  As she stood up, she paused; she let out a small groan, as one hand subconciously went to her tummy.  She figured that her tummy had adjusted while she was sitting down, so it'd re-adjust after dinner.<br>\r\nTerra's stummy was full of snacks; her tummy had a very small bulge to it, a sign that she had been eating alot.  Sheala noticed, and smiled inwardly.  Her plan was slowly working, and Terra wasn't suspecting anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra plopped down into a chair, and got herself set to eat.  She had manners, despite her huge apetite; she put a napkin on her lap, to catch any crumbs, and was careful to avoid putting her elbows on the table.  When Aunt Paula entered with the dinner plates and food, Terra's mouth dropped.  There was so much delicious food!  Turkey, burgers, macaroni and cheese, spaghetti - so much!  She didn't notice herself drooling slightly, but Sheala and Aunt Paula saw.  The sweet chubby lady chuckled, and playfully commented, \"Looks like somebody's hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they dug in, Terra got as much as she could.  She practically [i]dove[/i] into the turkey, and started stuffing her face.  Some grease was starting to get on her mouth, but she didn't mind.  She was getting more bloated with each bite, but she was only focused on the food.  Sheala smiled, watching her sister gorge herself.  Aunt Paula was sure to set healthier food near Sheala, so she wouldn't get too unhealthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she and Aunt Paula had finished the turkey, erra began on the burgers.  She bit into the first one, and delicious juices and grease overwhelmed her.  She ate more and more, fast filling her belly up.  As she was doing this, Aunt Paula was also stuffing herself, but not as fast.  She was taking time to enjoy each bite, and make sure Terra got more to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they had all stuffed themselves like...well, turkeys, Terra leaned back.  Her belly was now very full, and it was doubtful whether she could stand up or not.  Terra started to moan softly, and Aunt Paula and Sheala watched her.  She was starting to get full, and they knew it.  Sheala looked at Aunt Paula, as if asking [i]\"can we have her eat more?\"[/i]<br>\r\nAunt Paula shook her head.  Yes, Terra did need to get fatter.  However, if they made her eat more, while she was still rather thin, her body might not be able to tolerate the total amount of food she was eating.  Best to let her belly relax and digest her meal now, and then feed it later.<br>\r\nSheala didn't know this, but she wouldn't argue with Aunt Paula's decision. She simply made a note to ask her later, when Terra was either asleep or out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Paula stood up, and rubbed her belly, walking over to Terra. \"You ok, sweetheart?\", she asked tenderly.<br>\r\nTerra looked up, pain in her eyes. \"mm-hmm...\"she moaned.  Her belly stuck out slightly; since she was still skinny, her skin wouldn't be as stretchy as Aunt Paula's bloated belly.  But for her size, she had eaten quite a bit. </span></div></div>",

Can you... help me... up please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheala and aunt Paula walked over too Terra and pulled her up. Terra was't that heavy but still more heavy then her little sister who could't help but think: \"What a fat ass!\" when she needed to pull her sister up. <br>\r\nShe followed her aunt and sister who went too her sister's bedroom.<br>\r\nTerra picked up her Nightie and looked at her aunt and sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can i have some privacy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey fast closed the door.

She really hoped her boobs would grow in the vacation.   <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"When are we gonna feed her again?\" Sheala asked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well i will make some things for breakfast. After she wakes up we can feed her. She first needs to digest her food from today so it can turn into fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheala grinned to herself. Finally she could get her sister back. After all those years. Always be the little sister, the squirt the half pined, the dwarf. She was used to those nicknames but she still did't liked them. Terra made them up. She liked this plan too fatten her sister up. There was only own thing she did't liked. That she needed to lie too aunt Paula.

I should come over more often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you do that can you also cook for us?\" Sheala asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven without the fat it tasted good. So good Sheala even licked her plate clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You also like my cooking i see. I'm glad. You know it's no fun too be good in something if no one's there to tell you. Well let's start for breakfast. Hey Sheala do you want to learn how too cook?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheala looked up. Her mom never let her help too cook. The knifes,oven and the cooker. It was all much too dangerous for little kids. At least that's what she thought. But it liked her fun too help her aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh is it dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not if your careful and else i will do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a happy smile they started.</span></div></div>",

She had remained in the same spot since she fell asleep; she couldn' turn on her side, because her tummy was too full.  Her arms were splayed out, one arm raised up next to her head, the other on the covers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra's sleep was disturbed by the loud blaring of the alarm clock in her room.  She groggily turned over, and slapped the top of the clock, putting it asleep.  She half-opened her eyes, and looked at the time.  <br>\r\n6:45 a.m.<br>\r\nShe groaned softly, as she crawled back under the covers and returned to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the alarm rang again.  This time, Terra sat up and turned off the alarm altogether.  She rubbed her eyes; she knew that nobody usually got up at this time, so it was a good way t get a jump-start on her morning.  The sooner she got up, she believed, the sooner she could play video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra went into the bathroom to try and wake herself up before getting breakfast.  after she splashed some water in her face, she went downstairs to get some food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra stumbled downstairs, which woke Sheala up. She realized that her sister must've woken up, and couldn't wait to see what happened.  She half expected to be greeted by a chubby, fattened Terra, gorging herself on breakfast.  <br>\r\nWhen she got downstairs, she was greeted by the same-size Terra she had always known. Guess Terra's not the only one who's still drowsy, eh?<br>\r\nTerra had a big grin on her face; laid out before her was a huge breakfast, still fresh and warm.  Sheala smiled; Aunt Paula must've been up late making his big dinner for Terra.  Her suspicions were true, as Aunt Paula was snoring softly in her bedroom upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheala looked her sister over, hoping to see some change.<br>\r\nHer hair was a mess, which was usual this time of day.  But what she noticed was lower; Terra's usually scrawny arms and belly were slightly bigger.  She now had a slightly thicker frame, with slightly bigger thighs and rear.  Her chest was still flat (since she was still too young to get those), but the rest of her had definitly grown.  Now, instead of looking like a twig, she looked like an average girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheala smiled, and asked, \"So?  Ya hungry?\"<br>\r\nTerra nodded, now wide awake at the sight of pork sausages, scrambled eggs, bacon, and a myriad of other breakfast delights.  Sheala noticed a note on one edge of the table.  It read, <br>\r\n<i>\"Sheala, here's the breakfast.  Everything on the table is for your sister; your breakfast is in the fridge.  Please make sure she eats it all!  A<br>\r\n   - Aunt Paula\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra asked, \"Hey, what's that?\"  Sheala thought fast, and crumpled up the note. \"It's a note from Aunt Paula.  She says there's milk and juice n the fridge.\", she answered, throwing the note away.<br>\r\nTerra shrugged, and sat down to eat. </span></div></div>",

She could't belive the toothpick-sized girl that her sister used to be now changed in a greedy pig, or a food vacuum cleaner. She opened the fridge and found a plate with a note attached too it that said: for Sheala. She took it and walked back too the table and started eating her own breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better her then with our grandparents. Right?\", asked Terra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you it is. I like my grandparents. The're always nice too me. They also have those rooms full of junk were you can find neat stuff. Remember that we found that indian tent in a coner behind a curtain and played in it, or else those...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fun for you. If you did't want to also play in that indian tent i would't be allowed too play in it. You know that!\" She said and stuffed almost an entire sausage in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheala opened her mouth to say something about it before she thought she must admit it was true. Their grandma really hated Terra. She still did't understand why. Terra was't really a brat. Sure she was't a angel, and of course she and Terra fought every now and then, but they were sisters. They were supposed to fight now and then. Why was it that grandma hated Terra?  Terra of course was few years older. Maybe something happened before she was born or when she was so young she could't remember, she wondered. Terra always said she did't knew why. Maybe she did't remember it also or did't want to talk about it. It could also be grandma just did't liked her - \"Hate at first sight\", or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. I knew you would have had a terrible time with our grandparents. But she also makes those delicious chocolate pancakes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only for you. I only get one if you're not able too finish them.\" She pushed her mouth full with bacon. \"Besides *chew chew* don't tell me *chew chew* you don't *chew chew* like it here. BUUUURRRRP!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm only here for a day, but until now I must admit it was't bad. Today I think I'm going outside. I bet you're just gonna keep sitting on your fat butt playing computer games!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My butt is not fat! When I was your age, my butt was smaller then yours! So who's the fat one now?\", Terra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheala knew that if she kept saying things about eating or gaining, she could make Terra realize how much she was eating. So she held her mouth shut and eat her breakfast. But she kept looking at Terra.<br>\r\nOne would've almost thought the girl did't get any food at home. She stuffed herself with all the food for breakfast - that would be enough fot five people.  Sheala almost could't belive how much her sister ate; she did't leave a single crumb. All the food ended up in Terra's now bloated belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Terra went too the TV. <br>\r\nSheala walked over too the refrigerator. It was full of snacks that she and aunt Paula made. She knew that Terra would get the snacks herself when she got hungry. <br>\r\nShe thought about going outside, but on the other hand it would't take long until it was time for lunch. Of course she could just sport a bit more in the training room, or read a book...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. What will i do?\", the little girl thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For the past five days, Terra had been fed by their aunt, bombarded with cookies, dishes of foreign cuisine, dark meats and exotic vegetables, all sizzling in the most fattening of juices, dozed in the thickest of sauces, and prepared by oen of the best chefs to ever feed the two of them. As Terra sat on her lazy, slowly thickening derriere playing her video games, she had begun to fatten up into the butterball that she had to become by the time the vacation reached its end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela wasn't sure if her older sister even noticed this metamorphosis.

She looked like a regular-sized \"plump\" girl her age; her normally thin arms and legs had filled out to fit normal-sized clothes. She did have a pot belly, which looked bigger simply because she had eaten so much.  Her face had filled in more, so she looked more healthy.  She even looked slightly younger, as if she was about a year or so younger than she really was!  So she had fattened up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but...it wasn't enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela wanted to make her sister FAT, not just curvier.  She wanted her sister to be fat on ordinary standards - a girl with chunky, jelly-like thighs, and a big, round belly with rolls of fat.  She wanted Terra fat, and she was getting somewhat impatient.<br>\r\n\"Sure she's definitely gained weight,\" she thought quietly to herself, \"but it's not enough.  If I want to convince Mommy and Daddy that she's too spoiled, then I need her to <i>look</i> like she's spoiled.  She's got to be FAT, and we only have two weeks left to get her that size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra didn't notice her sister mumbling to herself in the corner.  She simply let her huge meal settle inside her, letting her thoughts drift and her body to relax.  She had eaten quite alot today, and all she was focusingon was finishing up the boss level.  The giant squid had bested her four times now, and she neded a new strategy to defeat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Paula?\" Terra asked a few minutes after her dinner began settling, \"May I be excused?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Paula looked towards Terra, looking innocently at the older woman, and replied...</span></div></div>",

We don't want to turn her into a cow just yet.

Here he is in his pyjamas, stuffed with pillows to make him look fat, stomps on the floor and watches the video from a computer, which looks like a sumo wrestling match he\u2019s tuning in.  He would follow it on and playing as a sumo wrestler, and used his teddy bear as his opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question people may want to know is how did a ten year old boy got an idea of wanting to become a sumo wrestler in the first place?  It was only three years ago when he watched a cartoon show.  Dean was so fascinated by this, he starts acting to be those characters, and he loved it!  Then, he was looking for some videos from the internet, and that\u2019s when he saw real sumo wrestling for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way they make some poses and wrestle each other, made Dave feeling the excitement in him, and had his heart beat when seeing this anticipation.  It was that very first sight he saw, and would see more of these clips from then on, and he\u2019s been hooked with it since.  When he\u2019s sleeping too, Dave can think of a dream and imagine being one of the sumo wrestlers and win everything he could encounter for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may be just a imagination, but as far as the next day goes, he may find his dream could become a reality.  He can be seen walking home from school, and it was when he saw a poster printed on the wall.  It has a picture of two sumo wrestlers with the words written, \u201cSumo Wrestling School!\u201d  This has lit up Dave\u2019s wide eyes and he feels he can be the right fit to train and become just like the two in the poster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!  Now that\u2019s what I call a once in a lifetime!  I wanna be in it, and be a true sumo wrestler!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave says in a very excited way, and wasted no time but to head to the place where the sumo wrestling school was taking place.  It wasn\u2019t that far away and the youngster had managed to make it moments later.  He got in the place, when he\u2019s been greeted by who?</span></div></div>",

He loved lying on his towel and showing off his body to everyone around him, especially the girl\u2019s his age. It might seem strange for a 9 year old fox cub to be doing such things, but he wasn\u2019t the type of boy that went \u201ceewww\u201d at the idea of having a girlfriend. True, his thoughts were innocent and he was thinking of nothing more than a puppy love relationship, but he still liked the idea of having a nice big girl to love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed at that thought. He didn\u2019t know why, but he had always preferred a girl who was more on the \u201cplump\u201d side and actually kinda liked seeing a girl eat and get fatter. He wasn\u2019t sure if this was so normal, seeing how ALL girls must want to be skinny and ALL boys had to like them that way, or at least that\u2019s what T.V and movies told him. However, he couldn\u2019t help what he liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was sure he\u2019d find someone soon too. Not only had he been at this spot, although mostly for his love of the beach not just his want of a puppy love crush, but also because he had a pretty firm and fit body\u2026had being the operative word. Since he was coming to the beach so often, he didn\u2019t really do that much anymore outside of lay on his towel. It also didn\u2019t help that a number of venders, including a fried chicken place, had opened up only a short jaunt from where the little 9 year old liked to lay. Worse yet, but he the little fox kid always was given lots of money by his parents, who were thankful to have a nice quite house all to themselves. All of this had caused his once \u201cabded\u201d belly to become softer and even begin to form a bit of a plump pot. Valko was unaware of this himself, which was why he continued to eat down the nice big bucket of chicken he had just bought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the cute plump 9 year old girl walking down the beach wasn\u2019t so unaware of him, or his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So I pretty much spent all day eating which is how I got all this\" said Maddy while patting her belly to emphasize her obesity. \"Whenever I would go outside and try too make friends the other kids would call me fat and ugly, so because of this fat I don't have a single friend in the world\" said Maddy but this time she starting to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValko noticed this and spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey come on you're not ugly\" said Valko giving Maddy a pat on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really\" said Maddy wiping her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if you asked me the idiots that called you ugly are the real ugly ones\" said Valko with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this the little wolf's tail started wagging happy that she may have finally made a friend. Valko noticed this and couldn\u2019t help but grin at the cute little girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"VALKO\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValko heard someone call out his name and turned around to see who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On the downside, she often gets lonely, and sometimes wishes for someone to talk to.  She does live close by a human town, and kids do like to go into the woods; however, they usually don't see her, and she doesn't try to bother them.
