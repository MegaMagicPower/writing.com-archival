The rain had been lashing down in torrents for some time now and the guards on the gates of the city walls were getting more and more edgy.  Anyone with the slightest intelligence knew that the country was threatened by the advancing armies of Cardac to the North.  And, on a bitterly cold evening such as this, it was easy to imagine foul things going on outside the relative safety of the city walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the pounding of the rain came a slow rhythm of another sort.  The thundering hooves of an approaching animal, presumably with rider.  But was the intention to aim for safety or attack?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, and with caution, six guards made their way to the barrier.  Although they would appear within touching distance to the visitor, the invisible field would protect them until they managed to seek identification.  Few were travelling at present, all needed to be checked, and a show of numbers, even if unnecessary, was always good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rider had approached and was dismounting.  Through the rain it was difficult to distinguish features, although the animal currently appeared far more interesting than its rider.  It was a faelan, the best description of which would be similar in shape to a horse, with wings.  These creatures were notoriously quick and close to impossible to train, although this one seemed happily at its rider's command.  To own such an animal was a sign of wealth, for to buy even an untrained specimen would cost more than a guard could earn in a lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rider stepped forward and, closely watched by the guards, was revealed to be as unthreatening as a young girl, perhaps twenty or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt.  What business do you have here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I come in peace.  I am seeking refuge within the city and to help however I can in the upcoming struggle.\"</span></div></div>",

A lesser individual may have given up at that, but the girl was not such an individual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is dark and dangerous out here.  You would leave me to fend for myself?\" she asked, as politely as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.  Orders are orders and no strangers are to pass through here,\" came the negative reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small murmur of sympathy went around some of the guards.  They would not be swayed but it was evident that they did feel some compassion for anyone stuck alone outside on a night like this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl moved silently away into the night.  She was sure that she could have used her powers to gain access through the gates, but she would rather her access to the city was through traditional means, to avoid arousing suspicion.  Besides which there were twenty seven gates in total, not all of which may deny admission.  She wondered however, if the guards had any idea how easy it would have been for her to gain access.  Once she had controlled the mind of the leader, she could have done whatever she wanted.  It was very tedious trying to be good, when you know that within your powers you have the ability to control others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiding away from the walls to alleviate suspicion, she could softly hear the sound of approaching hooves.  It was another rider.</span></div></div>",

It was a dark night and on her own she could be easily hidden, but the faelan was slightly harder to escape notice.  The rider was going quite slowly, but as long as they remained still she hoped to remain unseen.  Her eyes remained glued on the path however, waiting to see who or indeed what was making its way towards the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight that met her eyes was not a pleasant one.  It would be hard to describe the creature approaching as man or beast.  It was a simbilliant - one who had once been human, but who by the powers of Cardac now lived entirely for evil.  A creature with the power of twenty men, but barely any brain left, with one purpose left in life - to serve its master.  Not somebody you would want an encounter with on a lonely path after dark, and certainly not someone with an honourable purpose for making towards the city walls.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Safe behind the thick trunk of a tree she took aim and... <i>thwack!</i> The rider suddenly had an ivory handle sticking out of his throat. With a surprised gurgle, the rider swayed and fell to the ground. His steed was well trained and simply paused beside its fallen master. Soundlessly creeping over the grass, Dauphin knelt caustiously at the creature's side and felt for a pulse. None. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood and approached the animal, still standing patiently, with soft words. It eyed her suspiciously but with a soothing mental caress it kept still. She searched the bags, finding several large bottles of a swirling green mixture that made the blood run from her face. That creature hadn't been a scout! He had been heading towards the city to kill the inhabitants! No doubt, he had been planning to put the poison in the water supply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called to her steed and swung up on its back. </span></div></div>",

They were on foot, but those feet were strangely deformed, splayed and taloned toes at the end of double knee-ed legs.  Aside from this, they appeared human, their bodies covered in armour, their hands grasping sharply bladed weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely you don't think that we would send a single agent, do you girl?\" asked the biggest creature, a good head taller than its companions and wearing a plume in its helm.  \"Now hand that vial over to us, and maybe you won't suffer too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin made a quick count.  Ten of them, and each a battle hardened veteran, if she was any judge.  She probably wouldn't be able to survive if she tried to fight her way free, but then she knew that she couldn't trust them with her life; all her life she'd been told stories of their duplicity and cruelty, as a child they had served as bogeymen to scare her into obedience.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow those self-same bogeymen were made flesh, and their fingers were flexing over the grip of their glaives.  No way to stall them - she had to decide now.</span></div></div>",

Why can't you just wait for some time?<br>\r\nMy home is nearby and we are gonna pass it anyway to go north, my wife knows these things, she might help you, she studied medicine before the war.

No turning back now.  She had to stand and fight, or die trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lead creature snarled and drew the wickedly curved blade at his side.  \"Burn you!  You will pay for your stupidity!\"  The blade lowered and became level with her head, staring directly down the blade were the hate-filled eyes of the monster.  Dauphin had time to imagine that she actually saw flames within those eyes before he bellowed and they fell on her like an avalanche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly her mind opened up and the familiar feeling of vertigo washed over her as she soared through the levels of Raav.  She blinked.  Everything became sharper, more detailed.  Colors, smells, all of it was richer and more beautiful on this level of concentration.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the monsters was practically on top of her, its glaive raised high overhead.  Using the unnatural speed granted to her, she side stepped and drew her blade in a single, smooth motion.  Time seemed to slow down to Dauphin.  She saw the creature bring its weapon down onto the head of another that was coming from behind her at the same time her blade opened a large gap in its belly, spilling its intestines.  There was a moist crunch as the glaive tore through the skull, and both creatures toppled to the ground together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glaive came stabbing towards her from the side.  Dauphin pivoted on her heel and spun again, rolling up the shaft of the weapon.  She lashed out with her sword and spun away quickly, not needing look to know that the arm holding the weapon was severed at the shoulder.  Parrying another stab, Dauphin allowed herself to rise a few more levels of Raav.  She could see a delight in the creatures' eyes as she backed away, parrying and dodging their attacks.  They thought she was retreating.  Dauphin couldn't help but grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer veins felt both frozen and searing hot in turns.  The energy from the higher levels of Raav was coursing through her body now, and it was almost too much for her to handle.  She channeled some of that energy into her sword, the blade becoming sheathed in a pale blue flame, and attacked with every ounce of skill she had.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three creatures in front of her paused in their assault after seeing the flames ignite on her blade, and that's when Dauphin struck.  The first one toppled over headless, the head itself landed about a yard from the body.  The second began to turn but fell as the tendons behind its knees were severed.  It had time enough to look shocked before Dauphin's blade pierced its heart from behind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third managed to get away and regroup with the others.  Dauphin stood her ground, left foot slightly in front of her, balanced on the balls of her feet.  She dragged her blade along the ground in front of her, the fallen leaves and grass combusting from the blue flames, to mark a burning semi circle around her.  Dauphin raised her eyes and leveled them at the leader.  </span></div></div>",

Their leader desperately cried out to them to stay, bellowing such oaths that Dauphin was glad she didn't speak the tongue of Cardac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all his threats, they were beaten, fleeing into the trees and leaving their sergeant to face the woman and her faelan alone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin smiled a litle smile, hoping to cover the fact that she was feeling pretty weak from the blow to her shoulder.  Her sole remaining enemy was large, and in her present condition he might actually present a few problems.  If possible, she'd prefer it if he were to run with the rest of his squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was made of sterner stuff, however.  He screamed a war cry as he charged heedlessly towards her, all his previous calm lost in  mindless battle-lust.  He fought with two curved scimitars, and it took all of her considerable skill to avoid being decapitated by his strikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she returned with attacks of her own, and he was hard pressed to fend her off.  This was where he would learn what it truly meant to be a warrior.  How long had he fought for, she wondered?  She knew that they trained them young in Cardac, but she had been fighting all of her life, and her experiences were not drill practices.  She had learned through life or death encounters every day since her birth, and no jumped up little soldier boy could beat her.  He attacked more hastily and with less skill as the fight went on, doubtless seeing his death in the very near future.  When her blade tore across the muscles of his right arm, tipping him to the ground, it semed as if this would indeed come to pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin levelled her bloodied sword at him where he lay.  He dropped his second weapon, and looked up at her.  There was fear in his eyes, and he was defenceless.  She could let him go.  But this was war, and there could be no prisoners taken.  After what his kind had put her through over the years, did he really deserve mercy?  </span></div></div>",

She hadn't gone inside, so she did not if there would be any shelter that could afford protection from the elements for the night, but it would not hurt to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinsome landed in the empty courtyard. Even now, days later, she could feel the essence of the brigand and murderer she was seeking. He had passed here three, maybe four days prior. As she dismounted, Winsome snorted in disgust. The faelan was not impressed with the castle grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimly lit by the half-crescent moon, she could just make out the shadows of the courtyard. Ten or fifteen pace to her left, the ruins of the gate and gate tower. To her right, some fifty paces from where Winsome had landed, a building that even in the dark seemed mostly intact. Stone, with empty black where the arrow ports and door had been, she could not be certain if it had been a palace or simply some administrative center, a judgement hall of some sort perhaps. To her front, a bit further, sixty paces or so, a long stone wall with several doors. She assumed it had been a barracks. Nothing behind her had caught her eye as they flew in, but she turned and looked anyway. Twenty paces behind her, piles of rubble and twenty paces beyond that, the castle wall. This had been a small place indeed. It most likely had served a single family, a dozen servants, and fewer than half a hundred soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to stare across Winsome's back at the stone building. Her knowledge of this area's history was incomplete. No storied war or battle came to mind that might explain the devastated gate and empty ruin. Whatever had happened had not been long ago. A single lifetime or less would be enough to account for the random bits of weed, the lack of trees or brush, and the mostly intact structure. With just a bit of work, she mused, it could be made quite livable once again. She estimated renovations would require a team of three skilled masons, half a dozen carpenters, one or two laborers to carry materials and run errands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, Winsome, Let us search out this building and see if it will accommodate us for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were no holes in the ceiling above her to let in starlight. It was hard to see clearly, but the walls appeared to still be paneled. Whether or not those walls were stained with dried blood and hardened battle gore would have to wait until the morning. She was in no mood to investigate closely. The staircase in the back was a faint shift in the shadowed interior, so she moved to check the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe banister was broken in several places, apparently severed through with some weapon. Something in darkness caught her foot on the third stair and she kicked it aside in annoyance. Probably a skull, or a bit of broken armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the second floor she discovered the roof was half gone. Jagged planks, beams, and tiles, the sharp angle of the break, all implied it had been broken from above. A faelan attack or a dragon could have done such damage. Nothing smelled of old fire or charred wood, so probably not a dragon. Fortunately, it was the back half near the stairwell where the break occurred, which explained the odd shifting shadow that had revealed the staircase. Some faint glimmer of starlight, or perhaps the half-crescent moon, had been enough to shift and twist the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin led Winsome under the shelter of the remaining roof. She retrieved a blanket from her saddle bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to sleep, Winsome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faelan tilted its head to stare at her out of one eye. It gave a snot and a headshake, reminding her once again of a horse, although there was nothing horselike about the hardened spine, the sloping back, or the furled wings. Nonetheless, Winsome curled up next to the front wall of the building, well under the protection of the remaining roof and far back in the shadows where no one who stumbled across them before dawn would notice. Wrapping her blanket around her shoulders she settled into the curve of the faelan's body, leaning against it for warm and company. Winsome shifted slightly adjusting to her weight, then laid its head against her thigh. If anything disturbed either one, both would instantly know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had dreamed of some place that in her dream she had called, \"home,\" but it was unlike any place she had ever seen. There had been a family around her. Her mother had been tall and willowy, slim and elegant, with a grace to her every movement that spoke of dancing sunlight or sparkling water. Tall, firm but not muscular, her father had carried himself with the air of a scholar, or perhaps a wizard. Two sisters, both younger than she, but as her eyes opened their names vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat an odd dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinsome felt her move and lifted his great head, twisting so he could study her through both eyes. She could have sworn he blinked, but faelan did not blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she noticed her hands. They were no longer dark and hardened from years of fighting. Soft, cinnamon brown, with carefully trimmed natural nails. Shocked, she stared at them, her mind suddenly blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winsome?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faelan snorted. Clearly Winsome still knew her, even if she did not know herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms were covered in heavy travel wool. Dark green in color like something a forest ranger might wear. She still wore breeches rather than skirts, and they were made of the same dark green wool. Around her waist a heavy leather belt with two broad hunting knives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second shock, then, catching her completely by surprise. She had no blood hunger. Running her tongue across her teeth revealed a third shock, she had no fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow in the course of the night she had become human. Her hands flew to her head to find her hair cut short and straight. She plucked a few hairs and brought them before her stunned eyes. They were the deep orange-red of the setting sun. At least she was still a woman. That much was a comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What magic is this? What has become of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin turned to stare into Winsome's eyes.

The smell of death and corruption hung in a palpable cloud around his monstrous form and she felt herself growing weaker as he began to drink her life away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back!\" she cried, thrusting her dagger into his reptilian chest.  The creature hissed, a forked tongue flickering out from between his white lips.  \"He's smelling me!\" she thought with a thrill of horror.

All she could do was to wait for her doom when she saw the hideous monster raised its huge scaly claws and without warning sunk it deep to her chest and through her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin opened her eyes, unbelieving that she was still alive.

Is anybody here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a little dizzy when she stood up. She noticed that she was in a place with only darkness around her but amazingly she could see herself because of the immaculate light that was surrounding her. She jumped back when all of a sudden a spiraling gold and silver light materialized before her. She had to shield her eyes because the light was so blinding and when she was sure it was safe to look again, she slowly lowered her protective hands from her face, only to see the scaly monster, with its dragon like wings and huge sharp claqs, she had encounterws when... she was confused. She didn't know if it was right to say, \"When she was still alive\" because she didn't feel like she was dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There must be an explanation! Where am I?! What is the meaning of all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe withdrew when the monster advanced one step towards her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe could feel a strange feeling inside her. She felt warm and... and light. She thought she saw a spark of blue and green light on her palms and it was guiding her... guiding her to....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster launched itself at her, claws menacingly directed to her and it was releasing a blood chilling screech from its throat. At that same instant, her hand brought itself protectively before her in an act of protecting herself and a blinding blue and green light blasted the monster off the ground and hurled it a hundred meters away from her. The impact was so strong that she felt the ground beneath her, if there was any (she wasn't sure), quake that sent her off-balanced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer vision blurred but image after image she couldn't decipher flashed before her and voices she recognized as from the head of the city on siege shouted in her head.

After a moment, Dauphin heard a soft slithering sound and the end of a rope appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" whispered the girl. \"The sleep dust doesn't last much longer.\" She gestured towards the fireplace. \"You go first.

It was what she so desperately wanted, and the King knew it, knew how to sway her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father,\" she said, almost choking.  She caught herself.  She could not let emotions interfere with her cause.  She had to play-act for the sake of regaining her freedom but, unless she separated her heart from this now, she would end up joining Cardac in spite of herself.  \"Father, I am sorry.

My men searched first for you there.  They found no evidence that you had ever been there.  Still,\" he paused.  \"I don't trust you.  This is not the first time you have tried to run away, and unless you are telling the truth, it will certainly not be the last.  Therefore, I have assigned guards to your chamber for the next few weeks.  If you can prove to me in that time that you are loyal, they will be reassigned.  If not...\"  the king's complexion paled, though his countenance remained stern.  \"You will be executed as a traitor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Dauphin blurted.  She had expected the guards, but this, this... she'd had no idea.  Her mind spun as she was led away.  Would she be able to convince her father of her loyalty?  What could she do to accomplish that?  She could suddenly think of nothing.  Should she try to escape now?  If she could find a diversion, she might be able to slip away from the two guards, and she knew the secret passages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, one of the castle servants hurried by with a large tray of food.

We've remained there since,\" Dauphin replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to look the princess in the eyes, but kept looking at the necklace pending from Safina's thin, frail neck.  The necklace had a gold chain and hanging from it was a phallic-looking object made of diamonds, that rested lightly in the princess' cleavage.  The Captain followed Dauphin's eyes to the princess' sweet rack.  His thoughts were far cruder.  Those milky white babies, lightly sprinkled with freckles helped him through many lonely nights.  Very few people have ever been so close to such perfect breasts in their lives.  He began to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSafina, almost as if gliding on air, moved swiftly, but not with an awkward swiftness, towards the stranger and took her hand in hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your name?\" she asked, batting her eyelashes a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander loudly coughed, \"Dauphin,\" at the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSafina turned her head to face the commander and, in a deep tone, reminiscent of her father's own voice, said sarcastically to the Commander,  \"Unless Dauphin suddenly grew a bunch of hair on her face and developed bad gas, you'd better shut the fuck up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander bowed his head.  A little twitch in his upper lip suggested that if she weren't the princess, but his wife, or some other woman, he'd slap the shit out of that bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSafina turned to Dauphin again.  Her face looked innocent and gleeful, like what had happened didn't really happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard the guys in Fayedian are SOOO hot!  Is that true?\"  Safina asked as she starting leading Dauphin up to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I suppose they're not bad,\" Dauphin replied, happy to get away from the men.  Dauphin wasn't a complete psychic, but she could sense the Captain's perverted thoughts about the two young, gorgeous girls.  Mind you, she did not trust this princess either: far too coarse and disrespectful for her hallowed position.  She had no choice but to go along with it for now though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued chatting about guys and girly stuff like that until they finally walked into the princess' room.  They sat down on pillows on the floor, about two feet apart, facing each other.  One servant came in with a big, green glass bong.  Another servant came in with a silver tray with big green nuggets of dama, a weed that all the famous artists were smoking at that time, and placed it on a table next to the princess.  A third servant walked in with a pitcher of iced tea, a couple of glasses and some sandwiches.  All three servants bowed, then promptly left, never turning their backs to the two young women.  It was a special rule created just for the princess, because she was paranoid that someone would fart on her.  She hated gas.  </span></div></div>",

You're not a gypsy, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Dauphin coldly replied, \"I'm not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess took a deep breath from the waterpipe, and coughed.  With a little giggle she said, \"Sorry.  I didn't mean to offend you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Princess,\" Dauphin was eager to cut to the chase.   \"This isn't a time for smoking, this isn't a time for laughing, and this isn't a time for questioning me.  There are soldiers at your gate, and when I leave they are going to pounce on me.  That necklace you are wearing holds much significance.  It could be a map or maybe a key.  I don't have it figured out yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin pulled a stone from her bag. Weighing in at possibly ten pounds, the dusty old stone was probably the most unclean thing ever to make its way into the Princess's sanctuary, other than the Princess's mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This comes from the Moon Temple, built by the Northern Bedouins over three thousand years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess was about to ask a question when she noticed the tense look upon Dauphin's face.  This wasn't a time for questioning.  She let Dauphin continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fact that this stone made it as far south as Fayedian is almost miraculous.  Do you have any idea how it got down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess pondered heavily for a moment.  She examined the stone closely.  Its shape reminded her of the lid to a jar.  Suddenly, a thought occurred to Tt Princess.  It manifested itself as a gasp and a sparkle in her eye before she finally exclaimed, \"It's a Mamulayan!  The Northern Bedouins believed in three major deities.  One of them wasn't born yet.  My tutor taught me this last year.  I thought it was so stupid back then, but my father insisted I learn about it.  I have a bowl that should fit this Mamulayan pretty snuggly.  If we burn the right combination of tea leaves, the fire at the bottom of the lid will create an image on the ceiling.  The image should be a map, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin replies, \"Yes.  The map will tell us where we need to bring that necklace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess saidatter-of-factly, \"We already know where it should go.  It belongs in the Sun Temple.  The Northern Bedouins of the Moon Temple had the major elements to unlock the Sun Temple, and vice versa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin looks at her, surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Bedouins and the Tangi never knew of each other.  It's impossible!  The coincidence that one had a Moon Temple, the other a Sun Temple never went unnoticed, but these cultures have nothing in common.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a big smirk on her face the Princess saido Dauphin, \"They have one thing in common.  Dama.  How do you think the Bedouins of the North ever got a hold of dama when they live among glaciers and fjords?  Dama is one of the ingredients, isn't it?  That's why my father has never made it impossible for me to get it.  All these years, I thought I was outsmarting him, but he knew the whole time.  Hewanted me to see this image.  But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the universal law is that you can't hurt a Princess,\" replied Dauphin, \"You have to bring your necklace to the Sun Temple yourself.  The whole plan is coming together.  Your father is very clever.  The connection between the two civilisations is the Dama.  The old trade route passed through your kingdom.  If you follow it, it will bring you to Sun Temple.  I don't have a map of the old route though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" said the Princess, \"I think I saw the map hanging from my dealer's living room wall.  He's an aristocrat.  His family helped put an end to the trafficking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to seek out his help,\" said Dauphin, \"but first let's see the image!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess replies...</span></div></div>",

The part of the palace they were heading towards looked older, with strong walls walls of rough stone covered in ivy. They were now walking in a garden where vines and fruit trees outnumbered flowers. The footpath crunched beneath their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice behind them made her stumble, \"What are you doing here? Don't you have a city to guard?\" The voice was female, loud and sounded displeased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty.... The girl says she has a message for the King.... Says her name is Dauphin...\" the Captain's voice was shaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin turned around and almost gasped in surprise. She had been expecting an old, witch-like harridan, dressed in scarlet robes. The woman in front of her, however, was hardly older than her own mother! She was wearing a simple, high-necked grey dress, its only adornment being garlands of leaves embroidered in green around the cuffs and hem.  Her hair was dark and long. If this was the King's mother, this meant the King was about Dauphin's age.... Of course, her mother had married rather late, so he could be a little older... or maybe even younger.  This could make things more complicated... or perhaps simpler.  Besides, if this was the current King's mother, it meant that the old King must have died while Dauphin was travelling and she hadn't heard the news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll thoughts fled as she looked into the dowager Queen's eyes. They were black - the darkest, most intense eyes Dauphin had ever seen on any creature. Her eyes looked right through the girl, and she suddenly realised that she couldn't use her mind powers on this woman if she tried. Yet Dauphin couldn't sense any special powers in the other, only her formidable will. She could almost see this will as a column holding up the whole castle, and even the very sky above the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin released a breath as the King's mother's eyes left hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" the Queen said abruptly, \"This girl could be trouble.  One way to keep one's peace is not to meddle in the affairs of the other royal Houses, and we have always done that.\" Another weighing look, \"On the other hand, we are also in trouble now.  Perhaps she could be of assistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may go,\" the King's mother said to the guards, \"Leave the girl with me. We will talk. Post the usual guard outside my garden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the guards were gone, the woman steered Dauphin towards a gazebo in the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you should tell me what brings you here,\" she said in her customary brusque manner.</span></div></div>",

In Tamrath, word came saying that your city was in grave danger. My father, who is a part of the Tamrathian council, worried that if someone did not go to help, your city would be destroyed. I know that I am only a girl, but I have been training as a warrior since I was very young. I am the best fighter in Tamrath. I have won awards in contests. I have beaten the best of Tamrath. My father thought it best that I should help save your city. Please your Majesty, I know I can be of service to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin stared in the the queen's black eyes.

Thank you for allowing me to assist you and your city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this, Dauphin left the Queen's home and went to the stables to take care of the faelan, to make sure he had been properly fed and watered. She found the faelan very comfortable, so she went inside the stall and began stroking the magnificent creature. It had been given to her by the Tathrinian goverment for defeating the top warrior in the city. He was her closest friend, she trusted him with everything she had and he was very loyal to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomra,\" she said, which was the fealan's name. \"I can't believe it was so easy to get in here.

She gave me the answer I wanted, so what would have been the point of using my powers if it would have been the same outcome either way? And also, I think she could resist, there was something in her eyes, that told me she wasn't like most people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared thoughtfully for a moment, remembering those black eyes. Tomra whinnied and she came back.  \"Well, perhaps, since you have been taken care of, I should go see to where I'm staying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up, patted Tomra's head and left.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was time for her to get to bed before someone else threatened her life or made her life difficult. Fingering the hilt of her sword she paused a moment staring down the black alley way before continuing her journey to the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she traveled throughout the city Dauphin got a feel for the atmosphere. Faint sounds of laughter and conversation floated to her ears and an overall sense of well being was communicated on other levels of her consciousness. Before she knew it she was at the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small sign outside declared that this was the Wayward\u2019s Rest and a picture of a tall cloaked figure with a quarterstaff and a sack was illustrated under the title. Taking a deep breath Dauphin pushed open the door, fingering the letter in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe low murmur of noise abruptly increased as the door swung open, not halting in the least at the sound of an opening door. Closing it shut quickly behind her, the young warrior examined her surroundings, moving throughout the room in a slow controlled walk that came so readily to one with her training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inn was a well lit haven from darkness, giving off a feeling of rest and merriment, truly different from the oppressive atmosphere that inflicted her homeland. Then again they still had their artifact, but that was a thought for tomorrow after rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of the men in the room looked her over as she walked to the bar to speak with the innkeeper. A few even made as if to talk to her or intercept her path. It wasn\u2019t hard at all to work on the minds of normal people. Men who had meant to stop her for a word sat down and resumed whatever activity that had caught their attention before leaving her unimpeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe innkeeper looked up from polishing his bar. \u201cHow can I help you lass?\u201d he said placing the cloth beneath the tabletop and turning his body to face the warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need a room, nothing too fancy but a bath would be nice,\u201d Dauphin said handing over the letter that she had received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe innkeeper\u2019s eyebrows rose a bit seeing the royal dowager\u2019s own sigil pressed into the wax of the seal and opened it without comment, his eyes scanning the brief message. Looking up he handed the parchment back, his eyes weighing her, before a brief smile touched his lips once more. \u201cI see,\u201d he said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGesturing for Dauphin to follow, he made his way up the staircase to the left to the third floor and, after walking to nearly the end of the hallway, he opened the door and motioned for the girl to enter first. The room was well furnished if a bit plain and an adjoining room had a large copper bath with piping leading into the walls, leaving her to believe that at least one worry would be taken care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to thank the innkeeper she found that the man was already gone and with a shrug she\u2026</span></div></div>",

My decision is final, I will not change my mind.\" the queen said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's weak, Dauphin thought. I could break into her mind and change her desision.

And she left the queen's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stormed to the stable and quickly opened the stall and called the faelan out. Tomra walked slowly forwards and looked at Dauphin questioning the sudden departure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said no,\" was all she said, as she hopped onto his back. They flew for an hour before the faelan swooped down and landed gracefully. She hopped off his back and took out a piece of bread she still had from the journey there. She needn't get anything for Tomra, for he was quite happy eating grass. After eating, they settled down to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she said no,\" Tomra said. He couldn't speak in the city for fear of being over heard. Most people didn't know that faelans could speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I tried to tell her that with me on Cardac's side they would be destroyed. But she wouldn't listen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you try using your mind tricks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought about it, but I couldn't bring myself to.

It was an ugly, misshapen thing, covered with bubbles that resembled warts on a toad's back. It was closed and locked wth a bright silver linchpin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what they want,\" Dauphin told the guard commander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man scowled and reached for the box. Across the lid and down the sides, bright silver runes burst to light like a blaze of fired naphtha. A loud hum like the residual vibration of a deep bass church bell having been struck filled the room. He jerked his hand away and the runes slowly faded as did the tooth-rattling hum, leaving the box's dark surface unmarked and the room silent except for the crack and sizzle of another bolt thrown against the barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch,\" Dauphin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander glared at her. \"I gathered as much. What in the hell's is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin sighed, suddenly looking very weary and much older than she'd appeared initially. There were dark circles under her eyes and she looked as though it took all her strength just to keep from dropping the lead box at the commander's feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The heart of their king,\" she said quietly. \"The Mad Conquerer, King Grothag.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The barrier suddenly shook as two more green Zurethan bolts slammed into it.  The barrier dissipated the energy back and upward into the atmosphere as designed, but the audible crackling noise made it clear that its integrity had been compromised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Guard Commander had seen enough.  His eyes were filled with uncertainty as the onslaught of the dark riders continued.  He took hold of the clasp of Dauphin's riding cloak in his fist and pulled her violently closer, their faces only inches apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl or not, I won't have you bring this battle to my gates!\" he yelled.  The cacophony of Zurethan tearing the barrier down filled the air around them, nearly drowning out his words.  \"Tell me why I should even try to protect you, and tell me right now, else I throw you back out to them!\"  His breath was heavy with fear and anxiety on Dauphin's smooth face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin didn't know what to do.  Just coming here in the first place had cost her dearly, and would cost her more once she found the Oracle masquerading as a simple clerk inside the fort.  She had to continue on at any cost, but she was as powerless as a baby without her weapons to resist even simple guards, even with her faelan Rendalin at her side.  Yet, if she told them her true mission they would fear her even more than they feared the black riders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing she saw clearly was that the Guard Commander was not going to be receptive to anyone from Cardac, and Cardacian she was.  The truth, she knew, would not be taken well by this man.  If she revealed that she was of noble Cardacian blood they would throw her out and into the clutches of the Baron's forces who had cornered her here at this guard post.  There was only one thing she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes had been averted downward, in the typical form of a supplicant female that this Dynisian Guard Commander would expect.  Her eyes bolted upward to him, tranfixing him in her gaze.  She could feel his breath catch for a moment in his throat as she showed him a hint of the true nature of the person he was manhandling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know what they want from me, Commander,\" Dauphin said, barely audible, her eyes like stone, her voice low, even and commanding.  \"I am sorry to have brought this to your post.  Release me and I will take my faelan and be gone.  It was wrong of me to have come here; I apologize.  You would forgive a foolish girl, would you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander stood, paralyzed, his mouth agape as she held him in her gaze, the rain pouring down over his face.  She softened her face then, and smiled, breaking the moment.  The Commander's composure quickly came back to him, though he looked befuddled and confused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barrier shuddered with an ear-splitting crack as another Zurethan bolt struck home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander released her, snatching his hand away as if from fire.  \"Yes... yes, that would be best,\" he almost whispered.  Turning around, he seemed to refill his full frame as he commanded his unit.  \"Prepare to open the barrier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" yelled most of his contingent, nearly in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander seemed to be in full charge of himself once again as he addressed his troops.  \"Our guest is leaving... now.  The riders will leave with her.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But sir, you cannot abandon her to them!\" protested a catapult gunner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander turned fiercely on the gunner.  \"It is not your concern!  Would you have her bring down the barrier?\"  The gunner's mouth moved but appeared unable to obey his command to speak, so he instead meekly turned around and assumed his post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander turned to Dauphin, though he was conspicuously careful not to look her in the eye.  \"Mount up, milady, you'll have less than five seconds to be clear of the barrier.  You won't want to be in its path when we reestablish it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin leapt onto Rendalin, seeming lighter than air as she did so.  She caressed his neck.  \"Get ready, boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barrier shuddered under yet another barrage with a sickening crack, then fell silent as enemy guns paused.  \"Reload!\" came the distant command from the dark rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open the barrier!\" the Commander yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud hum that cut off sharply, the barrier came down, its opaque edge shimmering briefly before falling down like a waterfall abruptly turned off at the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander turned on Dauphin.  \"Go now!\" he commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin nudged Rendalin with her heels, and they were off in an instant, climbing high.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commands came nearly at the same moment: \"Fire!\" from the dark rider, and \"Barrier up!\" from the Commander.  The order was not quick enough, however, and two bolts got through.  Dauphin felt her stomach tighten as she watched them strike a building in the city, though what the building was she could not tell.  It collapsed, and she heard voices screaming.  Young voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nudged Rendalin higher and higher.  The faelan flew strong, his muscles bulged, a sheen of sweat already appearing on his fine coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark riders were now aiming their shots at her but with each passing moment she gained more distance and  safety.  \"Just about there, boy,\" she cooed to Rendalin, patting his neck in sympathy with the animal's terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later they were clear of fire and high over the city.  Dauphin knew that the city's barrier was not a complete dome, it was merely a large wall; the Cardacians never attacked by air so complete encapsulation was not needed.  All she had to do was fly far enough away to be out of sight of the dark rider and his small army, then she could go up and over the top and enter the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faelan, ridden by a woman, would cause an immense amount of agitation within the city and it was this that she had hoped to avoid in the first place, but it was inevitable now.  The Oracle was the only one who could help her.  She would deal with bringing a faelan into the city when the time came.</span></div></div>",

She depressed a button on the equizitily engraved hilt and the blade blazed to life with an orangish yellow glow that illuminated the area some twenty paces around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the glow of her blade she could see the attackers moving towards her. There were perhaps ten of them. They were covered in thick shaggy furs that hid their features but she did not need to see their features to know they were Gromums. Inhuman beasts, raiders that roamed the waste-lands and would kill anything or anyone they came upon, but for them to attack a city was unheard of, their numbers were too few to attempt something like this. Things were far worse here then they seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards stood terror-stricken as the obvious leader of the Gromum's stepped forward to face the young girl that stood before him, sword at the ready. A guttural laugh escaped the towering beast's lips as he looked down upon her and then without warning he struck! A huge taloned hand shot out from beneath the folds of his furs aimed at the girl's throat but instead of feeling his razor sharp claws sinking into the soft flesh of her neck there was a burning pain and he jerked back: a severed stump were his hand once was. The beast screamed in pain and rage as green blood pumped from the wound with every beat of its heart. It threw its head back and howled in anger, the folds of its hood fell away to reveal its massive head. Yellow eyes glowed under high jutting brows that were hair covered and wrinkled skinned. Its mouth was filled with rows of needle sharp teeth and its serpents tounge whipped out lashing the air with its forked ends and sickly blue colour. It rushed the girl with all its tremendous strength but she stepped aside easily and the beast's momentum carried it past her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned and attacked again this time bearing a spiked club in its remaining hand. The earth shook as the beast's intended blow missed the girl and struck the ground. Her moves perfectly timed and choreographed as if she danced some sort of ballet of death and it ended as the creature's disembodied head hit the ground with a melon sounding thud, its dead eyes staring into nothingness. The remaining creatures, seeing their leader fallen, fled in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl turned to face the guards. She deactivated her sword and then said quietly, \"I've come to see the king.\"</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, an explosion tore a hole in the wall beside them, and a party of fifteen vicious-looking warriors stepped out and charged the surprised duo. The guard reached for his spear, but before he could do anything, a long, thin, heavily-armored warrior, who was obviously the leader, drew a large curved sword and sliced the unfortunate man\u2019s head off. As for Dauphin, before she knew what had happened, two burly warriors had stepped behind her, removed her energy sword and pinned her arms behind her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader stepped towards her and pressed his sword against her throat. \u201cMake any noise and you\u2019re dead,\u201d he barked. \u201cYou\u2019ll come with us now.\u201d He lifted his other arm to reveal an impressive, crossbow-like apparatus strapped to his arm, then fired a large arrow at a mountain cliff on the horizon. All of the men grabbed hold of the rope which was attached to the arrow, and soon they - and Dauphin - were sailing through the clouds towards the mountain. The kingdom grew smaller and smaller to Dauphin as she flew farther from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they had landed on the cliff, the leader tied Dauphin to a tree perilously close to the edge of the cliff, and pointed the blade at her throat. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cWill you tell us what we wish to know, or must I reveal my more unpleasant ways of getting information?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d asked Dauphin. The man nodded to one of his cohorts, who bashed her across the face with a heavy wooden club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know exactly what I\u2019m talking about!\u201d snarled the leader. \u201cYou are in cahoots with the Kammabvars. Lead me to them now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin\u2019s eyes widened. The Unseen Four! They were four mysterious men with great powers, who had long ago quit their respective home countries and wandered the wilderness together, vowing to protect the good and be terrible to the wicked. Although nobody had ever actually seen them, or known how to contact them, it was certain that they existed; their influence had been present in every major war or disaster as long as anyone could ever remember. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you think I work with them?\u201d asked Dauphin, confused. \u201cI don\u2019t even know them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s lying!\u201d barked the leader. \u201cCut her from the tree!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fat man with an axe slashed her bonds. Dauphin looked around in anxiety. There was nothing she detested more than being helpless; if only she had her energy sword, she\u2019d teach these clowns a lesson they\u2019d never forget. But, unfortunately, she didn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat man marched her to the edge of the cliff, and made her look down. They were at least three miles high. The ground was so far down it made her dizzy, and she had to shut her eyes to avoid blacking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell us or we drop you!\u201d screamed the leader again!</span></div></div>",

Either way they would kill her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said the leader. \u201cThrow her over the cliff!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat man moved to do so, but, suddenly, a rock flew out from behind a nearby tree and smacked him in the head, making a sound not unlike that of a bottle bursting. The fat man\u2019s eyes rolled back into his head, he went limp, and he tumbled past Dauphin over the edge of the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader looked around nervously, trying to find out who had attacked them. \u201cFan out!\u201d He ordered his men. \u201cFind our enemies and kill them!\u201d The warriors grabbed their weapons and prepared to move out, but suddenly, one of them broke into a wide grin. The next minute, all of them were lying on the floor, laughing like maniacs for no obvious reason, laughing so hard that they forgot to breathe and they all passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader was now the only one left. He grabbed his long, heavy curved sword and jumped behind Dauphin, pressing the blade against her throat. \u201cCome out or I\u2019LL KILL HER!\u201d he croaked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his sword began to shimmer, and became two swords. He held on to them as best he could with one hand (he used the other to hold onto Dauphin), but it became more difficult as each one multiplied into two, three, six swords. Finally, it was too much for him, and all the swords fell in a pile at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnarmed, and realizing he couldn\u2019t bend down to pick one sword up before his mystery attackers were upon him, he dropped to his knees and pleaded with Dauphin to protect him. Suddenly, Dauphin noticed her energy sword lying on the ground beside one of the comatose knights. She calmly walked over and picked it up, and did the same thing to the leader as he would have done for her: she cut his head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell done,\u201d said four simultaneous voices, and four unusual people stepped out from behind the tree. Dauphin didn\u2019t need a moment\u2019s thought; she knew, without ever having seen them, that they were the Unseen Four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them was a thin, bald middle aged-man, with a precisely trimmed mustache and goatee, dressed in a suit of raven black. A large gold abacus was slung across his back, with rows and rows of pearls painted red and green. He was\u2026 the Numerologist; probability and numbers were his to command. It was he who had caused the swords to multiply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother of them wore a black hood, which concealed his face, and in his muscular hand he clutched a mace, which glowed like a red-hot coal. He was\u2026 the Warman, the master of all weapons and the strongest man alive. It was he who had thrown the rock with the force to smash a skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third was dressed in a jester\u2019s outfit, complete with the three-pronged hat tipped with bells, and he wore a smiling mask as red as a radish. He was\u2026 the Majester, Lord of Laughter, Ruler of Rage, Sovereign of Sadness, Monarch of Madness and undisputed controller of all emotions. It was he who had made all the warriors laugh themselves to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final Kammabvar was by far the most mysterious of all. It was a walking tree in the form of a beautiful woman. He skin was rough bark, her eyes were amber, her hands were thick branches covered in sharp twigs, and her hair was a flowing curtain of green leaves that reached her feet. She was Embla the Soul Mirror, most powerful of them all.

It had three eyes and fire poured from its mouth. It saw them from its central eyes and slithered towards them, fangs raised hungrily. With a sinking feeling Dauphin recognized it as a Mountain Death Serpent, one of the most intelligent beasts in the wild. This beast, unlike most, actually knew how to use the various plants and animals of the forest to its advantage. It would not be easy prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawing her energy blade, she leapt towards it. Then she pointed towards the Unseen Four and shouted...  </span></div></div>",

And I - Zev - I was the best of them all. We were the last of the North bound region who defied Cardac. What is it to be a slave? My people never knew. We would die before we would surrender. And we did. We died in battle. We fought to the last. But I - I was not allowed that glorious portal known as death. I was denied the victory to die in battle, and was taken captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptive? Never I! Never! I plotted and planned, even as they prepared the gallows for my death. There was no honour in the death of a hanging. No Wolf ever hung like an ornament from the noose of such a man as Cardac! My golden eyes that betray my Wolf Clan heritage always burn, but they burned with a different light as I planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI might have gone mad in that little cellar that they had prepared for me. We of the Wolf Clan always ran free. And I was stronger than any - lithe and free. They said that I was the Spirit of the Wolf in flesh. I certainly would have gone mad in that tomb - that living tomb - had it not been for the voice that lived next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a captive from the south, and she sang her songs of grief for her family. She sang her songs of her tribe. They did not have such clans as we did, apparently. I wondered if the Wolves were the last that remembered the old ways. Perhaps. She told stories to herself, and I listened. She sounded old, but she spoke with clarity. She was wise - and told of the way across the wastelands, haunted by the Gromum, to a city where a wise king ruled.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI listened always. She spoke of her sister - Dauphin. I came to love this girl for her bravery. For the way she had fought Cardac - she had refused to be taken captive. I grew ashamed that she had fought so much better than I. Sometimes, the old woman would drift off to sleep in the midst of her talk of Dauphin, and I would grow desperate to know of what had happened to the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I know. I made it out of the cellar. They could not contain me. Not Zev. I lifted the latch of the old woman's cell. But she might have already been dead. I do not know. I made it through the wastelands. I feasted on the meat of the Gromum, and took their plunderings for my own. I was strong enough to make it. I swore I would find Dauphin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I have found her. She is better than I - but only in some ways. She already has wounded me. But even in this she was wise. She did not make it impossible for me to travel. She made it difficult for me to do any harm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it is not wise to have one with you who is stronger. So now what do I do? We have already left the city. I find myself drawn to her. She does not talk more than is needed. She is strong. But she will not reveal her reason for going to Cardac. I wonder why?\"</span></div></div>",

General protocol required kings to present themselves before common subjects at least once a week to deliver justice and patronize. She had shrouded memories of King Daray coming before his lesser audience on Mondays, but those were the merry days and it would be foolish to expect such exposure to danger now.... besides, it was all so hazy- now that she thought about it, Tuesdays rang a bell...<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nDauphin looked up at her small companion from under her eyelashes, irritation growing as she realized Rendle was mimicking her pose. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Come\", she said gruffly, turning on her heel and choosing an alleyway at random, \"let's get you home.\"<br>\r\nRendle quickly abandoned his position and hurried on her heels, making her stumble and pause outside a somber inn.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"This ain't the way to the Grotto,\" Rendle remarked worriedly, \"and I don't wanna go home. I wanna show the king my sto-\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nDauphin glanced suspiciously at the dusty windows of <i> The Plucked Fowl</i>,  and slowly released her hand from Rendle's mouth, knuckles white with suppressed tension. The boy looked suspiciously close to tears at her rough handling, and Dauphin realized a tantrum was imminent. She motioned that they should keep walking, and kept her hand on the pommel of her sword until they turned into a pleasant little town square. Rendle sat on the edge of the marble fountain in the centre and pouted pointedly at her. Dauphin glared back into his eyes before shaking herself out of such childish behavior. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Rendle, I can give the... your stone to the king soon. Tonight,\" she said, sighing as he moodily shook his head. She really did not need this. Dauphin wasn't sure why she was even bothering to escort an urchin she had just met home. Chances were he didn't have one, but just slept in the refugee campgrounds. It would explain his lack of a proper birthname. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As Rendle trailed his fingers through the water, and Dauphin stood in indecision, the rest of the city was much less placid. Rendle's ears pricked at the sound of distant fearful screaming, and he stood, gazing the direction that the sounds of human terror were echoing from. Dauphin frowned as the little boy got up. She spun around to see what he was looking at, simultaneously inhaling traces of smoke. Dauphin stepped up onto the fountain's edge to peer over the rooftops and could just make out flickering green flames leading off into narrow plumes of smoke. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Dragons,\" she told Rendle, only to see him racing away on short legs, down the alley they had just come through.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is forbidden!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloaked man jumped, his hood falling back to reveal a wrinkled and scarred face. \"My dear, you scared my old heart.\" He pulled out a small wineskin from a pocket hidden within his cloak.

He avoided her hand, swirling his cloak around him. Its colour flashed from black to blue to green and back to black. In an ominous voiced he intoned, \"I wield The Cloak of Anamoric, do not play games with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandle gasps from the corner where he had been hiding. \"My stone glows too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, then you must be the child I have been searching for.

Then he looked to the boy, and extended his free hand.  \"Come with me, child.  Leave this place behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRendle looked from the sorcerer to the portal, to the unconscious form of Dauphin.  The slightest hint of red showed at her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would deny me as well?\" Malkika curled his lip.  \"Then clearly I will have to be less kind than I had hoped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wrist rotated, and the sword did too.  Slowly, but getting faster with every moment, the sorcerer span the stolen blade around, thrumming through the air.  Then he took a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite fancy,\" Rendle remarked.  \"But I don't think that she's impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girl?\" Malkika snarled.  \"She should be grateful that she's sleeping.  Such pain-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, HER,\" Rendle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorcerer turned to follow the boy's gaze, and caught the hooves of the faelan right in the chin.  Catapulted over, he crashed to the ground, dropping the sword and breaking several bones, if the snaps were anything to judge by.  As his eyes closed, the portal did as well, and the stable was plunged back into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRendle saw that the stone in his hands had stopped glowing as well.  It must be worth quite a lot, he reckoned.  There would be plenty of people that would pay a fair price for it in the market.  It had been months since his last proper meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin still lay sprawled in the hay.  he didn't really owe her anything, he told himself.

She knew of only one person she trusted enough to hold onto that particular dreaded artefact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin allowed Rendle to follow her for a while, but led him down an alley where, sure that nobody was watching, she dropped him with a clout to the back of the head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she picked up the Stone, she felt a brief twinge of guilt, but she had long ago learnt that the ends justified the means.

The Stone was nothing less than an omen of doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know much specific details of its powers, but tales had followed in its wake of the bad fortune that befell all who glimpsed it.  It was also said to be a summoning stone for daemons, the gallstone of a god, a shard of Cardac's own throne....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the rumours were probably false.  She wouldn't be surprised if there was nothing intristically magical about it, and that its power was derived solely from the fact that those that saw it expected bad things to happen after hearing stories of bad things happening to those that saw it.  And in so thinking, they cause those very events themselves...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGah, what morbid thoughts, Dauphin told herself, shaking her head.  It could be some sort of psychic wave from the Stone -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough speculation.  She had to see the king, and warn him of the enemies at his gates.  Although presumably, after the attack he would already know.  She had thought herself well ahead of the beast hordes, but they clearly travelled a lot faster than her.

She should say something more, she knew.  She should feel something, too - sad; angry, if nothing else - but she couldn't find any emotion of that sort within her.  It was a simple fact, and she was fine with it.  In a way, that scared her more than the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!  Times are changing, and rulers must change with them!

Dauphin had run from her father, abandoned her birthright, because of what had gone on behind closed doors within the palace.

She always tried to hide who she was as long as possible. At least there was no weapon in sight now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to scare all my customers away?\" the bartender demanded angrily. Indeed, the bar had become noticeably emptier. Dauphin mentally grinned: it was as if the man's position gave him the courage to face her that was lacking in trolls almost twice his size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to cause trouble,\" said Dauphin pleadingly. \"I just want a meal and a place for the night. I won't bother anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, someone remarked audibly, \"Some humans have no taste! To cross...\" Dauphin shot a cold stare in the direction of the remark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If humans have no taste, how come no human has ever crossbred with a troll OR a goblin?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just because they have no taste,\" piped up a shortish, skinny goblin to some nervous laughter. Mostly, the bar's patrons just wanted to escape her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the barman addressed her again. \"What will the creanth have for dinner?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human food, of course,\" Dauphin said firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we don't have much demand for that, but I think we could find you some... beef. And perhaps I could fix you some potatoes...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be just fine, thank you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man disappeared in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was waiting for the food, Dauphin thought that there was something unusual about this bar. Despite the bar's refusal to admit human customers, the barman was obviously human. And, as she observed, the relationship that existed between him and the bar's non-human customers was friendly, if on the gruff side. As the girl watched, a large troll ordered a drink, threatening to eat the barman if he didn't like it. The man just laughed, saying, \"If you do, where will you get your next one? No-one else will serve you in this town.\" The drink finally arrived, and the troll quaffed it on the spot, apparently satisfied.... Then there was the way the man had called her a creanth. That would make him Fahrian, or possibly Seraelite. A long way from home, either way....  A most curious place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious that the cook wasn't very familiar with human food, but it was edible. It filled the stomach, too. After the last two weeks, that was more than satisfactory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin scanned the crowd again. They were still avoiding her eyes. Some of them were probably discussing her, judging by the furtive looks thrown in her direction, but they made sure to keep their voices too low for her to hear. It always happened this way. Dauphin knew she was safe here: no-one would be stupid enough to challenge her now that they knew who she was. Still, sometimes she just wished not to be such a freak, despite all the powers she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin felt a sudden desire to go to one of the little groups of drinkers and just talk, or even join in the horrible song trilled badly by a drunken goblin and his rowdy friends in a corner. No, they would all run away if she approached. She felt very alone. Always alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin decided to...</span></div></div>",

It was very painful for her to have traveled so far to assist the village and now she was being treated like the enemy.  Her father had told her she was to earn the trust of the village before she would be accepted in any foreign land.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troll leaned toward her and noticed her oval shaped earrings encrusted with rubies.  They were a gift from her father.  They belonged to her mother whom had passed away while giving birth to her in the bath house.  The mid wife said she was too small to bear a baby as big as Dauphin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your earrings, give them to me, they are mine, you stole them, you are a thief!  I will call the police and demand that you return them to my safe!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrolls were known to lie and cheat everyone.  That is why the kingdom was in such ruins.  Dauphin remembered her grandfather the village baker whose father was the nephew of the king of Octavias.  He had dealings with the trolls back in the old kingdom.  Her grandfather left the royal palace to take up baking, a craft he learned from the palace baker whom he fell madly in love with and bore her father.  This had caused him to lose his place in the line of succession, because the King had an arranged marriage arranged for him with the Princess of Emerald.  He did not agree with the arrangement because there was a condition in the marriage that stated her grandfather, Alcheas, must wear a skirt and leggings at all times and also he had to cut his ponytail off and allow the Princess of Emerald to boss him around.  This was something he could not deal with.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin used her knowledge of the trolls and their greedy ways to bribe the inn keeper into allowing her to stay in the tower area of the inn.  She asked where was the fresh bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bread, we haven't had bread for years?  What are you a crazed maiden or something, everyone knows there is not a crumb to be found in the kingdom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I apologize for my ignorance,\" she whispered.  \"I can make bread from a white powder called flour.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A white what you crazy gal?!\"  He tossed his head back and laughed loudly, revealing all the gold in his mouth that trolls were notorious for having in their teeth.  He also had a huge gold celtic cross around his neck with a massive chain that seemed to weigh five pounds.  The band played the troll music of the alleys, expressing their feelings of that period, which were violent tunes with trolls dancing around on stage acting like they were committing violent acts against one another.  There was ale all over the floor.  One of them tossed a cup over her head and she did not react as her father had warned her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tolerance\" she remembered he had taught her as a child, telling her stories of his travels to shoe the horses in the village of the trolls and how they were so anti-human.</span></div></div>",

Ever so slowly, she entered a more respectable part of the city.  The streets cleared of refugees, the homeless and other undesirables.  Beautiful stone and marble houses rose on both sides as she passed by.  Eventually, the houses grew to mansions and suspicious eyes of private guards began to watch her progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, the palace came into view, a giant sprawling building designed to awe the visitor and display the grander of the city.

They were distracted by the wet, miserable weather, and looked to her professional eye to be unworthy and slothful in their duties.

However,\" and here his eyes twinkled, \"if you would do yourself the pleasure of having dinner with me tonight in the palace, mayhap I may be persuaded to be more... forthcoming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin really didn't know what to say.  Obviously, she needed to get inside the city, and to offend the Crown prince would not be a good idea, but after how she'd seen him deal with other people she wasn't sure if she wanted to spend even another moment in his wretched company.</span></div></div>",

Tell them I have gone to find someone to convince them to let us in and implore them once again for our admittance.  As you speak with them, I will seek a more direct path to the governor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the corner.  Tamor turned back towards the guards, shielding Dauphin from their view as she deftly turned the corner hugging the wall.  As she suspected, there were other guards down the wall on this side too, but her movement had been slight enough to escape their attention.  She heard Tamor, in a loud voice, again imploring the guards for admittance.  Looking down the wall, Dauphin saw a tree whose branches were just inside the grounds.  Slowly unfastening a cord around her waist, she fixed her gaze on the guards in the darkness ahead.  Just then, a sound from down the road caught their attention.  In a flash she had lassoed the tree branch with her rope and pulled herself over the wall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin gazed from behind the tree at the large stone mansion before her.  A distance of about 50 feet separated the wall and the mansion, which was surrounded by a gravel path.  She furtively began to edge away from the wall when she heard footsteps on the path.  She ducked behind her tree again then glanced out to see a patrol of four guards go by.  As they turned the corner, she glanced around again and spied a small doorway on the side of the mansion.  Seeing no sign of more guards, she darted silently for the doorway.  Upon reaching it, she found it descended a few steps to a passage which was barred by a large knobless wooden door.  She went down to it and listened for any sounds on the other side.  Nothing.  She groped for some means of opening the door, but on pressing her hand on it, the door slid silently open.  She was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corridor before her was dimly lit with torches.  She went forward slowly.  Soon she came to another door, this time with a handle.  She opened it.  It led to a further corridor.  She had not gone more than a few steps when the door slammed violently shut behind her.  Without much choice she went forward, even more stealthily now.  The corridor opened on what appeared to be a large rotunda, though she could make out very little of it in the darkness.  She thought she heard movements as she stepped towards the center of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the room was ablaze with lights.  On all sides of her were guards brandishing pikes pointed in her direction.  She turned towards the man clad in black velvet robes, seated on a large wooden chair, almost a throne.  She met his firm penetrating gaze.  \"I\u2019ve been expecting you,\" said Governor Alczar.</span></div></div>",

And perhaps she came not to speak, but to spy and only speaks now being unable to spy any longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Dauphin, what have you to say for yourself?\" asked the Governor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Cardac will be here shortly and if you don't wish to have your head displayed on the battlements on the tip of a Cardacian spear, you must prepare and you will need my help --\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your help,\" shouted Kaltar, \"is this the same help you provided at Asgath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should know, Kaltar, that my loyalties lie with peace and truth, and with the same powers that I saved you from your folly at Asgath, I will use to preserve you from Cardac.  Their armies will be here within the week,\" replied Dauphin calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Within a week!\" cried the governor astounded. \"Where did you hear this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not hear it.  I left the Cardacian army 50 leagues from here.  That was 3 days ago,\" replied Dauphin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaltar, you reported to me that the Cardacians were at least 80 leagues away yesterday,\" said the governor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the word of my most trusted scouts and I had this word from them myself.  She lies my lord, and must be imprisoned,\" said Kaltar and, in a low and sinister voice, added, \"Who knows what the punishment awaits for those who would shield an enemy in this time of crisis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe governor turned to Kaltar, his eyes blazing, but only for a second.  Then he fixed his glance on Dauphin again.  For a second she thought she glimpsed understanding.  But then the governor's features hardened again and he said, \"Yes she must be imprisoned.  Guards, take her to the prison.\"</span></div></div>",

Bidding on the faelan had been a rash decision, as she had nowhere to live and no stables and now two faelans to support!  But she handed over the money with confidence and looked over her new faelan.  It was tied in several places - obviously the auctioneer had not trusted it not to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin walked closer and held out her hand to touch its fine silver mane, keeping as far from its jagged teeth as she could manage.  Not that such an act was difficult the way its head was captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.  Come with me,\" she told the creature and slowly undid the head restraint.  Its body was still captured, but if it wanted to attack her it was now capable of doing so.  Dauphin was intelligent enough to know, however, that its attention was elsewhere on her faelan Aeredne.  Aeredne was female and if she was not mistaken this faelan was definitely male and although it might not follow her anywhere it would happily follow Aeredne!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe undid the back restraints also, so the faelan was entirely free and guiding it with her hand alone walked through the crowd with Aeredne at her other side.  It was an amazing sight to the locals, who had seen the faelan's earlier viciousness - that this small girl had it seemingly under her power.  Dauphin hid an inner chuckle that they did not realise it was not her but Aeredne that had the faelan under her spell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madam, have you anywhere to stable those creatures?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin turned to face a well dressed man.

It was the bidder from the faelan auction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Those faelans of yours could be our only chance for survival,\" the bidder panted breathlessly. \"Let me lead the way on that male. You follow behind closely and carefully with your female.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As ridiculous as this sounded to Dauphin, her choices were limited to a rock and a hard place.  She reluctantly nodded her head in agreement, and quickly mounted her beautiful silvery-white faelan. The Unexpected Ally took to the sky after a brief dash, with Dauphin following in quick succession. The cool morning air whipped against her face as she gained speed, sending her long hair trailing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Dauphin heard a horrifying screech from above, and quickly turned her watery eyes toward the source of the sound. One of the heavily armored Cavalry units was swooping down for an attack, blood-red sword in hand, with Dauphin as the unfortunate target. Dauphin quickly attempted to evade the death strike, but the rider was dismounted from the faelan by an attack from the Ally. The heavily armored victim fell to hit the stone ground with a dull metallic thud, barely missing a frail old woman shrieking for her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The Ally quickly switched directions toward the Northwest, in the direction of the castle.  He was picking up speed, and Dauphin followed suit. The west side of the massive and grand castle was in sight, and in the dim orange light of the gradually rising sun shone at least a hundred white faelans rising to meet the opposition. The castle was now mounting a counterattack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The Ally quickly dove towards the area where the town's Flying Cavalry had gracefully risen to the challenge. Dauphin noticed an opening in the side of the castle, and apparently so had the Ally. Dauphin followed the Ally into a dimly lit passageway at the foot of the castle, and landed only feet away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The Ally spoke quickly. \"My name is Allan, and I can assure you that aiding you and this beautiful city is my top priority. I am a mercenary by profession, and I assume that you have some skill with weaponry also.\" Dauphin nodded in agreement as Allan continued speaking. \"This castle must contain weapons we can use. I suggest we procure these weapons and aid the town in it's counterattack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Dauphin was reluctant. She felt tears well up as she forced her eyes shut. It was going to be difficult facing the army that single handedly murdered her whole family and village. Could she face the trials ahead and avenge those that had fallen? She lifted her head and opened her mouth to reply...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dauphin was obviously considered the far lesser threat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the man was in for a suprise, as Dauphin withdrew her sword with a speed and agility that suggested long experience on the battlefield.  Within seconds she had brought her blade against his with such force his sword clattered out of his hand onto the street.

Two just turned on their heels and fled the carnage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, it's not safe to stay out here any longer,\" Makarin urged her, taking her back into the tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A meal for myself and the lady - she's earned it,\" Makarin told the barman and led Dauphin towards a smaller room at the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't harm those men.

She examined a couple of the other animals stabled there.  A bay mare whickered softly as the girl approached her stall and nuzzled her ear.  The girl appraised her carefully.  She did not look diseased.  In fact, she was well groomed and there was food in her trough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl turned to the faelan, \"Come with me, girl.\"  The faelan was a relatively intellegant beast and she obeyed readily enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stable boy woke with a start as the faelan's silver hooves stopped about an inch away from his ankle.

She kicked some of the wood clippings at her master, who giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a curry comb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy nodded,and handed her one from a shelf on the wall.  Then he left while she desaddled the faelan and brushed her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned a few minutes later with a pile of alfelfa, which he put into the trough.  The faelan looked from the food to the girl in distate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a carnivore...\" the girl explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened,  \"We don't have any meat, miss.

He had the characteristic red, veiny nose of a heavy drinker. His reflexes were no doubt dulled by years of whisky. She could probably disarm the man, even kill him, easily enough. But what would that accomplish? Whoever sent him wanted her alive. And she might not ever find out who it was if she didn\u2019t accompany him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe had a short knife in her belt and another, longer dagger, in her boot. There was no point in revealing her skill in weaponry and hand-to-hand combat just yet. The Boss, whoever he was, clearly didn\u2019t know that, despite her youth, Dauphin was an experienced assassin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe opened the door. The man with the knife smiled appreciatively as he noticed her skin-tight buckskin pants and shirt. She felt almost violated as he looked her up and down, but said only, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe man motioned with the knife, indicating she should precede him. As they descended the stairs, he whispered. \u201cWalk through the lobby. Don\u2019t talk to anyone. Remember, I got my knife right here in your back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDauphin did as he ordered. Outside, a light rain fell. \u201cTo your left,\u201d the man said. They walked through the darkness for what seemed like a mile. Dauphin kept track of what landmarks she could see in the half-moon light, so she would know exactly where he was taking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEventually they arrived at a one-story building quite a way from the tavern and the stables. Another man, standing guard, smiled when he saw them approach. \u201cGood work, Dolm,\u201d said the guard. \u201cThe Boss will be pleased.\u201d He opened the door and motioned Dauphin inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe found herself in a large room with a ceiling so low it nearly brushed her head. A short, heavy-set man sat at a desk. Two other men, apparently bodyguards, slouched in chairs against the wall. Sloppy, thought Dauphin. I could probably have a knife in each guard\u2019s throat before they knew what had happened. But then she\u2019d never learn why a man had abducted her at knifepoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe fat man said, \u201cThank you for coming at such short notice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDauphin didn\u2019t think it was funny. \u201cYou didn\u2019t give me much choice. Why couldn\u2019t you have waited till morning and then asked me politely?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause you might have said no.\u201d He motioned her to a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe sat down, but remained alert, ready to spring to her feet if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy name is Wel Dun,\u201d the man said. He waited, apparently expecting Dauphin to introduce herself. She remained silent. After a moment he went on. \u201cYou entered the gate of our city with a faelan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat was he after, Dauphin wondered. Was he going to demand her steed for himself? Everyone knew a faelan was loyal to only one person. If it was loyal to any human at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI have a faelan myself,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat bit of information surprised her. The stable boy said they had had no faelans previously. And if there had been a domestic faelan in the city, she would likely to have known it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh, I don\u2019t keep it around here,\u201d the man continued. \u201cI built a special pen for it several miles to the east.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSurely you know that a faelan should never be penned up,\u201d said Dauphin. \u201cThey need to be free, to fly, to hunt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes, but if I let it fly free, it wouldn\u2019t be mine any more, would it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt\u2019s not yours now, she thought. Aloud, she said, \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI need someone to break and train the beast, so I can ride it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFaelans respond to love and gentle coaxing, if they respond at all. Dauphin knew one could never be \u201cbroken.\u201d It came to its rider willingly or not at all. It would die before it allowed itself to be ridden against its will. \u201cI can\u2019t help you.\u201d She stood up. \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need my beauty sleep.\u201d She stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy dear,\u201d said the fat man, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I must insist.\u201d He gestured to the two guards, who came to their feet brandishing swords.</span></div></div>",

If she could kill one quickly, the other one would likely present no problem. Still, they had swords while she had none. Better to discretely bide her time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat back down and said to the Boss, \u201cI have information for the Lord Of The City. Important information, concerning the war in the north.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d agreed the Boss. \u201cBy all means, pass your intellegence along to Lord Antirr first thing in the morning.

As if reading her thoughts, he grinned and said, \u201cA faelan is a fearsome beast in the open, but yours is penned in a stable... and it\u2019s not arrow proof.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin cursed her self for twenty kinds of idiot. She should have let her mount roam free outside the city. Here she thought she\u2019d done it a favor by bringing it to a warm, dry stable. The Boss had posted a guard at the stable who would kill her mount if she attempted to retrieve it and flee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough clenched teeth she asked, \u201cMay I go now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly, my dear,\u201d agreed the Boss. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the gate at the ninth hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she was out of sight of the Boss\u2019 building, Dauphin backtracked to the stable. It looked dark and quiet.  Silently, she crept closer and heard voices coming from inside. She didn\u2019t want to look in and announce her presence, so she stood outside and listened. She heard the voice of the stable boy. He was apparently playing cards with another man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d really kill a faelan, Mokker,\u201d said the stable boy. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful, magnificent animals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they are, and tame ones are incredibly rare,\u201d said the other voice, apparently Mokker. \u201cBut the Boss told me to kill it if that dame tries to cross him. I aim to follow the Boss\u2019 orders, seein\u2019 as how I\u2019ve grown inordinately fond of breathing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like there was only one guard in the stable. The Boss and his men were still taking Dauphin lightly. They had no clue that she was a highly trained assassin. She could dispose of the guard here at the stable easily enough. But then what? The boss would be gunning for her. She\u2019d have to leave the city.

We must build up from here and stop letting others dictate our actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall woman clothed in oak leaves stepped into the moonlight and blocked her path. In the pale glow of the full moon, there were no colors, but Dauphin could see that the woman's complexion threw back little light. It seemed tight, draw harshly across strong cheek bones, prominent from near starvation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cannot pass here, human.\" The voice was dry, raspy. Dauphin suddenly noticed the woman's hair was not \"hair\" at all! A Dryad had woken from its slumber to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant no disrespect, Keeper of the Tree, and what a fine tree it is! But I cannot return the way I came. I am the last of my house and I am hunted, even as you are, even as your daughters are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dryad stood motionless. Slowly, as if studying Dauphin and Miriam in detail, she moved her head from side to side. Eventually, she stepped forward and touched Miriam's muzzle. She gently stroked the faelan's nose, then her cheeks. To Dauphin's surprise, Miriam did not object. She lowered her head so the dryad could fondle her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see she loves you, human. Though I cannot imagine why. Do you know her true name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin was puzzled. What did a dryad know about faelan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name is Miriam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dryad looked up from where she was caressing the faelan's forehead.  She frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her true name is Starfinder. If you had let her guide you instead of forcing her to your path you would be free of my lands and our paths would never have crossed. Because Starfinder loves you, I will let you live, but there is one condition. You must remove the reins and never guide her again. Talk to her. Tell her where your thoughts are leading you, then let her choose the path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin's first impulse was to simply command Miriam to destroy the dryad. The downside, she knew, would be her own death at the hands of the dryad's daughters and sisters hovering even now in the shadows of their trees where she could not see them. She would fight hard and it would be a find, honorable death, but there would be no poets to sing of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not want to be forgotten by dying in a forest and becoming mulch. She dropped the reins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot reach the bridle from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile that was almost warm, the dryad removed the bridle and reins and let them fall to the forest floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now tell Starfinder what your seek and let her take you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoubt filled her mind, but now she had no way of guiding her faelan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miriam...\" she began, but the dryad frowned at her and looked about to strike, \"...pardon me, Starfinder, I need shelter, food, and a place to start a new life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was dimly lit; business done here was not meant to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she knew it was probably useless, she looked for Fallon.  A few darkly clad men sat at the bar; more men clustered around tables.  They spoke in a hushed, controlled manner.  This was not a place for drunks.  In fact, it was not a place for most men, even those without a soft spot for alcohol.  \"Men.\"  The first jitters creeped into her body then and she cursed them under her breath.  A woman in this place would be suspicious, but she had no other alternative.  He had told her to meet him here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door seemed to brood before her.  Her nerves dulled as she took a deep breath, and she pushed the door open.  Though the door was heavy, she pushed it open with ease.  A few men looked up at the noise, and she noticed their faces as she kept hers blank.  With a sixth sense she'd developed through necessity, she noted that many other men had noticed her entry.  Whispers stopped momentarily as more men glanced her way.  She felt an especially intense gaze and let her eyes drift to a table near the window where a man indeed was looking intently at her, his dark eyes hidden under the long straight hair that hung over the sides of his face.  His blonde hair was in striking contrast to his dark features, and as she noticed his strong nose and curved lips, she felt a weakness run through her that she had not expected.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, she turned away and inspected the other side of the room.  His eyes still bore into her; she could feel their intensity, which was not letting up.  Could he feel her heart, beating quickly?  She wondered if this was Fallon.  It would be a dangerous gamble to make in this place, but she felt a connection to this man.  </span></div></div>",

Whispers arose as the men returned to their hushed conversations, keeping a wary eye or ear on the curious stranger.  Lithely she weaved through the tables, watching the man as she approached.  He sat alone, appearing deep in thought.  He made no gesture of welcome and made no attempt to even acknowledge her approach, but she felt an awareness in him and knew he was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fallon,\" she whispered matter of factly as she sat lightly into the chair opposite the man.  It was hard and roughly hewn, and obviously made for a person larger than she.  It hurt to sit; the days of riding had left her bruised and tender.  Stoically, and out of necessity, she disregarded the pain and concentrated on the man's face, his body.  Body language was often easier to read than faces, especially if the eyes were obscured.  Already she had focused her psychic energy on the man.  She would need to use her every ability here, she knew.  There was no room for mistakes.  Not one of her senses warned her of bad intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atalia,\" the one word was spoken with eloquence, rolling off the tongue with a dark sensuality that sent her nerves tingling.  He looked up then, and his dark eyes caught the light from every candle in the place and flickered there, a thousand lights dancing, reflecting back into her eyes.  She was mesmerized by the magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" almost an incoherent whisper was her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is full of danger,\" his eyes searched hers, and the depth of his eyes reflected the danger she too knew was all around them. \"Every minute in this place is a risk.  Too many eyes watch, too many ears hear our words,\" he glanced slightly to his left.  A chair creaked; a man looked away.  After a few seconds he continued, \"We must leave.  Follow me, Atalia, to a place where we can speak alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery whisper in the place sounded like a scream to her ears.  It was too strong, too sudden.  Too new.  It was a feeling not to be trusted, but as his magnetic eyes pulled her in, she felt that it was.</span></div></div>",

His pace was brisk and though she was tall for a woman, occasionally she needed to jog to keep up.  It was odd the way he moved, with a steady, sure, almost calculated gait.  It reminded her of a faelan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she began to tire and lag behind, he stopped abruptly, his heavy cape left swirling behind him.  After a sharp-eyed survey, he stepped to his right and disappeared.

Though given a layout of the city with the important buildings and places meticulously described, she had no idea where she was.

She could not guess the time she had traveled, but it had been a fair distance and she doubted she could track her way back.  Not to mention, a young woman traveling alone after dark here was an easy target and would not cross the street alone at this time if she could help it.  Cold rain stung her cheek and ran down her back as she glared into the dark alley into which her guide had disappeared.  A mere two feet separated the buildings on either side, niether of which she recognized.  There was no light.

She could neither stay in the open nor safely follow Fallon through dark, unknown alleys but unfortunately she had left herself no other choice.  She knew she had a better chance of fighting off one man in a narrow alley than five or six men in the street.  Nearly any man would be stronger than she, but it did not escape her that the narrow confines of the alley would prevent him from using his full strength against her.  Still she remembered the way she had been captivated in the saloon.  The enchantment had faded, but the connection had not; it was nerves that caused her to doubt the strength of that feeling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFallon was the only person she knew in this city, and she couldn't truthfully say she knew him.  Seven moons ago she had recieved a strange but intriguing letter addressed to a name that only her mother had ever called her:  Atalia.  The rest in their small village knew her as Dauphin; she doubted anyone else knew even of her existence.  In the first letter the writer had earned her belief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was very young, her family had fled a wealthy city.  In fact she was too young to remember anything but the briefest flashes from that time, but she'd been told stories.  On the darkest of nights, when snow blew in under the slats of wood in the walls of their home and the wind wailed its sad song in the trees, she would share the bed with her mother, sister and younger brother.  They would stave off the cold that way, and her mother would stave off the sadness by telling captivating stories about the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd been very wealthy once, she explained, with a house that was never cold, food that never ran out, and a fine stable that was never empty.  Colorful rugs from Traebol decorated the floors; jewels from Koche decorated their necks.  In the winter, the hearths were alight with an unending supply of logs, and they would sit and wave their feet in front of the fire to warm them.  Then, when their cheeks would glow red like apples in the summer, they would be carried to sleep in beds stuffed with the soft feathers of birds.  They had even had a family crest, a red faelan with a man on its back.  But the two were flying, like in the old myths, rather than on the ground like they are actually ridden.  There was a story about the crest, her mother had said, but she hadn't heard it in so long that she couldn't even remember it.  In her dreams Atalia had seen the crest, clearly as if she were awake, with the red faelan and defiant rider.  But in her dreams, the person riding the faelan was not a man.  It was her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when she opened the tiny package wrapped up inside the letter and found a gold ring with red Faelan and rider exactly as her mother described the crest, she knew it was no lie.</span>                 </span></div></div>",

It was not a pleasant smell and she moved her riding cape over her nose to block it out.  Eyes wide open, Atalia walked as quickly as she dared and the sounds of her boots on the stone floor echoed softly back at her.  She could hear her breath in her ears and, because she could see little more than the black silhouette of the tops of the buildings against a dark navy sky, all four of her other senses were heightened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her in the street she'd left, new voices had materialized.  First there were two, and then more joined in; she could not discern how many, though it seemed not more than four.  As they talked, she heard metal tapping against the cobblestone.  Horses.  She glanced back, heart beating hard in her chest, but could see nothing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are sure?\" It was a soft voice, perhaps a woman's, but it was so muted from the distance that Atalia really could not tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she is here.

Moments later hooves clattered against the cobblestones and they were gone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtalia breathed a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall shadow to her right and then the same dark voice, \"Many know of you; of this you were not told.

As she walked, she scrutinized the dark, obscured ground for anything she might trip over.  A faint beam of light fell from the alleyway then and she saw it was clear of debris; she looked up to find the man's caped figure retreat behind a door in the building, letting it close behind him but leaving a crack of light to guide her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she pushed the door open cautiously she was greeted by the warm glow of a room lit by candlelight.  The spaciousness of the room took her by surprise, as did the warmth of furnishings and smell of cooked food.  Immediately a hunger pain stabbed its way through her stomach and she became aware of her hunger.  She'd not eaten since that morning, and only a few stale flakes of bread and dried fruit pieces at that.  Carefully she shut the door behind her and, seeing the two locks this side of the door, locked them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine you'd like a warm meal.  There's food here,\" his voice echoed from around a dividing wall and she instinctively headed toward it, being sure to stay well away from any pieces of furniture or delicate looking decorations.  Inspecting the room as she walked, she saw that there was a large hearth on the wall opposite her.  It was well stocked with logs and she could faintly feel the warmth it provided even from where she was standing.  Her body relaxed further and she allowed her eyes to roam.  Though the floor was bare, the room was well furnished and, she thought, well lived in.  Chocolate-colored leather furniture was placed before the fire and she longed to lay her tired body on the long armoire.  A few throw blankets promised extra protection from chill.  She continued to her left, away from the couches and hearth and toward what she assumed was the kitchen.  Beyond the hearth and furniture to her right was an open door, with no light beyond.  On the walls hung a number of lanterns, all unlit; a few tables held enough glowing candles to prive all the light that was needed.  A large mirror - a luxury - hung on the back wall before her, reflecting the dark room mysteriously.  The last thing she saw before she rounded the dividing wall were the glorious pictures.  Rather than hunting animals for their heads and their skins, whomever had decorated this home had hunted them for their soul; beautiful paintings of animals adorned the walls and lent vibrant color to the room.  Paintings of horses, wolves and faelans.  Dragons, even, though she had never seen one and was never entirely convinced they existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Fallon put a wooden bowl before her and her nose and eyes recognized it as stew.  It was gone within minutes and she asked for more.  Fallon watched her silently, his dark eyes brooding, hiding his thoughts.  She sensed his seriousness and the gravity of his thoughts, but was not skilled in mind reading and could not tell what words passed behind those eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater he showed her the other rooms of the home; there was the room she saw upon entry, a back room with stacks of books with bound papers and detailed maps dotting the walls which was directly behind the entry room, and three of what looked like bedrooms.  These were what lay beyond the dark doorway in the entry room.  They had beds - larger than those at home - and her bones complained to her wearily when she saw them.  Thankfully she was instructed that this is where she would sleep tonight, and Fallon left her there momentarily as she dropped her traveling bag next to the bed and straightened the quilts blanketing the large bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes notified her of his return - it was impossible not to feel when he lay them on her.  Curiously she looked up and studied his face, opened her mind to his.  He would speak now, she realized, and quietened her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You passed the test,\" he stated and it seemed as if he were congratulating her.  \"I've asked you to do things you should not have done, that were against common sense and everything you know, and you did them.  You know I speak the truth,\" he smiled slightly as he said 'truth'.  \"Words cannot be trusted.  They are dangerous; they can break a strong man's heart and kill the best warrior.  By your actions I'm ensured of your trust and don't need to ask it, but I want you to know that everything I ask of you, I ask for a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" she said, sitting upon the bed for the first time.  It was soft and her body sunk gently into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow we will begin your training.  Sleep well; you will need your strength.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he left and the remaining doubt lingering in her mind retreated with him.  Exhausted, she fell upon the bed and pulled the blankets close around her chin.  Slowly the lights which seeped through her eyelids faded and she was asleep.                 </span></div></div>",

With a happy sigh, she stretched luxuriously in the bed.  She'd slept fabulously, and had not woken up a single time during the night.  It was rather odd, she thought, considering where she was, but the thought did not concern her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had been up awhile, had made the bed and organized her things, Fallon poked his head into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, thank you,\" she replied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  Nightmares are a sign of discontent with the gods.  Good sleep speaks of the gods' good will.  We can proceed with training as planned,\" he paused to gauge her reaction and, satisfied as she held his eye, continued, \"There are two methods of training you must choose from, as you cannot do both.  One is Varchi'va, to train you for mental battle.  No doubt you know of your inborn talents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtalia nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other is Honci'va, to train for physical battle.  Also you have talents here - most men are warriors and have little knowledge of the damage well trained female warriors are capable of.  Each has their own strengths and weaknesses, and once you begin with one you may never learn the other.  Your bath has been readied,\" he motioned for her to follow him, \"and breakfast will be ready thereafter.  I will expect a decision from you when I see you next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he opened an old wooden door to reveal a small but clean and bright bathroom, complete with steaming bathtub.  Gratefully she unrobed, sank into the bath and began to think of training.</span></div></div>",

Looking up, he noticed without surprise that  both the night's rest and the short bath had done much to improve her mood and condition.  They had little time and the matter of training would best have been cleared up last night, but doing so would have put undue stress on the girl.  Already she had travelled days on the back of a faelan and while there were worse ways to travel, the exhaustion had been apparent in her manner and he knew it would have been a mistake to push her any further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have decided?\" he asked as he rose to retrieve the mash-grain he had prepared for breakfast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind his back, her face twitched with irritation.  Was he always this impersonal?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a slight pause, she responded, \"Yes.  There was little choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFallon turned around, bowl of grain and glass of milk in hand.  Carefully he set it in front of her, pushed the utensils toward her, and took a seat across the table.  He leaned forward, and the emerald green sleeves of his robe pulled back to reveal worn but strong hands which he set, clasped, on the table.  He looked at her for a moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems to me it was a very big choice,\" he said pointedly, watching as her chewing slowed and she looked him in the eye.  There was a twinkle in her eye and a twitch of a smile on her lips.  She knew he was testing her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems to me that's not your call to make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInwardly he laughed, and let her eat in peace for a few moments as he studied her.  She had her father's grey eyes and flaxen hair and her mother's pale complexion and long, slim frame.  Also he knew she had inherited the gift which had skipped her mother but ran in her entire family's blood, and he knew without having to ask which training she would pursue.  There really was little choice, he agreed silently.  It was her destiny, and she burned to follow it.  It was why she had come this far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtalia stopped chewing for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Varchi'va,\" she said, and met his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" he nodded and continued, \"That leaves the question of how, exactly, you would like to begin training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA question sprung to her grey eyes, and they glittered like glass.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to begin training with friends,\" he asked slowly, holding her gaze and then continuing in a dangerous voice, \"or against enemies?\"</span></div></div>",

Atalia had noted his height the night before, but now as she sat watching him, well rested and with clear thoughts, she considered it again.  Any serious enemy would recognize him from a good distance not only because of his height - native residents here were usually of a shorter, stockier build and most foreigners were easy to spot - but because of his distinctive gait as well.  With herself alongside, she doubted they would go unnoticed by any but the most distracted of people.  Her mind wandered back to the horses and voices she had heard the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wore the ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtalia had been twirling the ring around her finger idly, but now she quieted her fingers as she looked down.  As she had done many times before, she noted the bright gold band, the smooth glossy red of the faelan and the clear stone which twinkled in its eye, and the silvery, shimmering rider on its back.  It was a beautiful ring and she had appreciated it as such from the first time she'd seen it, but now as she gazed at it with the knowledge that it represented something real, something more than the fantasy she'd played in her head for the past seven moons, it took on a new importance and a new beauty.  Enemies would notice it, she knew, but the realization was not enough to make her take off the ring.  Suddenly she felt that it belonged there, a part of herself that she'd not known of for so long and one that she was entirely unwilling to hide.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly hypnotized, she stared at the ring, suddenly oblivious to all else, including Fallon.  He stood, feet away from her, piercing brown eyes resting on the ring.</span></div></div>",

It was as he remembered it and though he knew it was hers by right, he marveled to see it on her hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     With an inborn skill that had been developed over tens of years, he read the thoughts which streamed through her mind, cataloguing them incase they would help him later.  But for now he simply listened, curious to know what was going through her head.  Last night he had discovered that she was surprisingly good at mind-blocking and until now, he'd been mostly unable to break through the block that she had held up.  Realizing now how powerful she was, a chill ran up his spine and he worked immediately to block it.  There were so few of the masters left that he knew she'd had no prior training.  Rather, she had a gift beyond that of any of their living line.  Should she be captured and used in the wrong hands, she would be an exceedingly difficult force to defeat.  Should the wrong side earn her loyalty, Fallon had little hope that their line would exist at all after this war was over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"It is time,\" he spoke finally.

Autumn was coming fast and while the days were still warm, the nights were getting colder and the lingering morning chill nipped at her hands and cheeks.  Pulling the dull, black robe that Fallon had loaned her closer around her body, she watched the curled red, orange, and yellow leaves tumble down the gray cobblestone street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively stepping sideways, she narrowly missed tripping over Fallon's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pay attention,\" he warned, assessing the crowded street head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFallon slipped into the street; Atalia balked, waiting for an opening in the stream of people.  Dark, hooded head bobbing, Fallon was quickly retreating down the street and Atalia pushed reluctantly into the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" she appologized to a woman in red after she bumped her, and then immediately ran into a very tall man, who gave her a nasty look.  Bodies came orderlessly from left and right and Fallon was nearly out of sight.  Atalia wondered how he could possibly be getting through this that quickly.  Knowing she was about to lose him, Atalia felt her heart beat wildly in her chest.  Then, he disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to panic, she walked faster than she thought she could have.  All these people.  She'd never seen so many people in her life.  She fought the suffocating feeling of being surrounded by so many people.  As she walked faster, heading off tingles of panic, a funny thing happened.  She began to anticipate people's movements.  it began slowly, with a feeling that a person would move left or right, and as she began to lose herself in concentration, she began to see paths through multiple people.  When she began to see colors, the crowd began to part around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly she stopped.  She stood stalk-still, breathless, then her eyes were drawn to the left where someone sat on the steps of a shop.  They were looking directly at her.   </span></div></div>",

Though she was no stranger to death, the Imperial Guards were well known for their prowess in battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw them coming towards her, armored and muscular.  Realizing that no sensible girl would wish to be caught in their path, she made it appear that she was trying to conceal herself in the shadow of a nearby house.  The guards paid little attention to her.  She breathed a sigh of relief as the last few ranks passed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly her plan exploded into infintesimal fragments.  She saw a bearded, sneering face she recognized - and worse, Morkan obviously recognized her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Dauphin!\" he snarled.  \"It's their girly captain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards turned in surprise, but at the sight of Morkan drawing his sword and advancing on her they joined him, blades at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin cursed inwardly.  Pressing her back to the wall, she drew her own weapon and screamed through the mind-link, Delpheus, get over here now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards closed in on her.  Without waiting for them, Dauphin lunged forward, beneath one man's guard, to thrust her sword into his gut.  He screamed as she ripped the blade out and then there was nothing but chaos.  Dauphin dodged a sweep at head height to kick a man heavily in the shin, punch another in the face and decapitate a third.  A guard blocked her stroke and she kicked him in the groin before whirling to ram her sword into the rib cage of a man behind her.  The sword grated on bone; she tugged harder, trying to free it from the suction of the dead man's flesh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinging the weapon around, it bit into a man's neck, and blood spurted everywhere.  Elbowing another man in the ribs, she hooked his feet out from under him but his weight bore her to her knees as he fell towards her.  Shoving him aside, she blocked one stroke aimed at her head but was powerless to defect another which crashed down onto her shoulder, splintering her collarbone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wordless howl of agony she thrust her sword upwards into the grinning face of the man above her.  Blood showered from his ruined visage as he screamed.  Suddenly Dauphin's vision exploded in crimson bursts as a pair of heavy hands tightened around her throat. Choking for breath, her mind growing numb, she pulled her knife from her boot and slashed desperately at her adversary.  He roared with the pain and hurled Dauphin from him.  Flat on her back a heavy boot drove into her ribs; she tripped the man and they grappled on the ground.  His hand forced her head backwards; she bit him till the blood came and hooked at his eyes with the fingers of her uninjured hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInjured, half-strangled, Dauphin knew that if help did not come she would die here, in these muddy streets, within a minute. Where, in the name of Faire herself, was Delpheus? </span></div></div>",

The sounds of running footsteps approached and the door opened. \"Oh! Are you okay? Do you hurt?\" A female voice said, and Dauphin looked to see a blue-haired girl standing beside the makeshift bed, holding a cup of what she presumed was tea. The weird thing about the girl was her ears. They were about eight inches long, ended in a point, and went down wards. Her eyes were a clear blue, and she wore a crimson headband. \"I hurt... my collarbone... where am I?\" Dauphin said hoarsely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Haruka, and you are in my house. I'm sorry about the mess. Here, I made the tea for when you woke up. It has some pain-relief herbs. They might not make it better, but they'll take the pain away for a while.\" The girl, Haruka, said softly, before placing the teacup next to Dauphin and grabbing a few flat pillows, propping them up behind her so she could drink easily. She forced the teacup into her hands and said, \"I am really truly sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin quirked an eyebrow. 'What was she sorry for?' she thought, and Haruka, as if seeing the question in her eyes, said softly, \"Your brother is dead. My sister, one of the royal army soldiers, set up a magic barrier. His wings were destroyed and he plummeted. I couldn't save him.\" Haruka looked down sadly at that, and Dauphin would of started to cry, but she saw another person walk into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haru~! You have to go and play your victory songs~!\" A masculine, but still slightly feminine, voice sang. Dauphin looked over at him. He had long emerald green hair, and ears like Haruka's. He wore, strangely, a white dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! I almost forgot! Oh, this is Seth! He'll look after you when I am gone, okay?\" Haruka said and didn't wait for an answer.

She then went into the engarde position and challenged the King's son.  He came running at her with the sword en pointe to stick her in the heart.  She parried the attack and kicked his feet out from under him, then knocked him unconscious with a blow from the butt of her sword.   She let her brother bind their enemy and walked over to the balcony with hands outstretched.  The roar of approval rang throughout the courtyard. </span></div></div>",

Two guards were easily killed off. An army that had no magic, nor steel. Dauphin disarmed their greatest magician with just one word. His flesh dripped off his bone like water from a gutter, leaving nothing but gray ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelpheus, her twin brother, had proved to be less vital than she believed.

I could cut you down, and free your spirit to whatever hell it is destined to be in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe killing blow did not come. But though she felt fear in the rawest form, she did not repent.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Khar'rith soon found himself in a rather large stable that appeared to be inhabited by many other animals of diverse sorts. A marketeer's stable, he thought. A few costumers walked by at intermittent times. They looked upon the faelan with awestruck eyes, a look that quickly faded to disappointment as they realized they could never afford such a beautiful and mysterious creature. This, of course, brought smug satisfaction to Khar'rith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rhythm of awed and disappointed customers became almost predictable to the faelan. He was ready almost to destroy the ridiculous stable and run, hoping to find cover in order to conceal himself. C onceal himself with that magical Art that all faelans are taught by their parents, who in turn learned it from theirs, who learned it from theirs, and so on, back to untraceable roots. Legend had it the Art was taught to the first created faelan by one of the gods themselves. But Khar'rith hated the gods, and so did all faelans he knew. No, not a god. It must have been one of the Fallen. The great and mighty Nethergods. The first faelan must have been created by one of them as his worthy steed, Khar'rith mused. In fact, it was once said that -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one, Mum! He's so pretty!\" Khar'rith first shuddered about being described by such a detestable term. After he gathered himself, he finally assessed his situation. He was being picked for purchase. No matter - it was a small boy, barely ten winters. His parents were about to grab his hand and lead him away, saying \"Maybe something else, sweetheart.\" But to the faelan's surprise, they did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure, son? Yes, he is beautiful!\" Khar'rith shuddered again. Please not them, he prayed to whatever force moved these disgusting people. They were dressed much better than any of the other humans he had seen. And they were clean, surprisingly clean. Rich, he thought. And therefore able to afford a market-priced faelan. But the stench of righteousness oozed from their pores. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parents made their way to the market clerk, but the boy stayed behind. Khar'rith tried his best to pretend he didn't notice the boy standing there, staring up at him with that stupid smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dad said you're a faelan.\" Idiot child who would talk to an animal that wasn't even paying attention, much worse that was expected to not even understand human speech. With a bite of cold irony, Khar'rith realized he was, and could. Either the boy was incredibly stupid, or staggeringly intelligent. He was human, so it must be the former. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard stories about you. Um... your kind, I mean. I want to name you, since you're going to be mine now.\" Great, the faelan thought. Not another confounded human name. Horsey Worsey, he thought to himself, and chuckled at his own wit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll name you Khar'rith. I read about a faelan named that once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhar'rith stumbled visibly backward, and almost fell to the ground. The boy giggled. Yes!  Yes, his name had been taken from the steed who assisted Galfalad, the greatest of human kings. It was a common name for a faelan, however. But still, he was awestruck. His heart began to warm to this boy, who had actually called him by his real name. But he suddenly noticed this warming, and quickly hardened his heart once again. Stupid human. Yes, stupid. That's what he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parents returned. They led the faelan away out of the congestion of the inner city and up to the hills.</span></div></div>",

Slowly walking down the street and trying not to look too out of the ordinary, her thoughts slowly started clearing up, easing her racing mind. <i>This dark-cloaked 'master' character couldn't possibly leave the city with it... or could he?  He had enchanted - and killed - the stablehand.</i>  Suddenly she froze, her blood frozen cold yet again.  <i>It wasn't any ordinary thief that stole my faelan, it was one of the Dark Cloaked Beings, and that meant she either was really clumsy in charming her way into the city, or there had been someone spying on her....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that would mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something covered her eyes, then her body, and before she could cry for help something hard fell upon her head, and everything went painfully blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head ached horribly.

Ooze drooled from its disfigured mouth, lined with long sharp teeth, and black, matted hair fell to the cold stone floor all around, which, near the creature, was covered in red blood - the same color as its three bulging eyes directly above the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye,\" boomed Zephoras' voice, now distant and behind her, and was followed by the same strange... metallic, she realized... clicking sound she had heard earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the clicking stopped, she felt the binding force release her, and, caught unaware, she fell forward onto her hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature immediately released an ugly, gurgling roar, and began to cautiously stalk its prey, crawling left and right, gauging Dauphin's weaknesses and reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin had faced such a creature before, but her heart sank when upon searching her newly-freed body she realized she had been stripped of her weapons and belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't panic,\" she told herself, glancing around the room.  Above there was an iron chandelier, unlit, and fixed upon the three visible walls was a single flaming torch.  She sought to look behind her, but she knew all too well it would be a fatal mistake to turn away from the <i>trynzar beast</i> - its reflexes were formidable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe failed to see the dark figure hiding in the shadows above the chandelier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as they said she would come, she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now... <i>his</i> time had come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow will YOU decide their fates?</span></div></div>",

True, she had always wanted to be a warrior, but girls just didn't become fighters in her country.

She had been experiencing the most terrible dream: that she had been dragged away from home, lost in a strange city and then shot by an arrow....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\"  The light burned her eyes as she forced them wearily open.  It wasn't a dream.   She was sitting, half-propped against a wooden trough, being shaken roughly by a man whose status seemed little higher than her own.  So much for a knight in shining armour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave the girl be, Ingleby.  She is conscious now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDauphin tried to move to look, causing pain to shoot through her right side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't do that.  You have an arrow in you still,\" the same voice replied wryly, the speaker moving in front of her as she did so.  A gentleman, although shabby in attire, perhaps four or five years older than Dauphin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My servant will go and try and find a healer,\" the man added.  \"Although I hold little hope.  There are thousands of refugees here, many with wounds more serious than yours.  We have so little gold left that I can be of no great assistance to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cultured tone and tattered but rich clothes made sense now: this man was a noble, but now a homeless one due to the war.  Despite her fatigued, injured  state, Dauphin could not help but be overjoyed that someone of such a high status was even talking to her.  \"I'll be fine,\" she gasped.  \"Just help me to my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on the man's face showed little faith in her words, so Dauphin moved to do so herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe promptly fainted.</span></div></div>",
