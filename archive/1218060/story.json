The blonde teenager stood up, his stomach expanding a good 5-inches from his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\nAfter much work, Naruto had finally gotten his pants buttoned, \"Wow, that was tough, maybe these shrunk in the wash or something?\" Naruto dismissed the thought, and headed out the door, to his favorite place i the whole village, Ichiraku Ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto walked through the town, Kakashi poofed next to him, \"Hey.\" the sensei said, not turning away from his book, \"OH, hi, Kakashi-sensei, whats up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, really,\" and then Kakashi noticed Naruto's belly pushing against his jacket, he didn't want to seem rude, so he decided to ask Naruto something he knew he couldn't turn down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, you waana get some ramen, my treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\na smile grew across his face \"REALLY, KAKASHI-SENSEI?\" the genin asked, Kakashi nodded, and with that, Naruto ran off towards resturant, leaving his masked teacher behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two enetered the ramen shack, being greated by the shop owner and his daughter, Ayame.  She turned her head to see the orange jump-suited ninja along with his new belly, \"Hey, Naruto, you sure have gotten bigger.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Naruto said, unaware she meant his stomach, not his height, naruto took his seat, \"Ill take the biggest bowl you have!\" the boy said, with a smile, the old chef handed Naruto the biggest bowl of ramen the boy had ever seen, it had everything, chicken, beef, seafood, fried tofu, and so much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Naruto, you sure you can finish all of that?\" Kakashi asked, but before he even finish, Naruto had already ordered his second bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes and 13 bowls later, Naruto leaned back and sighed, \"THAT WAS GREAT!\" he said patting his bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, you sure you sholdn't go on a diet?\" Kakashi asked, Naruto gave his teacher a look of confusion, \"Why would you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, youve put on a few pounds.\" Kakashi said, poking Naruto's belly, \"Really,\" Naruto looked down at his fat belly, it was soft and warm, \"Well, i like it so there, and you know what, IM GOING TO PROVE TO YOU THAT WEIGHT ON A NINJA DOESN'T MATTER, old man, 2 bowls of your fattest ramen!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi smiled behind mask, he decided to keep an eye on his now weight obbsesed student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been one week since that day, and Naruto's has done nothing but, eat and sleep, he had invited Kakashi over to show him how much he had gained, Naruto stepped on the scale, it read..</span></div></div>",

Naruto smiled, turning to his teacher to see his expression, Kakashi was shocked \"Wow Naruto, you sure stuck to it, how much did you weigh before you started?\" Kakashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought for a second, \"120, i think.\" Kakashi\"s visible eye widened, \"120 pounds, thats a 30 pound gain in two weeks, how did you do that?\" Naruto unziped his orange jacket, and lifted his black shirt up exposing his belly, which he began to poke, and smiled \"I stopped training, went to Ichiraku Ramen alot more, and slept alot, duh.\" Naruto contnued to poke and rub his belly, a wide smile across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Naruto, im just glad your happy,\" Kakashi said, \"Come on ill take you out to eat.\" The teacher headed out the apartment, with the cubby ninja right behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later, the two arrived at the towns newest resteraunt, Konoha Buffet.  \"Kakashi-sensei, when did this place get here?\" Naruto asked, \"They just built it.\" the teacher said heading inside, when they entered, Kakashi grabbed a table while Naruto went to get some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kage Bunshin no jutsu!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto created 7 clones and hurried to his food, Kakashi was surprised by the amount of food his chubby student had grabbed, \"Hey Naruto, you sure you can eat all that?\" Kakashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and his clones had already finished their food. Naruto formed a hand sign, causeing all of his bloated clones to turn to smoke, Naruto's belly began to swell slightly, \"Naruto what did you just do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Kakashi-sensei, i had some of my clones eat, then i get rid of them, and all of the food that the clones ate, goes directly to my belly.\" The blonde replied, rubbing his swollen stomach, \"Wow, Naruto, thats pretty clever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young ninja then formed his hand sign again, creating 9 clones this time.  \"Your not full yet?\" Kakashi asked, Naruto shock his head, \"Cause of the nine tailed fox, i have a HUGE matabolism, i could probably do this all day!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see that?\" Kakashi said, \"tell you what, ill give you till 3 o'clock, and if your not passed out from your stuffed gut, ill take you out to eat everyday this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2 hours, thats easy.\"  and with that naruto stood up and hurried over to the food stand with the rest of his clones<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sat back, his stomach puffed out about 12 inches and was hard as a rock, Naruto had removed his jacket and t-shirt long ago and was now sitting with his stomach exposed, Kakashi noticed not only his full stomach but the fact the Naruto was also starting to get man boobs.  Naruto reached down, and unbuttoned his pants allowing his swollen gut to fall to his lap. \"Oh man, im so full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi looked at naruto, \"Are you giving up?\" he asked, Naruto realized what was on the line here, quickly naruto created 14 clones, \"Ok, You 10, go grab some food, as for the rest of you, i need you to rub my stomach.\" the 10 clones hurried to the food stands, while the other 4 began to rub, Naruto smiled at the feeling of his fat clones rubbing his stomach.  The clones returned and began to eat, once they finished their plates, they turned into smoke and narutos stomach expanded farther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe town bell rang at 3, the clones dissapeared, Naruto smiled \"W-well Kakashi-sensei, it looks like....i won.\" Naruto passed out, Kakashi smiled from behind his mask, \"Well done,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi caried his bloated student back to his apartment, he placed Naruto in his bed, and left a note on his dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto woke up around 11, he sat up and noticed the note, when he opened it, it said....</span></div></div>",

A huge grin stretched it's way into his chubby cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto,\" it read. \"I'm really impressed by how hard you're working. I didn't think you would go so far. Meet me at the ramen shack in 4 days, but only if you weigh at least 200 pounds. - Kakashi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"200 pounds? That's 50 pounds in 4 days!\" Naruto rubbed his jiggly belly. He wasn't full anymore.<br>\r\n\"Wait.. I wonder if I put on any weight last night?\" Naruto wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cheerily hopped out of bed. His scale was right where he'd left it yesterday. He stepped on the scale. The pointer spun a few times and finally stopped on 160 lbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, 10 pounds in one night!\" he said excitedly. \"This'll be too easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's stomach let out a low growling noise. \"Can't forget to eat!\" he said with a few pats on the stomach. He noticed how soft his belly felt. He actually like the feel of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto ate as much food as he could, then used his shadow clone technique he'd developed to help him eat even more.<br>\r\nHis belly was hard and round from all the food packed tightly in it. His clones rubbed his belly as he relaxed with a smile. Even though he'd just gotten up, he felt so full, and he slowly dosed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto woke up to a counter filled with massive ammounts of food. Ramen, rice cakes, regular cakes; all of his favorites, all of them fattening. Naruto leaped forward and began shoving it all into his mouth. \"I don't know where I am, mmmh, but I don't care. This is the best!\" he said with a moth full of food. He just kept eating, and eating. He never felt full, the food never seemed to end. It was lie heaven. Naruto reached down to feel his belly and see if his belly felt full, but instead of a hard, round, full belly, his hand met a soft, jiggly mound of flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, surprised at this, looked down at his belly. It was huge! His breasts were sagging and laying comfortably on his belly, which was resting between his thighs on the floor. He stood up and grabbed the huge mass of flesh. He couldn't even see his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what the hell is going on?\" he said frantically. He hadn't realized just how much he'd eaten. He stared down long and hard at his belly, all the while holding it in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, he liked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto heard a crash and flung up. He looked from left to right, and realized that he'd been dreaming. <br>\r\n\"Dammit!\" he said loudly. He looked around to see what he'd heard. A few dishes had fallen in his sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had all been a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it felt so good..\" he mumbled to himself. He picked up the note from Kakashi, and read it once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should gain more than 40 pounds, maybe 60, or 70.. but what if I put on too much?\" he argued to himself. \"It felt so nice... but then what if Kakashi gets mad..?\"<br>\r\nNaruto thought to himself for hourse. finally, he decided...</span></div></div>",

I need to have a plan that will allow me to maximize food intake as much as possible. But how?\" Naruto pondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter deliberating for a while, Naruto had finally set out a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kage Bunshin no jutsu\" Naruto called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge puff of smoke resulted, and about 10 clones appeared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Firstly, you 3 will go and stock up my refrigerator, and make sure its always full. The remaining 7 will go and enlist to do the local jobs to keep my wallets full, while i will go to Konoha buffet everyday.\" Naruto commanded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem\" the clones replied, and then jumped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then headed to the Konoha buffet and parked himself into a cubicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" i will need to eat more today than i did yesterday...so Kage Bunshin no jutsu!!\" Naruto mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the appearance of 20 clones, he commanded 3 to bring him food, and the remaining 17 to stuff themselves at the buffet lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"keep it coming!\" Naruto directed the clones, and he continued his gorging<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Naruto and his clones were done, he made a hand sign and the 20 clones disappeared. Naruto's belly had already expanded greatly from his own stuffing, and with the additional food from the clones, had blown it up even more. His already tight jacket zipper was forced downwards, and his black shirt suddenly made a ripping sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soo full....\" Naruto clutched his stomach and moaned....\" but not enough....this is somewhat less than yesterday...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then created 10 more clones, and ordered 2 to massage his stomach, 2  to bring him food and the remaining 6 to return to the buffet lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto and his clones were finally done, there were hundreds of plates stacked up on his table. Naruto's jacket was forced open, and his shirt had a huge rip over the area covering his stomach. He was slumped over in his chair and was almost unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Uooh....cant move....but cant stay here as well...I've been in here for about 8 hours already, and the owners are closing shop'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then mustered all his strength and hoised himself from the cubicle, and waddled his way out to the front door. He then created 4 clones and asked them to carry him home, before finally passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto finally awoke the next day, most of his food had already digested due to his high metabolism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I wonder how much weight i gained\" he then stepped onto the scales and waited for the result<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scales then pointed at 171 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What!! i ate so much more and still only gained 11 pounds\" Naruto was taken back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Looks like i have to increase my intake. Hmm...\" Naruto remarked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then created about 10 clones again to fulfill the duties yesterday, and he gave them extra orders. \" Eat whenever you are able to! and you 3 who are in charge of the refrigerator, make sure you clean it out at least once, and feed me in my sleep, help me chew and swallow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naruto then created some clones to finish off the food in the fridge before going to Konoha buffet again.

After that I had to find clothes to wear, all my old clothes are too small for me\" Naruto replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi examined his pupil, Naruto have enlarged quite alot in the last few days. He now had  a prominent double chin, and his belly clearly spilled over his lap. His cheeks had puffed up, and the rest of his body had also grown along with his increased weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmm...how much weight did you put on? This doesnt look like 40 pounds\" Kakashi questioned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" i actually put on about 60 pounds\" Naruto replied, scratching his head with a fat finger<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi then prodded Naruto's belly with his finger, and suddenly appeared to be in deep thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Kakashi sensei, that hurt!\" Naruto cried, he then swipped Kakashi's finger away from his belly. \" Why did you poke me? and I won the bet right? So when are we going to eat? I am hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi then changed his facial expression and had his \"smiling eyes\" again, \" yup, you did, so why don't you start ordering now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto beamed, and turned to the uncle and asked for a bowl of ramen with everything in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Itadakimus\" Naruto said, and started to gobble down the food<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" So where do you want to eat this week?\" Kakashi asked, sipping his tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anywhere would be fine,\" Naruto replied while gulping down another bowl,\" as long as you are paying. Another please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. So how's your training been going? Your body cant hold that much weight without strengthening you know\" Kakashi asked again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Another please! Oh, i have had some clones doing the village chores to keep my muscles strong, and i am thinking of having some train up while i feast for the next week\" Naruto replied,\" another please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" That's good\" Kakashi smiled,\" don't want to become useless in combat, you are not Choji you know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded. Even he knew that if he put on so much weight without any muscle,he would be rendered useless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another please!\" Naruto called<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes and 60 bowls later....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" That was a good meal!\" Naruto patted his bloated belly. He had unzipped his new larger jacket ( its still orange) and unbuttoned his pants to let his full belly rest on his lap. He had eaten so much that eve his new larger black shirt had ridden up his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I see your eating capacity had increased over the past few days..so shall we be off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled,\" yup, and where are we off to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" to find a restaurant for dinner\" Kakashi smiled, \" its my treat right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled and said \" wait, before we go, one more bowl of ramen please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi smiled and started to walk off first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 minutes later, Naruto had caught up with Kakashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" So where are we going?\" Naruto asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we are going to the Tenju grilled beef restaurant for dinner, they have an all you can eat there\" Kakashi replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALL RIGHT!\" Naruto punched his fist into the air,\" lets go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, despite his heavy lunch, his stomach was empty again by dinner, and he used his cloning method to eat more food<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Naruto was finished, his belly had bloated to look like he was at least 8 months pregnant, and he had to unzip his jacket and remove his black shirt to allow him to breathe properly.

This time 100 clones plus the original, and Choji's family begam stuffing themselves as much as they could.  The second course was just as big and eaten just as quickly. The third course contained not only bacon, eggs and pancakes, but now with hashbrowns, french toast, waffles, chocolate puddings, and milk to wash it down. The next 3 courses were bigger than before, causing Naruto's belly to grow even more, forcing the zipper (of his largest jacket yet) down, soon after, his shirt rode up and ripped. The button on his pants popped off and his belly flopped onto his lap. The final course contained nothing but chocolate milk, milkshakes, ice cream, and cake (For breakfast?) Naruto noticed that his clones were still there, so since they finished eating, he had 10 of them rub his belly and the other 90 disappeared, causing his belly to swell much, much further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels sooo gooood...\" murmured Naruto, his clones did a great job rubbing his belly. \"Kage Bunshin no jutsu\" Naruto said, the remaining 10 poofed away so the last of the food could swell his belly furthe. 40 more clones appeared to continue the rubbing, but also to rub the bellies of Choji and his parents. \"Doesn't that feel nice.\" said Chouzi, Choji's father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto felt ready, he got up and asked if they had a scale. \"Right this way Naruto.\" Choji said leading him through the huge building.

You'll need new ones before the first course is over. I have some I can give you, as for your shirt, best not wear one for the rest of your stay with us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys' stomachs growled in unison. \"It must be lunchtime.\" said Choji. \"Really?

He looked down at his belly to see something he hadn't paid much attention to recently. The seal that keeps Kyuubi, the demon fox locked up inside of him. Naruto noticed that the seal was streched along his belly because he had enlarged greatly from his pig-outs. He looked over at Choji to see something sticking out of the larger ninja's belly button. Naruto heaved himself up, careful not to wake his fatter friend. Slowly, Naruto pulled the thing out to find that there was more stuff shoved into Choji's belly button. A closer examination of the mysterious objects showed that they were snacks. 'Great storage space in here.' Naruto thought, looking at his own belly button. 'This food looks really good... but Choji will definitely know I took some. I think I should go to the dining room if I want food.' But on his way, he saw the bathroom door... the scale is in there...</span></div></div>",

His mouth watering slightly, Naruto said, \"Kage Bunshin no jutsu\" and 200 Naruto's dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I ate the whole stash Choji.\" Naruto said as his clones disappeared.

Naruto grinned victoriously as he pumped his fist in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, take THAT! 50 pounds in one week! That's gotta be a new record!\" he cheered happily. Kakashi was shocked, his single visible eye wide open. How had he gained that much weight in so little time? Something about his rapid gain seemed.....unnatural, to say the least. Naruto had stopped prancing long enough to notice his sensei's strange stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kakashi-sensei, why are you staring at me like that?\" he asked, slightly disturbed. The silver-haired Jonin seemed to be awakened from his stupor by the blonde's question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was just wondering if you would come with me real quick. It'll only take a few minutes.\" he said. Naruto seemed surprised at this request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we gonna do, sensei? Is it some kind of super-secret training?!\" he asked excitedly. Kakashi lazily dismissed his student's curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you could consider it that. I'll let you decide for yourself.\" he said, walking towards the door. Naruto waddled quickly behind, his body still adjusting to his newfound weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey wait up Kakashi-sensei!\" he cried out, though his cries fell on deaf eyes. His sensei was already out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a beautiful day in Konoha, a perfect day to just sit back and enjoy all life has to offer. Calm, quiet, peaceful.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMMIT WHERE THE HELL IS HE!?!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....Well, kind of.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stomped down the dirt path, a look of extreme anger on his chubby face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The nerve of that guy! Inviting me for a walk, then disappearing without a trace! Gah, I can't STAND him sometimes!\" he complained in anger. Paying no mind to where he was going, he bumped into the object of his anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Naruto. You're a little late.\" Kakashi said nonchalantly, his face hidden behind his infamous orange book. Smoke could be seen billowing out from Naruto's ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You damn son of a -\" a quick hush from Kakashi cut off his incensed rant before it could begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, there's something that's been bothering me lately and it concerns you.\" he said. Naruto looked at him confusedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is? What is it?\" he asked innocently, with the look of a young child in his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just how dedicated you are to gaining weight. I don't want you neglecting your training or your other duties as a shinobi as well.\" he stated plainly. Naruto smirked knowingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't worry about that! I've been using my shadow clones to train and do missions around the village while I gained at home! It's not like I didn't think about that beforehand!\" he replied, smiling at his resourcefulness. Kakashi sighed. This was not the way this conversation was supposed to go. Apparently, he'd have to wait a little longer before any hard evidence came up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I suppose my concerns were unfounded. If that's it, then I'll just be going now. I need to see the Hokage about something. See ya.\" he said. Before his student could complain, he disappeared in a puff of smoke, leaving a frustrated Naruto alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I will NEVER understand that guy!\" he shouted. With a reluctant sigh, he turned back to his apartment, hoping to maybe eat a little bit more before he had to turn in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade's paperwork seemed to be neverending. The blonde Hokage slammed her head on her desk in frustration. Why did she agree to this again? Well, there was Nawaki, Dan, Jiraiya, Sarutobi-sensei, Shizune, Naruto......Okay, enough of that guilt trip. She settled instead for silently praying for something to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone must've heard her, for Kakashi entered the room with a stern look in his eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsunade-sama, we need to talk.\" he started. She looked up curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? About what?\" she asked nonchalantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's about Naruto.\" he replied. With that, Tsunade instantly gave him his undivided attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all ears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had just finished emptying his cabinet of food, his stomach bloated from the gorging. With a final belch, he sighed in relief as he felt the food finally begin to digest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh.....maybe I overdid it a bit....\" he admitted, feeling somewhat queasy. He decided to check to see how much he weighted after that. Hopefully getting this slight case of indigestion would pay off....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scale tipped, finally revealing his weight to be 183 lbs. He was somewhat surprised with the results. He felt he had eaten a lot more. Ah well, he'd just have to wait for the food to settle before he checked again. With that done, he changed into his new larger pajamas and fell quickly to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sighed in frustration. Was that the case with Naruto? Somehow, it didn't surprise her in the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kakashi, keep an eye on him. Thank you for bringing it to my attention. We may need to help the process along to find out exactly what's going on.\" she ordered. Kakashi nodded and disappeared in a puff of smoke. With him gone, she opened a nearby drawer and pulled out a top-secret manila folder with many papers flowing out of it. She opened it carefully and looked at the top page. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder.....could this be it?\" she asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the night, a mysterious shadow watched the sleeping Naruto with a cheerful grin. The plan was working perfectly, and the blonde's interest in gaining weight only helped the process. With a small chuckle, it left, waiting to see the fruits of its hard-thought-out plot. </span></div></div>",

For the past couple of weeks nothing had been going on in the village,there were no missions and the village was safe so Kiba had gotten some time off and having nothing to do he began skipping training which was starting to have an effect on him. Kiba woke up to the sound of Akamaru barking at him to get up which Kiba did reluctantly, he had stayed up late last night having barbecue with Choji again. Kiba sat up and yawned, he had his pants on but no shirt and it was hard to notice but Kiba\u2019s flat stomach had gotten a little pudgy lately and he also seemed hairier then before but not by much, not enough to notice anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked at Akamaru and wondered why he woken him up so early, then with a startling revelation he remembered his Mom and Sister were coming home today, for the past 2 weeks they had been on a mission and were coming back today. Kiba then realized that the house was a complete mess and he didn\u2019t even want to think about what would happen if his Mom and Sister saw his mess. So he quickly got dressed and cleaned like a mad man, with the help of Akamaru of course. Kiba had just thrown out the last of the garbage when he heard the door open and saw his Mom and Sister walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u201d said Kiba\u2019s mom \u201cLooks like you were able to keep the place clean\u201d. Then she walked up to Kiba and grabbed him by the collar of his shirt and said menacingly \u201cBut if I find anything out of place you will be sorry\u201d. Then she hugged him returning to normal and said \u201cI missed you, it\u2019s nice to be home\u201d. That night Kiba\u2019s Mom and Sister decided to cook a meal to celebrate, it was a feast of all of Kiba\u2019s favorite foods, tons of meat and steak and chicken and pork, it made his mouth water and he made sure Akamaru got his fair share of it. After dinner Kiba he leaned back and rubbed his bulging stomach, he had eaten a lot more than usual which surprised him, maybe choji\u2019s eating habits are rubbing off on him, Kiba\u2019s mom had noticed this and thought that it was time to tell Kiba what she had been hiding from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba went to bed and slept almost till noon the next day, when he woke up and saw what time it was he wondered where Akamaru was and why he let him sleep in so late. Kiba got up and wandered into the living room where he found his mom waiting for him. \u201cKiba come here\u201d said Kiba\u2019s mom. Kiba walked over and asked \u201chey do you know where Akamaru is?\u201d<br>\r\nHis Mom said\u201d Yes I had your sister take him to the vet for a check up\u201d Kiba was relieved that nothing bad had happened to Akamaru.\u201dKiba do your mom a favor and take off your clothes\u201d she said. \u201cWhat why would I do that and why would you ask that?\u201d, said Kiba. Then his mom gave him a deadly glare which was all it took to make Kiba begrudgingly strip down to his under pants, Kiba was still lean and fit except for the little fat on his stomach that was barely noticeable. Kiba\u2019s mom walked forward and took a closer look at Kiba, \u201cYep looks like your about ready\u201d said kiba\u2019s mom. \u201cAbout ready for what?\u201d Kiba said giving his mom a confused look, his mom went over to a nearby drawer and opened it and took out a picture and walked back over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are starting to go through a change\u201d said Tsume (Kiba\u2019s Mom) \u201cYou are what we call an Alpha Inuzuka. Every couple of generations an Alpha is born and that Inuzuka would then become the head of the clan\u201d. \u201cYou mean that I'm going to be come head of our clan\u201d said Kiba surprised. \u201cYes but that is not all, Alpha dogs are not only the head of the pack but also the biggest and strongest, meaning you will be the strongest Inuzuka out of all others in the clan.\u201d said Tsume. \u201cThats cool in all but how do you know that it\u2019s me?\u201d said Kiba skeptically, Tsume then walked up to Kiba and said, \u201cWe have three reasons to believe so, the first is that you were born into the head family of the clan which had produced Alpha\u2019s since the beginning of our clan,but we could not be sure yet, the Second reason is the you are the first male to be born in our family since the last alpha was born\u201d, Tsume then showed Kiba the picture she held. Kiba saw the picture was a man who was very hairy even for an Inuzuka, he was also very tall and while it looked like he was very strong, with thick muscular arms and legs, he also very fat and had a huge belly hanging over his waist, but what surprised Kiba the most is he looked like himself! \u201cKiba this is your great grandfather and he was an Alpha\u201d said Tsume, Kiba was shocked thats what an Alpha looked like and that it was his great grandfather. \u201cAnd the Third reason\u201d Said Tsume \u201cis this\u201d she then poked at the small little belly Kiba now had. \u201cThis?\u201d said Kiba \u201cThis is nothing, I have just haven't been training as much and there have been no missions. That\u2019s all this is\u201d. \u201cNo it\u2019s not\u201d said Tsume \u201cThis is only the beginning of it, as time goes on you will start maturing at a faster rate. You will get stronger,\u201dAnd you will also start gaining weight because while you become the Alpha your metabolism will shut down  and you will gain weight very easily, don\u2019t worry though you\u2019ll also gain muscle as well but all Alpha\u2019s are fat, its a sign of power and prosperity so the fat will just add to your strength . And don't worry about that part, most other Alpha\u2019s liked getting bigger. But the point is you will go through these changes and become the Alpha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba sat down in shock of what he just heard, he could not believe that this was going to happen to him. He felt a mix of emotions confusion, worry, curiosity, and excitement. Then Kiba thought \u201cwhat would my friends think of me?\u201d causing Kiba to become anxious. \u201cKiba don't worry this is a natural process, you don't need to be scared or worried. You are actually lucky Alphas are treated like kings by the clan you will get treated with much respect and get as much food and girls as you want\u201d said Tsume, \u201cMom!\u201d said Kiba now more embarrassed. \u201cSorry I couldn't resist but now your not as worried right?\u201d said Tsume Kiba did feel less scared now \u201cdon't worry this will start happening on its own so you don't need to do anything and I know what your thinking your friends wont think any different of you trust me. Now the changing will start on its own but after a while we will need to help you prepare for becoming the Alpha but for now go about normally, I love you\u201d Said Tsume as she walked away leaving Kiba to think about what he just heard and what will happen to him. As the day ended Kiba was laying in bed thoughts of becoming an Alpha still swarming his brain, but he was tired and decided to call it a night and feel asleep. But unknown to Kiba as he slept his body was preparing itself for the changes to come.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After last night Kiba didn't know what to think, the whole thing confused him so he tried not to think about it too hard, when he woke up he smelt something delicious coming from the kitchen and it made his mouth water. He got up and went to the kitchen to see the table completely covered with food, and in the kitchen was his older sister, still cooking more food. \u201cGood Morning Kiba, I have breakfast ready for you so go ahead and dig in\u201d, \u201cUh, ok\u201d said Kiba. At first Kiba tried to eat slow because he was still worried about how his metabolism is suppose to make him fat, but after a couple minutes and without even realizing it Kiba had steadily picked up the pace and began to eat more and more while his sister kept putting plate after plate of food in front of him until eventually Kiba couldn't eat any more. He was completely stuffed so much that his shirt stuck out a bit from his distended belly, \u201cglad you enjoyed your meal\u201d said his big sister, \u201cif you keep it up you\u2019ll look like a proper Alpha in no time\u201d. Snapping back to his senses Kiba realized just what had happened and wondered how much he actually ate, it was like he was in a trance and couldn't control himself and here he was thinking he could cut back on how much he would eat. So before his sister had a chance to try and make him something else to eat Kiba walked out side and found Akamaru waiting for him and decided to go work off breakfast by training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his way to the training grounds Kiba was forced to take the back roads to get there because when he was walking through town every place that served food was trying to offer him a \u201csnack\u201d, or \u201cfree sample\u201d and even though Kiba had just stuffed himself he felt hungry enough to eat them. So he left the main road and took the back roads to get there. When he got to the training field it was completely empty except for him and Akamaru, he looked down at himself and saw while his belly didn\u2019t stick out as much as it did this morning it was still bigger than yesterday. He lifted his shirt and it was confirmed, yesterday he didn't even notice the fat on his stomach until his mom pointed it out but now he could definitely notice that his abs were definitely less defined in fact he couldn't see them! Even though he was told that he would get fat and that it\u2019s even a good thing, Kiba was determined to keep that from happening as long as possible. So Kiba began his training by starting out with the basic stuff, he did his stretches and some physical warm ups to get himself going and he had decided to focus more on physical exercises rather than work on his ninjutsu. As the day went on Kiba had kept training, he ran laps, lifted rocks as weights, and made sure do workout every part of his body especially his abdomen. And so far Kiba hadn't noticed a real difference in his physical ability even with some extra pounds, Kiba was a bit relieved and decided to take a lunch break because even though he didn't want to think about it he was starving! Kiba had made sure to get some lunch for him and Akamaru while he was in town, so he sat at the base of a tree next to Akamaru and gave him his lunch and unpacked his which consisted of 3 plain rice balls. After the breakfast he had he made sure to make it light but he was so hungry he scarfed them down in an instant and was still starving, but he had to manage because if he doesn't want to gain weight then he has to watch what he eats and more importantly how much he eats. By the time Kiba was done training he was absolutely exhausted, he looked up and saw it was sunset. Kiba then began to slowly make his way home when he realized that if he were to go home now his mom and sister would probably have a feast with his name on it, the mere thought of food made his stomach growl and his mouth water, but Kiba shook himself out of it remembering he can\u2019t but if he were to go home he probably wouldn't be able to resist. While walking Kiba ran into...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While walking Kiba ran into Naruto who seemed to be on his way home when a idea struck Kiba. \u201cHey Naruto\u201d said Kiba, \u201cOh, hey Kiba hows it been?\u201d asked Naruto. \u201cUm\u2026\u201d Kiba said as he looked down at his middle then quickly realized he didn't want to draw attention to it, especially from Naruto, \u201cOk\u2026hey I was wondering could I spend the night at your place?\u201d asked Kiba, \u201cUh sure why not. But why do you want to stay at my place, personally I think your house is way nicer than my place\u201d. \u201cNo particular reason, but hey lets get going its going to get dark soon\u201d said Kiba in a hurry changing the subject. At Naruto\u2019s place Kiba felt like he could relax, he just wanted to take his mind off this Alpha stuff for a while. After a couple hours of games which Kiba crushed Naruto at (which was easy when Akamaru looked at Naruto\u2019s hand and told him the cards he had not that Naruto will ever find out), they decided to hit the hay and sleep. But after Naruto went to sleep Kiba was still awake, the games had kept him occupied but now with nothing to do all Kiba could think about was how hungry he was and listen to his stomach growl at him wanting food. Finally Kiba gave in and thought to him self Ok but just a small snack, what harm could it do? Kiba crept over to the fridge and opened it and of course it was mostly filled with instant ramen but there were a few other things besides that which Kiba took out and began to snack on, and just like at breakfast Kiba seemed to go into a trance and ate everything he took out but he wasn't satisfied so he went back to the fridge and continued to eat everything, even the instant ramen without cooking it first, until the contents of the fridge were completely empty and in Kiba\u2019s belly which was visibly sticking out more than it had been and stretched his shirt out. Being satisfied Kiba closed the fridge still in a trance like state and went to bed completely unaware of what he just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba awoke to Naruto screaming \u201cAaaauugh! What happened to all my food!\u201d. Kiba sat up and looked at Naruto standing in front of his fridge which was empty. \u201cHey Naruto will you quiet down, what happened? said Kiba as he gave a yawn, \u201cYou!\u201d said Naruto as he turned around and looked at Kiba with a death stare. \u201cWhat?\u201d said Kiba, \u201cit was you! You ate all my food last night and left nothing!\u201d said Naruto. \u201cWhat no I didn\u2019t\u2026.\u201d said Kiba who then thought Wait did I? No I couldn't have. What happened last night? I remember going to just grab a snack and then\u2026I don't know, thats the last thing I remember then I woke up. Don't tell me. Kiba looked down at his stomach and saw that it had indeed gotten bigger so much so that his shirt was visibly stretched out, he definitely had a small pot belly now. Kiba didn't know what to do, he looked at Akamaru and then said to Naruto \u201cIt wasn't me I swear\u2026It must have been Akamaru\u201d said Kiba and Akamaru gave Kiba a surprised and confused and almost betrayed look wondering why he was blaming him. \u201cWell you need to control him because that food was suppose to last till the end of the month and now\u2026\u201d Naruto said with a depressed face as he looked at his measly savings in his wallet. \u201cGeez sorry about that Naruto, I\u2019d better go then. Thanks for letting me stay the night, come on Akamaru\u201d said Kiba as he left as quickly as possible hoping to avoid him noticing he new belly, which wasn't going to be a problem as Naruto was still staring at his empty fridge and soon to be empty wallet. Once Kiba had left Naruto\u2019s place he said \u201cSorry for throwing you under the bus Akamaru, I couldn't let him know that it might have been me last night. Please forgive me\u201d, Akamaru looked at Kiba for a sec and then gave a bark meaning he forgave him. \u201cThanks bud, now lets get home. I got to shower and change clothes but also have to make sure that Mom and Big sis don't spot me\u201d. And with that Kiba set off for his house trying to avoid as many people as possible and hoping to avoid his family when he got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his house Kiba ran into...</span></div></div>",

But now that he wasn't a ninja, he could eat anything at anytime he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaku started with the pancakes. He started slow at first, using a knife an fork. As soon as he at a piece, his eyes widened and his pupil dialated. IT WAS DELICIOUS! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgoing the knife and fork, Haku took to the pancakes with his hands. He'd stuffed his mouth as much as he could, then swallow. It was hard the first time but he got used to it pretty fast. Haku at a fast but steady pace, not caring about the syrup covering his mouth and hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes, Haku had completely devoured the pancake to the last crumb and drop of syrup.

As an added bonus, everytime Haku stuffed himself, he stretched his stomach compacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely, Haku's new eating habits and appetite showed on his body. Around 290 lbs, Haku was pretty huge. His face appeared to have been stung by bees, possessing swollen cheeks. His stomach had billowed outwards, easily domination his physique, sticking out a good foot. Haku's thighs and legs had become small tree trunks of blubber. Even Haku's feet had fattened, snapping his sandels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even with all this Haku was okay. But he was not satisfied with his weight. He felt that ALMOST 300 lbs wasn't good enough.

Or a morbily obese person, such as Haku could use chakra to slide themselves around once their legs stopped working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this was good new to Haku.
