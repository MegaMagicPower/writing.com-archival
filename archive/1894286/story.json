Otherwise, Jessica would have called them down to have some cookies and cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked at the sweets. The cookies, so fresh and warm. The cake, so fluffy and moist. She'd really outdone herself this time, it seemed. The food looked amazing. Absolutely incredible. And the smell! It was almost intoxicating. Jessica's stomach grumbled. She looked at the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well... It would be a shame to have all this food go to waste...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica picked up a cookie off of the tray. At this point, they had cooled down to a nice, warm temperatures, perfect for human consumption. They were chocolate chip cookies\u2014Jessica's favorite. Biting into it, her taste buds were immediately flooded with a richness of flavor. This batch of cookies had been baked PERFECTLY. Jessica moaned quietly in delight. The first cookie was soon followed by a second. Then a third. Soon, Jessica was in a frenzy, devouring cookie after cookie until the entire batch was gone. Twelve cookies\u2014gone in minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was just the slightest bit full after that. They weren't small cookies by any means. However, there was one sweet still resting on the table: the devil's food cake. It was a small, circular cake, and it tempted her silently from where it sat. <i>Eat me!</i> it seemed to say. <i>We both know you want to.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica went over to a drawer and pulled out a spoon. She took the cake off of the table, sat down below the counter, and tucked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cake was simply delectable, moist and fluffy with a strong chocolate flavor. Jessica took a moment to just enjoy the first bite, then began to dig in, shoveling spoonful after spoonful of cake into her mouth. She hadn't had time to add any frosting, but she didn't care\u2014the cake was still delicious without it. Halfway through the cake, Jessica felt an intense pressure on her midsection. Almost reflexively, she unbuttoned her jeans, and the pressure was relieved. Jessica resumed her feast, and twenty minutes later, the cake was gone. Jessica placed her plate and spoon on the counter above her head before she sank down in her seat. Jessica looked at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rather stuffed, bulging forth from her midriff quite considerably and tight as drum. Her shirt had rode up a few inches, exposing her navel. A soft layer of belly fat had been forming around it for some time, now, and Jessica knew that this feast of hers wasn't going to help shrink it down. However, she couldn't say that she regretted it. At least, not at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Jessica patted her belly. \"What am I going to do with you?\" she said.</span></div></div>",

The movie was half over, and the once full tub was half-finished. She loosened the waistband of her sweatpants to make room for her belly, then resumed her feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she couldn't figure out why, Jessica had been eating quite a bit more than usual today. Her earlier baked goods binge was only the first. For lunch, she had ordered a pizza and eaten the entire thing herself. She took the girls out to an all-you-can-eat buffet and devoured an unbelievable dozen plates of food. For some reason, her appetite was just insatiable today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result was that Jessica had been wearing black sweatpants and a loose-fitting Superman T-shirt all day. They were the only clothes that were able to fit and accommodate her stuffing herself silly, and did a decent enough job of hiding her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro was dueling with Elena when Jessica found that she had finished the entire tub of ice cream. She paused the movie, got off the couch, threw the empty tub away, and sat back down. Jessica noticed her shirt ride up to expose a tiny bit of tummy chub. She gave her belly a rub, then resumed watching the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Jessica had changed into some flannel pajamas and was getting ready for bed. She was l looking at herself in the full-body mirror. While the bloating had subsided a bit, Jessica's midsection was still rather round, poking out from behind her shirt. Jessica pinched it, managing to grab some fat from newly grown love handles. She clucked her tongue in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer midriff wasn't the only part of her Jessica found to be thicker. Her thighs clung tightly to her pajama bottoms and her bosom was just the slightest bit fuller. Turning around, Jessica found a softer derriere and a little more back fat than she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'll have to check how much weight I've put on, soon,</i> she thought. Surprisingly, Jessica found that her weight gain didn't bother her too much. Her disappointment was almost an after thought, if she was being honest. Turning back around, Jessica undid her messy ponytail and let her hair down. Patting her belly, Jessica went to bed, setting her alarm for 7:00 a.m.</span></div></div>",

As she was brushing her teeth she saw the scale in the corner of the bathroom \"It's been awhile since I weighed myself, I better check if I've put any weight on. It's probably not a lot if I have\" she thought as she finished brushing her teeth and started to walk to the scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Jessica's life she had been extremely attractive. She had long golden blond hair with crystal blue eyes and a perfect figure of a trim flat stomach, medium size perky breast and a cute bubble butt not to mention an angelic face. Jessica had always kept her body as she barely ever ate junk food only ever eating healthily and she had a great metabolism. This was perfect for her as Jessica absolutely hated to exercise she could stand the thought of sweating and she hates doing anything related with physical exercise and even though she had the the body of an angel she was incredibly unfit thanks to a life of never exercising, she could barely walk up a flight of stairs without getting tired. The only reason she had managed to keep her figure all her life was because of her metabolism and diet and her weight always ranged around 120-130lbs. However because of her recent food habits and her metabolism slowing down as she is in her late twenties things for Jessica were about to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"138.\" Jessica exclaimed \"I've never been past 130 before.\" She said \"don't worry  it'll be fine my metabolism will burn it of in the next couple of days and I'll be back to normal\" she thought to herself as she got ready to drop her kids off at school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished dropping her kids of at school she started to go home. Jessica didn't have to work so she didn't just like physical work she also hated normal work and thanks to her good looks she had managed to marry an extremely wealthy man, so when that went downhill and ended in divorce because of her super amazing layer she ended up with getting huge alimony check (a husband's (or wife's) provision/ money for a spouse after separation or divorce; maintenance) every month and on top of a huge child's care check. So basically she sponges of her ex and never has to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was driving back she noticed a new fast food restaurant had been built just around the corner of her house. \"Ooh a new fast food stop. Well i did skip breakfast so I might nip in and get a quick bite\". When she walked in and order she decided to get a large breakfast burger with an apple pie and when it came out she stood in shock. The size of the food was huge she had never seen portions that big in her life, the burger was drenched in grease and looked like the size of a full turkey and the pie was smuthered in sugar and looked the size of a full cake but when she took her first bit she fell in love with the taste of the delicious burger and sweetness of the magnificent apple pie. She was going to enjoy having this fast food stop near her house but was her waist?</span></div></div>",

She had spent the entire week binge on fast food and because of her new found baking addiction she was also constantly baking snacks for her and her children. However now the week was over the schools summer vacation had started and her kids were spending the entire summer at their dads this meant Jessica was alone so she so would be the only one to eat her cooked goods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Jessica had not worked a day in her life always sponging of her ex, lounging around and relaxing over the years she had made her way through quite a lot of different hobbies, shopping being her favourite, however in the end she usually got bored and stopped doing them , all except shopping. Baking however was her newest hobby and she was obsessed mainly because due to her always eating healthy, the sweet treats she got to eat at the end were absolutely addicting. However this hobby was having knock on effects as she becomes more addicted to the sweet goods she becomes less focused on maintaining her diet this leads to her slaking of and starting to eat a fast food joints and when she eats there she starts to become addicted to the fast food as it tastes better then health meals which she has been eating all her life. And ultimately this leads to the start of weight gain and with her kids gone there is more baked goods for her which will only feed her addiction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww these pants are tight I must of shrunk em\" Jessica said as she buttoned them up. \" right come on kids hurry up I have to get you to your dads by 8 your plain to France leaves at 12\" Jessica yelled trying to get her children to get a move on. As she arrived at her exs mansion to drop them of she walked up to the door and rang the bell. Her and her ex hated don't get along with each  other he hated her even though he is rich for getting divorced and still taking his money ever month for her own and rubbing it in his face every time he sees her. \"Hi guys come in our butler will take your bags to the car and we will set of soon\" her ex says to the kids in a cheerful tone. After the kids ran in Jessica said smugly \" first day of the month you now what that means. Alimoney pay\" \"yeah yeah what ever just because your too lazy to do anything yourself Jess. \" he said as he rote the check. Even though he could afford the \u00a3150,000 a month he pays her he hates the fact he has to give money to his ex \"thank you sweetly\" she says sarcastically  with a smug  on her face as he gives her the check. \"You know Jess if I was you I'd stop spending so mouth of that on food you look like you've gained a little weight\" her ex says with a huge smile on his face as he has just wiped that smug grin of her face \" shut up I just shrank my clothes in the wash\" she said enraged \"but at least I can by new ones with this big fat check you gave me \" she said reclaiming her smug grin. \" well if your not careful you'll be big and fat soon just like that check\" her exs fires back \"ehh ah\" she stutters in shock \" I hope you break your neck on that trip\" she screams as she storms of. \" if I break my neck who will give you money\" he yells laughing his head of as she gets in her car and drives off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was furious as she drove home muttering insults towards her ex all th way back. As she approached her house she was that stressed and mad she decided to stop at the fast food joint for some food. \"I want 3 large jumbo burgers, fries with all of them, I want 2 super boxes of chicken and 4 cream pies and make it was quick\" she yelled in a mad tone. As the food arrived and she walked to the table she muttered under her breathe \"calling me fat. I'm not fat I'm super hot always have and always will be\" not realising the sheer quantity of food she had just ordered and began devouring. </span></div></div>",

Even though this hobby started because she like the cooking aspect just like the rest of her hobbies she had grown bored however she didn't want to give up all the delicious bake goods so this new restaurant was the perfect thing for Jessica she could still have the food without all the labour to make it. However this meant she would become even more lazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica decide she was going to order some fast food from the fast food joint near her and order some cakes and cookies for a dessert after her meal.

Ding-Dong. \"Great foods hear\" Jess thought as she heaved herself up to answer the door as she she reached it she was extremely out of breathe, because of Jessica already being super unfit before she gained weight she found it much more difficult to move the added pounds. \"I'm sure this door is getting further away\" Jess thought as she answered it.

Jessica wobbled her way into her room in only her very tight underwear and incredibly out of puff from her little exercise and began to search for some cloths that fit. Jessica had out grown almost all her clothes and about half way through the holidays had given up wearing them all together as they were way to tight. However today was different today she had to pickup her kids from her exs as they had just got back from holiday, so for the first time in three months she had to get dressed and leave the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally found some old sweat pants and stretchy shirt from when she was pregnant that just managed to tightly fit but still exposing the top of her bum crack and the bottom of her gut. Jessica had gained about 80lbs all together over the holidays and now weighed 218lbs but she was still in denial. Her face now had a permanent double chin and she now had small bingo wings. Her perky breast had grown quite big and had now started to sag a bit and her thighs had thickened even more with her thigh gap quickly disappearing  and her legs rubbed together with each step. Her once perfect butt was now very big and jiggle every time she walked and her flat stomach was now full gut that dangled at her waist and wobbles when she walked. Jessica was quite tall for a girl about 5 foot 9 tall this meant she did not look as big as other women over to hundred pounds but she was now definitely fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessica knocked on the door and her ex answered he instantly burst out into laughter \" wow Jess you have seriously gained\" he said hysterically \"no I have not you no good wan...\" she fired back. After a half an hour of argument and insult Jess found out that her kids had such a good time at there dads that they wanted to stay there instead as they love they big mansion and there dad was super fun. And thanks to the custody agreement say the kids could stay were they wanted Jessica was forced to swap terms with her ex saying the kids could see her once a month and if they wanted to could stay with her at holidays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica left enraged after the situation gone down and decided to stop at the super market for stress and comfort food. Whilst Jessica was walking around she saw a scale she picked it up and thought \"I can't of gained that much she weight I've always been super hot. I'll buy this just to check\" as she payed for her things and drove home, getting some quick fast food on they, she set up her scale when she got back and started to weigh herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"218lbs. No f*cking way\" she screamed \"that's impossible, what happened to my metabolism\" she yelled. After seeing the number she immediately grabbed some food and began stress eating and comfort binging. \"I can't be fat. I've always been hot\" she cried drowning her sorry in muffins and burgers \"I want my body back she wined. \"</span></div></div>",

Jessica was spread out like a blubbery walrus on her, near collapse, couch scratching her large gut and eating away. She was wearing nothing but an overly stretched pair of under wear and a bra on the edge of snapping. Her panties were jammed up her arse crack and digging into her hips as she let out a rather large fart. <br>\r\n\u201cF*ck me Jess, that stinks.\u201d She said as she gobbled down her fifth burger of breakfast and threw the wrapper on the floor of her bungalow she moved into, as stairs had become to difficult for her. Her house was a mess, there were wrappers and pieces of half eaten food all over the floors, chairs, tables, windows, in every room and even on her bed. You couldn\u2019t take a step with out stepping in some leftover crap Jess had been binging on. The house looked like it hadn\u2019t been cleaned in ages and it stunk of bio, gas and rubbish, and Jess did nothing about it except sit on her arse and shovel down junk. Jess\u2019s kids hadn\u2019t been round since she moved over 8 months ago, as she was too lazy and big to keep up with them and the house was too untidy to live. <br>\r\nSuddenly there was a snap and Jess\u2019s underwear pinged off as they couldn\u2019t contain her any more and her huge gut flung forward. <br>\r\n\u201cSh*t\u201d Jess said as she looked down to see what happened but then only saw her gut. Jess then began to heave herself up to go to her room, doing so causing a lot of food and wrappers to fall of the couch. After a lot of grunting and sweating Jess finally got up revealing her huge mass. Jess had a thick heavy double chin covering the bottom of her face and as she stretched, her big chunky bingo winged arms, wobbled. When she started walking here  giant tree trunk legs covered in lard began rubbing where her thigh gap used to be. Her hips had widened incredibly and her once firm ass now looked the size of two large saggy beach balls which jiggled as she walked. Her giant boobs now rested on her titanic gut sagging down and straining her bra to the limit. And as for her gut, it was colossal, easily her largest area, followed by her ass, and hung past her lap almost to her knees. Her belly button looked like a creator filled with bits of crap that had fallen in, her body was smeared with bits of food and spilt drinks and as she moved her gut swayed side to side like a wrecking ball. <br>\r\nAs she squeezed through her door and entered her bedroom she grabbed a huge pair of panties she had ordered and began a long exhausting process of putting them on. As she finished she noticed the scale in front of the mirror in the corner of the room. Thinking why not she plodded her way over and plonked herself on, observing her shear mass with disgust in the mirror. After the scale had finished spinning she look at the result with dread using the mirror to see as she could not look past her belly. <br>\r\n478lbs the scale read. \u201cAre you joking I\u2019m almost 500lbs, how much fatter could I possibly get?\u201d Jess thought annoyed at herself. <br>\r\n\u201cSurely I can\u2019t gain much more weight, I\u2019m huge.\u201d Jess thought not knowing that she still had plenty more to gain. </span></div></div>",

Now I must remind you this is an experimental drug, so there is a chance of unknown side affects to occur. However, all test indicated that the drug works perfectly in keeping a persons body healthy, when they are so.. well you know, FAT like you.\u201d Doctor Summers said bluntly. <br>\r\nJessica had been prescribed a doctor about a year ago, due to her becoming so huge. <br>\r\nDoc Kate Summers was a stunningly attractive 25 year old, with a face of a goddess and luscious long blonde hair that fell just at the centre of her back. She was about 5 foot 9 and had an absolutely incredible figure, curves in all the right places a tight flat stomach and huge D cup boobs with a large but firm perky ass. <br>\r\nShe was truly gorgeous. <br>\r\n\u201cOkay so I\u2019ll come see you again in about a month,  I\u2019m going to take these away Jess to help with your diet, so please try and stick to the diet Jessica, I don\u2019t want you getting any fatter. \u201c the doctor said as she picked up about ten extra large burgers that Jess was going to eat and then began to leave jess\u2019 house.<br>\r\nJessica\u2019s floor was disgusting, it was buried in layers of trash and leftover food, that Jess had just discarded once she had finished with it. The doctor began to lift her leg of the floor, but found it difficult to move as the thick mess on the floor came up to her knees. She powered through the trash till she got to the door and finally escaped Jessica\u2019s house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Doc Summers said as she walked from the house to the car and removed her nose plugs, which she used to avoid the horrible stench of Jess\u2019 house. \u201c that place is revolting, how could anyone live like that? And that women, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met anyone so fat in my life. I can\u2019t believe I got stuck as her doctor\u201d Doc Summers thought as she got in her car. She placed down her doctors notes and all the burgers she had confiscated on the passenger seat and began to drive home. As she was driving she got a whiff of the burgers and began to feel hunger. She looked down at the burgers and thought <br>\r\n\u201c ooo they smell quite good actually, and I have missed lunch. I may as well have one, saves time getting my own lunch plus it beats wasting all of them. It does go against my diet though\u201d she contemplated \u201cOh well it\u2019s just a one of, and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m ever gonna end up like Jess.\u201d Kate thought as She pulled over and grabbed one of the burgers. \u201cWow, these are huge, no wonder Jess is fat these are bigger then like full meals\u201d she thought as she bit in to one. \u201cOH MY GOD. \u201c she thought as she swallowed the greasy chunk of burger. \u201cThis is incredible. I\u2019ve never had a burger this delicious before. I wonder where she got it\u201d she thought as she began finishing it off. <br>\r\nAbout 10 minutes later. \u201cOhh that was so good\u201d she said letting out a small burp. \u201c I\u2019m so full.\u201d She moaned. \u201cGod I have to know where she got it from, that\u2019s some of the best food I\u2019ve ever had\u201d she thought as she looked down at the other ten. \u201cWell it\u2019s like I said, there is no point wasting them so I\u2019ll just have another later for dinner and have the rest over the course of this week. Then that will be it, cause it\u2019s not like I can eat these every day or I\u2019d end up like Jess and it\u2019s not like that\u2019s ever going to happen. \u201c Kate thought as she began driving again but couldn\u2019t stop thinking of the burgers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Jessica\u2019s house she had just finished ordering some food as her doctor confiscated hers. 24 Mega Burgers, with fries, drinks and Donuts were rapidly on there way to be devoured by Jess. <br>\r\nAs she was waiting Jess stared down at her gigantic body, she was now fully naked as clothes could not keep up with her expansion. She looked like a human blob, led on her back on the floor, with her stomach extended so far in the air it looked like a mountain of flab. Her sheer size prohibited her from sitting on her couch, so she now restored to just lying on a mattress on the floor. However she was so huge her fat ass, thighs and gut seeped over the mattress sides.  Her blubbery arms now rested on her formidable gut along with her titanic saggy breast, and her face was now thick with fat and had a very heavy triple chin. Jessica was very obese and she new it. She poked her fat body, disgusted at how soft and large it was. She picked up the sheet of paper the doctor had given her and read her weight. \u201c789lbs. I\u2019m so fat\u201d she thought as she heard a knock at the door. \u201cGood the foods here I need something to make me feel better\u201d Jess thought as she put down the paper and resumed her life of gluttony. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

After a run in with the delicious burgers she got a taste of from Jessica, Kate couldn\u2019t stop thinking about them. Almost every day she went to about 3 burger joints trying to find the insatiable burgers Jessica had at her house. She must have been eating over 20 burgers a week trying to find the place Jess got hers from. And with this craving of burgers came some very obvious side effects. Kate had put on about 25 pounds over the last month and this had made her clothes quite snug. Her thighs had gotten quite thicker, and her butt now had a slight wobble but most of all was the small belly she was beginning to develop. <br>\r\nKate grabbed her bag and set off from her office to Jessica\u2019s house. It was that time of month for her check up and even though Kate hated the sight of how disgusting Jess was, she could finally find out where she got her food from. <br>\r\nOnce Kate arrived she put her nose plugs in and opened the door to Jessica\u2019s house. She treded through a thick lair of garbage on the floor and entered the living room, where she was greeted by the sight of a colossal Jess stuffing her face. <br>\r\n\u201cOh my god. What a pig. I would never let that happen to me\u201d Kate thought in disgust. <br>\r\nAbout an hour past and Kate did her usual check up. She had just got of the phone with the health care council and then sat down to talk to Jess. <br>\r\n\u201c Right Jess. Your results show that physically your body is perfectly healthy, impart from the fact your near immobile. The drug we used is keeping your body healthy but however it can\u2019t fix the immobility issue, the fact is your just to fat to move.\u201d Kate said harshly as she was judging Jess. <br>\r\n\u201c Your current weight is 824lbs which is extremely large. I\u2019ve been informed that you have requested an in house assistant to help you as you cannot walk is that correct. And that you will pay more on your insurance if one is provided\u201c Kate said. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s right\u201d Jess replied. <br>\r\n\u201c Ok, then an assistant will be provided in the next couple of days.\u201d Kate said.  <br>\r\nAs Kate was leaving she saw a pile of unopened burgers and pizza about to be eaten by Jess.  Kate\u2019s mouth began to water as she stared at the greasy meals. <br>\r\n\u201cErr *cough* Now as a doctor I\u2019m obligated to confiscate this food as it is bad for your health. \u201c Kate said, when secretly she just wanted them for herself. <br>\r\n\u201cNow our of curiosity and for my doctors notes, err where did you happen to get these from\u201d Kate said trying to find the source of her guilty pleasure. <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s called whoppers. It just round the corner from here\u201d replied Jess. <br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay. Thanks\u201d Kate said bursting with excitement. <br>\r\nAfter her meeting with Jess Kate quickly walked to her car and eagerly pulled out some of the food she confiscated. <br>\r\n\u201c it\u2019s been to long\u201d Kate said as she took a bite. <br>\r\n\u201cOh my god. Its as good as I remember.\u201d Kate said intoxicated with the taste.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

More and more often, Jessica was going to bed stuffed to the brim after a whole day of constantly eating. She'd finish up her chores, laze around for a bit, then find herself overcome with intense hunger pangs.

Jessica had driven past the buffet hundreds of times before, as it was along the way to her daughters' school, but never had stopped in. Now, with a growing appetite, the beckoning buffet finally succeeded in luring the late twenties woman in. Finding a parking spot close to the restaurant, preventing an unwanted long walk, Jessica heaved her body out of her car and entered the establishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entry, Jessica was greeted by a variety of tantalizing smells. Bacon, fried chicken, macaroni, pizza, cake, pie, and so much more basked the walls of the buffet. Jessica's stomach growled more even demanding. Anxious for the oncoming feast, Jessica impatiently approached the cashier. \"Yes um how much does a meal for 1 person cost?\" Jessica asked the cashier who was a portly woman. \"Oh its all you can eat for just 5 dollars.\" the chunky gal smiled. \"FIVE DOLLARS!? That's a deal!\" rejoiced Jessica whipping out a five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith thick hips swaying side to side, Jessica hurried to the food. Grabbing a tray, Jessica quickly piled it with heaps of yummy foods. Jessica grabbed several slices of pizza, indulged with a pile of bacon, scooped huge plops of macaroni, generously partook of the fried chicken, and helped herself to a blueberry pie. Jessica's weak arms grew tired carrying the mass of nourishment to a table. \"Whew! That was heavy!\" Jessica admitted emphasizing how unaccustomed to arduous labor her unfit muscles were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh this looks so good.\" awed Jessica before voraciously digging in. Jessica picked at the chicken, greedily ripping the greasy meat off the bone. Leaving a pile of bones, Jessica than chowed on the pizza, forcefully shoving the slices down before scarfing down the salty bacon.  As empty space appeared on her tray, Jessica's pants grew tighter, digging deeply into her swelling belly. \"Ugh\" she moaned \"gotta undo these.\" Jessica attempted to unbutton her jeans, which were already far too tight before the buffet, but before managing, the button popped off. Immediately Jessica felt relieved as her belly poured out. \"Wow that feels so much better.\" Jessica patted her still hungry belly before polishing off her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite consuming everything on her tray, Jessica still hungered and went for seconds before returning with another pile on her tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was changing in the late twenties mother.  Never before had Jessica been striken by such relentless hunger. What once was satisfying now barely qualified for a snack. Cravings became overwhelming, tempting the stay at home mom to indulge in new foods. Jessica constantly thought about eating, even when she just ate. Yet Jessica didn't mind. She never cared for exercise or any sort of physical activities which is why she always preferred baking over playing outside. It's like she reasoned before. She's a mom and moms get fat. Her daughters certainly didn't mind. Coming home to a soft fleshy hug was always pleasant.<br>\r\nThough she'd probably need to change her clothes as her popped jeans attested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours a several piles later, Jessica waddled out of the buffet, holding her burst pants up with her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was so full from the buffet that she had go hold her belly while doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jessica made it into the house she headed upstairs to quickly change into a different pair of jeans. She opened her closet flipping though her clothes. She put on a pair dark blue denim jeans, her favorite one's. She had buttoned them but quickly unfastened them since they were uncomfortable on her stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica knew her daughter's would be home soon do she decided to prepare them something sweet to eat. She flipped through her cookbook trying to find something tasty to bake. After looking she had decided on fudge brownies. These were Hailey's favorite. Jessica put them in the oven and set the timer. She decided to take a nap before her daughter's came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;&gt;Beep&lt;&lt; The stove's buzzing woke Jessica up. She shuffled off the couch and entered the kitchen. She put on her mittens and took the hot brownies out of the stove. Jessica took a quick glance at the clock. It was 2:50. The girls usually got home around 3:05 so she had a couple of minutes to herself. She quickly tidied up around the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, there was a knock on the door. Jessica hurried over to the door. She realized that she had never buttoned her jeans so she quickly fastened them before opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy\", Annie yelled, lifting her hands up so her mom could pick her up. While picking up Annie she could feel how much heavier Annie had gotten. It was becoming more difficult to pick her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica carried Annie to the kitchen and Hailey followed closely behind them. Jessica placed Annie in a chair and headed over to the cabinet. She grabbed a plate and put the stack of brownies on them. Then she brought them back to the table for her and her daughters to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, Look at what Mommy made for you\", exclaimed Jessica. Both the girls whipped their heads around. They were very attentive now that food was around. Both of the young girls had recently became greedy due to their' mom's baking. Jessica's new fatty habits had not only effects her but her children as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 3 of the girls quickly grabbed a brownie and shoved it into their mouth. They ate very quickly for a few minutes. Jessica noticed that a little more than half of the brownies had been eaten and being greedy she told Hailey and Annie to stop eating. Both the girls whined. Even though they were full, they still wanted more. \"No more brownies tonight!\", Jessica exclaimed. She sent them away to go do homework and took the plate of brownies up to her room. She laid on her bed and began to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica loved brownies.Her baking skills were good and she knew it. Jessica let out a moan as she bit into another brownie. She had already eaten a good amount of them downstairs and her stomach was still filled with food from the buffet. Jessica was full but that didn't stop her from indulging in the remaining brownies. She had eaten 9  since she entered her room and her stomach started to feel uncomfortable. She lifted her shirt up and unbuckled her pants so she could rub her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her belly while she ate the remaining 5 brownies. When she was done she let out a low burp. Her cheeks heated up. Even though she was alone, she was still embarrassed. It was very rare that she burped but it was happening more frequently now that she was stuffing herself. She couldn't believe that she was getting do big. Jessica had usually been so tiny. She wad very conflicted about her weight gain.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica ran her hands down her figure--from her pudgy chest, down her swollen sides, past her wide hips, to her thick thighs. She had definitely gotten bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been gaining weight for a while, now. Having two kids and a general disdain for exercise (plus an insatiable sweet tooth) would do that. In her current bloated state, it didn't really make much sense for her to get on a scale. However, there really weren't a lot of moments from the past week where Jessica WASN'T bloated, so who knows how long she could forestall those fateful steps. Until then, however, the mirror would have to suffice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around to get a good look at her rear. She'd always had a nice butt, her (relatively) narrow waist emphasizing its roundness and size. In college, when she'd been hooking up regularly, Jessica loved it when a lover would give her a good squeeze while they were making out. Shopping for jeans, though, had always been difficult, even when she'd been slim, which is why she'd liked this pair so much. Normally, either the thighs would be too wide or the waist too narrow or some other compromise would be made for her body type, but this pair was just right, leaving her enough room in the all the right places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, they used to. Now, with soft fat spilling ever so slightly over the waistband, the fabric was stretched tight across Jessica's larger frame, to a point where if she was just two or three pounds heavier, they'd certainly split. She was reminded of that scene from The Incredibles, and suddenly found herself empathizing much more with Helen Parr than ever before. She gave her butt a good smack and watched the reverberations jiggle down her legs. It was clear that the days before she outgrew this pair were numbered, especially with the way she'd been stuffing her belly senseless lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, her belly really was the main event as far as her weight was concerned. Sure, her arms had gotten softer, her chest a little thicker, and there was undeniably more junk in her trunk. Ever since having kids, though, her belly had experienced the greatest growth of all. Jessica was much more accustomed to having a flat tummy. At her most toned, she'd gotten pretty darn close to having abs, but even at her heaviest, she'd only ever had a slight belly pooch, if anything. She tended to be pretty bottom-heavy, so her belly usually didn't put on as much weight as her thighs and rear, but it seemed that was changing as she got older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, her belly was undeniably round. Though it certainly would be smaller when not full of rich buffet food and brownies, Jessica was on the verge of growing a full-blown pot. She lifted her (too small) shirt over her belly to get a better look at its engorged form. Stretch marks from her pregnancies striped in familiar red channels across her taut midriff. Jessica ran a hand across them. Even when stuffed to the brim, she could feel the soft fat sinking just a bit into her belly. Any trace of her abs had disappeared about two pans of brownies ago, it seemed, but Jessica honestly didn't mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the side, she examined her profile. Her butt was still quite thick, but it came in at a close second to her swollen, balloon-like belly. Jessica rubbed a circle around her tummy, tracing her navel. She hadn't seen it this big since she'd been four months pregnant with Annie, but this was all food and fat, as evidenced by the way her belly wobbled when Jessica slapped it. She rubbed her hand soothingly over the red flesh where she made impact and pinched a good inch of pudge. Yep. Definitely food and fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica put her hands on her hips and sighed. She was definitely getting fat, there was no doubt about it, but her opinions about it were pretty mixed. She'd liked being slim well enough back in the day, but she wasn't about to give up baked goods just for a smaller tummy. And having a big belly wasn't so bad. She wouldn't admit it, but Jessica thought it was kinda cute--made her look soft and inviting. Maybe other men and women wouldn't find it as desirable, but what time she did have for dating definitely wouldn't be enough for such fickle folx anyway. Besides, it's not like she had the desire to hit the gym and properly work off the weight anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her fattened tummy, Jessica's musings were interrupted by...</span></div></div>",

Annie!\u201d Jessica called out, \u201cWho wants cookies and cake?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before she heard the light thuds come rushing down the stairs, followed by some heavier pounding. Haley and Ann came rushing in, making a beeline for the fresh soft cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful, don\u2019t burn yourself.\u201d Jessica said softly as they dug in. She grabbed one for herself and gobbled it down, then another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before they dug into the cake too. Jessica poured her daughters and herself a glass of milk as they dug in, the cake slowly disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica got up and carried the plates over to the sink as the two girls sat there in near silence, only the youngest, Annie a five year old, made any noise. She just breathed loudly, stuffed to the gills from eating too many sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley got up and refilled her glass of milk as Annie slowly got up and walked into the living room. After a few seconds they could hear some cartoon come on. Haley walked up next to her mother as she took another sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo wonder Annie\u2019s getting so fat, you bake all the time.\u201d Haley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica eyed her older daughter, the eight-year old was old enough to register weight, but had a blindspot when it came to her own weight gain.  Haley did sports at school, sure, she loved basketball and was even on a team, she might even be on the soccer team later, so her weight gain was slow, but still present. She wore a light pink t-shirt with a rainbow on it with clouds at each end, a pair of purple shorts, white sneakers, and had her hair in a pony tail. Where just a few months ago the thin girl would have fit into the outfit perfectly, things were changing. Her once flat stomach pressed out, at the moment it was mostly swollen from food, but even before she ate a new roundness had pressed out, not much but enough to notice. After she ate, her shirt rode up revealing some flesh. The waist of her pants, normally a perfect flat line, developed a crescent as her stomach swelled out from the meal. However, the meal hadn\u2019t caused the just slightly thicker legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Jessica had to admit, she wasn\u2019t wrong. A little over a year ago Annie had lost all the baby fat and looked like a thin little girl. Just a few months ago, Annie, had gotten just thin enough to feel her ribs just above her still soft belly, since then Jessica had needed to buy her a completely new wardrobe too fit her.  Annie had gotten skinnier then most girls her age. Now she had turned into a butterball, most of the fat going straight to an ever larger belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe isn\u2019t the only one.\u201d Jessica said turning to face her daughter, shifting her body some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica wore blue jeans and some baggy black shirt, her hair hung loosely down her back. In this outfit, her weight gain was noticeable. While her daughters were active, the most exercise she did daily was chase after them in the mornings. She thought most of the weight went to her hips, she really had gained the most in the back giving her butt some new found size and occasional jiggle, either way her jeans were struggling to contain her. Around her waist her weight gain was present, on either side a little fat pressed out on the waist of her pants, not love handles yet but if she didn\u2019t go up a size soon it was coming. Her stomach rounded out from the meal, but without all the food in it it wasn\u2019t much bigger yet, just softer. Her chest bulked up too, the shirt hid it but she needed a new bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley looked away sheepishly, \u201cWell, I hadn\u2019t noticed it on you, mom. You look fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d  Jessica replied, \u201cJust, don\u2019t be too hard on your sister. You got pretty plump when you were her age too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, good thing I lost the weight.\u201d Haley said turning around to walk away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess arched an eyebrow as she watched her daughter walk away. She hadn\u2019t noticed it yet, but where her formerly flat butt had been two round butt cheeks had sprouted and pressed against the fabric as she walked, forming a noticeable crease in between them. Haley headed out the door way, utterly oblivious to her own weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica rubbed her full stomach as she looked around. Cake, gone. Cookies, gone.  She finished her glass of milk while thinking about everything she had just ate. She undone the zipper on her jeans for the space, but left it buttoned.<br>\r\nShe sighed placed both hands on her overfed stomach, lost in though. She left the last two glasses in the sink to wash tomorrow and walked into the living room to join her daughters, cradling her swollen belly as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she thinking about?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She kept thinking about her ex-husband. She turned a light on and took a long look at a picture of him, with a slightly slimmer her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard was a commercial pilot. About a year ago, he had left her for another woman and moved halfway across the country. Since then she had started work and had been raising the two girls on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by that alone he sounds like a monster. That\u2019s not the case. Richard and Jessica\u2019s marriage had never been a good one, when they started dating it was never meant to be serious, but one night they forgot to use protection. About two months later Jessica told him Haley was coming. He proposed on the spot. They got married before Haley was even born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere marriage had its good times, but even at its best they both knew they didn\u2019t love each other. They tried to fall in love, the last ditch effort was a second honey moon, leading too Annie. But finally they had to admit it wasn\u2019t getting any better. A year after that he met another pilot, and they had a very amicable divorce. Richard emailed his daughters daily, called on the weekends, and visited at least once a month, sometimes staying a day or two in the guest room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paid a third of his salary to her in the form of alimony, but it was his idea. He didn\u2019t need it, being a pilot for a commercial airline and the National Guard, plus married to another pilot, he still lived very comfortably. Some men might not have been willing to give that much, he wasn\u2019t willing not too. He even freely gave her the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe respected him, cared for him, but wasn\u2019t in love with him. And he felt the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, she had started work again. While they were married she finished her degrees, in graphic design and webpage design. With the money she made from that plus alimony, she was hardly broke, and since she chose her own hours she could still be involved with her kids. It wasn\u2019t like she didn\u2019t have other support, she had a cousin and a brother living in the same town, happy to do anything for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she felt like crap at the idea of being a single mother. She hated the idea of divorce, she knew it was the right thing, but here she was. Alone. It had hit her hard a few months ago, and that was about when she started baking so much. She always baked a lot, it had always made her feel good to create something for others to enjoy, and recently that meant more than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica got out of bed,  wearing nothing but her underwear. Her panties were tight and wrinkled, stretching around her new hips and expanding rear. Her bra was no longer hidden by a shirt, now anyone could plainly see it pushing over the cups. Jessica grabbed her bathrobe and put it on, not out of modesty, she didn\u2019t care if her girls saw her naked let alone in her underwear, but it was a cool night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica slipped on her house shoes and silently headed out the door. She walked down the hall way, and out of ritual, she checked on her girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was Annie. She pushed the door open, and went in quietly, careful not to wake her. On her dresser was a photo taken of her a few months ago made at the mall. In it Annie was still the thin, even petite, little girl in bright pink over-alls. She didn\u2019t fit in them anymore, she out grew of them a while back. The last time she tried to wear them she only got one button on fastened, the other suspender hung loosely over her shoulder, her belly still pressing out against the fabric, demanding more room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore then Jessica had been in denial, but after she knew her daughter needed a new wardrobe she had to face it, her little girl was getting pudgy. Now she was getting even bigger. She took one look at her daughter, her stomach sticking straight up, gently moving as the butterball breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica snuck back out of the room silently. She then headed down the hall to check on Haley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she got to the door she watched Haley come out. In the dark light he couldn\u2019t see her very well, just the outline of her and her long night shirt. They both jumped when they saw each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Haley, what are you doing up this late?\u201d Jessica whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just woke up really thirsty. I figure I\u2019ll go down and get a glass of milk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smiled, \u201cWell, g\u2019night again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG\u2019night again.\u201d Haley nodded and they parted ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica went back to bed to try and get some sleep. Tomorrow was another day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She grumbled getting out of bed before heading out the door and too the bathroom, then she started getting the girls up. First was Annie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped in the door and headed over to her youngest, slightly jossled her by the shoulder.  \u201cIt\u2019s time to get up for school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie turned over and started taking the blanket off. She was a morning person, Jessica had no idea where she got it from.  Without the blankets, Jessica could plainly see her daughter\u2019s growth. The Elmo pajamas were a button up shirt and loose pants. The pants were still mostly loose, but the top wasn\u2019t completely buttoned. She had left the bottom button undone, her tiny naval plainly visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, Mom.\u201d She said wrapping her arms around her mother\u2019s hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, sweetie.\u201d  Jessica said, \u201cstart getting dressed, I\u2019m going to make breakfast in a bit.\u201d she said as she walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie rubbed her eyes as she watched her mom leave. Just like her mom and sister, she had a partial awareness of the situation. Her mom was only partially aware of her own, totally oblivious to the large rear Annie now watched leaving her room, while her sister had no idea she was getting softer at all.  The difference was Annie had no emotions tied to it. She got up and started getting dressed in the clothes her mom and her laid out the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica pushed Haley\u2019s door open and headed over, \u201cHaley, wake up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m making pancakes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley\u2019s eyes opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon everybody was around the breakfast table. Annie was the only one dressed, wearing a skirt and shirt. Jessica wasn\u2019t, she was still in her underwear. While neither was looking she stopped to adjust her tight underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley was in her night shirt still. It was her dad\u2019s once, long enough to reach her knees but not very baggy. She finished her plate and looked up, expecting more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica noticed her glance, \u201cThere isn't any more pancakes.\u201d She said, \u201cI made some cupcakes for your basket ball game tonight. You can have one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley smiled and headed over to the cupboard and stood on her tip-toes and stretched, noting the new sensation of her expanding belly rubbing against the counter and immediately forgetting it, unaware of her larger butt pressed against the back of the shirt. She got down a cupcake and started digging in, crumbs sliding down her shirt, inhaling it in less than two seconds.  She tried to reach for another one, \u201cNo.\u201d her mom stated before she could grab another one. Haley crossed her arms and looked at her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou can have more later, go get ready for school.\u201d She stated as she finished her plate and placed it in the sink. Annie snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too, little missey.\u201d Jessica said to her youngest, \u201cBrush teeth, go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie frowned and she left, Haley following. Jessica started out of the room, stopped to make sure Haley was safely up stairs, then grabbed a cupcake for herself. She enjoyed it, grabbed a second and devoured it, followed by a third. She almost grabbed a fourth, and paused. She needed those for the game. Instead she headed up stairs to her room to get dressed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Going to downward, her C size bra was at least a size small, her now bigger chest pushing over the fabric. Moving further down her belly was getting rounder, and softer. turning to the side she see her larger butt, starting to form down her thighs and butt cellulite forming on it, making it look like she had dimples. Giving a small slow breath, she grabs clean unders and starts to put them on. Jessica always preferred tight underwear but right now the clean pair was really tight. Cutting into her wide hips and no longer covering all of her bigger butt. Whiching bras were also tight, her chest spilling over, as well as making it hard to breath. Then grabbing her clothes for the day, she starts to put on her pants; her jeans were low rider jean. when Jessica had gotten them they were a little loose, now she was struggling to put them on, pushing her large butt into them she was able to get them on, and she was barely able to button them. Her jeans now showed a small muffin top and love handles, and then throwing on her shirt, her once nice fitting shirt now rode up a little. Getting her comb and quickly brush her hair, Jessica walked out and yelled, time to go girls.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica struggled to button up her jeans. It seemed no matter how much she stretched, bent, sucked in, or laid down, she couldn't get the buttons together. This was particularly worrisome for her as these were her fat pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good grief! Did I really put on that much weight!?</i> Panting slightly after her nearly twenty minute fight, she rested on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and the girls had kept to their routine over the last few weeks. Haley's team was doing really well at basketball, posting an impressive winning record. Of course, each win was celebrated at a local All-You-Can-Eat, and Jessica always baked for the team games. She also made plenty of extras for the inevitable taste tests that she and her girls would have beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica always took the time to hand prepare their meals, and was glad her work allowed her to do so. Breakfast was always a lively affair. Jessica tended to favor foods like pancakes and waffles, and always made sure there was a good assortment of toppings available. Haley, for example, tended to prefer her waffles with bananas and syrup, while Annie loved whipped cream and M&amp;M's on hers. Lunches on the weekends tended to vary depending on the day's plans, but burgers and hot dogs were common fare. During the week, the girls had their lunches at the school cafeteria, so Jessica would often eat out while on her way to the shopping center. Their suppers were fairly varied, but often included pasta dishes, pizza (both homemade and takeout), and meats like ham and roast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, there was Jessica's baking. After getting the girls off to school, Jessica would typically spend her mornings working in her office, usually in her underwear. Once she was done her work, and had finished her lunch and shopping, she'd come home and start baking. Cookies, cakes, pies, tarts, eclairs, and doughnuts were staples of her repertoire, but she was always searching online for new and exciting desserts to try. Her girls would typically get home as the treats were cooling, and Mother and Daughters would sit down and sample the many delights Jessica had made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven how much Jessica loved baking, it was usually a fairly decent amount of treats. Several cookies, a couple cupcakes and a slice of pie each was fairly common as an after school snack. Because of the time spent baking and eating, Jessica generally didn't start making dinner until after seven, meaning the family didn't often eat supper until after eight/eight thirty. After supper and finishing off more of the large pile of desserts, the girls were sent to bed. Jessica, meanwhile, would clean up the kitchen, and then go to the living room and finish off the desserts while watching some t.v. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica could see how a diet like that combined with her total lack of exercise could cause a person to gain weight. She was still hesitant to believe she'd gained so much in such a short period of time, but if even her fat pants (which had admittedly been getting rather tight for some time) had stopped fitting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she really didn't want to, Jessica got up from the bed and walked to her en-suite bathroom. Pulling the scale out from under the sink with her toes, she stepped on it. As she waited for the dial to stop moving, she got a decent eye full of her larger bust and belly. <i>Still, neither one looks big enough to have put on much weight.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scale stopped spinning at 168 pounds. <i>Fifteen pounds since I last weighed myself!? No way! My boobs have overgrown my bras, sure, and my belly is a bit softer, but neither one has gained that much. I knew these old analog scales weren't exact, but to be out that much, this old thing must be broken.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUtterly convinced of her scale's fallibility, Jessica pushed it back under the sink and turned to leave the bathroom. Had she looked in the mirror behind her, she'd have seen exactly where the weight had ended up. Her considerable posterior had a hefty jiggle to it, and the top of each cheek stuck out of her pants a little ways from how squished they were in the garment. Her hips had also noticeably widened, and had a bit more wobble to them then they used to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving little choice in the matter, Jessica changed out of her jeans and put on her sweat pants. Though she hated wearing them outside the house, wearing pants she couldn't button was a certain no-go. Pulling on her socks and grabbing her purse, Jessica headed downstairs. \"Girls! It's time to go! Let's get a move on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was taking her daughters clothes shopping. Haley had hit a growth spurt and was rapidly outgrowing nearly everything she owned. Annie needed some new clothes as well, and as Jessica now knew, so did she. As she waited for her girls, she wondered if they had suffered the same weight gain she'd had. She certainly wasn't about to force them on a scale (they didn't need to develop any body issues now, if ever), but she couldn't help but be a little curious given her daughters' eating habits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley avoided vegetables or anything nutritious like the plague, and likely would have died from scurvy had Mom not insisted on her taking vitamins. She very likely would live on desserts if Jessica let her, and she was constantly sneaking cookies and cupcakes from the kitchen. One time, Jessica had even caught her eating a tub of icing from the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie, on the other hand, was an irrepressible glutton. Getting her to eat vegetables was no problem, especially if they were soaked in cheese sauce. The only hard part was actually getting her to stop. The precocious 5 year old made it a point of pride to out-eat her sister at all times, usually by two or three of whatever they happened to be eating at the moment. Haley also had taken to using her sibling as a garbage disposal, putting what she didn't want to eat on Annie's plate whenever Jessica wasn't looking. The end result of this was Annie typically ended her meals stuffed to the gills, panting heavily from the quantity of food inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley's light footsteps contrasted with Annie's heavier ones, and the elder daughter came around the corner first. Her added height was definitely noticeable, at least a good three or four inches. While she didn't seem to have lost any of her thickness, she didn't seemed to have gained any either. Her legs were still firm and thick with muscle, and while a small amount of fat clung to her belly and behind, it wasn't much. Any weight Haley had put on seemed to have gone into her height and muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the elder bent down to tie her shoes, Jessica's other daughter came around the corner. Annie...</span></div></div>",

Her weight gain was likely only equal to that of her sister, but since she hadn't yet grown, she had fewer places to put it, making it far more noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly had notably taken most of the weight. It stuck out in front of the little girl by several inches, wobbling impressively as she moved, and was beginning to droop as its size and the force of gravity took hold. Her torso had also widened considerably. Her little girl had love handles that overhung her pants, and side rolls were clearly visible under her skin-tight shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs had migrated from plump little turkey legs to fat little piggy ones. Her thighs and calves were round and flabby, and were large enough to interfere with Annie's stride. Her behind had also taken its fair share of the weight, and had stretched the material of her (previously baggy) pants to near bursting, As she bent over to put her shoes on, Jessica watched as her derriere pushed against the seat of her pants, stressing the already suffering material even further. Her bottom had gotten so large that it was no longer round, but closer to square shaped, and drooping under its mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she got her shoes on, she turned to her mom and smiled. Her face was round, with chubby chipmunk cheeks, and big dimples when she smiled. Her neck and arms had also put on some weight, though nowhere near as much as the rest of her body. Still, they jiggled as Annie moved her plump little body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was perhaps what made her weight gain all the more noticeable. Annie's body was a constantly wobbling, jiggling mass, striving to burst from or escape her clothes. Even as she stood there, she had to pull her Big Bird pants up over her bottom again, which was hard given how her flesh stretched out the material, and the bottom of her belly and love handles stuck out from the bottom of her matching shirt. Annie didn't even bother to adjust the shirt, as her many attempts had proven there was no chance of the garment covering her up completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes, the three of us are in bad need of bigger clothes,</i> Jessica thought, thinking back to the pants on her bedroom floor.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jessica got her girls in the car, Haley asked, \"Mom, can we get something to eat first? I'm starving!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll grab something on the way to store. Until then, I brought some eclairs to tide us over until then.\" Haley smiled and climbed in the car excitedly while Mom helped Annie into her car seat. It wasn't as easy a feat as it used to be, as the little butterball's growing body oozed from the seat and made bringing the belts together somewhat for difficult. Passing Annie an eclair from the bag that Haley was currently digging into, Jessica wondered if Annie was heavy enough to be above the minimum weight to ride without a car seat. <i>Course, if she gets much bigger, she'll outgrow it, and it'll be kind of a moot point.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three happily ate their way to the local Burgers-R-Us, with Haley finishing off three eclairs, Annie four and a half (she dropped part of one on the floor), and dear old Mom a whopping seven. Jessica had timed it perfectly, as they were just finishing the bag as they pulled into the restaurant. Parking the car, Jessica and the girls made their way inside, Annie finishing off the remaining half an eclair she'd grabbed off the floor on her way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica had her girls grab a seat while she ordered their food. \"Could I get four kid's meals, three quarter pound cheeseburgers and fries, a large box of nuggets, three half pound double cheeseburgers with extra cheese and fries, nine apple pies, and three large cokes please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyes of the kid running the tile almost popped out of his head at that order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jessica got back to the table, the three girls dug into their food with gusto. Annie was stuffing nuggets into her face with both hands, while Haley seemed to scarf down her burgers without chewing them. Though Jessica wouldn't have credited it, she was probably the worst of the three, flat out inhaling her lunch before helping the girls finish off theirs. Despite the large amount of food in front of them, the pile was demolished in short order. As Annie finished her pies (in a rare occurrence, finishing after her sister), she asked, \"Mom, can we get more pies? I'm still hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll grab some more from the counter,\" Jessica said, unable to refuse her youngest's request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley watched as her Mom got up from the booth and went to the counter. Jessica's wide hips and large, wobbly butt were obvious even in her sweat pants, and as she turned around and came back, her full belly and enhanced bust came on display. Her belly had gotten fairly round and her soft rolls were obvious even with her shirt on. Her boobs had definitely grown, jiggling heavily as she walked and placing the buttons of her shirt under severe stress. <i>Geez,</i> thought Haley, <i>between the butterball and Mom, I'm the only thin one in this family.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"butterball\" clapped excitedly as she received more pies for her bottomless belly. She was perhaps more observant than the other two women of the family. She knew she was fat, but she had no emotions either for or against it; it was simply how she was. She watched her older sister as she grabbed some more pop for herself. Haley's weight gain may have been slower, especially in light of her recent growth spurt, but it was still there. Her derriere pushed against the seat of her pants, and her belly squished against the counter as she filled up her drink. She, like Mom, was jiggling more as she walked then she had even a couple weeks ago. Even her face had noticeably rounded. Annie thought her Mom must have had a blind spot where her girls were concerned, as she still seemed to think Haley was skinny and needed to gain weight, while Annie was \"pleasantly plump,\" not \"fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Mom? Jessica has ordered herself another burger meal, and her already bloated belly grew a little more as even more food was stuffed into its cavernous depths.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the start of December, and that was an exciting month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Haley and Annie had been born in this very month, Annie on the 5th, and Haley on the 15th. And with Christmas just around the corner after that, it meant that December was a very exciting month for those two girls. And combined with Thanksgiving, it also meant food; lots and lots of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much extra food was honestly hard to say. In truth, the three ate almost constantly when they weren't at school or asleep, or simply constantly in Jessica's case. And if anything, Jessica's addiction to baking was only getting worse, even starting to interfere with her work schedule. There were only two things Jessica loved more then baking, and that was the two tiny terrors currently in the living room eating the previous batch of cookies. The two were watching a movie while Mom got the next batch ready to go in the oven. The plate of cookies sat between the two on the couch, and though neither one said anything, both were surprisingly deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley looked at her younger sister with a mixture of awe and disgust. She'd gotten so fat! Her belly stretched out to her knees, and her love handles and rolls were far too large for a child her size. Though hard to see under the blubber of her upper body, Haley knew her lower half had also plumped up. Mom had taken Annie clothes shopping twice more since their Back-to-School shopping, and it looked like Tubby the Destroyer of Desserts would need to go again before too long. <i>Especially after this month</i>, thought Haley, as she thought about the sheer gluttony this month would doubtless entail. As Annie grabbed and ate another three cookies, Haley watched her plump cheeks and developing double chin. She mentally shook her head, and wondered how her sister couldn't tell how big she was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie knew considerably more then her older sister thought. The truth was she knew how big she was; she just didn't care. And truthfully, though it was hard to tell under her girth, Annie was at last starting to grow up instead of out. Haley, on the other hand, was a different story. Basketball had wrapped for the year last month, and with soccer not starting until late February, Haley now had a lot of time on her hands. Unfortunately for her waistline, she chose to fill her hands with her Mom's delicious and fattening treats. This was made even worse by the fact that Haley's current growth spurt was also at an end, giving the calories nowhere to go but out. Annie looked at her growing sister. Her belly was tight against her shirt, and her belly button was clearly visible. Annie kept sneaking glances as Haley ate, watching as her shirt rode further and further up as she filled her belly. If she kept up at this rate, it wouldn't be too long before she was as wide as Annie, and even with her natural obliviousness, she couldn't fail to notice her weight gain then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls, however, paled next to Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica had blown up like a balloon over the last couple of months. When the harshest physical activity you do all day in housework, and you fill nearly every waking moment with eating, it was only to be expected. She'd finally passed the point where she was baking too much for even her daughters to keep up with her output, so Jessica had taken to eating more to avoid wasting a single crumb. Her standard lunch, which had consisted of two whopper meals, had grown to include a third, and a second stop on the way home. After school snacks had also grown to include an entire pie rather then a mere slice, and eating cupcakes had become as common as breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next batch is in!\" Mom said as she came into the living room. The two girls got quite the show as Jessica came into the room, wearing naught but her painfully stretched underwear. Her belly was divided into two large rolls even while standing up, with a third fold of fat under her bust. Her belly was beginning to droop, and was giving the indication that it would eventually be an apron belly. Her boobs were straining her large bra past its limits, and her upper arms were noticeably girthy. Her hips had widened a fair bit, but paled next to her ass. Her butt had grown absolutely huge. The tremendous, wobbling extremity was covered with cellulite and proved a massive hazard whenever she was walking by something. Her thighs had kept pace, and were rapidly approaching \"thunder thighs\" territory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a large plate, she heaped it with cookies and brownies, then sat down on the loveseat. Her drooping derriere hit the cushions long before the rest of her sunk in. The loveseat gave a creak as it took the full load of her weight, and Haley found her eyes locked on her Mom's belly as it spread over her lap. Each of the three had their own thoughts as they feasted in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley couldn't believe how fat her mom and sister had gotten, and how she was the only one who was still skinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie wondered how long it'd be before Haley was as big or bigger then Mom, and whether or not she should have more cookies or grab some pie next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was wondering if she had any more brownies kicking around, and what kind of cakes to make for her daughter's birthdays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthor's note: won't lie, I'm not terribly happy with my chapters for this one, nor do I really care for the direction this is going. I just don't like writing scenes with children. I'll be abandoning this branch after this chapter, so if someone has an idea they want to run with, go right ahead.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This is the branch of the story for people that would like to focus on the children. The story is still \"Adult weight gain\", so Jessica will never stop gaining weight (at least, as anything other than a plot device to gain more weight later, like a crash/fad diet or something). But this branch, at least for the immediate future, is for focusing on the effect Jessica's gluttony is having on her kids, and how much she seeks to indulge them and/or is blind to their gaining compared to her own enormous, adult self. After all, fat adults can raise even fatter kids. Anyway, this was just to segue from the previous chapter's strange ending, so on to the story!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Jessica started ramping up the baking, Annie noticed. Annie was a very observant child. And although Jessica had ramped it up to the point that her two kids couldn't keep up... Annie was determined. She loved her mom's baking, and she wanted more of it in her belly. She wanted her belly to grow, to be able to handle more and more of that delicious sugary goodness!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Haley was looking on in horror as her sister \"obliviously\" stuffed herself fuller and fuller every night. But in reality, it was Haley who didn't realize what she herself was doing. It turns out, when both your mom and <b>younger</b> sister are stuffing their faces with junk food night after night, there isn't much you can do but join them. After all, if she was still eating less than her younger sister, that must mean she's fine, right? Older kids are supposed to eat more, after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with this pattern continuing, and both girls continuing to expand at a rapid rate, doing almost nothing but eating and watching TV while at home, the evening of the 4th rolled around and Jessica asked Annie what kind of cake she'd like tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I bet she doesn't care as long as she gets a whole one to herself</i>, though Haley snarkily. But even despite this thought... she was shocked when her little sister actually said it out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... I was thinking, mommy, all of these brownies and cookies every night have been so good, can I just get a whole chocolate cake for myself? You can make whatever kind of cake for you and Haley, too!\" Annie replied, half-giddily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was taken aback at first, since this did seem like a pretty ridiculous request at face value. But when she thought about the actual ingredient list for the cakes she'd normally bake for birthdays, she realized... <i>huh, I guess that would be only a little over a third of my usual baking load these days</i>. A normal person would take that thought and realize what utter pigs they had been turning their family into, but Jessica was fully giving into gluttony and instead replied kindly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, honey. I'll make a similar one for myself. Haley, do you want one the same size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley was just kind of in shock at this point and replied cautiously, \"Uhm, sure, mom....\" After all, she didn't have to finish it. She had self control, unlike Annie! And besides that, she wasn't even sure she <b>could</b> finish one. With that, the trio continued their evening binge watching reruns on the couch until it was time to go to bed, with Annie practicing her appetite by gorging herself as much as possible, and Haley eating more than usual just because she was in a mind-numbing state of shock from the conversation that had just transpired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie's birthday happened to be on a Saturday this year (so Haley was stuck with a Thursday in a couple of weeks), and with the day off from school, the family pigged out together with no regard for the cakes that would come later. For breakfast, Jessica made them all huge stacks of pancakes, waffles, and french toast, all high-carb foods that were of course slathered with butter and syrup. Haley was looking at Annie inhaling food and wondering when she was going to pop, when all of a sudden, she actually heard a pop... but not where she expected it from. She looked down and saw that her own jeans button had actually popped off. <i>Ugh, they shrunk in the wash.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annie, I know it's your birthday but would you mind if mom took us clothes shopping today around lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*mph* no *munch* 's fine, my *gobble* clothes are getting pretty tight, *swallow* too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What does she mean, too? Most of my clothes are fine, I just don't want mom's laundry skills to make me go to school naked....</i> thought Haley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't I get a say in this?\" Jessica jokingly interjected. \"But yeah, I guess it's a good time to upgrade both of your wardrobes. We can go to a few fast food drive-throughs while we're out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley mentally made a note that her mom was thinking of more food later even as she gobbled down chocolate-chip pancakes and belgian waffles in the same forkful, not even realizing that at this point, she was nearly matching her mother bite for bite, paying much more attention to the fact that Annie was eating more than either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as Haley was concerned, the trip outside was uneventful. Haley completely ignored that she now had to shop in the same Husky section that her sister had been shopping at for a few months now, instead chalking up her new clothing size to a growth spurt that had ended early last month. The 5 drive-throughs they visited, getting an average of two adult meals per person per restaurant, was also uneventful to Haley. She ate her share and was fairly satisfied, and as Annie kept begging for more, Haley accepted more as well when it landed in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen dinner rolled around, Haley was... kind of full. As soon as they got home, Jessica had handed out brownies as usual, which she had finished baking right before they left. So Haley was actually a little surprised--she had forgotten--when Jessica came out holding a large chocolate cake, very generously frosted, with candles denoting Annie's new age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't worry, honey, this one is just yours. I just didn't want to bring them all out at once, or I might've dropped them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, the family did have trays large enough for holding three of these cakes on them, but Jessica's maneuverability had suffered a bit with her increasing waistline, so her fear of tripping while carrying that much cake was not unfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the last of the cakes was brought out, the three dug in with gusto. These cakes were the best Jessica had ever bake! ... if she did say so herself. But her daughters clearly felt the same way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie was less than a quarter of the way through when she gave up any pretenses of using a fork and just started digging in with her hands. As such, she ended up finishing her cake first, her new tent of a shirt not being strained too much by her taut belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was having a bit more trouble... but only because she hadn't gone shopping for herself today. At halfway through, as she was starting to slow down, she undid her pants button of her own accord, letting her belly swell outwards and giving her ample room to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley, on the other hand, had never even considered eating as much food as she had today. At halfway through, despite the ample give of her clothes, she put her fork down in defeat. It wasn't the cake itself, it was just everything else she had stuffed herself silly with. For the first time ever, she noticed her belly was a globe in front of her. Of course, it was super hard, so she still wouldn't entertain the thought of being \"fat\"--no, that word was reserved for the behemoth bellies her mother and sister carried. But even so, she figured maybe she had eaten quite a bit today, to have such a big \"food baby\". It was at this point that she noticed her little sister eyeing her cake....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Annie, you can have the rest of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, in that case, I'll take some as well!\" Jessica interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only five minutes before the remaining half of the large chocolate cake was eaten. Jessica leaned back and rubbed her belly. Annie thoroughly licked every last bit of icing off of her slathered fingers before doing the same. Haley just groaned, the reality of the day's eating starting to catch up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie was the first to speak up again. \"We should do this... more often....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica just chuckled. Her little daughter was so adorable! Though, she wouldn't mind really stuffing herself like this every so often... the normal fare of her baked goods was satisfying, but it no longer gave her a really stomach-stretching feeling, and she felt like maybe she should fix that....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the days passed with a steady increase of gluttony, all three pigs of the household stretching their stomachs to new limits on a daily basis. When the evening before Haley's birthday came around...</span></div></div>",

But I'm not actually interested in this branch, so it'll be a very short chapter before people can branch it themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's gluttony was out of control. Her baking kept increasing and her portions were just getting larger because of it. The girls' birthdays came and went, with Jessica making an extra-extra-large sized chocolate cake for each and eating about 2/3 of the first and 3/4 of the second cake. Her speed of eating increased, too--Annie, at least, would've had more cake if she had been fast enough, but alas, her mother was too quick on the draw and her appetite was suffering for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind you, both kids were still eating more than enough for kids their age, so neither was going hungry. But the recent trend of increasing portions leading to increasing appetites was being bucked, and the girls settled into a steady state of somewhat unhealthy portions of mostly unhealthy food that led to them maintaining their existing waistlines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristmas came and went as well, and a plate of Christmas cookies for the family soon became ten plates just for Jessica. Finally, after New Year's it was time for the girls to start a new semester. Jessica took some time to evaluate herself and her kids around the new year, thinking on whether there were any resolutions she should make. Overall, she had been pretty happy with how the previous year went, and figured certain things should continue on the way they had been. She also took note of her daughters and noted that they had both gained some weight in the past few months, wondering whether she should take them to the doctor soon to get them checked out.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hannah had it all: a handsome, devoted husband; big house in suburban Sycomore Hill; a fancy car; expensive wardrobe; and a membership to the local country club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of her good fortune, Hannah was bored and somewhat lonely. While she had some acquaintances that she called friends, she spent most of her time alone, longing for something that she couldn\u2019t name. She loved her husband, but his job kept him busy, and she had hours and hours to fill on her own each day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently, Hannah had discovered that cooking was enjoyable, and she began to try new recipes on a regular basis. She liked brunch food the best, and with those hours wide open in her usual routine, she began making herself brunch almost every day. The cooking challenged her, and her abilities improved with each new dish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this new hobby, Hannah noted that her clothing was getting a bit tight, but saw this as more of an indication that she should probably upgrade the clothes in her closet rather than a problem with her weight. She had never been much of a workout buff, but she did use the country club fitness facilities sometimes and thought that this would keep her close to the 5\u20197\u201d 130 pounds at which she had begun her marriage a couple of years ago, regardless of other activities. As such, she invested in some new yoga pants, bras, and tops, willfully ignorant of the fact that she now weighed 147 pounds, the heaviest she had been in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her search for new recipes, Hannah discovered Carmen Colazione, an Italian-American YouTube chef who shared some amazing concoctions. Hannah had yet to find one of Carmen\u2019s creations that she didn\u2019t love, but was also intrigued by something else about Carmen. Scrolling through Carmen\u2019s channel, one could see that she had changed. She had begun as a sort of normal looking girl teaching cooking techniques, but as time passed, she had morphed into an increasingly large woman. With that, Hannah noted, she took on a more outsized personality, dressing to show off her ever bigger boobs, and adopting her catchphrase, \u201cFor some, it might be too much, but I\u2019M EXTRA!\u201d, usually uttered when adding things like more butter or additional chocolate chips to a dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Hannah watched Carmen and ate her recipes, the more she was mesmerized. She was constantly googling Carmen, looking at before and after pictures, and engaging in  her favorite activity, often performed while eating: reading comments that people made about Carmen. They could be loosely categorized into three groups: comments about the dishes; fat shaming remarks; and Hannah\u2019s favorites - encouragement to keep eating, how hot Carmen looked, or best of all, a combination of both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah\u2019s searches for Carmen led her to others that were interesting: entertaining chefs, cam girls and celebrities who had inadvertently gained weight, and women who stuffed themselves gleefully and meticulously tracked the progress that they were making as they added pounds to their bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she found some favorites, Hannah was consistently drawn back to Carmen. She fantasized about what it would be like to be her, growing in size and in confidence before an audience, flaunting her curves, letting people know that her size and her personality might be too much for some people, but that she was unapologetically EXTRA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah was spending more and more time eating, browsing, and fantasizing. She wiled away hours, grazing through dishes meant to serve 4-6 while focusing on flattering photos of Carmen and the others and the encouraging remarks made by their adoring, anonymous audiences. She hadn\u2019t been to the gym in weeks, and wasn\u2019t really missing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot surprisingly, Hannah found that her new clothes were becoming progressively ill-fitting, and one morning, after squeezing herself into an outfit, she began to reckon with herself. As opposed to her indifferent response previously, this time Hannah found herself conflicted. She had gained weight, to be sure, but how much? Was she getting fat? What did she expect, sitting around all day, eating and not going to the gym? She dusted off an old bathroom scale and stepped on. The digital display bounced around before settling at 162. 162?! That was 32 pounds more than on her wedding day! She looked in the mirror, noting her stretched out yoga pants. She pulled her top up to find her soft belly bulging over the waistband. She felt her breasts, straining a bra that now dug into her back.She was getting huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thought echoed for a moment. \u201cHannah, you\u2019re getting huge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHannah, you\u2019re getting fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEating all that food you\u2019re cooking, Hannah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf Hannah gets any fatter, she\u2019s going to roll away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thoughts were scrolling through her head like comments on a website, and then she paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep eating, Hannah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look amazing, Hannah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill that recipe give me boobs like you, Hannah? I\u2019ll make a double batch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHannah, that body is EXTRA!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hannah considered all of the positive reinforcement that people had showered on Carmen and the others and transposed her own name, Hannah\u2019s doubt and negativity didn\u2019t disappear, but it lessened. Just as she focused on the good things that were said online, she magnified them in her brain. And she knew what she would do next: get some better fitting clothes. But first, brunch...she had been craving a cream cheese French toast recipe that she had learned from Carmen a couple of weeks earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that moment forward, Hannah began to embrace what had been a desire hiding in plain sight. She wanted to live confidently, showing off her body, feasting on decadent meals, and feeding off of the positive attention. She devoured the desired French toast as she admired Carmen\u2019s largesse, and then made her way to the shopping center, where she loaded up on push up bras, low cut tops, and tight clothing of all manner before having some ice cream, just because.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her husband returned home that evening, he found Hannah showing off an impressive and unprecedented  amount of cleavage. He smiled and said, \u201cWent shopping today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like?\u201d Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed, and she knew she had his undivided attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome people might think it\u2019s a bit much, but I\u2019m EXTRA.\u201d She said, before tackling him onto the couch and smothering his face with her boobs. As he grabbed at her, all she could think about was how she was just getting started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the days passed, Hannah lived as she wanted, but it wasn\u2019t too much longer before she realized that there was still something missing...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hannah\u2019s inner conflict returned when she thought about putting herself out there for public consumption. It was one thing to go to the club for dinner with her husband and watch people\u2019s heads turn as she walked past. She knew that she was likely being met with a combination of thoughts about how much weight she had gained, how her tits were bouncing around on full display, and how much she was going to eat at dinner. It was another to think about letting strangers on the internet  know how much weight she had gained, how she loved showing off her bigger tits and how much bigger they were, and letting them watch her actively pack food away as she grew in confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, she needed the comments. She wanted to know what people thought. Her only validation at this point had come from her husband, who never remarked on her weight, but let her know verbally and physically that he liked the new look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started simply: a post with before and after photos and a voiceover talking about how she had gained 40 pounds on the \u201cCarmen Colazione diet\u201d and loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, she cooked, ate, and watched as the comments came streaming in. There were haters, sure, but she reveled in the remarks about how healthy she looked now and how her body was amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer next effort was live footage. She set up a camera in her kitchen, and showed people how she cooked and ate an entire serving of her favorite Carmen cream cheese filled French toast, reviewing it as she went, explaining that she was stuffed by the end but couldn\u2019t stand to waste a single bite. Again, she rejoiced as people commented, with her favorite being, \u201cHannah, you won\u2019t stay that size for long eating like that, but seems like that\u2019s a gOOd thing!\u201d She loved the subtle reference to her ballooning breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe became more and more comfortable with every post, and had output a couple of times a week. Once a month, she\u2019d do a \u201cbefore and after\u201d piece in which she\u2019d show a picture of herself at 130 pounds and a current photo followed by a focus on the new image pointing out her current weight, the amount gained, and the increase in her measurements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lived for these days, because not only were they her most popular posts, but they let her reflect on her changes. Two months in, she was impressed to report that she was up to 205 pounds. She was delighted to be a top-heavy gainer, progressing from a 34B to a 36DD, with a waist that had expanded from 29 to 34 inches. Her hips had barely kept pace as they grew from 30 to 34 over the same time frame, but this mattered little to Hannah, because she generally showed herself from the chest up, allowing her boobs and round face to dominate the screen, giving her and her devoted followers most of what they wanted to see anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the day of this two month posting, though, something would change for Hannah:</span></div></div>",

It was always her intention for she possessed a primal craving for watching girls get fat. Just the notion of a slim girl thickening, going from a fast, perky girl into a plump, waddling girl, excited Courtney. Thus she reasoned that being a teacher would enable her to quell her hunger. Courtney was ecstatic the day she found out that an all girl school had an opening, she immediately applied and dazzled the school board so much that they hired her, of course she kept her devilish yearnings surreptitious. Once she landed her job, Courtney concocted plans to live out her fantasy. With a sure fire agenda her 3rd grade class would plump up nicely, although she would also end up gaining incidentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first day of Courtney's teaching career, her class was full of energetic, bright eyed, skinny girls and even Courtney was still a trim and toned woman. Courtney sat at her desk anxiously waiting for her students to file in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy I can't wait. I have such a scrumptious surprise for them teehee.\" Courtney softly spoke to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the girls entered chatting about. Courtney studied all of them, observing their thin bodies, fantasizing about smothering those bones in blubber. Then a cute little blonde girl approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey are you going to be our new teacher?\" asked the amiable blonde girl sporting a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes I am, I hope we become good friends.\" Courtney responded imagining the blonde girl twice as heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay!\" the cheery girl enthusiastically replied before skipping to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce every girl was sitting at their desk, Courtney introduced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome class, I'm Ms. Courtney and I've got quite the agenda for this class.\" She had to restrain a smirk. \"Now as a sign of friendship, I'm giving each of you a treat.\" she pulled out a tray from under her desk bearing cupcakes. \"So please every girl have some, there's certainly enough for everyone.\" Courtney announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" the jubilant class proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls quickly got up and took a cupcake, however upon the first bite, the girls learned that they were more than the typical cupcake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow these are cream filled!\" exclaimed a girl. \"MMM so yummy!\" stated another.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy.\" Courtney said. \"Yeah eat up girls, pack on the pounds. I was up all night making those cupcakes.\" Courtney thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm Ms. Courtney these are so tasty, you really should have some.\" insisted the cheery blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh umm sure.\" Courtney spoke \"Well I knew I was going to have to gain weight during this agenda.\" she thought as she grabbed a cupcake and bite into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney made plenty of cupcakes so each girl had seconds some thirds. Courtney took great satisfaction at the sight of their expanded bellies that she was unaware that she herself had eaten four cupcakes. After the high calorie cupcakes were devoured class started as did more fattening for Courtney brought along a huge bag of candy, rewarding students for correct responses. She made sure the questions were easy. The girls were totally oblivious that each correct answer added to their waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few weeks the girls had become plump thanks to the plans Courtney had implemented from corrupting recess, bringing in food, manipulating lunches, adding cooking class, and convincing the gym teacher to ease up on the girls. But it wasn't merely the students who put on weight, for Courtney herself had gained 25 pounds as a result of the fattening agenda, a consequence which Courtney happily accepted if it meant she got to fatten up her class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently Courtney was fattening the girls up...</span></div></div>",

Courtney loathed the idea of the girls burning off the calories that she so desparately craved. Therefore to ensure that the calories would stick, Courtney sabatoged the girls' recess by preventing intense games and suggesting more sedentary activities like patty cake. Courtney introduced new games to the girls, games which lacked physical exertion thus protecting their forming fat. Courtney would also talk to the girls thus interrupting their exercise even providing snacks for the girls. Of course sitting down snacking with the girls plumped her up a bit too, which did not bother Courtney in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently Courtney was gleefully watching the girls walk around, their bodies possessing a nice layer of fat, hindering their desires to run around. However, Courtney saw something displeasing. It was a group of older thin girlstrying to get her class to play soccer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no that won't do. I can't let my cute tubbies get provoked into excessive activity.\" Courtney thought, finding the notion of her class losing weight unsettling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney approached the older girls attempting to chase them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" Courtney demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just trying to start a game.\" said one of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well too bad you can't play soccer.\" Courtney scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!

Her name was Lyla and she had gained alot of weight under Courtney's influence. Lyla the once cute, cheery, thin blonde had blimped up into a fat jolly girl as a result of Courtney's agenda.

Each woman came as a perky slim newbie weilding such optimism only to watch their waists widen and clothes tighten. Helplessly watching their once flat stomachs bulge, their perky boobs ooze out of their uncomfortable bra, their tone butts spill out of their taut skirts.

The youngest daughter, Lisa, came in first clearly not interested in anything. She had headphones in both ears and a look on her face that said \"leave me alone\". Lisa was skinny, she was average height, around 5'6\", and she was very pretty. She had stunning blue eyes with longer blonde hair and had a nice figure which weighed around 107 lbs. She sported a modest bust and had a less than average ass, however at her size she was still beautiful. Lisa liked to stay to herself, normally in her room after school, and had headphones in when she was at school. She was fairly popular, she had a good group of friends, but she just wasn't interested in being social often. Becca loved Lisa very much but sometimes worried about her wanting to be alone all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Lisa came in the door and abruptly went upstairs, the other two girls, Emma and Megan, came in talking to each other. For being twins, they sure didn't always seem like it. For one thing, Emma was the preppy cheerleader girl. She was head of her squad in grade 11 which is pretty rare, and she was going to become the head again this year for her final year, but found that grades were too important for college, since last year being a cheerleader had negative effects on her grades and attitude. Even though she had quit cheer leading she hadn't lost her activity. She still worked out in her spare time, but she was doing less rigorous and intense training as she was when she was cheer leading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Emma and Megan had their similarities though. For one, they were both 5'9\", they both had dark hair like their mother, and had brown eyes that were quite pretty to get lost in. There was a little bit of difference though in appearance, which is their weight. Emma is a stunner with a very great ass and nice perky breasts that were a C cup. She weighed 115 lbs and she was admired by so many people, especially boys. Megan on the other hand, was a little bit bigger than her sister. She wasn't fat, that's for certain, but she was more plushy than her sister. She weighed 135 lbs, which gave her a big butt, but not in the same way as Emma (who enjoyed that a little bit in secret), she had a bit of a pot belly, but it wasn't overly noticeable and looked fairly healthy. Megan had a bit of a rounder face, but her favorite part was her breasts. They were a D cup moving their way on to E pretty soon it felt like. Megan enjoyed her cup size, and didn't mind that she was a little bit heavier, since she never exercised and didn't watch her weight like Emma. Megan considered it fair to be heavier in this case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the daughters came in, talking about the daily gossip and the boys that bothered them today, they put their bags down on the kitchen table and walked over to see their mother eating what looked like the latest baked goods, her famous cookies! Without thought Megan grabbed a couple (why keep making trips when she knew she would have more than one anyways?) and Emma just looked at them and fought off the urge to eat the delicious cookies, she needed to be the skinnier twin after all. She joined her sister and mother on the couch. Becca asked how their day was, and the girls gave her the daily news at the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Courtney seems to have put on some weight, if she keeps it up she won't be the leader for much longer haha\" Emma would say to which Megan would retort \"well have you seen Mrs. Henderson? She's supposed to be coaching them but it seems like all she does is eat, no wonder Courtney is putting on weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while of catching up, Becca asked...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After being married for 6 months, they invested into some software company and become super well off. They got a new house, and Adam and his friends started investing like crazy until they made their own business. Now they're very well off, not needing Becca to work a day of her life, so she decided to quit working at the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca was really quite happy with Adam, though she missed seeing him since he worked so much. Becca decided that she would do anything for him since he provided everything she ever needed. They weren't filthy rich, but they were comfortable to say the least. This gave Becca the chance to experience whatever she wanted. Becca is a modest woman, she isn't insanely over indulgent. She has a crossover vehicle, she has nice outfits but nothing over the top, and she doesn't feel the need to go out often. She had a very very nice life, and she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently, Becca has been eating more, she has bee a housewife for many years at this point. She had her kids at the age of 20, which was very young, but they wanted kids since they could afford it at that point. Becca was 38, and her figure wasn't what it used to be. She managed to to lose most of the baby weight after the twins, and even after Lisa, Becca was still only 150 lbs. In the past few years though, she's been on the rise. She's now up to 165, which is quite good compared to her friends making her the skinniest by far. She would host a lot of dinners with those friends (just one of the few reasons as to the housewife's widening frame) a couple times a month. Becca didn't try to over indulge, but food was just so good, especially her cooking, everyone loved Beccas meals, probably because she made an abundance of food any chance she could it seemed. This was a factor to Megans growing waistline and both of them knew it, but neither cared. The only person who seemed to care at all was Emma, since Lisa barley talked to any of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A salad? Again dear? Come on surly you can eat something a little more hearty, especially if you're going to the gym, you need energy after all.\" Becca said to her daughter who rolled her eyes at her mothers comment. \"As if she knows anything about staying in shape, she's as a bad as Mrs. Henderson, she mumbled to herself under her breath. \"What was that, Emma?\" Megan asked, knowing full well what she said, she just wanted to see Emma come up with something on the spot. Emma uncomfortably responded with her teeth closed, \"I said, you're right mom, what's for dinner?\" \"Well I have an idea, I'll go whip up some food, won't take long, and then maybe after we can do something as a family? What do you say?\" Emma and Megan both agreed, thinking it would be fun to do something together. \"You girls think of something to do after dinner while I get some food ready, okay?\" The girls began talking to each other about ideas, and decided upon a few things to do, but thought it might be best to wait until after dinner and go from there. However, they didn't expect...</span></div></div>",

There were platters of burgers and hot dogs, as well as sausages and a huge plate of french fries, but it didn't stop there. There was a huge plate of chicken strips that she deep fried, as well as loads of mozza sticks and dip. Deep fried pickles, mars bars, and she even made a pizza. A PIZZA! And of course there had to be dessert somewhere, even if it wasn't out on the table yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, someone get Lisa and let's eat\" Becca said with a smile wiping a bead of sweat off her head while she did so. Lisa came down and the girls sat down. Becca immediately began grabbing food, she grabbed a couple burgers and hot dogs as well as other delectable things and put them on her plate in a pile. Megan followed suit not thinking twice about the reprecussions of this excessive meal. Lisa was next, she grabbed just one burger and a few other things, a far more normal and rational amount than her overfed other and sister. Emma kept staring in awe and fear, knowing full well what this meal will do to her if she were eat as much as Megan and her mother, even Lisa maybe. Becca was quietly moaning as she grabbed her second burger, Megan keeping up pace with her mother as they were almost on to a second plate. \"Mmmm Mom this is soooo gooood! I don't know how you even do it\", Megan said before putting the rest of her burger in her mouth sloppily. \"Oh well thank you dear, I'm glad you're enjoying it. So are you I see Lisa.\" Lisa had finished her smaller plate at this point and had begun going for seconds, grabbing the hot mozza sticks and dip and putting one in her mouth, \"I'm mjust *grunt* humbry\". Becca had never seen Lisa so indulgent. \"Have more my dear\" Becca said passing a plate of chicken strips over to Lisa, who took a handful quickly while stifling a burp. \"Burp! Thank you.\" Becca then turned to Emma, who was still looking in shock at the whole thing. \"Emma you haven't eaten anything, are you okay?\" Emma didn't know what to do. She was hungry, and the food did smell good, but she knew if she caved in she'd put on weight, and the thought of ruining her figure wasn't something she was okay with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emma went towards the burgers, and just took one. <i>If I just eat this, I'll be fine, you can do this Emma, you can do this</i>, she thought to herself before taking a bite out of the greasy burger. AS her teeth took the bite, she forgot about everything in that moment except the food. <i>Have burgers always been THIS good!?</i> She thought to herself as she took a second, bigger bite from the burger. \"Mmmmmmm...\" she moaned making Becca smile at her, \"Sounds like somebody like their dinner?\" she said, giggling at the look on Emma's face. \"Here hun, have some more\" Becca said passing her more burgers and other delicious items. At this point, Emma was just way too into this burger to even think about the repercussions it may have on her figure. She poslished off her first burger faster than anyone else at the table, quickly grabbing more food. She tried a hot dog, and then another, and then another. She went for chicken strips, and sausages and anything else she could find. At this point her pants were getting tight, she had to undue her button to relieve pressure from her little round belly. Becca had also undone her belt and jeans, letting her larger gut release some pressure. Megan had also done this after her 3rd burger, not to mention the 4 hot dogs she practically inhaled. Megans potbelly was fairly prominent making her shirt ride up. Lisa was in the same position, feeling bloated but hungry at the same time. She had eaten a colossal amount of food. she was on her 5th sausage (her favorite food) rubbing her taut belly and groaning. Megan was also feeling the fullness in her gut, rubbing it and leaning back expelling a huge burp and shoved a handful of fries in her mouth. Both Becca and Emma were still eating, especially Emma. Both slower than when they started, they eventually finsied off the couple burgers and hot dogs that were left. \"Oh my go-Braahp- ugh 'excuse me.\" Emma managed to say with a large amount of effort. Hopefully everyone has a little bit of room left, I have something special to finish this meal with.\" Becca said struggling to get up the vast amount of food sloshing around in her full belly. Becca came back with a huge triple Decker chocolate cake, as well as a batch of her cookies. Each girl was so stuffed, but it looked too good to just pass up. Becca cut big slices for each girl, leaving only half the cake left afterwards. Megan dug in first, she had an insane sweet tooth, sugar was her biggest weakness. Lisa and Becca followed suit right after, while Emma looked at her belly and the slice of cake that was big enough for three people. <i>I really shouldn't</i>, she thought to herself, <i>I've eaten so much, I'll get fat if I'm not careful... although I've already eaten so much... mmm who cares right now</i>, she finaly thought to herself before digging in with gusto. \"Mmmmmoh my gawd Mom this is amaaazingg...\" Emma said before going back to her cake. Megan grunted in agreement while finishing her slice quickly. \"Can I have another mom?\" She asked Becca. \"Of course my dear, have some cookies as well\", her mother responded before passing the plate of cookies. Megan took a handful and a slice of cake and immediately began porking out just like before.Lisa finished next, asking the same as her sister, while Emma and Becca were at the same pace. Pretty soon nothing was left but crumbs and four overfed girls rubbing their bellies and trying not to explode. \"So ladies, what did you want to do tonight?\" Becca asked her daughters, since they had planned what to do after dinner. \"How about...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girls decided to wait a half hour before they left so they could digest, and then headed to the mall to go see a movie. At the theater, Becca offered to buy the girls tickets (since they came out for some family time after all) and also decided that snacks were a good idea. Each girl got the largest size popcorn, the mega sized drink, a chocolate bar AND some candies. If they don't eat it all they will have something for later, Becca justified to herself knowing full well she can eat that much food during the show. Each girl was impressed with the size of the \"snacks\", but even Emma knew that there was no point in copping out now, after that meal earlier, she might as well have fun for the rest of the day. The movie was 2 hours, giving each girl enough time to eat all their food, and Megan even got everyone refills of the pop halfway through. On their way back they were laughing about what happened in the movie. \"Paul Rudd is such a dream\" said Megan, \"He's just so nice and pretty handsome too.\" \"He's no Channing Tatum though\" as each girl agreed on that point. Walking back through the mall, Megan could smell something that made her stomach grumble. \"Mmmm oh my god do I smell... DONUTS!?\" Megan did have a weakness for sugar after all, and even after such an enormous amount of food in the past few hours, she wanted some donuts and she wanted them bad. \"Please oh please mom can we get some?\" Megan begged almost too passionately just for some food. \"Of course dear, in fact I could go for a couple myself...\" Becca responded unaware that she was rubbing her big gut. \"Ooh yeah mom can I have some too!?\" Lisa and Emma said in unison. \"Of course, what are we waiting for?\" Becca laughed, walking over to the food court. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone got home, they each just went upstairs to lay down. Those donuts were good, Emma ate 4 of them, and they weren't even small! Although she ate the least compared to her gluttonous family. Lisa ate 6 and nearly passed out in the food court with belly exposed, while Becca had bought an entire dozen, eating her 10th on her way in the door of the house. Megan of course at the most. She stuffed down a dozen right in the food court, and bought another for later (Becca doesn't mind spending money on her lovely children, especially when they're enthusiastic about it). Megan walked in the door with the first donut of her second box in her mouth with icing sugar and chocolate all over her face. Once the daughters went to bed Becca sat in the living room with a bottle of pop. She was so thirsty she just started chugging it down, until there wasn't anything left. She burped like crazy while craddling her exposed gut. She looked down at it and sighed. What is the matter with me, she thought to herself, why am I eating so much? Food is just so good I can't help myself. How much do I even weight right now? She went upstairs to the bathroom to check the scale and was worried to see the result of her constant housewife binges. The numbers went up until it stopped at 185 lbs. \"Oh my goodness, I've never weighed this much before...\" she said to herself in shock. \"I can't believe I've let myself get so fat, I have got to diet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't exactly the easiest thing to do though. Dieting is actually quite challenging, especially for Becca, who found herself bored throughout the day and would snack to fill that void. However, she really was trying. She used to workout equipment downstairs for a bit, attempting to lose the weight, as well as jogging around the block and on the treadmill. While she was doing it, she wasn't enjoying herself. She decided to examine herself in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs were fairly thick, and her arms had some pudge on them. Her belly wasn't protruding over her pants too badly, but it will if she didn't maintain her weight. Her face was rounder, and all together she just looked lazy. She didn't look the same as when she was 19. She had abs, an amazing ass and decent breasts. However, her ass had gone a little flabby with stretch marks on it. Her breasts were the one thing she enjoyed about her gain, noticing how much Adam had been touching them lately. She really enjoyed eating, especially when she was with her daughters, but she didn't want Adam to divorce her because of her weight, so she had to do this, even if deep down she didn't want to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca actually didn't mind her weight though in total, but she afraid of the consequences with Adam. Her friends couldn't comment on her weight since the closest one to her size was 250 lbs, which was quite a difference from her current weight. She also noticed that on their day of pigging out, that Lisa was talking to them more than ever. She missed seeing her baby, and it was nice that they had such a nice night. If Emma, Megan and Lisa stopped worrying about their figures, they'd sure bond a lot more. Becca wasn't sure what to do, should she sacrifice the hit on her figure for just a little bit so she can spend time with the girls, or does she try to slim down so that Adam doesn't divorce her?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Admitably, Becca's plan wasn't the most well thought out plan. Most mothers who want their daughters to become close with them again normally suggest things like sports or hikes, not something like food. But Becca didn't really mind the weight, she thought it felt liberating to stop worrying about her figure for a change. It was true she had put on weight slowly for a while now, she had still done her best to stay in shape, but this was different. Becca decided that for a full week she was going to pamper her daughters with her cooking and after the week was done, the family would be closer than ever, and would start eating normal again. This plan however, was extremely flawed. She decided to start on the Saturday, so the kids would have nothing to do but hangout around the house, so Becca went to grocery store. She bought more food than usual (which was a pretty large amount in the first place) and tried to get the girls favorites, and maybe a few things for herself - it was a cheat week after all. As Saturday came closer and closer, the girls had no idea what was coming in the week (and then some) ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was laying in her bed Saturday morning when she woke up to a familiar smell. <i>BACON</i>, she thought to herself, <i>why do I smell bacon? Is it a holiday?</i> Megan decided to go check it out and rose from her bed with a little more gusto in her step than usual. As she absentmindedly rubbed her small belly she began to walk downstairs to the kitchen to find out the reason of that delicious smell. Sure enough she see's her mother cooking bacon on the stove, and a lot of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when do you make bacon anymore?\" Megan asked making sure she didn't sound ungrateful. \"I thought you girls could use a break from the regular breakfast we eat\" Becca said innocently, \"sometimes it's nice to change it up a little! Now go see if your sisters are up.\" With that, Megan went upstairs to wake up Lisa, knowing that Emma would probably be at the gym already. Once Lisa and Megan came back downstairs, they saw that breakfast was more than just bacon. A lot more, in fact. Becca had prepared a feast for the family, and it was being served! It seemed like mountains of pancakes, french toast, hash browns and bacon spread all over the kitchen table. There was plenty of maple syrup to go along with it all, and other delicious breakfast foods to go along with it. Megan began licking her lips while Lisa's belly rumbled. \"You girls seem hungry, hopefully this is enough!\" Becca exclaimed, \"Where is Emma though?\" Just then, the door opened to reveal Emma walking in with her gym clothes on. \"Oh wow hey mom do I smell bacon? And eggs!? And... is that french toast!?\" Emma asked astounded at the amount of food that was on the table. \"Yes it is, won't you come join us?\" Becca asked her daughter. \"I really shouldn't... but I did just work out, and I did that run yesterday.... oh hell I earned it, pass me a plate mom!\" Emma responded putting her gym bag down and sitting at the table with the rest of the family. Emma was the first one to dig in, and did she ever. She finished her first plate so quick you could swear she was starving, but none of the family was paying any attention to Emmas indulgent attitude, they were all too focused on their own food to care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the table began to become less and less full of food, each girls stomachs started showing. As each girls pants started getting tighter they began getting more and more full until each one was leaning back in their chairs trying their best not to explode. Emma had truly pigged out on that meal, undoing every second of her early morning workout, she even out ate her sister! True, it was Lisa, who bailed on the food after her third plate full, but Emma didn't usually eat that much. Becca knew the girl loved her breakfast foods. Megan and Becca ate the most, both going to five platefuls. Megan was an indulgent girl who wouldn't shy away from a good meal, but even this was a lot for her. Her Pj's were tight on her belly and her t-shirt was riding up just a little. Megan had syrup on her face and was still picking away at the last few pieces of bacon (against her stomachs wishes). Becca couldn't remember the last time she ate so much, she was absolutely stuffed. Her gut was showing as her t-shirt had ridden up exposing her belly button. <i>It feels so nice to eat what I want for a change,</i> Becca thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls go sit down on the couch and watch some TV, I'll clean all of this up\", Becca said, struggling to move her overfilled body out of her chair. The girls did as she said without protest and relocated to the living room to watch some TV. For the rest of the morning Becca gave her daughters anything they wanted. Megan noticed her mother unusual behavior and decided to take advantage of it, asking for a bottle of pop and some post-breakfast ice-cream. Lisa did the same followed quickly by Emma, who had decided that she could eat it because of her workout earlier in the morning. It went like this all day. If the girls were hungry, Becca would fetch them a snack of their choosing with any drink they'd like. For lunch, Becca made her famous 6 Cheese Mac + Cheese with a ham, which was eaten with a large amount of intensity. The meal was smaller than breakfast, but it was still a full sized lunch that left the girls feeling bloated. Becca asked if the girls would watch a movie together with her and so they lounged on the couch for longer. Not too much time passed before Megan started feeling peckish, and grabbed herself some chips and pop. Becca did the same and grabbed Lisa and Emma some too. Before Megan knew it the movie was over and her bag of chips was empty. Belching a little, Megan asked what was for dinner. \"I thought we'd go out for dinner, I thought that would be nice.\" Becca suggested as the girls obliged. Megan suggested an all you can eat buffet, but Becca felt set on getting some burgers, so they decided they could do a buffet another night and drove the local fast food joint; Lardo Burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca told the girls to grab a booth while she grabbed the food. \"Hi welcome to Lardo Burgo\", the cashier said sounding bored. \"Hi, I'll get 8 Jr. Lardo Burgers, 5 double Lardo burgers, large fries with each one, and can I get 4 large milkshakes for the drinks, please?\" The cashier obliged and placed the order saying it was going to be just one minute. Becca could hardly wait to eat this food. Today was a great day for Becca, she had never felt so free. Normally, she'd workout and eat healthy, but she felt liberated just eating whatever she wanted and whenever she wanted. Becca didn't even mind the weight she was putting on, it was only Adam she was staying in shape for at this point. Of course Becca didn't want to make Adam unhappy so she was planning on going back on her diet in a week, but that was so far away, right now she wanted to just relax and enjoy herself with her children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Order up!\" The cashier said, as Becca licked her lips and rubbed her hungry belly. <i>Let's get you fed</i>, Becca thought to herself while grabbing her food. As she brought it over she could see the anticipation in her daughters faces. As she put the trays down the girls began grabbing their burgers and fries and eating without abandon. It seemed like getting the girls to spend time together was going to be easy if all she had to do was just eat a little more often.  </span></div></div>",

Adam had gone on a work trip on Monday, leaving the girls and their appetites home alone for the week. Becca decided that if she really wanted to bond with her girls, she was going to have to really spoil them. She gave them Monday off saying \"Who doesn't love a 3 day weekend, right?\" and then used the excuse and gave them the week off school, and boy did they bond. The clock currently said 9:00am which was sleeping in for Becca any other week, but the girls had grown lazy and all started to sleep in longer. She was still the first one up and would begin making breakfast for the family. As Becca sat up she felt her PJ's getting tighter around her fuller tummy, and noticed they were tighter than she remembered them. She grabbed her flabby tummy and let out a sigh, Oh boy you've grown, she thought to herself while examining herself. Her legs were thicker and so were her arms, she could feel the chub layer growing by the day. Her boobs had gone up a size, maybe even two with all her eating, and she could feel her face was softer. Her butt had also grown, and she was looking more and more like her overfed friends. She didn't want to step on the scale since she wanted to enjoy her last day of over indulging and left it for tomorrow. As Becca walked down the stairs rubbing her belly, she knew she was really going to let loose one more time. In her heart Becca loved this all a little too much. She denied it as much as she could, but knew deep down she wanted to eat like this all the time. She might've even given in if not for her loving husband Adam, she didn't want to make him disappointed in her. She wanted to be the trophy wife for as long as possible, but she knew right now she was very far from that. She needed to get in shape... but after today of course. Once hitting the kitchen Becca came across a mess in the kitchen. 3 empty Ice cream containers, an empty box of chicken fingers, candy wrappers and of course a few empty chip bags (although one of those were from Beccas late \"snack\"). She then discovered even more once going further into the kitchen. Laying there passed out with an empty pizza box was her fully gorged daughter...</span></div></div>",

Every time she was offered food, she would take it. Megan had always been okay with her weight and eating whatever, but she never really pigged out often. After the couple days of doing it with her family, Megan realized how good food was. She ate as much food as she was given, and took more if possible. Megan started snacking at night, and last night had gone haywire. Each member of the family had eaten a midnight snack, but Megan was last and ate the most. For some reason she just could not be satisfied. A tub of ice cream, a bag of chips, a candy bar and the rest of the leftover pizza. Megan really enjoyed this lifestyle, and didn't want it to stop. Becca could tell how much Megan was having a good time, but seeing her overfed daughter was something else. Megan had definitely put on 5 to 10 pounds in a week, and it was resting in her belly. Her pants unzipped and her shirt up a little with food smeared all over her mouth. Becca even noticed that she had drank a beer of hers with some pop on the side. She liked seeing Megan so happy, and she didn't want to ruin that for her, or any of her daughters for that matter. Lisa had been eating a lot of food during the week as well, and actually talking to the family more, although she did like going into her room playing video games all night on her computer, accompanied by snacks of course. Lisa had of course put on only a couple pounds, mostly going into her butt. Becca didn't know if Lisa was aware or not but didn't feel like ruining her daughters good time, plus she thought her daughter could stand to gain a few pounds anyways. One of the biggest shocks was Emma though. She liked to eat. A lot. Luckily for Emma, she does have willpower and was capable of working out almost every day this week helping maintain her slender figure. She had put on weight however, almost 5 pounds. Emma had noticed the pudge, and why it had grown, but she knew she could lose it, she just had to fight off her mom and eat better. Looking back at her daughter, Becca started cleaning up the kitchen and making a big breakfast. As she started cooking she started hearing the front door open, Becca went o look and saw it was...</span></div></div>",

He began filling her in on the meeting and rushed back to the cab to grab the last thing. \"And there we go, that'll do it!\" Adam said cheerfully walking back in the front door with a box and a bag. \"What\"s that, honey?\"  Becca inquired. \"Oh just a few complimentary snacks and such, you know how they love to schmooze\" Adam said happily placing the box on the counter and opening it. He pulled out a great big triple layer chocolate cake and placed it on the table, as well as 3 boxes of chocolate chunk cookies. \"Wow that looks good, eh honey?\" Adam called to his wife, who was still cooking breakfast. \"Wow where on earth did you get that, that looks delicious!\" Becca said admiring how tasty the goody looked, even imagining having a slice or two later on. \"Some online bakery company, E-bake or something? They have tons of stuff, we're doing business with them so we even get a discount\" Adam explained, while opening the bags and emptying its contents. In the bag were all sorts of snacks; protein bars, chocolate bars, gummy candies and way more different types of goodies, each calling Beccas name. If Adam wasn't here oh the things I would do to that food..., Becca thought while her stomach grumbled. \"Oh wow looks like someone is hungry, eh babe?\" Adam smirked at his curvy wife, \"Hopefully breakfast is almost done?\" In truth, Adam knew that his wife had been putting on weight, especially this week. She was always thin and sexy, but she had a soft spot for sweets. Adam had always wanted his wife to bigger, especially when they had first met. He thought that she would gain weight easily based on her weakness to goodies, but alas she didn't. He loved her a lot when she was skinny though, he thought she was his soulmate and only wanted what was best for her health and didn't tell her about his interests. However, she had been putting on weight slowly, and she was eating more. He could swear she liked eating so much too. He never wanted to fatten her up because he knew that was dishonest and wrong, but the way she's been eating recently, he could just leave some food out and maybe she might eat it, that surely wasn't his fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney we need to talk about something...</span></div></div>",

I wanted to teach, and I know that I can Adam. I think it'll help Lisa stay out of the wrong crowds and the twins are just in a victory lap year anyways, they might as well contribute to this family more\" Becca said confidently, knowing Adam would let her if she debated him on it enough. After a half hour of discussing it, Adam decided it was okay. He had faith in his wifes ability to teach, and she did seem to want it bad. Megan finally woke up from her food coma smelling the delicious meal and was now stumbling over to the table ready to devour more food. Lisa and Emma came down and began eating fairly quickly, as well as talking to their father about the trip. After the full meal each girl reclined and began relaxing. Becca knew today was going to be food filled especially after her 3 servings of pancakes and bacon, with eggs. Becca and Megan ate more than they could handle (like usual) and needed to go lay down, while Emma and Lisa were full, but could manage themselves. Lisa went back to her bedroom, first grabbing a huge bottle of coke and a bag of chips fully aware of the trip she was saving in a couple hours. Emma decided to go out to the gym in a bit, deciding some TV would be fine while digested her breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...</span></div></div>",

She realized that she had to make the family lunch, so she heaved her chubby frame up and walked (although it was half a waddle now) towards the kitchen. As she made it there she saw that Adam had cooked some burgers and hot dogs for the family. \"Oh wow you are every womans dream\" Becca said to her husband lovingly while giving him a kiss. \"I figured for dinner we could go out, maybe that new buffet or something?\" Adam asked while putting food on his wifes plate. \"Oh yes that sounds terrific, I haven't gone out to eat in forever.\" Becca said, even though she went to a buffet on Wednesday and a bakery on Thursday. All the girls came down the stairs one by one and ate more than enough food to feed twice as many people, but no one seemed to mind. After some lounging around the girls then all proceeded to go into the van and drive to the all you can eat restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      On the front it had a great big sign that read \"GutBusters: Home of the all you can eat anything\" in big glowing letters. \"Looks good\" Becca said excitedly. As they entered they were in awe. \"This place has everything!\" Megan said rubbing her ever growing gut, \"I can't wait to eat.\" \"You don't have to!\" Said the waitress, \"I've got a table for 5 right over here, just follow me please.\" The waitress then lead them through the building, showing them all of the vast foods they have. They covered american food quite well, with burgers and steaks and delicious meats, while there was plenty of Italian foods and basically every other kind of food. The girls were excited to have so many choices, and all you can eat meant they could try all kinds of mouth watering dishes without breaking the bank, which Adam did enjoy. The waitress showed them their table, \"Here you are, right by the pasta station, that's my favorite station,\" she joked to the family. She was a blonde beauty, not too tall and had bigger than average breasts with a nice ass to create a tremendous figure. She was young and probably new, no older than 25 and was very beautiful. Once they were sat she told them how everything worked, and soon she was leaving them to feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach girl began seriously stuffing themselves silly, even Emma. Adam just had his one plate, while Emma had 3 plates consisting of pizza, chicken legs, burgers and fries, as well as a steak and some rice soaked in soy sauce. Lisa had 3 plates as well, but she dug in on the Italian dishes, like lasagna and ravioli, feeling very bloated and full afterwards. Becca ate 4 plates, the food was from all over the place. Adam brought her all the food she wanted so she didn't even have to move a muscle. Adam watched as his plump and overfed housewife stuffed in her last slice of pizza with difficulty with one hand while the other rubbed her protruding belly that was showing. Megan had the most food however, a whopping 5 and a half plates. She almost passed out in her plate filled with ice cream when they decided she had probably had enough for the time being. As the waitress thanked them for their service, Adam couldn't help but notice her thin frame had a little bulge happening. <i>I think this is the place to go from now on...</i> Adam thought to himself, just thinking about the effects the place would have on his wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were home each girl slowly worked their way up the stairs to go to bed. Becca was excited to begin homeschooling them soon, but figured sh'ed surprise them (maybe with one or two more days off first) so it was more fun. Becca sat down at the kitchen table while Adam followed her and sat down beside her. \"Adam?\" Becca asked her husband, \"Yes my dear?\" He responded happily. \"Do you think there is a chance I could have a slice of that cake you brought home? Just a small one for dessert?\" Adam happily complied with his wife and grabbed the cake, cutting a decent size piece for her to fork down. Once he gave it to her she took a forkful and had a bite. The cake was absolutely amazing. It was the perfect level of moist, and so rich with all the chocolate (it even had chocolate chunks inside of it!) and she even got a large glass of milk to wash it down with. She eventually went for a second piece, and even though she was getting more and more full she just couldn't seem to stop...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Brraauuapp*... ohhhh goodness gracious I'm so-HIC- ugh.. full... Adam would y-HIC... would you please help me up *burrrp*\" Becca said to her loving husband, who was extremely turned on by the amount of food his hog of a wife just consumed. Adam helped her up and to the bedroom leaving the rest of the cake that Becca hadn't finished, which meant only half was left. Becca knew if she kept eating with such negligence that she'd be huge in no time, she knew she had to stop tomorrow and start working out, how on earth she was going to pull it off she had no clue, but it really needed to be done. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The past month was very different than anything the family had ever gone through. Becca knew that she needed to lose weight again and tried building her will power back. While she was unsuccessful in losing weight, she definitely began controlling herself more. The trick to Beccas plan was to give any food she wanted to one of her daughters, that way she could keep the girls bonding while not putting on weight. The plan didn't really work that well, considering Becca hit 200 lbs and needed to get a new wardrobe, but she was slowing down the speed of her gain, and was becoming more active. She was working out everyday now to try and slim down for Adam, who was now trying to give his plump wife more food. He enjoyed the size of her breasts and how big her butt and belly were getting, especially when she sat down. But of course Becca cheated on her diet with some occasional sweets and snacks, maybe even a Lardo Burger or three every now and then. Becca had of course also begun homeschooling her daughters which was probably a generous way of phrasing that. She was basically pampering her daughters with her cooking, which was impacting the household in a few ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, the girls appetites have grown, and so have they. Emma was going to the gym less and less over the month, and while she thought she ould hate being home schooled, she actually enjoyed lounging around for a change and not worrying about her weight constantly. Emma had put on a few pounds and was starting to look fuller in her belly and butt. She had grown close to out growing her clothes but she wasn't really noticing since the food was so good. Emma didn't mind her sedentary lifestyle all that much. Lisa had grown the laziest, she never left the house. She was either gaming, watching TV, or eating with her family. Becca enjoyed that Lisa was being social with the family and saw what her cooking was doing to the cute girl. She was becoming chubby for sure now. A nice little layer of fat had accumulated on her all around, giving her a curvier look. What would you expect from all the junk food she snacked on all day, which was becoming more and more over time. Megan was the sight though. She wasn't at all upset about being homeschooled, and was really enjoying herself and her lifestyle. Becca usually would give the food she didn't want to Megan since she would eat it without hesitation, something Becca was really enjoying about her daughter. Megan had basicaly outgrown her clothes at this point (though they were tight before) and pretty much always had her pants undone and her t-shirt up over her little jiggly belly. She really loved the feeling of pigging out and didn't want to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly, the girls social lives had changed drastically, or at least Emmas had. She went from always talking to people and hanging out to just sitting at home and hanging out with her family. She started not minding the feeling of not being talked to 24/7, though she missed the attention from boys. Megan didn't care at all, her friends weren't always so nice about her weight and \"held her back\" from having fun with food. As for Lisa, she didn't care either, her online friends were actually becoming closer now so she didn't mind at all. Becca was giving the girls some school work of course, but it wasn't nearly as much as they used to get, and she really didn't want them to get stressed out so she just gave them a little bit and considered making them do the rest of the work over the summer. <i>The girls don't need to go to college yet,</i> she thought to herself as she was making her famous tortellini with meat balls and cheese. Beccas social life had also changed in the last month. As much as she had wanted to spend time with her friends she had to keep making food and \"teaching\" her children, so she didn't see them as much as she might've wanted to. The stress near the end of the month was giving Becca the ability to lose some weight as well, and all the walking around was a good thing on her hefty figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, and maybe most importantly, Adam's business has blown up. While the family was by no means poor before, they weren't rich, but during this month investors and sales went through the roof making Adams business very valuable. With more money then he ever knew what to do with, he decided to spend it on his family. He gave Becca a special credit card that gave them discounts with whoever they did business with (which was becoming more and more food places and services) and it also didn't ave a limit on it. They bought a summer home, new cars for each daughter and Becca, they renovated the kitchen so now it was state of the art for cooking. Becca realized that she could now spend more money on her daughters and really spoil them. For Lisa she bought her a state of the art computer along with a super comfy chair, and decked her room out with a mini fridge, a soda fountain, and bought her a lot more snacks. Emma got a new laptop, a mini fridge in room filled with food, and had recently started watching TV shows and Movies more often, finding them the most entertaining use of her time. Megan got a mini fridge as well, and a very comfy bed just for her. She was the most pampered, getting anything she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family was doing well, but there was one thing that Adam thought would really help make the household complete. He decided to get a maid to help out around the house. Her name was Lexi. She was a 35 year old girl who was short and plump, around 210 pounds. She loved to clean, and was always willing to help in any way. Adam was hoping that she would end up making his wife get lazy, and with some hope, get fat. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Becca had never been so happy with life. Since the first day of meeting Lexi, Becca realized that she was going to really get to relax. She was still dedicated in losing her weight though, but at least Lexis cooking was so great she didn't need to slave away in the kitchen all the time, or take care of her daughters every need. As time went on, the girls just started giving in. Emma liked all the money and was working out now. Her social life was coming back, and she was quickly becoming her old self, just thicker. Yes, although Emma might've been working out again, she still wasn't eating healthy. By now it was summer, and the girls would've graduated but didn't get the proper credits so they have to wait until the next year for college. No one minded, Emma wanted to live the rich kid lifestyle, she had big parties on the beach with lots of drinking and drugs. She liked the attention of the boys and girls and liked how admired she was. Emma would eat fast food often, drink often, smoke weed and get the munchies often, and just lived a life of social indulgence. She was not her once thin self either, she was officially chubby. She had worked her way to 145 pounds which had given her generous boobs, a very large butt, and a moderately chubby gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe summer for Lisa was different. She stayed inside on her amazing computer and played video games. She had gotten into a bit of a routine which consisted of binge eating chips, chocolate, baked goods, and just anything that was junk food. All she drank was soda from her fountain, and she was basically always snacking. Her weight was getting up there, which one look at her and you would notice that she hardly moves. Becca and Emma workout, so at least they're active, but Lisa is far from active resulting in a higher weight gain than most. She actually weighed more than Emma at 150 pounds and she didn't seem to care. She is spilling out of her too small clothes but doesn't care since sh'e not trying to impress anyone. She's starting to drink energy drinks as well, and on occasion will partake in drinking some booze or getting high with Em, but not too often. Most of Lisas weight was in her midriff and was working into a solid muffin top. Her legs were thicker too, and all tone she once had was gone. She definitely was working her way to fat very quickly but she was apathetic towards her gain and just kept living her lifestyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was a lot like Lisa now, but she does still go out, it's just for food. Megan hardly denies her relationship with food anymore; she's obsessed. She ate 3 BIG meals a day, but snacked almost religiously. She would want new food all the time. All she did was watch TV shows or movies, maybe go to fast food joint down the street (driving there of course). Megan was in hog heaven. One day she literally just drove from burger joint to burger joint trying to eat a burger from every place which, she did, and then got ice cream. Megan was a monster with food. No thanks to Becca who was always giving her extra meals so she'll lose weight, Megan really blimped up. She was tipping the scales at 170 pounds and showed no signs of slowing down. Megan still hungout with her friends, but most left her for her sister, or they only stayed for the money. Megan did know that her best friend Olivia didn't care about the money and would always hangout, although the free food was a bonus for Olivia. Megan put in requests for snacks all the time and never wanted to move. She was living the perfect life full of food and laziness. She was so happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Beautiful little girls with blue eyes, all three were somewhat chubby thanks to their mother's baking. She was rather fond of her own fat and her daughters all had big appetites, so she decided to spread her fatness to her little girls. As Becca's daughters ate up the cookies she baked for them, their mother took notice of their bodies. She saw their tummies had begun creeping out from under their school shirts, but this wasn't quite enough for Becca. She'd been feeding them sweets every day, but they were still too small. They should be big enough to start waddling everywhere they went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay, Mommy?\" Amy asked Becca. She was the youngest and the most curious of the girls. She was also the only blonde in the family, with hair styled into little buns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, everything's fine, Amy. Eat your cookie, now.\" Amy did as she was told, licking her fingers clean of chocolate when she finished. Middle triplet Marnie walked over next, fixing her red ponytail. Becca could see her shirt ride up and see her belly was hanging ever so slightly over her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's for dinner?\" Marnie was always straightforward and blunt with her statements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to talk to your father first, dear.\" Sally, the oldest, then bounced over. She usually had the most energy and her red pigtails would always fly behind her as she ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but don't take too long, 'cause we're huuuuungry!\" Sally emphasized this by patting her belly multiple times, her sisters flowing suit. Becca gave a short laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I think your father has something planned already. In the meantime, have another cookie. It'll keep your tummies happy.\" The girls complied and ran up to their room. Other mothers would be worried this would spoil their kids' appetites. Becca was worried it wouldn't be enough to hold them until dinner, with which her husband Anthony would hopefully help her. Until then, it was Becca's turn to indulge in one of her own cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Anthony returned home, he saw his daughters waiting for him at the front door, tackling him in a hug. He was aware that the girls were getting heavier under his wife's care, but his only concern was that they'd knock him down too hard one day. He kissed them each on the head and then his wife on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did the family decide on for dinner?</span></div></div>",

A small stateside community that could easily exist anywhere, the urban streets of Sycamore Hills are just like any other. Children play around cars that drive between them, throwing baseballs and fiddling with their latest electronic gadgets. Young couples patrol the sidewalks daily, not giving two licks about whom or what resides outside their sweetheart\u2019s embrace. Mothers push strollers while fathers talk on cell phones discussing business or the football game. Or sometimes in reverse order, Sycamore Hills is pretty progressive about that kind of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuildings aren\u2019t all that tall, but far from humble. A few big businesses have popped up here and there in Sycamore Hills, bringing new faces almost every day in the grand name of Big Business. The commonplaces don\u2019t stand to gain much attention, a McDonald\u2019s here or a WalMart there, those things some people can\u2019t live without. The largest building in the Hills (as the Sycamorians do call it) is about seven stories tall, the new church in the middle of the valley. Other than that though, Sycamore Hills doesn\u2019t see much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, with all these big businesses and new faces popping up, we\u2019ve lost a couple people too. Old Mr. and Ms. Ware were taken just a little bit over a year ago. A real shame, he was one of the best mechanics in town and she cooked the meanest cherry pie you could ever hope to taste. But, as all do eventually, they passed and moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterestingly enough, they left their house to their granddaughter Jane, knowing that she would take good care of the place after they\u2019d gone. Jane was a young college student at the time, and felt that a change of scenery was just what she needed. So, a year ago to the day, she packed up her things and moved into their two stories, two-bedroom home that had stood since 1953. She enrolled online to make better use of her time, now that she wouldn\u2019t be living on campus anymore and started out to get a job but\u2026 well, time makes fools of us all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Jane, she\u2019s got a good set of parents who\u2019ve got a good offset of cash to help keep their daughter\u2019s lights on. And again, luckily for Jane, they\u2019re in the dark about her falling behind on her classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that\u2019s old news. No, the real story is what\u2019s going on with Jane now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane let out a heavy huff of exertion, her weekly jog around the block leaving her rather winded after having missed the last twenty sessions or so. It was winter time in Sycamore Hills and it grew rather cold, which Jane found very desirable for a workout; she didn\u2019t sweat so much and could attempt to \u201chide\u201d her less than ideal shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in a blue zip-up hoodie, her ginger hair fell awkwardly as sweat matted her bangs down to her forehead. Gray yoga pants were ripped up the side, she had tripped, and her sneakers were covered in mud. Her glasses were foggy from her heated face and she couldn\u2019t breathe all too well after a morning of \u201cwitnessing the fitnessing\u201d. Considering how disastrous this little excursion was in the summer time, her Winter Fitness regime\u2019s <b>first lap</b> hadn\u2019t gone so badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she trod through the front door, defeated by her bout with exercise, Jane could only wheeze out a groan of mild discomfort- her entire body felt like it was on fire. From her busty upper half to her chafing hamhock thighs, poor Jane was burning up in the middle of October. She peeled off her hoodie, revealing her gray <i>Help!</i> shirt underneath, and plod uselessly into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fumbled around for a bit, finding everything needed for a cup of coffee. Jane\u2019s life was a stressful one, you see. Being a freelance writer without any endorsement was hard, what stories she had sold weren\u2019t bringing home much to impress her folks. Her name was out there sure, but as what she could only guess the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why she had decided to bring in a roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents had been harping on her about her high cost of living. A new computer, new kitchen appliances, and not one mention of textbooks- they were starting to get suspicious. So, rather than own up to dropping out of college, she decided to wow them with getting a roomie to help pay the bills, and dazzle them when one of her books finally hit the shelves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what\u2019s more, rather than splurge for an ad in the paper like some chump, Jane had just the woman in mind. She was a sister of Alpha Zeta Phi from her old college campus, they had actually met when they both pledge sophomore year. At the time, Jane and Patricia (or \u201cPatti\u201d as she preferred) Ramirez were really good friends, and when Jane moved out she was genuinely sad to see her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut time came that Patti decided to drop the college route as well, it wasn\u2019t for her apparently. Needing a place to live and focus on her own career track (one that hopefully didn\u2019t include a degree) Patti and Jane decided that she should move in with the lazy redhead and find a job, keeping quiet about Jane\u2019s dropping out of her online courses in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, October the ninth, was her estimated time of arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, not long after Jane returned home, the sound of tires rolling gently onto the gravel driveway alerted the young author to her new roomie\u2019s presence. Jane could barely contain her excitement as she opened the front door to reveal\u2026</span></div></div>",

She could afford to be picky; after all, she was only 21 and was already one of the world's most notorious assassins.

After all, what if they were her next target?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, though, she didn't really look like the master assassin who terrified those in the halls of power. Her cutesy face, big blue eyes, and long golden blonde hair looked more at home on a fashion model or a cheerleader than they did on a professional killer. There was also the fact that she was rather fat. Her wide hips and round butt had needed to be smooshed in between the easy chair's armrests, and her laptop (custom-made with several modifications considered illegal in most of the civilized world) was currently resting on top of the dome of her belly. With a frustrated grunt, Dani shifted in her chair slightly; her breasts were blocking her from seeing all of her computer screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she resettled in her chair, now able to see her laptop clearly, Dani took a moment to consider her chunky body, and why she was so fat in the first place.</span></div></div>",

You probably need to lie down - we\u2019ll get you more to eat in a little bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlass and Marker guided Dani to an adjacent suite and laid her on the bed.

And there was something wrong with this scenario. While she truly hadn\u2019t been able to stop herself from stuffing herself nearly to the point of bursting last night, she was not ignorant of the conversation and tension between Marker and Glass. She surmised that this wasn\u2019t the first time they\u2019d seen someone like Dani. What had happened to the others?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was considering this, the door opened, and in walked Marker and Glass followed by uniformly clad staff members  wheeling carts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d Dr. Glass said cheerily. \u201cFeeling better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite alright.\u201d Dani replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Glass said. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought you some essentials - stretchy sweats, grooming supplies, and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said it, the staff lifted covers off of the carts, revealing a variety of breakfast foods, enough to feed several people, although Dani guessed that they were intended for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBreakfast!\u201d Glass continued. \u201cThe most important meal of the day for a growing girl like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut first,\u201d Marker said. \u201cI need to take some measurements and draw some blood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDani and Marker walked into the adjacent bathroom, where Dain shed her dress and Marker took bust, waist, hip, thigh, and arm circumferences. Dani redressed in the loose sweats before Marker took out a needle and vials for blood collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you testing, exactly?\u201d Dani asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMetabolic markers.\u201d Marker explained. \u201cThe trends will give us information about how you\u2019re tolerating your weight gain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEver done anything like this before?\u201d Dani probed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarker paused and then shook her head. \u201cNo, my work is usually focused on the opposite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDani detected a lie with the pause. \u201cThis must be exciting, then, to do something so novel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose.\u201d Marker replied. \u201cHonestly, I worry about the safety of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow so?\u201d Dani asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDani, you\u2019re bright enough to understand that what you did yesterday wasn\u2019t normal.\u201d Marker said. \u201cThese manipulations that Dr. Glass has performed on the food you ate led you to eat three huge dinners in the span of a few moments. You wanted to keep eating, even though you were about to vomit from having your stomach stretched past any reasonable limit. Hopefully it just leads to weight gain, but previous...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrevious?\u201d Dani asked. \u201cI thought this was new.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I was going to say is that previous experience has shown me that manipulating one part of biology almost always affects others.\u201d Marker recovered. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to keep an eye on that. Come on, your breakfast will get cold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaggy sweats!\u201d Glass beamed. \u201cYou\u2019re dressing like a fat girl, now it\u2019s time to eat like one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with the previous evening, Dani plowed through the mountain of food set before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat job!\u201d Glass said. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave you with some snacks while you let breakfast settle, just in case you\u2019re still hungry. See you at lunch time - any requests?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Dani blurted, \u201cPizza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d Glass encouraged. \u201cNow you\u2019re dressing like a fat girl AND talking like one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDani smirked, but primarily thought of how she was going to start eating the snacks as the crew left her room. They were a selection of danishes and pastries. As she ate them, Dani noticed that she became very full, very fast. For the first time in her two binges, she stopped without finishing. She then found herself exhausted. She laid down on her side and ran her hand along what Marker had measured recently to be a 24 inch waist. She wondered how many inches had been added through this morning\u2019s stuffing. So many questions, but for now she just wanted to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Dani\u2019s well-developed investigative skills usually led her to question her situation and surroundings constantly, as the days and weeks passed, her questioning was now happening far less frequently. An alarm bell would go off in her head after something was said or when she noticed a flinch by Marker, but the bell was silenced after she gorged herself with an ever increasing amount of food. And so, she ate, slept, had weekly weights, measurements, and blood tests as her body grew softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out that Dani was eventually given the answers to the questions she began with anyway. Glass explained that her food additives were a combination of an appetite enhancer and a chemical that blocked feelings of fullness. The snacks provided at the end of meals didn\u2019t contain these things, and eating them neutralized these effects. Marker confided that there had been a test subject prior to Dani on whom the snacks hadn\u2019t been used; eating nothing but enhanced food got her fat very quickly, but left her completely food obsessed to the point of being otherwise non-functional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that these explanations were provided, Dani had long since accepted her fate, and it hadn\u2019t been too bad. Enhanced or not, the food was good. Dani discovered or rediscovered things that she had denied herself for years - calorie-laden dishes of all kinds from carbohydrate-loaded breakfasts, to piles of candies to snack on throughout the day, to indulgent desserts so delicious that she would awaken at night to consume a second portion. At first, Glass annoyed her with her upbeat, bubbly positivity about Dani\u2019s ridiculous mission to get fat in six months, but Dani came to smile when they would celebrate milestones like every ten pounds gained or when she grew out of her sweats. Even Marker had lightened up as time passed, and meals, while still focused on Dani, had become more communal, friendly experiences in which the three of them talked and ate like old pals getting together for social time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree months after starting, Dani had hit 205 pounds, which had her on the verge of technically being obese. All in all though, her 5\u201910\u201d frame had filled out pretty evenly, and had one not known what she looked like previously, she would have seemed pretty normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the meal where you officially become fat!\u201d Glass nonetheless cheered after Marker shared her latest measurements, knowing that a couple more pounds would tip Dani\u2019s BMI into that range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may not be the only one, Dr.\u201d Dani chided as she poked the food scientist\u2019s bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely not.\u201d Lamented Marker, who touched her own midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, while Dani had been intentionally fattened like prized livestock, her monitors had been slowly growing themselves. Glass had started chunky, but nearly 20 pounds over three months had her curvy 5\u20194\u201d body straining her clothes at the seams. More striking was Marker, whose rail thin 5\u20197\u201d body had been transformed by the addition of 30 pounds. She had taken to wearing scrubs that hung loosely on her, but her bulging butt was visible evidence of the layer of softness that had overtaken her entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright girls!\u201d Dani said. \u201cI\u2019ve gained more weight than both of you put together, and we all look amazing. Let\u2019s eat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they did. Once the meal started and the conversation became lively, the Drs. seemed to have forgotten the awkwardness brought on by the acknowledgment that they, too, had been gaining weight while they were supposed to be making sure that Dani did so. What was interesting, though, was how it was happening.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was no accident that Janet Glass was in food science, nor that she was working her dream job right now. She had always had issues with her weight, and wanted nothing more than to make the people around her a little bigger. When she heard about an opportunity to fatten other women up for money, she jumped at the chance. The test subject was like a fantasy - that skinny little thing couldn\u2019t stop eating and had blown up like a balloon, all because of Janet. As enjoyable as that had been, though, Janet knew that she had to deliver this time. These people, uptight as they were, were killers and they wouldn\u2019t tolerate anything less than perfection this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was going perfectly. Dani\u2019s weight gain had accelerated recently, putting her ahead of schedule. Janet decided that she\u2019d just keep going until the six months were up, no matter how much extra weight that meant for Dani. The comfort of knowing that she was ahead, and that she wasn\u2019t even close to being the biggest girl in the room had caused Janet to let down her guard. She was snacking regularly, and her portions were increasing. No mind, though, Dani was the fat girl now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna Marker, on the other hand, had always been skinny. She longed to be curvy and especially wanted to be buxom, but nature didn\u2019t seem to have that in the cards. She had stumbled into this job, and was mildly appalled by what had happened with the test subject. Glass had pumped her so full so fast that she was constantly bloated. Anna thought, on more than one occasion, that the girl might actually explode. It was so over the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came Dani. Tall and thin like her, albeit more toned and shapely. She wouldn\u2019t let Glass harm her. And she didn\u2019t. Week by week, she developed an increasing admiration for what was happening to Dani. She saw her toned body get soft. She watched her shapely thighs get thicker, her butt and belly get rounder, and her breasts...Anna dreamt about them and used any excuse to look at the graph of their measurements. 34B, 34B, 34C, 34C, 35C, 35D, 35D, 36D, 36D, 36DD, 36DD, 36F. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she fantasized, it motivated her. If Dani could get mind-blowing tits by getting fat, maybe she could too. So far, Anna had added most of her weight to her butt, but she knew that Dani had added inches there too. When she moved up to a C cup herself, Anna felt that her approach had been validated, and she started packing as many calories into her day as she could.</span></div></div>",

Both were very pretty with long, brown hair and cute faces, they originally came from the Former Soviet Union country of Belarus. Because their parents were somewhat close to Chernobyl's blast radius, they developed cancer and died when Amy and Emma were quite young. Amy took up a job as a journalist while Amy did odd jobs to rake in enough money to keep their apartment. They learned many different languages while doing so. They kept legit until the government started to construct a nuclear power plant. Amy did everything in her power to stop its construction. The government arrested Amy and kept her in jail for a week as their one and only warning. From then on, the government spied on the sisters to make sure they stopped protesting. However, during a surprise search of Emma's purse, the authorities found Amy's report notebook which has been mistakenly been placed there. Emma tried to explain, but it too late. The officers started to shoot at her with their Russian-made pistols. Whether it was good luck or bad aim, Emma escaped without a scratch.<br>\r\nWhen Emma told Amy about the Fray, they packed their bags and got all their savings in ten minutes and ran to the airport. At the airport, Amy frantically looked for flights that led to 1st world countries where they could easily start anew. Moscow, Kiev, Athens, Istanbul, Tehran, Oslo... All these places were either too close to home or they didn't speak the language. Than Emma saw two words that triggered thought of success and glory: \"Los Angeles\" Emma said out loud. Amy nodded and she quickly bought the tickets. They quickly ran to the terminal, seeing two soldiers, carrying AK-12s, were following them. They got on the plane in the nick of time and flew away. <br>\r\nWhen they arrived many hours later, it was night, and the girls were exhausted. They called a taxi. And got in. \"Where to ma'am?\" Asked the driver. \"Anywhere but here...\" Amy struggled to say as she started to drift off into sleep. The driver thought for a minute and started to drive north. The two girls fell asleep in the backseat of the taxi, relieved that they escaped death, or worse.<br>\r\nWhere were they when they woke up?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After an hour and a half of hitchhiking and walking, the two sisters arrived at a smaller town. \"I don't think those fascists will find us here.\" Amy said. Both of their bellies growled in unison.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but if we don't eat soon, starvation will.\" Emma giggled while holding her tummy. Amy looked at Emma's midsection. While neither of the two aren't chubby or plump in any way, Emma did have a bit of fat on her little belly. While this didn't make Emma chubby in any way, Amy secretly thought that this did make her cuter. <br>\r\n\"C'mon, let's go find some food.\" Amy said.<br>\r\nAs the two walked around town, they took in the beauty of this coastal American town. Back in their native country, the only things visible in towns were puffs of smoke rising from power plants, the pasty-white sky, concrete-gray tenements, the poor in the street dying from alcohol poisoning or starvation, and guards holding Kalashnikovs making sure everything stays that way. On the contrary, this place sported a sunny sky as blue as the nearby ocean, various houses and buildings with varying themes and styles, expensive cars on the road, and people of different ages joyously talking and laughing as they walked by the two girls. Each sight in this town was a surreal one for the two foreigners. \"Hey, how ya doing?\" Said a young man passing by. Amy didn't know what to make of this and just waved awkwardly and seeing the man smile back.<br>\r\nAt last, they arrived at a place named \"Grace's Cakes\". The two hungry girls licked their chops in sight of various baked goods inside. \"Let's go.\" Emma said while tugging on Amy's sleeve. They walked in to be greeted by a well-fed woman in her late 20's.<br>\r\n\"Hello! How are you two doing?\" The girl asked. <br>\r\n\"Hungry.\" Emma replied. The girl shortly laughed.<br>\r\n\"You two look like your dressed for a nuclear winter!\" She exaggerated while pointing at their coats. <br>\r\n\"We're not from here; we're new in town.\" Amy said, displaying her thick, Slavic accent. <br>\r\n\"Ahh, I see. Where are you guys from? Poland?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Umm, sure.\" Amy hesitantly replied.  <br>\r\n\"So, anyways, what will you guys be buying?\" The girl asked. <br>\r\n\"Oh! Well...\" Amy and Emma examined a few things in the bakery, until they settled on a chocolate cake that was quite large. \"We'll take that one.\" Amy said, pointing at the cake. <br>\r\n\"Very good! That's our most popular item. That'll be thirteen ninety-nine please.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, umm...\" Amy was getting nervous. She pretty much knew for certain that she didn't have any cash on her. Despite this, she reached into her coat pocket, desperately hoping that there was any American currency inside. But alas, the only contents were two rubles, her airplane ticket, and some lint. Amy started to sob up. \"I, we, I, can't...\"<br>\r\n\"You two can't afford it?\" The girl softly asked. Amy bit her lip and painfully nodded. The girl paused. \"Tell ya what: you can have this one on the house, just this once!\" Amy and Emma grew grins across their faces. <br>\r\n\"Thank you so much!\" Amy said while taking the chocolate dessert. <br>\r\n\"Don't mention it! Happy trails!\" She said as she watched the thankful girls walk out the door. \"Poor girls. I hope they find more happiness here then where they came from.\" The girl whispered to herself. <br>\r\nAmy and Emma took their dessert over to a nearby hill overlooking the ocean. The sat down and started stuffing their faces with their bare hands. The inside of the cake was filled with a dark-chocolate mousse, making an already rich cake even richer. Despite how thick the cake was, the girls kept digging in. After half an hour, the entire cake was gone. And it was quite a large cake, mind you. Because how stuffed the two girls were, they rolled up their shirts to rub their bellies, at least until a small group of people that happened to walk by let out slight chuckles of laughter at the sight of these stuffed skinnies. After the people were out of sight, they sheepishly cleaned up and put their shirts back to normal. After cleaning up, the two gazed at the ocean for a while. \"So... What are we going to do now?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n\"Hrrrmmm...\" Amy groaned, leaned back, and closed her eyes. She was about to say: I don't know; but then... \"I have an idea!\" Amy said quite loudly. She borrowed a smartphone from a man standing nearby and looked up an address. Before the two knew it, they had a destination on their minds. They were both heading to an apartment complex.<br>\r\n\"So who is this person exactly?\" Emma questioned.<br>\r\n\"We were pen pals quite some time ago, though we did send emails to each other in our teenage years.\" Amy replied. The apartment complex was quite a nice building. Located near multiple large shopping centers and the beach, it definitely wouldn't be a bad place to called home. They took an elevator up to the correct floor and headed towards the room.<br>\r\n\"Have you ever met this girl before?\" Amy shook her head.<br>\r\n\"We've only sent probably 3 pictures to each other over all the time I've known her. But she was still a very warm person.\" They arrived at the room. *knock**knock**knock* \"Serena? Serena? Are you home?\"<br>\r\nThen, a girl opened the door with a(n) [blank] build.</span></div></div>",

He had some fried chicken in one hand, an ice cream bar in the other, and two half eaten burgers on the coffee table nearby. He was wearing a blue shirt that would have fit him a few months ago, but now it's almost skin-tight. Alec was also wearing skinny jeans which were, well, not skinny. (I'm original lol) He took a bite out of his fried chicken, hesitated, and belched.<br>\r\nScarlett peeked in on her son and saw him digging into his treats. She walked into the room. \"Hi honey. I thought you looked hungry so I made you this.\" Scarlett held out a small cheesecake. \"Thanks mom.\" Alec said and snatched the cake.

Neither of them really cared that they were fat, but often tease one another for their girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two waddle down the stairs.<br>\r\nHilda plopped herself down. She was wearing some gym shorts that were pulled over her massive belly, and a plain red shirt with sandals.<br>\r\nMargret then shows up. She was in black leggings (not much else fit her) a green sweater, and plain sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both gobbled into their food. It didn't take long for it all to be gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you two, it's saturday, you need to help out in the bakery with me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two agreed as usual and squeezed in Heather's small car. Certainly not big enough to seat two girls of such girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course some of its obvious, large meals, lots of snacking, and minimal physical exertion. But I also encourage forming a bond with her through food.  Cook with your daughter, take her to restaurants and fast food establishments, make eating fun, have mother daughter eating competitions. Mold her mindset into thinking eating is fun and exercise is boring. Constantly express admiration for fat woman while proudly flaunting your fat by wear revealing outfits with courage.  And whenever you do have to engage in some sort of physically demanding act vocally manifest how disgruntled you are and how unpleasant it is for a true woman like every time I climb the stairs I say to my daughter how awful it is. I also implore that moms mock other women who exercise in front of their daughters.\" Lara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you tried any of these techniques on your daughter.\" Celia inquired. \"Yes Celia, I have a 7 year old boy and a 10 year old girl so I have to treat them differently since fat is healthy and attractive on ladies but not on males. I cook them separate meals, a modest meal for my boy and a much larger more fattening meal for my daughter. I also discourage my daughter from physical activity when she sees my son running around and I persuade her to watch tv with me and eat ice cream.\" Lara said. \"Now I myself have three daughters so I don't have to worry about different portions, so I just whip up very fattening meals for them. I also prevent them from exercising while telling them how beautiful fat is on them. I make sure that my daughters are well fed and comfortable by constantly buying.snacks and desserts. But I feel like they need to eat more, honestly I have to restrain myself from force feeding them.\" Celia said. \"Well what I do is demolish the thin ideal for women and girls by showing how revolting these anorexic women are. I showed my girl some pictures and she practically dragged me to a burger joint, we both stuffed ourselves silly.\" Lara gleefully said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Lara how do we encourage and spread obesity in women.\" Celia said with a mouthful of brownie. \"Well my first reaction when I see an underfed woman is nausea so I express my disgust I say things like \"Eat some cake\" or \"Cover up your bones.\" I also dress revealingly sporting mini skirts and belly shirts also going to pools and beaches flaunting a sexy bikini. I also go out with friends and encourage them to eat more. Once I had a friend who was reluctant so I hand fed her until she submitted. I even successfully fattened one of my friends up to a gorgeous 330 pounds. I've also formed a group that demands that television shows star fatter actresses. We also want all fat women to be portrayed as the sexy ones. I have even influenced the cartoon shows to have at least one episode were the female characters get fat to normalize female weight gain for kids.\"  Lara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Lara another benefit of fat on females is the health aspect, so lets welcome a a guest two doctors who specialized in this research Dr. Brad Tiel and Dr Sarah Conners\" Celia said lifting her fat arm to wave in the doctors. \"Hello ladies.\" said Dr Tiel who was athletic who was followed by Dr Sarah Conners who is... </span></div></div>",

Her first two weeks of collage has taken their toll on April and made her extremely stressed. Doing administrative paperwork and getting settled into classes isn't good for a mind that's already under pressure. To make matters worse, none of her friends went to the same collage; every one either went up north to Santa Barbra and Berkley or down south to LA and San Diego.<br>\r\nDispite her troubles, April thought she should reward herself with some well-deserved shopping. A year ago, April would have thought the idea of going a week without shopping was absurd. It's been a month and half and she hasnt been near the structure until today, though, this was the least of her worries.  Because of her various stresses, she has been nibbling on whatever sweets she got her hands on. Since the amount wasn't much, it didn't do anything dramatically different, but it did break down her once-legendary cheerleader abs into an avarage, if not somewhat flabby, belly. Because of this, April shopped for slightly looser clothes.<br>\r\nApril checked her cellphone clock to check the time. 2:30 PM; it was already an hour past her lunchtime and April still hasn't eaten anything that day. She moseyed on over to the new food court that was recently built.<br>\r\nWhen she arrived, she was astonished. The court was gargantuan. Two mall parking lots could fit into this food court! The smell of dozens upon dozens of eateries filled the air and even made April' mouth water a bit. Hot dogs, fried chicken, pizza, burgers,ice cream, the sights of all these foods were making April even hungrier then she already was. The best part about this place: all the food was dirt cheap. \"Maybe I'll just spend half an hour here...\" She thought to herself. <br>\r\nThree hours later and she was still filling up with all sorts of calorie-laden food. She must have bought at least one item from every other eatery in the court! It was obvious that April partook in a massive stuffing, since her belly was incredibly bloated. After she recuperated from the battle of the food court, she stood up and brushed crumbs off of her bloated torso. *Beellchh!* April giggled. \"That was the best meal I've ever had!\" April thought. \"I think I'm going to come back here more often.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>April looked at herself in the mirror, and didn't care for what she saw. Rather, for how much more she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in her bedroom, stripped to her underwear. Even looking at those scant garments, she could tell how much tighter they looked. The panties were particularly worrisome, and she'd only bought those a couple weeks ago, and they'd been loose when she'd purchased them. Now, they were rather tight, and between her belly, love handles and hips, they were starting to disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril ran her hand over her belly. <i>\"You've certainly grown, haven't you?\"</i> she thought as she felt up her rolls, a grim smile upon her face. Even standing up, her belly was divided into two definite rolls, with a small set of side rolls under her arms, and matching elements on her back. Her love handles already seemed pretty big, and were only getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt still paled next to her lower half, which had clearly bore the brunt of her recent gain. Her hips were wide, and only getting wider, and her ass seemed (to her, at least) absolutely enormous. Her thighs had gotten thick and flabby, jiggling and rubbing constantly while she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, let's be honest. I don't walk; I waddle.\"</i> April could, admittedly with some horror, even remember the cutoff point between walking normally and adopting her slight wobble, and it was only a few months ago. Her thighs had absorbed the calories like a big, fleshy sponge. Hell, even her calves had gotten flabbier, and she now had definite cankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts had already been fairly large, and they'd gotten even bigger since she'd come to college. If there was one positive she could say about her newfound girth, it was that her enlarged belly helped support her generous endowments while she was sitting down. The girls were still decently perky, as befitting her age, but if her weight gain didn't stop, she knew eventually gravity would take over and do its dirty work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer upper body at least was slow to accumulate any fat. Her arms and hands remained fairly thin, with only a little bit of fat apparent on her upper arms. Her face and neck remained thin and pretty, with almond shaped eyes, and framed by her straight black hair. If anyone saw her from the shoulders up, they could easily mistake her for someone considerably lighter then she currently was. April found that fact almost worse then if her face and arms had rounded out like the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the scariest part of her increasing mass was just how FAST she'd porked out. When she graduated, she was one of the bombshells of her school. She stood at 5'6\", weighed about 112 pounds, and had an hourglass figure which leaned fairly heavily towards the busty. April was vice-captain of the cheer squad, and was filled with a bit of sadness when she contemplated how active and athletic she had been. If she tried any of those flips and turns now, at best she'd only embarrass herself, at worst probably hurt herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Two years! All this in only two years!\"</i> April gave her belly an agitated shake, all too aware at how the rest of her jiggled in turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril had come to Sycamore University on a cheer leading scholarship. Perhaps it wasn't as prestigious a school as Harvard or Yale, and it was on the other side of the country from her family in Florida, but it was a full ride scholarship, and her parents didn't exactly have a whole pile of money. Actually, they were in the worst sort of spot; too poor to afford school, and too rich to apply for low-income assistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was while she was attending their summer camp before her first year that April had her accident. She was performing a flip, and as she went airborne felt a terrible jolt in her leg and landed really badly. She'd torn her hamstring, and while rehab was an option, it was a process that could potentially take years. Like that, her career path was shot in the foot. The school staff was at least not entirely soulless, respecting her scholarship for her first year. April had managed to land a couple small ones to stay afloat since, but her finances, like her clothes, were still dreadfully tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight began to pile on soon after. Her diet took a downward turn at this point. She simply couldn't afford a lot of healthy food, focusing on cheap and plentiful, which walked hand-in-hand with greasy and sugary. Stress over her grades and finances (especially since her new scholarships were mostly academic) had led to a lot of stress snacking and overeating. She wasn't exercising at all, and on top of all that, her metabolism was slowing down as she entered adulthood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat she gained weight wasn't a shock, only how much she'd packed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril looked over at the scale in the corner. It wasn't hers, as she tried to avoid thinking about her weight as much as possible. She'd borrowed it from her friend and room mate, Julie. The question now was, did she dare step on it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"221.4 pounds,\" the scale toned, seemingly mocking to April's ears. Hoping against hope, April reset the scale and tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"221.7 pounds.\" It was clear the scale was screwing with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"221!? I knew it was bad, but Jesus! That's...\"</i> April did a quick bit of math in her head. <i>\"109 pounds. One hundred and nine pounds.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril got off the scale and waddled over to her desk chair, her body energetically jiggling the entire way. She sat down, too lost in thought to notice the audible creak of protest from the perfectly innocent piece of furniture. Her body (there really was no other way to put it) oozed over and under the arm rests, which pinched mightily into her sides. Her plush ass drooped over the sides and back of the chair, and her belly and thighs kept any part of it from the front hidden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I nearly doubled my weight in two years.\"</i> As if to add insult to injury, her belly let out a loud growl of hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evidence as to why was all around her. She took in the empty candy and fast food wrappers, flats of pop both empty and full, the stack of empty pizza boxes in the corner and their strongest contender for sheer quantity, the empty Chinese food containers. Perhaps most telling was the smell of the room- rather, the lack of one. Despite the large selection of empties, there was no smell of rot or old cuisine in here. April was a fairly neat girl, and always got all her garbage out on their weekly pick-up day, and invested in quite a few air fresheners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply put, all these containers were very, very recent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly let out another grumble of complaint, well used to having eaten considerably more by this time. April frowned as she stared down at her enlarged gut. <i>\"You shut yer yap! You're the reason we're in this mess!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was a stubborn thing, and not one to give up easily. \"GGGGGRRRROOOOOWWWLLL!\" April blushed, worried for a moment that her room mates might have heard that unusually loud gurgle. She looked over at the bag of pastries she'd bought earlier in the day. She routinely went for a walk after her breakfast, stopping by the nearby bakery. The couple who ran it were the Henderson's. They quite adored April, and inevitably sent her away with a massive bag of the day-olds, generally sold well below cost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Is there even a point in pretending I have willpower anymore?\"</i> She thought as she opened the large bag of eclairs. Despite her despondent mood, she started salivating at the sweet smell of delectable morsels, and sunk her teeth into one as quickly as she could get it to her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm!\" She couldn't help but vocalize her enjoyment; Mrs. Henderson really knew how to bake. The first was finished in a few greedy bites, and a second and third followed hot on its heels. All too soon, she'd finished off all eight eclairs. However, there were still the cream horns and double chocolate muffins to go through...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril's second breakfast binge was fairly short, maybe 15 minutes. In all, eight eclairs, six cream horns, and four muffins now crammed her momentarily appeased tummy, and she could take stock of her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"... Seriously, what the hell?\"</i> It was more of a statement then a question, really. Her appetite was simply out of control, and had been for quite some time. Even as she sat there, licking sugar from her fingers, she could feel her belly working through its contents as quick as it could, making room for the next deluge of fattening food that would pass her lips in the very near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If I keep eating at this pace, I'm going to be absolutely enormous in another couple of months.\"</i> She ran her hands over the top of her belly, invisible beneath her overly-generous bust. Her lardy breasts and overfed belly jiggled flabbily, and she could almost feel the hard spot that signified where her stomach actually was under all her excess flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, she knew she'd already gotten quite large compared to how she was before. Her family's reaction was the most obvious tell as to how much she'd changed. She seldom saw them outside of the holidays, so it had come as some surprise when she came home from school significantly fatter then when she left. And then it happened twice more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Mom had been the most supportive, trying to avoid making any mention of it and refusing to treat her any differently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Dad was much worse about it, holding his peace around Mom but making snide remarks and not-so-subtle insinuations when she wasn't. He'd always been fairly strict, and clearly did not like what his eldest daughter had done to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorst of all was her sister, Kara, who had spent much of her time glaring at her elder sister almost accusingly. The rest of the time, she spent sliding April extra desserts and fatty dishes. She'd taken over the serving job from Mom, and April watched as her plates kept growing in size, always favoring rich, calorie laden foods, and boy oh boy was Kara quick to give her seconds and thirds. She'd bring her cookies when she didn't ask for them, chocolate milk when she asked for white, cola when she wanted water. When she cut a cake, she gave the rest of the family a sixth and then fed the rest to her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst of all the days had happened just a few weeks ago. She'd been sent shopping with Kara on New Year's Eve, and it really had been a trip from hell. The first thing she did was pull through the drive through and buy April two double cheeseburgers and a large fries with a jumbo milkshake. The psycho wouldn't even let her leave the car until she finished it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was just the start of a long, painful day. Kara seemed intent on keeping April stuffed to the brim at all times, alternating between force feeding her large quantities of greasy fast food and taking her to clothing shops to make her try on clothes she had no chance of fitting. When their Mom had them pick up pizza for supper, Kara ordered two instead of one, and made April eat a whole deep dish pepperoni under threats of blackmail with the photos she'd taken of her new, porky sister in a too-tight bikini. As if that wasn't enough, she'd still had to eat her share of the other one once they got home. April had felt fit to burst by the time she went to bed, and could only stare in mute horror when she saw the present her demonic little sister had left on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn entire freshly baked apple pie with a note on top: <i>Eat it, you fat bitch.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril had never been that close with most of her family, but after THAT, she certainly wasn't planning to head home ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her hands on her desk, April stood up. She felt the desk chair try to come with her, though it dropped off after a few inches. She had gained so much and so quickly that she couldn't help being a bit awkward, as she simply hadn't had time to get used to moving with her newfound weight. She turned around and eye balled her chair. It had been a bit small when she got it two years ago, but now it seemed laughably inadequate. She gave her mammoth butt cheeks a jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I wonder if I should speak to the campus shrink. I'm really starting to think this might be from some psychological scarring.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril waddled her jiggly ass over to her wardrobe. Opening a drawer, she found a bag of M&amp;M's, and without a moment's hesitation, tore open and devoured the bag. Throwing the wrapper in her positively packed garbage can, she quickly resolved to get dressed and speak to Julie, before she found something else to add to her waistline. Grabbing her largest remaining clothes, she found they...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>\"Oh God, please tell me you're joking!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril looked at herself in the mirror, stunned to horrified silence. To say her clothes didn't fit would be an understatement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA terrible, terrible understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shirt was far too tight. Her engorged breasts were simply too large, and the buttons had no chance of coming together. She could only manage every second one on her belly, leaving large pockets of pale skin on display. Her love handles refused to be contained, and protruded from under the shirt like a rock formation of fat. The rest of the material was stretched to the extreme, and it seemed like it would break if she breathed too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pants were even worse. Her legs were so encumbered with lard that she wasn't even able to pull them up her titanic thighs. Her huge ass hung over the back of the garment. Needless to say, both halves of the pants had no chance of being brought close enough together to be done up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You've got to be f#$%ing kidding me! I can't go outside like this! What am I going to do now!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril sat on her bed, and heard several stitches of her inseam give out with a loud \"Pop!\" as her fat settled around her. She felt either ready to cry or hyperventilate, or quite possibly both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSycamore Hill University took its Spring Break in early February. April had spent hers in town, lacking the funds to go anywhere more fun. And so, she'd spent her holiday in the apartment, mostly playing video games, watching movies, and reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd eating food. Lots and lots of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike many college towns, several of the businesses in Sycamore Hill offered large student discounts, and April took full advantage of that. As her waistline would attest to, probably too much. She had ordered delivery several times each day, and inevitably gravitated towards the deals that gave her the most food for the least amount of money, which meant she was buying dinners fit to feed four or more people in one go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had, simply put, spent her entire week off stuffing herself to the brim and sleeping, then woke up to do it all again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, April did have larger clothes then the ones she was trying to squeeze herself into, namely an oversized t-shirt and a pair of grey sweat pants. She'd worn them and her house coat almost exclusively over the break. When she'd gotten back from her morning stroll, her other room mate, Amber, had been collecting their clothes for the weekly laundry service. April had sent them both along with some other things for cleaning. She'd noticed they were getting pretty tight, but in a fantastic case of denial, convinced herself that it was because they hadn't been washed in awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, how she was regretting that now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And if I can't fit these, the largest remaining things I got...\"</i> April looked in her closet, stuffed full of clothes, all of which were smaller then what she was currently trying to wear. <i>\"I'm literally too fat for my entire wardrobe.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still managed to hold back any tears, though she did sniffle a few times. This was the lowest she'd felt since her accident. April slowly got up and took off her clothes. First, she freed her suffering legs from their too-tight confinement, pulling the pants off her fat engorged limbs with some difficulty. As she bent over to force them down, her belly ripped through her blouse's overtaxed buttons, sending three of them ringing off the walls of her room. She tore off her shirt in anger, and threw it as hard as she could to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is such bulls#$t! Why can't I control myself!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer anger subsided as quickly as it had come on, leaving her feeling hollow and desperate. The few times she'd acknowledged her weight gain, she'd promised herself that she was going to turn it around. She was going to eat less, eat better, stop drinking pop and other sugary beverages, exercise more, the works. And what happened? She sat on her fat, growing ass, and ate and ate and ate! Every time, she just ate more, and always the greasiest, fattiest food she could lay her greedy hands on. Though it was depressing to think about, she didn't feel she had a hope or prayer of slowing her gain down, let alone losing any weight; frankly, she just wanted some clothes that fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril started pulling clothes out of her closet, looking for something, ANYTHING, that she could make work. Each garment she grabbed simply wouldn't work, and she threw them one after the other over her shoulder, causing a large pile to form on her bed. Once she emptied her closet enough, she spied some unopened packages on the floor of the wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a care package she'd been sent with after the Christmas break. After her hellish experience over the holidays, she hadn't been interested in opening anything from the hate-harpies she called her family. Now in desperation, she opened the packages, hoping for something that could help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Mom's was a rice cooker, and a book on budget cooking and healthy eating. She probably meant well, but right now it merely stung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Dad's was a couple of gift cards- Wendy's, McDonald's, and Pizza Hut. The jackass had even used a jiffy marker, turning the last one into Pizza Hutt. <i>\"Well, f#$k you too, Dad,\"</i> April thought, though she set aside the cards for later use. It was clearly meant as an insult, but her funds were far too strapped to turn it down. <i>\"And honestly, it's not like it'll hurt,\"</i> she thought as she rubbed her heavy, soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last and largest one was from her sister. April opened Kara's package, and felt her heart leap from her chest. Clothes! Glorious, wonderful, hopefully fitting, clothes! April pulled them out, held them up against her body and examined them. It was a pair of black yoga pants and an admittedly pretty ugly yellow tube top, but if they fit, April would gladly wear them. At least long enough to go buy some new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the yoga pants on first, trying and failing to not notice they were size 2XL. She pulled them up her fat legs and overfilled, jelly-like ass, and was ecstatic to see they fit. Not well, mind you, as every fat roll and extra curve of her over-nourished body was on display, but she'd take it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was the top, which was marked as \"XL to One Size Fits All.\" As far as April was concerned, there had never been more unsettling words ever written in the English language, but desperate times and all that. She pulled the top over her head and shimmied it down her flabby body. She felt her lower belly roll jiggle its way free from her yoga pants. Once she had the top resting comfortably under her arms and straightened out, she fed her roll back into her stretchy pants. Now dressed, April turned to look in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly, she felt like she looked like shit. The stretchy material was skin tight, and left absolutely nothing to the imagination. Every crease, every roll, her gargantuan breasts, each oversized ass cheek, everything was totally on display. If she'd had anything else to wear, she wouldn't be caught dead in these, but she had no choice in the matter. Honestly, she was just happy she had anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked over at Kara's care package, she saw a large, wrapped box in the bottom. Pulling it out, she saw a piece of paper taped to the top that said, <i>\"Hope you like these, Sis!\"</i> She opened the wrap, and saw a box from Cupcake Heaven, a popular chain she'd always been very fond of. The box was packed to the brim with strawberry champagne cupcakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer treacherous stomach growled at the promise of more food. Biting her lower lip, April hesitated just a moment before beginning to devour the pastries in front of her. They were pretty stale, having sat for over a month, but God, they were good. She hadn't even finished the first one before grabbing a second. She'd just chewed the last bite of the second twice before taking a bite of her third. Then a fourth, and a fifth, and a sixth. In all, twenty five cupcakes were eaten in as many minutes. April, now seated upon her bed, leaned back with a groan and rubbed her belly, stuffed for the third time today, and it wasn't even noon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slowly opened her eyes, she saw an envelope that had been hidden under the heaping mound of cupcakes. She pulled it out, grunting a little as her over stuffed tummy didn't appreciate her bending that way. The envelope simply said <i>\"Read Me,\"</i> again in her sister's handwriting. April opened it, and caught a gift card for Cupcake World that fell out. There was also a note from her sister, which April promptly read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey Fat Bitch. Those cupcakes which I'm sure you just inhaled like a prize winning pig had 780 calories and 13 grams of saturated fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you truly love me, you'll take a photo of yourself in those clothes next to the empty box and send me the picture, lol. Or better yet, make a video. Jiggle your fat rolls for me, and tell me how much you love me making you fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just in case you aren't yet bursting out of your new duds, here's a $500 gift card so you can fatten up even more. I can't wait to see how big you're gonna get. I'll bet your fat ass covers a couch by Christmas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSend me some pics when your lardy butt starts crushing furniture! And try not to lose the ability to walk until after my wedding. I need my Maid of Honor to be fucking planetary to make me look amazing! Make sure to chow down, Tubby, that's an order!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril sat in stunned silence for a moment, only the gurgling of her overworked stomach breaking the eerie stillness. <i>\"My reprieve literally came from Satan...\"</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If April's emotional state was delicate before, after reading that lovely little note from Kara, it was shattering like glass. She stood up as fast as she could, and made her way from her bedroom to the common area of the apartment, almost desperate in her need to speak to Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie was a tall, thin young woman. She was currently reading in her favorite chair, glasses resting low on her nose. Her tight blue jeans showcased her long, elegant legs, and she was wearing a white tank top. Her bust size was a modest B cup, and while she could be a little sensitive about being small chested, the fact was that she was considered one of the true beauties of Sycamore U. April had overheard several guys (and even a few girls) discussing her in hushed tones and inappropriate language, usually involving librarian fantasies, and phrases like \"hot nerd.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was absentmindedly playing with her long, curly hair, and had one brunette lock wrapped around her finger. She looked up when she heard April call her name. Her eyes widened when she saw what her friend was wearing, but all thoughts of commenting on her choice of fashion disappeared when she saw the look on April's face. She slid a bookmark into her copy of Pride and Prejudice, and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April, sweetie, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril wrapped her arms around Julie. Julie wasn't much of a hugger, but squeezed her friend back, sensing how much she needed this. April sniffled twice before answering. \"221 pounds. And I'm too fat for everything I own. This is all I have that fits. I'm a fat pig who can't stop eating, and the only thing I have to wear was sent to me by the most evil child to ever walk the earth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie squeezed her a little tighter. \"Shh. Calm down, sweetie, it's okay. It's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril let Julie lead her over to the couch and sit her down. \"It's not. It's really, really not. I mean, Jesus, look at me! I'm a blimp! An ugly, yellow blimp in skin-tight yoga pants! Julie, what am I going to do!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie pushed her glasses up her nose a little. She'd only known April about a year, but had watched her friend steadily gaining weight the entire time. She, quite frankly, ate more then any human being she'd ever seen. Julie had been afraid to bring it up, but now that April was acknowledging what they could all see, she felt she could finally safely broach this delicate topic. \"Well, first, you need to calm down. You're getting a little hysterical, and a person can't make good decisions while panicking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril forced herself to calm down, and slowed her breathing. Julie nodded approvingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's better. Now, I'll be honest, but you have been noticeably... growing, since we've met. How much have you gained?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril started to answer, then stopped herself. She had known Julie for over a year now, but she couldn't bring herself to admit to her friend that she'd almost doubled her weight in just two years! So, she lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost sixty pounds since college started.\" It was almost the truth; if she'd guessed right, that was about how much she'd packed on since the start of this school year. She just gave an answer that left the exact start date a bit vague.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie nodded, falling for April's misdirection as she hadn't known her back then. \"Okay, that's good. Yes, that's a lot, but it's not insurmountable. Almost everyone gains weight in college anyway. Between eating badly, insufficient exercise, your metabolism slowing down from your teenage years, some weight gain is inevitable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril felt a bit of a swell of sadness at that. <i>\"If she thinks sixty is a lot, I wonder what she would say if she knew what I'd actually gained...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Julie noticed April's shifting mood, she gave no sign. \"First things first, we have to deal with the obvious problems; namely, your clothes. School is back in session on Monday, and you have nothing to wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" April nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, the first thing we'll need to do is go out and get you some new ones. What's your budget like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril shifted a little. \"Honestly, not great. I can't spare much more then $XXX for new clothes right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that's definitely a little tight, but we should be able to get you something of a workable wardrobe from that. We can make the 10:47 if we leave now, and take care of that right away. Next, and I might be overstepping my bounds with this one, but you do eat a lot in a day. I can't force you, but you might want to consider slowing down a little, and exercising a bit more. A morning walk doesn't do much for you if you buy a bag of donuts on the way back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril shifted a little more, and nodded her affirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd recommend talking to a nutritionist and getting a gym membership. I won't lie and say you'll lose all the weight you've put on since high school in a month, but every step towards better health is the right one. Now, get your purse. We've only got ten minutes to make our bus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril ran to grab her purse from her room, her heart sinking in her chest. <i>\"I can't afford either of those right now! And if she thinks I'd have trouble losing sixty pounds, what hope do I have of losing over a hundred...?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril's squeezed her plush, full ass into a seat at the mall food court. The small seat was truly uncomfortable, and she could feel her flesh drooping over every side of the hard metal chair. A cool draft of air on her back made her aware that either her pants had slid down or her top had pulled up, and she wasn't sure which.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly, she really didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bad day began on the bus ride. Though no one was pig-headed enough to directly say anything, she knew that the side long glances and whispered words of the other passengers were most definitely about her. While April couldn't prove it, she was pretty certain that at least one guy had taken a photo of her on the sly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes had given her no end of trouble. Her measurements meant that the top kept trying to roll up, revealing far more of her expanded features then she cared for everyone to see. Bending over was asking for trouble, as the yoga pants were barely keeping her modest, and her large ass cheeks seemed to revel in stretching the material to see-through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stares and whispered comments only grew worse at the mall. Some people made no attempt to hide their amusement at the fat girl and her immodest attire. April spent much of the trip red-faced in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough perhaps the worst part of the trip was that their route to the clothing shop took them straight through the food court. Despite feeling so horrible about her body and dreading getting even fatter, April was drooling as the smells of cooking wafted over her. She couldn't help but feel slightly horrified at her body's reaction in spite of her current embarrassment, and truly began to wonder if speaking to the shrink about her (possibly) being a compulsive eater was actually a really good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, scratch that. The worst part of the trip was when Julie ditched her in the clothing shop. They had bumped into members of the Literature Club, which Julie was a part of. She had a crush on one of the other members, Mark, and leapt at the chance when he asked her to join them for lunch. She'd barely even uttered an apology before abandoning April right where she stood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril, tears threatening to come from her eyes, grabbed some stuff off the shelf to try on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she grab, and what did she do with it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1 - She grabbed and purchased clothes that just fit, convincing herself that she was going to halt and reverse her gain. This option will lead to ill-fitting clothes, ripped clothing, wardrobe malfunctions, and likely further financial troubles, since she can't really afford another new wardrobe when she gains again. April's weight gain will be moderate, at least initially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2 - While April was hopeful that she could begin fixing her weight problem, she had quite a few doubts. She also knew she couldn't afford another new wardrobe should the worst happen. And so, she chose cheap clothes with a lot of stretch to them, generally a little big even for her expanded frame. This option will lead to stuffing and a large amount of weight gained. Clothing troubles and broken furniture will come in down the line, as will financial troubles from her food budget spiraling out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3 - April was in too foul of a mood after Julie's abandonment. She gave up clothes shopping, and went straight to the food court for some comfort food. Honestly, this tree could be just about anything, though extreme weight gain is very, very likely.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>April had grabbed an assortment of clothes - shirts, pants, bras, and panties. She took her huge arm load to the change rooms, ignored the looks the girl working the section gave her, and went into her private room to see how everything fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerribly, in a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything that was in her old sizes was just far too small. The pants were the worst. In some cases, she simply had no hope of doing them up, but by large the most common result was she couldn't even get them up her lard-stuffed thighs, or over her fat-inflated ass. After the fourth pair ended around her legs, she gave up and ran out to grab other, larger pants to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shirts were a bit more forgiving, though not by much. While her belly did its share to void a number of her choices, her ego was somewhat assuaged by the biggest culprit for rejection being her breasts. Her boobs had gotten larger as she'd gotten fatter, and when a shirt didn't fit, it was almost always because her massive mammaries said no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer underwear also caused its fair share of problems, again because she'd grabbed her old sizes, initially in denial over how much she'd grown. Her panties had needed the largest adjustment because of her double-wide hips and massive, growing ass. April wasn't very happy about that, though once again her breasts came to the rescue. Her band size had gone up, it was true, but she'd also transitioned from a C to D, and she had those cups filled to the brim. Hitting E couldn't be far in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is there even a point in pretending I'm not going to get fatter?\"</i> It was a depressing thought, but one April felt was justified. She didn't want to gain anymore weight, but she really had little ability to stop herself from eating everything in front of her. Hopefully, the therapist would help her isolate her problem and get her on the right track, as would trying to eat better and exercise (without rewards) more, but the fact remained that she was probably going to gain more weight in the short term. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccepting the truth may suck, but for the good of her painfully limited budget, April knew what she had to do. She focused her purchases on the large end of her spectrum. The bras and panties were a little loose, and the shirts and pants almost too baggy, but April feared that she'd all too soon fill them out. Each chosen article of clothing also had a fair bit of elastic give to it, giving it the potential for a lot of stretch should her features inevitably begin pushing on the sides. Unfortunately, this also meant most of what she had grabbed was far from fashionable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This sucks, but at least I won't have to worry about replacing anything anytime soon.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer purchases done, April checked the time on her phone. It was nearly one, and despite her gluttonous morning, she was famished. Her flabby ass wobbled merrily as she made her way to the food court. With the morning she'd had, she felt fully justified in having a large, greasy fast-food lunch. She knew it wasn't on her diet, but she could worry about that after she spoke to campus shrink on Monday. After two hours of nothing, she NEEDED food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the present, April was scarfing down a lunch fit to feed a family. Two double cheeseburgers, an extra large fries, and a jumbo milkshake from the mall McDonald's were the first to feel her belly's wrath. She sunk her teeth into the juicy burgers, licking the grease off her lips. She dipped her fries into her milk shake, enjoying the mix of the salt and sugar. She chewed and swallowed each bite like a machine. Not a drop of food was wasted, as each daub on her face was promptly wiped off with a finger and transferred to her hungering maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, she'd finished her first course, and moved on to her second- two slices of Super Supreme pizza from Pizza \"Hutt\" (<i>\"Seriously, f#$k you, Dad.\"</i>). April stacked the two slices together and ate them as one super slice. The rich tomato sauce, the fresh peppers, the meat, everything about it was just delectable. She finished off the last bit with a loud \"Mmm!\" of enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere hadn't been a Wendy's in the food court, so she couldn't use her gift card there, but there had been a DQ, and she'd gone and ordered herself a banana split. It was a sign of just how fast she'd eaten that the ice cream had barely softened, let alone melted. She grabbed her spoon and began eating her dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm!\" Damn, it was good! April decided to take her time with this one, savoring each and every mouthful. At least, that's what she thought she was doing. In truth, she was inhaling it like someone was going to take it away from her. And while she might have missed that, her growing audience certainly didn't.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zoom in, man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I think I know that girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril ate every last morsel, not even leaving crumbs on her tray. Her tube top, already stretched pretty tight, only got even tighter as she filled and overfilled her stomach. The material got caught in her belly rolls and began to pull down, slowly but surely exposing more and more cleavage as she ate. A couple drops of ice cream and sauce landed on her exposed breasts, and she quickly swooped it up with her fingers and sucked the digits dry in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrinking what was left of her ice cream sauce, she set the plastic tub down and leaned back with a mighty coo. She began to rub her delightfully stuffed belly. Already, she was feeling pretty mad at herself, but she'd work at fixing this come Monday, so today was fine, right? Besides, she needed to know how much money was on those gift cards her douche bag Dad gave her, and at $150 each, she could do a lot with those things. Her overfull belly began to throb a bit, so she eased up a little on how hard she was rubbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly now did April realize that she'd developed quite the audience. Twenty-odd people were staring directly at her, several with phones out. Her jaw dropped, and she turned beet red in humiliation. All at once, the gathered masses spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was disgusting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we buy you more!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make me sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, f#$% you, man! Don't listen to him, baby, that was some Stuffer31 meets Gaining Goddess level shit right there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you online!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you single!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to go to dinner tonight!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Youtube, honey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril was horrified. It was bad enough when she was stuffing herself and becoming a fat ass alone, but having other people see it was too much! Way, way too much! She needed to get out of here, now! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to get out of her chair, but immediately ran into problems. Her rock-hard belly refused to bend like it had when she squeezed herself into the small booth, and it hurt a lot as she twisted and forced her way out. Her ass pressed hard into the backrest of the chair, forcing her ass to try and squeeze between the bars. It was now that she learned the draft was indeed from the yoga pants moving down. Her upper ass cheeks and panty line were on full display, and a few jiggling moves had her love handles drop out of her top as well. April was seriously wishing she could die right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally free from the booth, she turned to make as fast an exit as she could when she heard the worst thing she possibly could at this moment: \"April!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze, and slowly turned in horror at the sound of her own name from one of her newfound \"fans.\" She saw a tall man standing there, holding her purse and shopping bags for her. It took her a moment to place him, before realizing it was the young man seated next to her in her Early American History class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeff! I'm... I'm... Sorry!\" She hurried over to him, grabbed her stuff, and made her way to the exit as fast as her fat thighs and rock-hard gut would let her. <i>\"I'm never leaving the apartment again!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril got home by late afternoon. She honestly couldn't have said if anyone on the bus was staring at her this time. She was too focused on everything that had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How am I supposed to finish that course now!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe honestly didn't think she could have felt worse then she did this morning, but the universe certainly did like to prove her wrong. She'd spent her whole bus ride staring at her belly, angry at her total lack of control. She couldn't even pretend she had self-restraint in public, for crying out loud! And now she was going to be the laughing stock of the entire school. Forget that course, how was she supposed to graduate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril opened the door to the apartment with some difficulty, struggling to balance everything she bought while unlocking the door. She fell back on her old standby when she was, well, anything- food. She'd gone to Cupcake Heaven and tested her sister's card. Sure enough, she'd put $500 on it, and April promptly spent a healthy chuck of it on three boxes of fresh strawberry champagne cupcakes. <i>\"Maybe if I get really lucky, I'll get too fat to leave the apartment.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril spent the rest of her evening alternating between eating cupcakes and brief periods of digesting. It was after she'd finished off the last of the pastries that she decided to finish off her day the way the universe apparently wanted her to. She arranged all the boxes her belly had emptied that day alongside her receipts from the food court, and snapped a shot, then took one of her bloated, flabby self in the mirror, and sent them both to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer phone dinged a few seconds later:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Love ya, fatty <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's your reward!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril's phone dinged again. She checked, and saw a receipt for two large deep dish pizzas for delivery, paid with credit card. Her phone dinged again with another message from Kara:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Send me lots of photos, Piggy!</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>April leaned back against her pillows, nude and with the lights off. Her hands rested lightly on her tummy, which was packed to the brim with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd eaten both pizzas over the course of ninety minutes, keeping Kara abreast of her one-woman feast with a facetime session. Stuffing all that on top of her cupcake stuffed belly had been quite a struggle. April was red faced and sweaty by the end, and a couple times felt like vomiting, but she'd managed to keep it all down. Kara was as supportive as always, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's right, fat ass, keep eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you feel yourself getting fatter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at yourself! You're such a good little pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat it right now, fatty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't finish it all, I'll show Mom and Dad just what you've been up to. Wouldn't you love that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You expect me to believe you could eat all those cupcakes and not finish a little bit of pizza? Plz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't even need me here, do you? You're such a fucking pig, you'd be blowing up even without me. I'm just here to speed things along. ;) \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How fat are you, piggy?\" ... \"221? Not a bad start, but let's see just how fat we can make you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last remark would have been rather worrisome earlier in the day, but after the day April had had, becoming too fat to walk seemed both inevitable and a luxury. At least she wouldn't have to deal with anyone outside the apartment ever again. It had been tough, but she managed to force the last of the pies down her throat. She had leaned back in her suffering chair in just her bra and yoga pants, as Kara had insisted she take her top off and let her see her naked belly. She had crowed mightily over that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Such a good little piggy, doing as you're told.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril heard a knock on the apartment door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good little piggies get rewards. Leave your top off, and set up your phone so I can watch. Let him see what kind of fat bitch you are, and remember, if he asks, it's all for you. You're a fat little piggy, you're so hungry, and you just want to get even fatter.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril felt her blood run cold, and it took a couple of threats from Kara to force her out of the bedroom. She set the phone up, and answered the door. The kid's eyes nearly bugged out of his head, and he was stammering badly as he handed over several containers of food. \"H-here's your or-order, Miss! I-I-I hope you have a g-good night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid left as quickly as he'd arrived. April breathed a sigh of relief, grateful he didn't ask any questions. She heard her sister sigh from her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ah, that's too bad. He was cute. I bet he'd have liked to know this is a one woman show. I'll bet he'd have fed you if you asked. Would you have liked that, piggy? But it's too soon for my cute little sow to get her first boar; tonight's my night. Now, back to the bedroom. You've got a long night ahead of you before you earn your reward...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the present, it was after four am. Kara had given her a massive stuffing of Thai food on top of everything else she'd already eaten that day. She was a bit more lenient about the pace with this batch, giving April some time to digest, and getting caught up on everything. It was really, really strange, actually. One minute, Kara would be forcing even more food down her throat, wielding blackmail and her tongue like a knife, and the next, they'd be talking like they were two normal siblings, just getting caught up with each other's lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was totally surreal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, April's reward was a massive slice of triple chocolate cake. Kara had her take it slow, licking and savoring each bite, describing how good it was, and how much she enjoyed it. She told Kara about her botched shopping trip, and was quite surprised at how offended Kara was on her behalf against Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What a bitch.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was overjoyed when she heard April had bought a bunch of new clothes, and overstuffed belly or no, demanded a fashion show. She seemed to consider how loose everything was as a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How fast do you think you can outgrow those? Don't worry, piggy. We'll have you stretching them out in no time. Such a good fucking pig.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen April had at last finished her heaping mound of food, she was painfully overstuffed. Kara was all but preening as she looked at her sister's distended belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Such a good piggy, eating everything she's told. How fat do you think this'll make you? You're the best kind of piggy, aren't you? The kind that just eats and eats and eats and just keeps getting fatter everyday. I think I've set my sights for you too low, fat ass. Way too low. God, I'm going to make you so fucking huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you're not allowed to go easy on yourself tomorrow. I know it hurts, but it's how we're going to stretch out your stomach, but it won't work if you keep slacking off and letting it shrink back to normal. Not that your normal is that small anyway, ha-ha! Send texts to let me know how much and what you're eating. Got to make sure there's some nutrition buried in that sea of empty calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and Sis? If a friend abandons you in your hour of need to run after a boy, she's a pretty shitty friend. Take care of yourself, okay? Anyway, I need to be off for the night, I've got work in like three hours. Later! And keep eating, lard butt, that's an order! Bye!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, her sister was off, leaving April very confused, unable to decide if Kara hated her or actually liked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had, with an immense amount of difficulty, managed to get undressed. Way too sore to even consider pajamas, she laid back in her bed with a mighty groan. God, she hurt! Her stomach seemed barely able to cope with the massive quantity of food she'd stuffed in it, and April was regretting not grabbing a garbage can should the worst happen. Despite how much it hurt, she was soon drifting off to sleep, debating what she should have for breakfast...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waking up to the sound of her stomach growling wasn't anything new for April.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up to the sound of her stomach growling at nine am when she didn't get to bed until four, and only after she'd eaten enough to feed a family of six or more? That was pretty new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril leaned forward carefully, not quite sure if the growling was hunger or her belly still working through last night's epic binge. Much to her surprise, her belly felt soft and her stomach was clearly empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GGGGGGGRRRRROOOOOOOWWWWLLLL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril blushed, shocked at just how noisy her guts had been recently. Everything about her body lately seemed to push her towards further gluttony. Her obscenely loud stomach making ungodly noises when it wasn't perpetually stuffed was only the latest in the trend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril rolled out of bed, and checked her snack drawer. There wasn't much left; only half a bag of snack sized mars bars and a small box of mini donuts. She quickly scarfed all of them down, then went for a shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lathered her flabbier body up, she couldn't help feeling a little better about herself then she had the day before. Did her sister's praise, despite her obvious desires and ulterior motives, really mean that much to her? Her soft body certainly didn't seem to bother her as much today, that was for sure. Typically, she was out of the shower as quickly as possible, and dressed without looking in the mirror. Today, April spent a bit more time cleaning between her rolls, making sure she was completely squeaky clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Still, I got to put a stop to whatever it is Kara's doing. Otherwise, I'm going to be as big as a house by Christmas.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasier said then done. Her stomach let out a more subdued growl, indicating that it was ready and expecting a second, more considerable course. On top of that, Kara had a fresh, new mountain of blackmail material she wouldn't hesitate to use, courtesy of April herself. She couldn't help but kick herself for that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why did I think any of that was a good idea!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril thought that, but really couldn't answer herself. She had been feeling almost completely worthless before she called Kara. Too fat for her clothes, her eating was out of control, abandoned by her so-called friend and made a laughing stock at the mall. She called her when she felt so low that she was certain she couldn't feel worse, and strangely enough, Kara actually made her feel better. Emotionally, at least. Physically, she was in a terrible amount of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all it cost her was another 10,000 calories or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril stopped rubbing her soft, jiggly belly. Coming to a decision, she turned off the water and began to towel off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I can't let this continue. I can't keep going at Kara's pace. I'll talk to the campus shrink tomorrow and figure out why I keep doing this to myself. Maybe I can't lose the weight, but I can keep from gaining anymore.\"</i> April's stomach let out another loud growl, causing her to flinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"... or, maybe I can at least slow it down to a more human number. Seriously, this is a massive problem! Normal people don't eat like this! Okay, okay, calm down girl. Just relax. I'll talk to Kara tonight. She's my sister. She wouldn't do anything too crazy, right? The worst she could do is tell Mom and Dad, and they already know what I'm like. I'll just tell her the truth; that I have a serious problem that I'm trying to work through, that her... whatever this is, is enabling me and making it worse, and I need to cut back for the good of health and sanity.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling good about her decision, April went back to her room to get dressed. Her resolve lasted about as long as it took her to see Kara's text on her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Morning, Fat Ass! Eat anything yet?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril's heart was filled with dread as she replied: <i>Some Mars Bars minis and some donuts</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara: <i>You call that breakfast? You need something more substantial then that. Google Maps shows an all-you-can-eat breakfast place only a bus stop away from you. You should totes go.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril: <i>I don't think I should Kara.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara: <i>Just fucking do it, porky!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril's phone dinged as she received a video from her sister. She turned pale as she saw herself in bra and skin-tight yoga pants, already bloated from food, answering the door to receive another arm load of greasy grub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara: <i>You sure were eager then, huh. If mom and dad don't scare you, how does internet fame sound? Your eating four plates, you fat bitch, and I want them fucking heaped.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril's sat in stunned silence when her phone dinged again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara: <i>Better make a stop at Cupcake Heaven too. You need a box of something for your prelunch snack. Send me the photos, or you'r famous. Be a good little piggy, and you'll get a reward!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril swallowed in fear. <i>\"I take it back! My sister is Satan!\"</i> She text back: <i>Okay, just let me get dressed! Please don't send them!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara text back: <i>No bra. Consider that your punishment. And make sure to have dessert, piggy!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril didn't think she could have felt more bloated then the previous night, but God, was she wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara seemed hellbent on making her eat almost every other hour of the day. April wasn't sure what she did for work, but she sure seemed to have a lot of time on her hands, because she was texting her constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara: <i>How was breakfast?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara: <i>Send me a photo</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara: <i>You look like you need a snack. You're practically wasting away.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara: <i>Better make it three cheeseburgers. Don't want you going hungry </i> ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara: <i>That's a good little piggy, eating what she's told.</i><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril was starting to figure out Kara's modus operandi a little, at least. If she ate what and when she was told, she was typically given more time to digest, and rewarded with a rich, sugary dessert. Kara apparently hadn't forgotten that April had a wicked sweet tooth. She tended to also be a lot more easy going, less verbally offensive, and actually supporting of her \"good little piggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she resisted, on the other hand, Kara would blackmail her into painfully stuffing herself. She'd rant and rave like a crazy woman, and cuss like a sailor. It seemed \"Fat Bitch\" was her punishment nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril really was not liking the fact that having a healthy relationship with her sister required her to eat like a herd of half-starved pigs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was once again lying nude in bed, once more too sore to bother with her pj's. Her rock hard belly stuck straight up like basketball, her soft rolls as solid as the food baby she was carrying. Kara, in her infinite mercy, allowed her to hit the hay at a reasonable hour, allowing her overfed sibling a chance to sleep before class tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're all heart</i>, she'd texted Kara. That comment had earned her another forced bedtime snack. Lacking the necessary supplies herself, she'd been forced to steal an unopened box of Chips Ahoy cookies from one of her room mates. She suspected they were Amber's, as Julie seemed to live on celery and water. April hoped she could replace them before Amber noticed they were missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final grunt of pain, April willed herself to sleep. She had to figure out how to get out from under Kara's thumb, but until then, she had some strict instructions for the morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs per her instructions, she'd contacted Kara as soon as she'd gotten up. She had done her essentials in the bathroom, and had not been permitted to drink or eat anything yet. Kara had had her remain nude for this, and was watching (and likely filming) via her cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really need to get an actual desktop camera, tubby. This quality is so poor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril barely heard her. Her nerves were firing on all cylinders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril turned on the scale, and once it powered up, stepped on it. The machine paused for a moment before announcing: \"227.4 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril's skin went a little grey as she felt her heart drop in her stomach. Kara, meanwhile, let out a joyous cry. Smiling evilly, she looked at her elder sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of that might be food, but still, not bad for our first weekend together, huh, piggy? Still, we can certainly do better...\"</span></div></div>",

Weighing in at 250 pounds, Grace was most definitely a well fed woman. Wearing a particularly tight tank-top didn't make her look any skinnier. As a child and teenager, Grace was never a skinny girl. Since she enjoyed baking and eating, the girl always had some meat on her bones. However, when Grace discovered that she could turn her passion into a business, she started to get thicker and fatter until she reacher her current weight. As her business and waistline grew, so did her feeling of isolation. Dispite a thriving business and a rich bank account, Grace wasn't completely satisfied. Because she spent the past 10 years building a business  from the ground up, Grace couldn't squeeze the time in to marry and start a family.<br>\r\nGrace parked on her driveway, finished her chocolate bar, and rubbed her belly. \"I could still go for some more chocolate.\" Grace thought to herself. She visualized a cake she baked for herself earlier in the week and licked her lips.<br>\r\nGrace got out of her car and took a look at her home. Standing four stories tall, her house was quite the building. She approached the door and attempted to unlock it. However, she was confused to find the door already unlocked. \"Did I forget to unlock it this morning?\" Grace thought to herself. She looked at the ground to find a bobby pin and a bent paper clip. Thoughts creeped into her mind of a burglar breaking in to steal everything of value. She creaked open the door and found faint tracks of mud on the foyer floor. Grace was really starting to get nervous. It was obvious that someone picked the lock and broke in. Hearing noises from the kitchen, she headed in that direction with plans to confront the trespasser.<br>\r\nGrace barged into the kitchen and strictly said, \"Can I help you?\" However, contrary to Grace's thoughts, instead of the trespasser being an adult man or woman, it was a child(s), [blank] to be exact. </span></div></div>",

Grace led her new girl into the kitchen pulling out a huge chocolate cake. Grace still craving one from her car ride home, had a huge slice herself. Kat was immediately impressed by the cake from its size to its taste. The taste tantalized Kat in ways she never felt before, her eyes lit up, her legs twitched, and a squeal of joy slipped out of her. Grace found Kat's elation so rewarding causing her to grab more desserts to feed her new kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of cake eating and conversation, Grace ascertained that Kat knew nothing of society's standards or social norms. Kat had absolutely no connections. The girl standing before Grace was literally a blank slate for her to raise however she pleased. Grace smiled as she contemplated all the possibilities, Kat could grow up to be a baker like herself or maybe something better. But first things first, Kat was filthy and in dire need of a bath. Grace showed Kat the bath and told her to wash up. As Kat washed, Grace helped herself to more sweets, gleefully stuffing her 250 pound body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nom Nomph tee hee A little girl, I finally have a girl to raise as my own.\" Grace rejoiced as her mouth was getting stuffed with desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring her joyful binge, Grace decided to...</span></div></div>",

She could rebel and live a life other than what she wanted. But that wasn't the case, Grace would control Kat's upbringing and with her lucrative business, Grace could raise Kat to her liking without any difficulty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was than that Kat finished her bath and walked out wrapped in a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um excuse me, I'm done.\" Kat said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace was surprised by the girl's beauty. After washing off all the dirt and grit, Kat's natural beauty could be seen. She had smooth white skin, sparkling eyes, and long blonde hair. Her body was too thin for Grace's taste though but she would fix that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my you're quite beautiful Kat.\" Grace complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am? No one's ever told me that before.\" Kat blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..\"Grace said beginning to push her ideal unto the girl \"you would be, if you weren't so skinny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" Kat felt disappointed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry honey, I'm here to help you.\" Grace comforted \"I'm a wealthy baker so I'll provide you with all the food you could eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow thank you.\" Kat appreciated her new mom's benevolence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'll clean your rags, when you get fatter you can wear nicer clothes.\" Grace promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the first month, Grace had sturdily set up the foundation for Kat's fat future. Grace had programmed Kat to believe that all girls wanted to be fat and that skinny girls were loathed. Grace would wear revealing clothes like her typical tank top, proudly presenting her long cleavage implying that only fat girls had big boobs. The baker always ate huge copious servings in front of the impressionable girl thus gaining weight herself. Grace had Kat educated by a private tutor. To perpetuate Kat's positive view of female obesity, Grace required that the tutor was fat and wear revealing clothing which flattered her curves. Grace would have magazines displaying plus size women placed throughout the house knowing Kat would see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat was also raised in an etiquette that facilitated weight gain. Grace deeply implanted in the girl's mind that it was expected of girls to ask for large dishes and obediently eat it all. Physical exertion was something that a respectable lady would avoid at all costs. Refusing sports in favor of more lady-like hobbies like cooking or tailoring. Kat was also told that skinny girls should conceal their unappealing bodies unlike their hefty counterparts who could proudly expose bare skin. Through Grace's influence, Kat was determined to get fat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daniella heard a familiar exclamation from her room mate from her usual spot on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another rejection,\" Sawyer sighed as she read the screen on her lap top. \"'Thank you for applying, but we regret to inform you we have decided to go a different direction.' Why couldn't they just say we hired someone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just the way everyone does things. Just keep trying; you'll find something.\" Daniella O'Brien walked into the room as she spoke. The young woman was in her early twenties. She'd graduated from college a couple of years ago, and quickly found a job as a legal aide. She was fairly short, standing at only 5'2\". She was a little on the round side, weighing somewhere in the 200-250 pound range, though she hadn't weighed herself since she was still in college. Her curly red hair was cut to chin length, and framed her chubby yet cute face nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friend and room mate, Sawyer Garcia, couldn't have looked more different then Daniella if she tried. Descended of Mexican and Portuguese immigrants, her caramel skin contrasted sharply with her Irish-American room mates' pale and freckled complexion. Her long, black hair rolled past her shoulders, and she was considerably bustier then her pear-shaped friend. She was also a fair bit taller, standing at 5'9\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terms of academics and professional life, however, Sawyer had been so far less successful. She'd been quite the athlete in high school, and got into university on a soccer scholarship. However, in her final year, she'd blown out both her knees, ending any hopes of playing professionally. And though she'd finished her degree, she was quickly learning that a BoA in Lit was not very helpful for someone looking for a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being out of college for almost a year and sending out her resume multiple times a week, Sawyer had yet to find full time work. So far, she'd managed to hold out due to her savings and a small amount she'd been making on the side, but she knew if Daniella hadn't let her move in, she'd probably have been homeless by now. And though she'd been trying to keep her hopes up, it was hard to remain optimistic when she hadn't even been able to get past the interview stage in the last nine months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's times it doesn't feel like it. I mean, seriously, I got turned down by McDonald's. F@#$ing McDonald's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's frustrating, but something will happen. Trust me,\" Daniella said as she checked the time. \"Any way, I've got to run or I'll miss my bus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay. I'll hold down the fort. Have fun at work.\" Sawyer waved at her friend as she pulled on her shoes. Daniella was wearing her professional business attire, while Sawyer was currently dressed in a sleeveless pink top and a pair of blue jean shorts. And though she wasn't about to say anything, Dani couldn't help but notice that she was filling out her outfit more then usual. Her midriff baring shirt did nothing to hide her double rolled pot belly, and Sawyer currently had the lower roll stuffed into her tight shorts. Her thighs had noticeably thickened as well, turning her bottoms skin tight. Meanwhile, there wasn't a way to describe her boobs that didn't involve the word, \"bulging.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's not too surprising, to be honest. She's always eaten a ton, and she stopped working out at all once she got injured. Besides, she's still a lot lighter then me, so it's not like I can judge.\"</i> As Daniella made her way down the street, she thought, \"Well, hopefully she'll find something for work soon. It'd be nice to have some help paying the bills. And if she doesn't get off her butt soon and start moving around some more, her wardrobe might not be able to handle what she's doing to her waist for much longer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniella was mistaken about how wide the gap between the two was in weight. She did outweigh Sawyer, that was true, but only by about thirty or forty pounds. The former soccer star's extra height helped hide her weight gain, but it was certainly there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't really surprising she'd put on a few pounds. From running a marathon every other day, her work out routine had dropped to nil. The problem was only exacerbated by her diet. Sawyer was still eating like she needed 5,000 calories a day, but her body needed less then 2k. The general quality of that diet had also dropped since college, aiming more for the cheap and greasy, rather then the more costly health food options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a third reason, and it was tied to her current sole source of income.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawyer booted up her computer, and sat down in her comfy computer chair. She cracked open a can of coke and took a sip as she slid on her headphones. Even when she was still athletic, Sawyer was something of a gamer nerd. She'd taken to streaming her sessions after moving in with Dani, reasoning that if all she could do was play some games, then she might as well try and make a little extra money on the side. It wouldn't be enough to live on, but it was better then nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that was what she initially thought. While she wasn't yet self sufficient, the stream was proving to be more profitable then she initially imagined. Granted, her fan base seemed a little... different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had started when she knocked her drink over during one session. She'd stood up to clean the spill before it went sticky, and the chat had exploded with comments regarding her chubby belly. Sawyer had been fairly self-conscious regarding her pudgy gut, but a number of people in her chat seemed enamored with it, and it quickly became rare that she could get through a session without someone asking to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey seemed to enjoy feeding her as well, and she couldn't help but notice that as she ate more and showed off her softening features, the more subs and donations she got as a result. She'd started doing punishment games, eating a slice of pizza when she was scored against in blood bowl or died in Dark Souls, for example, and those sessions had proven to be her most popular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently, though, some of her fans had been asking her to let them buy her something to eat on camera. She'd hmm'ed and haw'ed about it for the last week, and she'd decided...</span></div></div>",

She was fingering her curly brown hair while reading the news and eating a glazed doughnut. The young teacher specialized in history, and she was quite good at teaching it. While she had only been teaching for five years, she has become the favorite 9th grade history teacher out of all of them. The class itself was essentially an easy-A class, but Ashley still tried to put a reasonable amount of challenge into it.<br>\r\nAshley finished her first doughnut and moved on to the next one. Ashley sure liked to eat and because of that, she wasn't the skinniest 27 year old. Although she wasn't the fattest either. A good amount of her excess weight went to her bust; giving her large hips and DD breasts. Because of this, not many people noticed her pot belly.<br>\r\nThe clock stuck 8:00 and her students came flooding in. Her one major idiosyncrasy involved students. Mainly the chubby males. For some reason Ashley found the younger fatter boys more, for lack of a better term... Attractive. Knowing that by admiring students this way made her a \"bad girl\", only turned her on more. The top thing that totally made Ashley so turned on was a chubby boy's weight gain. She often dreamt was to take a chubby boy and fatten him up even more. That thought alone made her tingle on the inside. Of course, she couldn't tell this to any of her peers. If she did, that would be the end of her career in a split second. <br>\r\nSince it was the start of October, school only started half a month ago. Despite this, Ashley has already taken an interest in 2 boys already.<br>\r\nThere was Leo, who was currently getting a low 'A' in her class. Leo enjoyed history, and enjoyed the presence of Ashley all the same. He's a bit of a loner.<br>\r\nThere was Alex, who was currently getting a solid 'C' in her class. Alex hasn't really shown any outstanding interest for history and has been getting lass than stellar results on his quizzes. He's a bit of a dork.<br>\r\nBoth of these boys aren't the fattest boys around, but they weren't in any sports and according to their Phys Ed teacher, they are not fit and have a terrible diet, so they both have great potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhom does Ashley pursue?</span></div></div>",

Convinced she'd found love while in the local community college of Sycamore Hill, she'd dropped out and married at the tender age of 21 after only dating her newfound husband for three months. Unfortunately, Daniel (heaven forbid you call him Dan) had proven to be a charming date, but a poor spouse. Bad with money, a short tempered perfectionist, and extremely arrogant, their married life had been strained from the get-go. And once their daughter, Sylvia, was born, all his negative traits seemed to get worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, their dismal excuse for a marriage had come to an ignoble close. Gloria had asked for full custody of Sylvia; Daniel didn't even pretend to contest it. He'd had no contact with either of them since it was finalized. Frankly, the nicest thing Gloria could say about him was that his child support was always deposited in full at the appointed time, without fail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the marks he'd left on her life were unavoidable. She would never consider her precious daughter a mistake, but Daniel and her family had gotten along amazingly poorly. Gloria, foolishly smitten, had distanced herself from them when he pressed her to. Despite the divorce, she'd yet to successfully reestablish ties with her parents once again, though at least she was texting a bit with her sister now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth is she could use a bit of help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Sylvia now in preschool and requiring a babysitter while Gloria was at work, plus rent and utilities, plus grocery bills, plus car bills, plus and plus and plus and plus. Gloria's finances were stretched nearly to the breaking point. Her job as a waitress paid terribly, leaving her almost totally reliant on tips to make ends meet. Her boss was an ass, plain and simple, and seemed to love dropping double shifts on her, despite knowing she needed to get home and look after her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had been one such day. Luckily, her babysitter had been willing to stay a few extra hours. Gloria tipped her very well for that. And after making sure little Sylvia was tucked away in her bed, Gloria was ready to wind down herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria hadn't been much of a gamer growing up, being more focused on sports and club activities, but she'd really taken to the hobby in college. She'd proven really skilled with the FPS genre, and after a long day at work and looking after Sylvia, it proved a very cathartic way to cool off afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned back in her chair and smoothed out her tank top, Well, tried to, at least. Though she didn't want to admit it, Gloria knew she'd put on some weight. Her ass and hips were doing a good job of filling her tight shorts, and though her belly was slow to keep up, it had finally gotten noticeably flabby. Pooching out and separating into two rolls, her white shirt did nothing to hide her growing muffin top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, she wasn't terribly surprised by this. Gloria used to work out on a daily basis, but work and Sylvia left her with no energy to keep up her health regime afterwards. A lack of time to cook and her low income meant she was also often eating cheap takeout and delivery pizza. It would have been more shocking if she hadn't gained a pound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, this wasn't going to be a problem. She adjusted the camera mounted on her computer, adjusting it until you could only see her from the breasts up. Gloria pulled down her tank top to reveal as much cleavage as she could. Satisfied with her appearance, she turned on the chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple months ago, Gloria had started streaming her matches. Why not, after all? If she was going to relax with a shooter after her day, she might as well make a couple extra bucks on the side. As it turned out, she was making not bad money with her stream, although she figured out pretty quick that the chat were as or more interested in her. Sex Sells, as they say, and it didn't take her long to realize that if she showed a little skin and flirted with her subs a bit, her donations would be a fair bit higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, everyone! It's your host, GloriousGamerGirl1234, welcoming you to another fabulous night of head-sniping action. Tonight, I'll be fighting with the Greens, aiming for the Long Shot challenge.\" Her stomach let out a growl, and she really hoped her mic wouldn't pick that up. \"But first, I think I need some food before we begin. I'll be right back, unless someone in chat wants to send me something...?\"</span></div></div>",

I'll have to buy new ones again.\" pouted the brown haired woman. Morgan now only slept in her tighty whities having tore her sexy night gown weeks earlier. Morgan than walked into her bathroom to shower. Morgan felt relief as she stripped out of the tight panties which were digging deep into her flesh. Morgan felt even more relieved from removing her tight bra. Reaching behind to undo the undersized garment, Morgan slid her fingers through her back fat which rolled over the strap. \"Come on where is it?\"She grumbled before successfully releasing her breasts. Finally liberated by the bothersome wear Morgan could breathe easier. She wasn't bothered by the lack of support as the globes resting contently on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan carried out her morning routine like usual. Walk into the bathroom and dejectedly study her growing body in the mirror only to find more disappointment as she finds new rolls as she washes her plump body. Once done, Morgan put on her work attire which was becoming rather restrictive. Straining herself to pull up her pants over her large ass, which was particularly laden with cellulite, only to barely cover her deep ass crack. Morgan than tried to put her bra on only to snap it in two. \"Oh no that was my biggest bra.\" Morgan moaned tossing the broken bra aside. \"I'll just wear my shirt. Feels more like a bra anyway.\" Skipping the bra, Morgan pulled her shirt over her gigantic tits only to fail to cover her fleshy stomach. Much to her dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came breakfast. Morgan's family ate normal proportioned meals like bacon and eggs while the woman herself ate a miniscule amount. Everyone was perplexed as to how their mother was gaining so much weight when she ate nothing but an apple for breakfast. \"Mommy don't you think you should eat more than that for breakfast?\" asked her daughter. Morgan blushed \"This will do. I've got to do something to stop this weight gain.\"   </span></div></div>",

Notwithstanding the ridiculous notion that your body has to be somehow altered in order to be good enough to wear what you want, then there's the pressure to buy into this ridiculous notion. And if regular harassment wasn't enough, then there's the added harassment of daring to go out in revealing clothing when your body isn't one other people think anyone should be proud of. Not everybody, mind you, but enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, Hana Salem found a way to have some fun with it. She loved exercise--almost as much as she loved good food--and loved the challenge that came with having a goal to reach before the first day of summer. At 5'7\" and a somewhat unstable 130 pounds, she was more on the muscular side by the time June came around. When she was younger, staying at that size was pretty easy, but now that Hana was in her late-20s, she noticed that it took just that little bit more work to get that trim figure. Still, that was the fun, wasn't it? The challenge of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here she was, the first day of summer, admiring herself in a two-piece swimsuit after a 3-month regimen of diet and exercise. Hana had to admit, she'd done an amazing job getting in shape this year, all things considered. Her long, shapely legs rippled with powerful muscle built from many, many hikes. Flexing her arms revealed statuesque biceps testifying to the hours spent lifting weights. She could even trace the beginnings of a six-pack on her abdomen, a first for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHana's phone vibrated to life with a text from Jasmine, with whom she had an engagement at the beach: \"ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't wait! Heading out soon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Hana began to gather up her things: her tote, her keys, the matching kimono for her swimsuit, her hat, and her sunglasses. A final glance at the mirror stopped her at the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt like a mighty superhero, having dedicated intense hours of commitment on the side in addition to making rent as a journalist for the big metropolitan paper in town--no easy feat, but well worth the pay off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled hungrily. Hana'd yet to have breakfast, and her mind jumped to thoughts of large ice cream cones and sweet colas--pleasures she had denied herself all spring. She placed a hand on her toned tummy and smiled. Sure, going to the gym and getting in shape was fun and all, but her favorite part of bikini season?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndoing all her hard work with a flood of calories.</span></div></div>",
