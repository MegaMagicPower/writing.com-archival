The vegetation starts to get thicker, and the noises around you seem to get louder.

At least it was sunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear your stomach grumble, and bite your lip, looking around to maybe find something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA banana! Oh, maybe your luck is turning around. You pick up the banana without thinking and quickly start to eat it, eager to satisfy your own hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was odd. This banana tasted funny, and there was definately an effect. You were shrinking. You look around helplessly, hoping to maybe, MAYBE find something that would reverse it, to no avail. You finally stop shrinking, buried under your clothes. You must be about 3 inches tall, you think. You run quickly, stark naked, hoping to find a shelter, possibly someone to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou burst from the bushes into a clearing, where there's a sign leading in two directions, both pointing towards houses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe left arrow has a tie around it, while the right arrow has a baseball cap on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere to go?</span></div></div>",

Every smell, every sound - even tasting his feet as you were slammed forward while trying to breathe.

Looking at you intensely, he grunted with a smirk, and dropped you on the ground. He then walked over to a pile of banana's hidden behind a couple boxes he had in the corner of his hut, clearly some sort of secret supply, as he had plenty of banana's over the rest of his hut. He then grabbed one of the banana's, and walked back over to you, causing ground shaking Thuds with each step, due to how small you were. Something told you, you were going to be getting some bananas, but there was definitely something to be feared by the sly grin on his face. Donkey Kong looked down at you, and then picked you up, and after opening the banana, abruptly shoved it in your mouth and forced you to chew on it. You try to draw back, as you start to feel really tingly and uncomfortable, but DK forces you to finish and eat the rest of the banana, as he howls laughter once you take the last bite. The tingling accelerates as you feel very motion sick, then looking up at Donkey Kong, and wondering why he was getting more blurry. Then you realized it, his toes weren't that much taller than you before, in fact you were roughly the size of them, but now, they were at least four times taller than you, and still growing. You were Shrinking! Again! That banana was similar to the one you had eaten the first time, that caused you to shrink to 3 inches, but now you had just eaten a full banana at the size of 3 inches... How small we're you going to get to this colossal hunk of an ape? His toes we're now at least 20 times your size, a couple crumbs of banana on the floor from when he forced you to eat the banana, are now challenging your size, as you rapidly shrink smaller. You might as well be a millimeter tall now, only getting smaller by the second, soon to be 1/4th of a millimeter, a 1/16th, 1/64th of a millimeter. A nearby ant walking by makes colossal stomps and you cant even see the head of it clearly, but that's when you remember the ape that shrunk you, as you look up, at the now mega-colossus who's sly grin you can't even see, while you've finally stopped Shrinking at the miniscule size of 1/128th of a millimeter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now nothing but a fleck of dust, or pretty much less, to the ape, you're truly nothing in his eyes. Donkey Kong had just about lost you once you shrunk below 1/16th of a millimeter, but he definitely knows exactly where you shrunk, and albeit he can't see you, he knows exactly where you are, and he definitely knows you can see him in all his hunky glory. Knowing this Donkey Kong looks over you, moving a single foot, and puts his toes on both sides of you, as your entire world shakes, causing you to fly up into the air and hit the ground with a crushing thud, when only a single one of his toes lightly touch the ground. Heck, the ant that was near you a bit ago was causing earth shaking tremors. Finally getting yourself together after the tremors have stopped, you look up at the toes surrounding you, feeling smaller than ever. You then look up further as everything past that point gets blurred massively due to your size, and you notice a gargantuan paw seemingly caressing a seemingly infinite tower, with two dangling balls, churning with excitement, all massively looming above your speck like self. Now, you truly feel insignificant. Donkey Kong moans, causing your entire world to shake once more, as he touches himself, fondling his balls, and dialating his excitable slit, as precum leaks out in plentiful amounts, all while you can only try your best to shield your wars from his godlike moans. At that moment when you have your ears covered and your eyes closed in fear, a massive object collides into you, landing right nearby, sending you flying seemingly miles, but in actuality you only actually flew 1/100th of a millimeter, as you land in what seems like a lake. Having been plunged really deep into the lake, you have to swim to the top, nearly running out of breath, only to realize that this lake is hundreds and hundreds of miles long. In actuality, Donkey Kong had merely squeezed his massive organ a little bit for his pleasure, causing the tiniest of drops of precum to rain down near you, nearly drowning you in it. While you tried to stay afloat, Donkey Kong finally decided to do something about you, after messing with his gargantuan penis for a short while. You look up to see a massive monkey finger coming down towards the lake you're stuck in, as the lake seems to be hardening with you in it, making it difficult for you to escape the incoming finger, even though the finger is easily millions of miles long to you. The finger makes impact and surprisingly you didn't get crushed to death and are instead swept up into the beyond redwood-like strands of finger fur, up to wherever your hunky Kong God wants you. From donkey kongs perspective, he simply had kneeled down, and swiped the small speck of pre off the floor, knowing very well it's exactly where you were, and proceeded to bring his finger up to his crotch, first scratching his enormous (by normal means) balls. As you held on for dear life in the infinite jungle that is the tip of his finger, Donkey Kong used his other hand to probe the tip of his cock, making it harden past anything he's ever reached before,oaning and howling of excitement, as he took his other hand to peel back his foreskin, teasing his enormous slit, as it winked back at him, leaking out some pre in return. Peeling open his hungry slit, He then looked directly at the finger he knew very well that you were on, giving you the biggest sly smirk you've ever seen, and proceeded to wipe the tip of his finger inside of the gurgling slit, as it winked with pleasure, happily accepting the microscopic snack he had just offered it. Feeling the tinge of pleasure from feeding you to his monster, Donkey Kong chuckled, as he fondled his dick more, knowing you were sloshing down his urethra, soon to be having a bath in the sweet nectar within his monstrous balls.</span></div></div>",

Slowly, he held out one finger - gently butting it into your chest until you grabbed onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis prompted... a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLeading to him tossing you in the air.  The terrifying moment of freefal was culminated by him snatching you mid-jump, hanging onto a beam with his other hand.  With a swing, he did a full aerial backflip before grabbing hold of the next beam, followed by plopping down on the second story of the smallish building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIf it hadn't been for the absolute terror with each of these motions, it actually would've been pretty cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe gave you an uncomfortably large grin as he set you down.

Walking his fingers towards you, he held out his pointer.  You clutched it before it could butt into you - in which he hoisted, just a little, extending another.

When you get your bearings finally, you find yourself face to face with the gargantuan ape, his eyes seeming to focus on you, but he wasn't, he was more focused on his current food. without hesitation, he begins to unpeel the fruit, and a thought goes through your head that you'll be safe, you have to come off of the banana with the peel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe banana's core itself holds you in place, and is pulled over your shoulders and head, leaving you stuck to the sweet-smelling fruit. You look up to see him open his mouth, and enter a state of panic. You try everything within your power to grab his attention. Flailing your arms, yelling as loud as you can, and nothing seems to work. a shadow overcasts above, and you realize he has already wrapped his mouth around the banana, and yourself, closing his lips and teeth to take the bite that sealed your fate. He doesn't chew right off the bat, he just lets the chunk of fruit sit on his tongue, savoring the flavor of it. The sheer humidity and volume of the saliva inside his mouth allows you to slip from your fruity prison, and lay on the tongue. You try to stand and get your bearings, the tongue twitching below you, and throwing you off balance. Finally, you manage to stand and jump from the tongue, next to one of his teeth. You grip onto the flesh that you can, holding tight as he chews the slippery fruit. You felt that you might be able to survive this, but without warning, his tongue darts around, pulling up bits of the fruit that fell to his teeth, and you with it. His teeth stop for a moment and you felt somewhat safe, but with one fluid motion, his tongue raises to the roof of his mouth and tilts back. You claw at the tongue, the slippery texture of the banana causing it to fail. You slip into the black abyss of his throat, the pulsing muscles there pulling you down, despite your struggle. You feel your legs move into a humid, hot chamber, that you can only assume is his stomach, where the acids were already taking hold of the fruit itself, dissolving it into nearly nothing. You pound on the stomach walls, kicking and scratching to hopefully get his attention one last time, but nothing happened. The lack of air quickly took hold of you, the last vision you remember seeing was the churning muscles of his stomach, grinding you into mush.</span></div></div>",

One of the brown and white furred fox's hands then slowly begins to lower towards you once he had kept on going with, \"Anyway Wolf, could you please leave. I want to take my shower now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself looking from Fox hand over to the gray and white furred wolf who still standing in the doorway. Now the question was did Fox grab you in time to get both of you into the bathroom without Wolf noticing you? Or did Wolf see you and take you away from Fox?</span></div></div>",

Fox pulled the shower curtain back and walked in, before squatting down. You were then placed between his large feet before he turned the water on and stood up to be blasted by the warm water. You looked up in awe at the towering body of orange fur. Water cascaded down Fox's body making him look like a god with all the water running between his pecs, over the abs, and falling over his penis like a waterfall. Little water hit your body as you were directly under Fox's balls and casted in thier shadow. You soon moved over to his ankle and started to drench yourself all while taking glances up at Fox scrubbing his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon heard a THUMP! Looking over, you saw the soap bar Fox was using had been dropped between his feet. You looked up as Fox squated down, making his legs bulge and the member draw closer to you.

The pilot started by grabbing some 80 pound dumbells, sitting on a bench and placing you on his thigh. Fox started lifting the dumbells, making his biceps bulge and letting out a large breath. You looked up in awe as the veins pulsed in his muscles and sweat dripped down his  forehead and into the crevice of his pecs. He slowed down a little, showing some exhaustion. You smiled thinking of an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Fox!\", you yelled causing him to look down at you. \"I'll give you a kiss if you can do ten more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green eyes widened before narrowing in determination. Fox began to rapidly lift the weights, bulging his biceps even more and releasing deep grunts.

Scooping you up, you walked over to his lips and kissed the top lip.

The lips tenderly massaged you and blew the hot breath from his maw onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling away, Fox smiled and nuzzled you. \"Thanks little guy, now I think we should get some rest.

The pecs lightly squeezed you, not in a painful way but as if they were giving you a hug. This coupled with the large heartbeat beneath really made you feel protected and reminded of just how big Fox was to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm fur and rhythmic heartbeat started to lull you to sleep. \"Good night Fox......I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you dozed off, you felt the pecs apply a little more pressure and heard Fox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too little guy.\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up as you felt the pecs shifting. As you opened your eyes, you saw Fox's furry fingers reaching into his pecs before he gently plucked you out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, Fox placed you on his soft right palm. The vulpine rubbed his eyes as he smiled at you. \"*yawn* good morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed the grogginess out of your eyes before greeting him as well. Standing up from the bed Fox made his way towards the bathroom, holding you in front of his strong chest. As he entered, Fox began tugging down the boxers again, soon releasing his manhood and butt. Using his large foot paws, Fox kicked open the hamper and tossed his undergarments in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were placed on the shower floor and were greeted to the sight of Fox looming over with his muscles casting shadows. As the water poured down, you both washed up and got to watch Fox flex his muscles to clean them fully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower soon ended and when Fox squatted down turn off the water, he was a little to forward. This resulted in you being right under his balls as he brought his honking body down, watching in fascination as the testicles stopped a few feet above you. The large white balls rose with Fox and you tried shaking off your blush as the pilot scooped you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drying off, Fox walked back into his room and placed you on the bed with your clothes. As you dressed, your eyes glanced over to Fox as he got ready. The vulpine had put on his signature Star Fox outfit, the green pants hugged his bulge and butt. His shirt beneath the jacket was low enough to where his pecs where visible and tight enough to show his abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting on his boots, Fox walked over to let you walk onto his palm. Sitting on the fingerless gloved paw Fox carried you to the door of the room before explaining where he had to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it?</span></div></div>",

The leader was eager for you to meet his team but he didn't want to suddenly surprise the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Fox your back!\", Falco smiled as he walked up to his vulpine friend.

All his team was looking at him as if he was about to make a proclamation, which granted he would. Soon slippy let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I can't wait, Falco said you have a boyfriend!\", Slippy exclaimed in a excited manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox felt his jaw drop before looking at his avian friend with a irritated look.

You blinked as you adjusted to the light and looked in shock as the three members of Star Fox looked down at you in surprise. Clearing your throat, you stood up on the fingerless glove and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....hello my name is _____ and I'm the one dating.....Fox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a awkward silence as you looked up at the three towering anthros. Falco suddenly bend down and looked at you, his beak sitting a few feet away. The avian suddenly grinned before rising again and throwing his arms over his chest again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never knew you were into short guys Fox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox looked in surprise before groaning as he took in the joke made. This seem to bring a flow back as Slippy and Peppy looked at each other before offering you a friendly look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was then explained, how Fox found you and took care of you and started a relationship. You kept out the parts of knowing that this is a video game world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then ____ welcome aboard!\", Peppy said giving you a finger to shake. Slippy offered you a webbed finger as well and Falco simply gave a massive high five that was gentle for your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlippy decided that he could help you clothing wise and ran off almost tripping over a discarded object. After a little bit of getting to know everyone, the toad returned with a assortment of tiny clothes in one hand and a ray gun in the other. The ray gun was a newly constructed shrink ray now able to make clothes fit. Fox decided to head back to his room for now and let you get situated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nYou stood on Fox's palm dressed in you're new clothes. A black shirt with a red jacket and brown pants, everything had noticeable extra space as you didn't have muscle to fill them like Fox. Bringing you to his face, Fox pressed a light kiss and smiled.

Falco sent a knowing smile as he saw the two of you leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter flying for a while, in which Fox placed you between his thighs on his seat. You felt a blush as looking behind you was the clothed bulge and above it was the wall of muscles. Soon Fox arrived in Corneria and brought you to the top of his pecs and smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright little guy, I'm gonna put you in my pecs to keep you safe ok?\", you nodded and blushed as Fox put you in his shirt and pressed you between his large pectorals. The firm muscles applied enough pressure to hold you but not hurt you. You smiled as your boyfriend's heartbeat surrounded you along with his furry muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox soon made his way to the hotel in question and tried to hide the blush forming as he felt your tiny body snuggling into his chest. After obtaining his room key, Fox arrived in his room and put his bag down. Taking off his jacket and shirt to expose his torso, Fox slowly pulled you out of his large pecs and placed you on the nightstand.

The blush on your face darkened as you hurriedly stripped and pulled on your swin trunks which were orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the bathroom door opening alerted you that Fox was done, but turning around you gawked at the sight. Fox had changed into his swimwear, which was a green speedo. Not only was Fox's buff torso shown but also his large thighs and toned legs with his bulge looking more prominent. As he went to grab a towel you saw his firm cheeks popped out as the speedo went up his crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the nightstand, Fox's bulge was right in front of you and his face was slightly covered by his furred pecs. Scooping you into his palm, Fox threw the towel over his shoulder as he made his way out of the room. Making his way through the halls you couldn't help but face the strong chest that lightly bounced with each step the giant made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside a large beach stretched out for miles. There were a few other Cornerians but they were far away enjoying the beach, so you and Fox could enjoy each other in private. Laying his towel on a chair, Fox brought his hulking form on the chair and placed you on his right pec. Placing his paws behind his head, Fox hummed and relaxed and crossed his feet at the ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relaxed against the firm and furry ground as you viewed the abs, bulge, and large feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was next?</span></div></div>",

But those thoughts were pushed a bit to the back of his mind however, upon seeing the human was now on his last rows of abs. And just knowing that he was so close to his speedo covered bulge caused the anthro fox to become \"excited\" which caused the front part of his speedo to raise up into the air a bit. He then had an idea of how to handle this. But first he had to get his tiny lover's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found the blush on your face become a dark shade of red upon seeing Fox's member as it began to harden. However, your attention was quickly brought all the way back up to the anthro fox's face when he heard him let out a light chuckle when he told you, \"Well little guy, it seems like feeling you move about my body turn me on. Heck, even having you just sitting on my body causes this to happen to me.\" You then saw him lift one of his huge arms as rubbed the back of his head with a hand before he went on with, \"But I think I know how we can take care of this problem though. But to do this I think you and I should head......</span></div></div>",

Maybe relieve ourselves a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head and rubbed your blushing face, memories of your showers with Fox and getting intimate with him was always a exciting yet overwhelming feeling. Seeing Fox's smile and flexing muscles made a shock of arousal hit you, much like the vulpine your swim trunks started to feel tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buff mercenary grabbed his towel and soon stood up, the green clothed bulge twitched as Fox gained a thinking face and gave a small smile over his pecs at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little guy would it be alright if.....I brought you back to the room in my speedo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened as you looked over the ledge of the palm to see the prominent bulge, resting beneath the firm abs. The green speedo looked to be stretched over the manhood and let a small bush of crotch fur peak. You felt yourself getting turned on by seeing a reminder of just how much bigger Fox was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, looking up and nodding at your giant boyfriend. Fox's face lit up as he grinned, he quickly pressed you to his warm and furry pec and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks babe, I'm really glad to have you.\", Fox warmly spoke as his powerful heartbeat echoed from his large chest. You giggled as you leaned your head against the soft yet firm muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling you away, Fox glanced around to make sure to one was looking. Reaching down the pilot pulled the waistband of his tight speedo forward. Fox's semi erect penis was still laying on his large balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox smiled at you before lowering the palm carrying you. You watched as you asked the numerous creme furred abs, soon hovering above the opening. The way of bodily heat hit you along with the scent of Fox's manhood. Using a finger, the vulpine lifted up his member and slowly slid your tiny body in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around in awe, Fox placed you on his large and squishy testicles. Your body shuffled around a bit as the balls were much like a pair of large musky beanbags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox rubbed your head with his soft finger before releasing his penis. The member loomed over you as it was more erected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you comfy?\", Fox's voice boomed down concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore shouting, you leaned down and kissed the furry testicles. Fox's body quickly shifted as he felt a shiver run up his spine and his penis twitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep it's really nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox smiled as he closed the waistband, putting you in warm, musky darkness. The balls bounced beneath you as Fox's large thighs moved back in forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular anthro had a deep blush on his face as he felt your body shifted on his junk. Fox's tail swished excessively and his firm cheeks clenched as he felt more turned on by having his tiny boyfriend riding in his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relaxed and bit your lip as you felt more aroused with each step Fox took. Surrounding you was not only his manly musk but also the noises of his body. The sounds of his stomach and even faint traces of a heartbeat. All contributions to the expanding penis above, light started to peek in as Fox's member pushed more against the speedo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox was slightly panting as he reached the room, his muscles were clenched and sweat started to drip down his large biceps and in between his abs. Holding such high arousal was putting his body in increased ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked into the room, Fox quickly pulled his speedo down, feeling it peel off his manhood and slid out from his butt. Now fully nude, Fox looked passed his muscles and couldn't see you as his now standing penis blocked you. He felt you sitting on his testicles still and carefully climbed onto the bed. The buff vulpine leaned against the front of the bed and bend his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox plucked you from his balls and set you in front of them, standing in the shadow of his tower penis. You pulled off your swim trunks and kicked them aside, now fully nude as your boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as you could see Fox's face behind the member. \"That was a really fun ride babe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant chuckled and grinned. \"Yeah it was, you felt really good down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing you rubbed your head as Fox stretched his thighs, giving a view of his firm cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was kinda thinking we could have some fun like we did in the shower. Whatever you want I'm sure it will feel good for the both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned as you looked at Fox's impressive assets. Making up your mind you.......</span></div></div>",

I want to go between your two huge buttcheeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, sounds interesting, babe.\" Fox replied back, before you saw him turn around on the bed untiol he was laying on his stomach like what you had asked of him. After doing this you saw his tail sway from side to side along with his cheeks as he moved his hips and added, \"All yours, little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the giant anthro fox had done this you made your way to the huge cheeks that were light brown for the most part expect for the inner parts of them which was cream in color. And once youhad reached them you slowly pushed your way into them which wasn't aht difficult to do due to the vast size difference between you and Fox. Although after you got between his cheeks you felt both of them lightly clench around you as you heard Fox moan out in pleasure. Hearing this caused you to blush as you reached out and rubbed each one of his cheeks and then kissed them which only seemed to make Fox moan out even louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was made clear when he muttered out, \"O-Oh, this is truly something different for me, babe. But I think I might like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAGain this comment only made you smile more and blush more as you rubbed each cheek until you reached his huge hole. You then swallowed a lump in your throat and reach out to it until your hunads were touching it. Once this happened you again felt the vupline's cheeks clench around you again as he groaned out in pleasure again. However, after doing this two options came to your head. The first was an obvious one due to your location. That being that you push yourself into Fox's tail hole. Surely doing this would make him shoot his load in no time. On the other hand you had a feeling that he'd feel both embarrassed/nervous if he made a mess out of ht bed sheets. Sure he could clean them, but with all of the anthros heightened sense of smell they'd know he did something inappropriate in no time. so the second option was to crawl out of his cheeks and maybe have him do something else that would not only give you both pleasure, but prevent him from making a mess on the hotel's bed sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so after taking some time to think it over you decided to.....</span></div></div>",

You wanted to give you giant boyfriend the best pleasure so maybe you could find out a way to avoid embarrassing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Fox! Is there a towel or anything around you?\", you shouted from the deep butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox opened his eyes as a blush adorned his face, the vulpine glanced to the side to see a small towel on the nightstand the anthro reached out and grabbed it before looking over his shoulder at his butt. \"Ye-yeah little guy i have one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You put it under your legs, just a clean up precaution!\", you said. The cheeks lightly clenched you as Fox lifted up his toned legs before sliding the towel under his thighs, his erected penis settled on top and twitch as Fox felt your tiny hands once again rub his warm cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling now that everything was ready you were ready to pleasure your boyfriend. While you never had sex you did have a few thoughts on how to prepare Fox. While your size might make this tough, you be damned if you were gonna back down. Getting close to the tailhole, you stuck your tongue out and ran it across the pink ring. A loud gasp of pleasure came from above as Fox let out a hot breath at the sudden wetness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox had his head resting on his folded buff arms as he panted. The vulpine felt your tongue gently rubbed against his puckered hole, feeling it softened and open slightly. The muscles of the buff anthro tightened as you suddenly slipped your arm into the tailhole and made Fox bit his lip as he felt his anal walls being slowly penetrated, he felt his anal walls lightly clench as you inserted your second arm, filling his tailhole more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt sweat drip from your forehead as Fox's body heat began to increase as you stuffed your arms into the warm hole. Slowly, you began to stick your head into the hole, widening it even more as you smelt the musk of Fox's crotch infiltrate his butt. You pulled yourself more into the hot tunnel, making it squelch as the anal walls lightly squeezed you in a hug of sorts. The feeling of pleasure was high in both Fox and you, your penis was erect and twitching as the furry cheeks clenched them from the outside. You grunted as you had trouble getting your legs into the tailhole as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading your mind, Fox reached a paw around and rubbed his rear. \"B..babe do you neeOOoooHhh!....help?\", Fox moaned out as he felt you wiggling in his semi tight hole. You licked the warm pink walls getting a deep pleasured growl, Fox panted as he felt precum started to drip from his hard cock. Taking a finger, Fox reached deep into his big butt going past his warm cheeks until he felt your tiny legs. Fox moaned as he gently pushed you further in to where you where fully in thr tailhole and the entrance squelched closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox's face had a deep red bar as he growled a hot breath and felt you squirm deeper into him and spread his anal walls more. \"Ah baby...please harder!\", the vulpine moaned as he began to hump to bed and feel shocks of ecstasy shoot throughout his buff body. Fox took heavy breaths as he tightly gripped the pillow case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panted as after a bit of manoeuvring you managed to grab hold of your penis. The anal walls squelched and seem to kiss you as they heated you up and heard Fox's pleasured moans. As you masterbated, your repeated movements stimulated Fox more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally with you stretching his hole once more, Fox let out a loud moan as his load shot out over the towel and dripped down onto his balls. On cue you felt you cumed as fell and panted as your semen leaked out. Fox felt his body relax as his large muscles relaxed and felt your warm cum fill and leak out of his tail hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing his cheeks, Fox let out a long moan as he felt you sliding out of his hole. You panted as you were once again between the firm and soft cheeks. You were soon lifted up with Fox's fingers pulling you out of his butt. Bringing you to his snout, Fox gave you a big kiss before licking up the cum around your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you little guy...that was amazing.\", Fox warmly smiled as he nuzzled you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned as you hugged the warm snout. \"I love you Fox.\" , you were soon set on the pillow and watched as Fox's beautiful green eyes looked at your small form. \"I love you too babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon....</span></div></div>",

You could feel the warmth and heartbeat thump slightly louder as Fox seem to be on guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf rose an eyebrow with and amused grin, putting his hands on his hips. \"Hello to you to Mccloud, you sure know how to greet someone.\", the buff anthro flexed his buff bicep as he reached up and rubbed his neck. \"And to answer your question i decided to take a vacation as well. Call it coincidence but the receptionist gave me a heads up you were staying here as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall muscular Wolf then walked in past Fox. \"So i decided to give a visit.

It was certainly a good welcome don't get him wrong. \"I didn't think you want to greet me, certainly didn't get that impression the past few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf sighed crossing his buff grey furred arms. \"Look pup i know i might seem like i don't care, but I'm glad for you. I'm glad you seem to be in higher spirits since meeting this new boyfriend. I'm just not good at being mushy positive you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox smiled as he nodded, taking a seat across from his rival. \"Yeah, i do feel better.

But.. i feel more rejuvenated and ready to engage in the smash tournaments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf chuckled, patting the vulpine's shoulder. \"That's the spirit!

Should he show you to Wolf? The StarWolf leader wasn't a threat but who's to say he doesn't mock him. Feeling the heartbeat become faster you wanted to reassure Fox it was ok to show you. Placing your hands on the firm pec wall you started to rub it in a comforting manner, feeling the soft fur above the buff muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox felt your rubbing, he soon flushed and smiled as he understood your attempts to provide comfort. \"Oh um he's with us right now.\", Fox said getting Wolf to raise an eyebrow confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlexing his buff chest, Fox reached in and gently plucked you out before setting you on his warm palm. Wolf blinked and widened his eyes as he saw you. \"Wait that's your boyfriend? Heh didn't think you be the big guy in the relationship.\", the grey furred wolf chuckled before holding out a finger to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you cub, the names Wolf O'donnell. Heard you were making this pup happy.\", you nodded and smiled before grabbing your finger with both hands to shake it. \"It's nice to meet you to Wolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf grinned as he saw you standing before wiggling his eyebrows. \"I take it then that you two must have gotten intimate, considering i visit when you aren't exactly dressed Mccloud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox flushed. \"W-wolf! Ok we cuddle and maybe got a little close but still don't tease me!\", the vulpine said not angry like before, just in a more embarrassed way from the teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf chuckled as he stood up, looking down at you the anthro bounced his huge pecs. \"Remember to help your boyfriend work out little guy, i know you'd enjoy getting hugged by these muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as you imagined Fox's already huge body getting even buffer. Not to mention all the workout sessions between his warm and glorious features.

After doing this though he then carefully washed you next, and once you were both dried off and had put a change of clothes he made some breakfast for himself. Of course he also made sure to cut you a little bit of what he made for you too, even if the pieces were close to filling you up before you could finish it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you did do just that and as Fox cleaned the dishes you couldn't help but stare at your giant anthro fox boyfriend as he was wearing a pair of workout shorts that was hugging his large backside and bulge in front.

The vulpine brought you to his face and nuzzled you with his soft snout. \"Wow this is great little guy, i was worried i have to hide you my whole workout!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as you hugged the snout of your giant boyfriend. \"Yeah for sure, but i wouldn't mind if i spent the whole trip here in your pecs. Just as long as I'm near you hehe.\", you sheepishly chuckled <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox flushed before smiling warmly and giving a small yet large gentle kiss. \"Thank you so much...um do you want to spend the workout in my chest?\", the vulpine asked rubbing your body soothingly with his padded finger. You sighed as your back and chest were massaged, shaking your head you focused. \"Well maybe later i could chill out there, but i think for now given the chance i wanna see how you build those lovely muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding happily, Fox set you on his warm palm and held you level with his numerous abs. \"That is true so far when i worked out you were hidden, I'd be happy to show you love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to a long bench with a bar weight the vulpine hummed before nodding and swinging a toned leg over the bench. Setting his rump down, Fox slowly layed down and positioned himself under the weight, making sure to keep you steady. You were then set between Fox's pec mountains and his hill of abs, his scent rose off the fur covered body making you feel calm yet excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox took a breath before grabbing the bar, along his large muscular torso he could heel your tiny form sitting. Smiling, Fox grunted as he puffed out his chest and huge biceps, beginning to lifted the weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked in awe as your environment shifted. Fox's pecs began to bounce with each lift and grunt, you could see in the distance his orange furred biceps flexing as they lifted.

They won't save you in battle.\" He rubs the shirt in his fingers. \"They won't even help you with the cold...\" Marth walks forward with a look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ike, you have extra clothes, help him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIke turns and glares at Marth, letting go of your shirt in the process. \"No I don't. You have more clothes than all the princess' in this bloody county. YOU help him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No YOU!\"<br>\r\n\"NO YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and shake your head. They're from different games but they fight just like Roy and Marth do.

The most help you'll get out of him is sleeping on a straw mat and him rambling on about his swordmanship...\" Ike laughs and he 'Grr's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like he'd get that from you, mister 'I like to comb my hair every three hours!~'\" Ike puts a arm around your shoulders and laughs as Marth screams, \"I DO NOT!\" Once out of the room Ike winks at you and says, \"Don't worry kid, my room is the hottest one there is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's comforting...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in Ike's room you see the bed that was only meant for one and enough room to put another. About six feet from his bed there's a fireplace that looks like it was lit many times before. Other than the numerous piles of clothes around the room it seemed like a normal castle room. \"I can sleep on the floor near the fireplace, you take the bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure? I'm sure I can use a few blankets and extra pillows to make a makeshift bed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, Chivalry and all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. So you'll show me how to get out of here tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIke smirks and nods, a slight look in his eyes.  \"Yep. But if you're stuck here, maybe I can show you some sword skills!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiiiiiiigggghhhhttttt....\" You roll your eyes and take off your shoes. Ike raises an eyebrow as he takes off his. \"Not even chainmail underlayings...Man you'd die so quickly on the battlefield.\" You groan from that comment as you lay down and get comfortable in the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up with something breathing on you. Reaching for the covers you stop short when you feel skin where the bed should be. A slight chuckle confirms that something is up and you slowly open your eyes. All you see is fingers with a good 15 feet drop to the bed and slowly turning around you nearly jump off from an overly large Ike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go to your room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes grow wide and heart about to rip out of your chest. \"Wh - WHAT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know a little magic also, and since you agreed to go to my room. I said it was the hottest there is...or did you not get the inuendo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DIDN'T GET THE INUENDO!\", you scream at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence before Ike hmmmed. \"Well I already got you shrunken. Too bad!~\" His hand moves to dump you in his mouth but Gym's teachings kick in and you hop out before it even tilts. A little quick zip-lining down the bed's blanket got you to the floor. \"HEY! Get back here!\" He starts towards you but something stops him and he falls foward. You run to the side and barely miss him, but as soon as the sucessful 'Clonk' of his head rang the floor vibrated and you fell on your butt. You gulp and turn around, sighing heavily since the 'Clang' meant he was knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for how long?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis room's door was high enough for you to sneak under and run to the, apperantly only one sane in this castle, Marth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how fast can you run? There was that long trek home from the game store and THAT took you a good half an hour. If Ike woke up before that you were as good as 'man food'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second's thought made you...</span></div></div>",

One to breath and the other to make sure Ike didn't pull anything. After a few seconds Ike groaned and rubbed the bump on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that little...when I find him he's gunna get it so bad...\" He got up on his feet and looked around the room. He groaned and started scattering the piles of clothes close to where he knocked out. Once all the piles were scattered he grabbed all of them and made one huge pile, one that would squish anything under it. He lifted the bottom and once there was no blood he sighed and put it back down. You ducked in deeper to the pile when he got on his knees and started looking under his bed and dresser. When he found nothing but dustbunnies he sighed and looked around again, this time sitting down. That's when he noticed the door, and how high it was from the ground. \"Aw great...now he probably ran to Marth. Geeze I'm going to hear it from him...\" He got up and walked out of sight. The door then opened and closed but knowing better you stayed under the pile of clothes. Which was short lived since the pile was lifted from above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as you got into poise to sprint away Ike grabbed you and huffed. \"Thought you could get away, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, heh heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was going to be nice and treat you while you were in there but now you can rot in there for all I care. The only way you're gunna get out now is if I puke, which is one in a million chance.\" He smirked and practically threw you into his mouth. You were shaking about as much as a frozen person and him rolling you around in his mouth helped not that much. Once you were soaked to the bone in his saliva he tilted his head back and gulped, making you go into the throat, but not all the way down. You tried to wiggle to get free but a rubbing outside told you that all you were was a play toy. Another gulp made the throat muscles push you down into his waiting stomach, and new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;center&gt;\"Eyaaaaahhhhh!\" -Splat!-&lt;/center&gt;<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The walk to his room is silent till he gets to a certain door and opens it with a,\"TA DA!\" The room was fairly large and the bed was big enough for two to sleep comfortably. A quick look around you point to the clothes chest and Marth gives you a look. \"Alright, yes I have more clothes than I need but i'm a pack rat!\" He goes over to the chest and raises a small T-shirt. \"I keep all my clothes, kinda like mementoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, now I get it.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarth nods and puts away the vest shirt. He gets up and starts searching around for a potion of sorts. \"Listen, this'll make you warm for a whole night and knock you out in the process! I've used it god knows how many times when I'm stressed out.\" He hands you the near empty bottle and after swirling it a little you put it down on the bed table next to you. Marth comes out from a second room in all blue Pj's and sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, the one thing I don't have are extra sleeping garments. Can you sleep in your clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, not like I haven't done it before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarth gets into his side of the bed and takes a shot of the liquid and quickly fell asleep.

As you lied in the bed wondering how the hell it works you conk out instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, Oh god, Oh god...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan and reach for the pillow to cover your head.

You look up at Marth who is near to fainting, and also...larger than what he was last. 'Course being half awake your mind didn't register it. \"What's wrong? I don't feel any mutations...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You - you've shrunk that's what!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in your brain clicked and you started to panic too. \"WHAT THE HELL MAN!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. The sleeping potion always worked fine on me! You sure you're from this land?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! I clicked some stinkin option of joining you guys here and then there was these congas and then I tapped some sign with a castle and I was here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarth 'umm'ed while biting on of his fingers, on his other hand. \"Um, now here's the problem. If I'm correct the potion will run off if you take another one and that's on the otherside of the castle. The only thing is if it's not there I need to go get more from a witch in the forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-How predictable...- you think as you roll your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only other thing is Ike knows some magic. I think he can reverse it. If not you have to go with me to get the potion and such. The only problem there is that I don't have pockets and the whole castle will be up in arms if I'm carrying a little person in my hands...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Hide me in that cape of yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't, The cape doesn't exactly stick to my armor. One wrong move and you could fall to your death if my reflexes don't kick in properly. What I have to do is...um, eat you. But I can 'Pop' you back out with ease! You won't be stuck in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panic at 'Eat'. \"YOU MEAN YOU HAVE TO STICK ME IN YOUR MOUTH AN-mph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarth silenced you with a finger. \"Yes, but as I said I can pop you out. That means that I can take you back out with having to puke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hmph and think for a few seconds. If you go with Marth you'll get the inside tour, no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with Ike it'd just be a quick travel and you'll be back to normal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marth I...\"</span></div></div>",

If you don't pop me out then I'll do it for you...\" Marth chuckled nervously as he opened his hand and you crawled onto it. It was a few seconds of hesitation before he rose his hand to be level with his face. He sighed and said, \"I'm just as nervous as you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear ya...\" you say in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally put you in his mouth and the un-easyness was everywhere. You look around, trying to distract yourself what was about to happen, and notice that there was nothing stuck in his teeth and that for a medieval time he had good dental. When you were about to compliment him, Marth finally got the nerve and started to get you slippery. After a minuet of not knowing what was up and what was down he tipped back his head. The saliva around you did nothing to keep you there and down you slid till Marth's throat muscles were notified you were there. You yelped from the sudden clenching of your ankles together as the muscles pulled you down. Marth gagged for a second then gulped hard again, sending you practically all the way down. He had to gulp again to make your head and shoulders go in. After that all it was, was a long minuet down with the walls rubbing against you, pushing you down. Once your feet could wiggle in the air you gulped and yelled as the esophagus let you go into the stomach. The floor was plusher than you thought as you landed smoothly. Still though, you got up shakily and looked around, noticing that the slight lack of clothes Marth had on let a red light in. After getting steady the air around you shifted, like if you stood under a large vaccum and had on lead shoes. Faster than a blink you were cold thanks to the outside air hitting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...outside air?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarth took you out and after shaking your head of spit he spoke, \"See, 'Pop'. Probably didn't even feel it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right...I didn't.\" One last shake of your head got it spit free enough that it wasn't leaking into your face when you looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now if you don't mind...\" Marth opened up his other hand to you and it took a few seconds before your brain clicked to 'Give sword'. Which you did and he put it on the table next to you. \"Now it's some time before we get to the potions room. Are you hungry?\"</span></div></div>",

Your stomach growled in hunger and a few minuets later Marth came in with a plate and cutlery. Once he put the plate down next to you, you launched at it and started attacking the eggs. \"HEY! At least have some...\" Marth looked at the fork and then back to you attacking the food. \"Argh...they really need to make smaller cutlery.\" He put down the extra fork and knife and started to nudge you over so he could cut his half of the eggs. It took only 5 minutes after Marth started for both of you to clean the plate. He put the napkin on the plate to stop you from picking up crumbs. \"You know you're going to be in there with food now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't be as bad as puke...\" Marth opened his hand and slowly you crawled onto it. He didn't waste any time as he put you in his mouth and gulped. Once in the stomach you landed on a pile of eggs and Marth tapped the wall to make sure you were okay. After you gave the 'okay' the room started to move hecticly. Once it stops all you think is could he at least warn you next time he has to get dressed? The movement slowed down to a sort of swaying; like if in a hammock and the wind is at the right speed or your friend started to push it. Needless to say, it was pretty soothing. After a while you felt your eyes get heavy and to dreamland you went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to be woke up by a loud pounding noise. Startled you fumble untill you got upright and balanced. Once fully up you breathe in deeply and yell out, \"WHAT!?\" The air shifted again and soon you were on a table again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't find the potion, so i'm thinking it's shrunken so your size can find it.

If you were a threat they would've taken care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked up to you and offered his hand. \"My name's Pit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake his hand and offer your name as well. Then you ask, \"So what is this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPit gestures around the room and said, \"This is the Temple of Palutena, my goddess. She rules over Skyworld and I'm her loyal follower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't there anyone else here?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Palutena doesn't appear often.\" Pit said. \"And the centurions keep to themselves. It can get a little lonely actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're starting to feel sorry for the guy. You decide to stay for awhile and keep him company. He smiles at you and says, \"If you're planning on staying you should probably get some different clothes on. You'll stick out if you wear those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agree and Pit leads you to a room. It contained a bed, a desk, and a dresser, a mirror hanging over the dresser. It was a simple enough room and Pit said, \"Take what you need out of the dresser. I'll come back in a few minutes, I've just got to go check something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he closes the door and leaves you to get dressed. You pull open the dresser and pull out the same outfit Pit was wearing. You strip out of your old clothes and put these on instead. They were smooth and airy, allowing for a lot of free movement. Since Pit hadn't come back yet, you decided to look around for awhile. Pulling open the desk drawer you find two things. One, is a badge with the bow and arrow emblem reversed. You assume this will take you back into the darkness to find a different area to visit. The other item is a bottle of some kind. You open it and sniff it. It smells nice, and you're feeling rather thirsty. So, what do you want to do?</span></div></div>",

The music is loud, the colors are flying, and the main title appears! Upon looking through the main screen, you see a strange option, the option of \"Join the game\". You click this option, curious as to it's purpose. A bright light flashes from the screen, and you cover your eyes, unable to avoid the inevitable blackout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken in a daze, looking around you, to see a strange door, labeled with words you can barely make out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill you survive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((This is entirely M/M, sorry if you like girls, but please, don't add that. I will delete, unless I'm convinced It's a good chapter. Things I don't want to see: Gore, Chewing, Blood, Racial Slurs, scat, and watersports. Other than that, there can be feet, digestion, NC/Rape, Sex, Shrinking (Please!). Enjoy!</td>",
