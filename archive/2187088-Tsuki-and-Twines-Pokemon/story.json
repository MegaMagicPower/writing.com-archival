He had taken Umbreon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side in hopes that a petty confrontation could settle without much disturbance. Once, just once he intervened, and there lay a long-lasting friendship for years. Umbreon had settled close to Charizard, deeming him as his best friend, and, frankly, only one. The only one around, anyway. The rest of his friends seemed to have faded out of his memory. Umbreon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s old friends, not from grief, or anger, but simply a memory of when he was an Eevee. Charizard and Umbreon had been sharing a room for some time now, at least a year.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard however didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find himself in the same boat. Umbreon was his only friend, his first and ever. His compulsive unnerving from not being around Umbreon edged him want to be there whenever Umbreon needed something. Charizard would be right behind him, and above, a towering dragon with his large frame and threatening posture. When he entered the room, it was made apparent that Charizard would seriously maim you if you as much as pinched Umbreon. Whether or not he was the reason for Umbreon not making too many friends was never up for debate. His little friend always looked to be talking with someone, given that someone would likely be glancing at Charizard every once in a while, because sure enough Charizard would be doing the same.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite Umbreon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best efforts, he could not seem to anger Charizard unless it was entirely indirect. Part of Umbreon believed that even if he bit Charizard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tail that the dragon, instead of turning around and flaming the dark-type, would try to ram into the Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon sitting across the room. The only thing about Charizard that made Umbreon feel off was if someone had been particularly rude to him, for some reason they would not be seen again. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as if Umbreon really wanted to see them again anyway, but just that it was awkward to stumble upon Charizard shortly after, when the dragon was obviously trying to hide something. Namely a bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Umbreon was sure a looker. Charizard craved for anything from that dark-type. A nudge\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 a brush against his flesh\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 a gentle grope\u00e2\u20ac\u201d or a rub\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 a swipe of Umbreon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tongue\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 he longed to feel his little friend. At times where Umbreon and Charizard had separate places to be, Umbreon at the Berry Center or Charizard at his own job, Charizard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brain was always on the Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon he had helped so long ago. Else, Charizard would be off in the distance, eyes twitching with lust, the rising pit of pleasure rising from his gut, the wondrous sensation he imagined it would be to finally get Umbreon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s red-faced, half-groggy returned stare while laying on soft sheets of their shared room. He always wondered if Umbreon felt the same way\u00e2\u20ac\u201d he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d not asked\u00e2\u20ac\u201d but he hoped from the slight rosiness from Umbreon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheeks when he was near that his presence did turn something on in the Umbreon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard was lucky enough to get his massive body in the room Umbreon slept without making noise, save for the flickering of his tail. He loved to tease himself by placing his tapered penis close to Umbreon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face or rear when either were visible without covers. Charizard would grow hungry though, and go out, finding something to eat\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 or someone if he was really turned on that night\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 yet, his balls did ache more often than he wanted too. Charizard could always empty them, but filling them? <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Umbreon woke up one morning with a slight twitch to his nose, Charizard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gut dropped when he realized it was his own pre, but the moonlight Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon never noticed because of early-morning drowsiness, and proceeded to wash up in the shower. Days after it became an issue. Charizard unintentionally left more and more on the Umbreon every night, causing the dark-type to scratch his body more often than usual. Charizard wondered if Umbreon ever thought of it. Did Umbreon just shrug it off as it just being Charizard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scent rubbing off on him? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been happening for the past two weeks, up to now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The duo were walking together into their home. They had gotten to split the rent by a one in a million chance, and it was the best thing to happen to both of them in the past year. The house was only a block away, and Charizard had been on edge that whole two mile trek from Umbreon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workplace and the house, dreading over Umbreon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible reactions to his request\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Charizard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s request to mate. He planned on asking Umbreon when they were settled inside\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but his nervous sweating didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help at all when Umbreon was occasionally glancing up at him.</div></font></span><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Original</i></div></span></div></div>",

It was quite clear he had something on his mind, but he dare not ask. He never was the one to coax others to express their bottled up emotion, even if it was his closest friend, though Umbreon had to admit, Charizard's nervousness was definitely beginning to take a toll on him. Nothing like a nervous, sweating, fire dragon eight times your size to leave one feeling uneasy regardless of how close of friends they were. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Umbreon let loose a long yawn as he stretched, the cool feeling of the wooden flooring greeting his sore paws with a welcoming chill after the long walk, before heading off towards the bedroom the two mons shared. He leaped into the massive bed with a <i>fwumph</i>, purring aloud as he felt himself sink into the cool blankets\u00e2\u20ac\u201da small pleasure in life he would never get tired of. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Umbreon let the soft blankets embrace him, he began to ponder over the journey back home with Charizard. What could he possibly have on his mind that had him so nervous? He did not dwell on it for long though as he was reminded of something quite important he felt he needed to address. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey Charizard I forgot to mention we have a new co-worker up at the Berry Center! I hope you don't mind but I invited them to come over this evening so we could get to know each other!\" He yelled so as to be sure Charizard heard, one ear cocked as he waited for a reply.</div></font></span><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Original</i></div></span></div></div>",

He spun around slowly in the kitchen, his eyes darting at the cabinets and drawers and such without pause. What was he going to do? His eye twitched slightly until he closed them and looked down. Charizard then shook his head in small, rapid successions to clear his thoughts.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I've got to think of something</i>, Charizard thought. <i>I mean, how bad could it be?

This had been <i>the</i> night, this was <i>his</i> night, he wanted <i>Umbreon</i> for <i>himself</i>. He clenched his claws. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard was angry, yet his heart dropped, who was he angry at? Umbreon? How could he\u00e2\u0080\u0094 how dare he\u00e2\u0080\u0094 be angry at his friend? The dragon swept into the living room and slowed himself to a stop at the couch. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was a large enough couch for both an Umbreon and a Charizard to sit together. More like two Charizards, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s besides the point. Now it would be for a third Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon for that night. Charizard placed his claw along the line of the soft couch and traced the edge until his claw drifted into the air. He gagged internally, then inhaled one last time, very slowly. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try not to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard finally called back. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell that was a bit long for a response, wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Umbreon called. The sprinkling of the shower against both the Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fur and the shower walls reached out to Charizard. The dragon twitched again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWas looking outside,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he lied. Charizard did decide to approach the window though. He craned his neck to peek outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Minutes later, wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know it\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new co-worker \u00e2\u0080\u0098Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099 was timidly padding up the sidewalk. The faint orange fur contrast with the growing darkness outside, Flare had approached the door before Charizard had time to think of what to say. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luck was on his side though, and Umbreon was too far away in another room to hear everything. Charizard quickly dashed away from the window and stood behind the door.  For Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, he needed to be collected for this new \u00e2\u0080\u0098friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A knock on the door signaled for Charizard to grasp the handle and allow entrance. As the door was side open, Charizard was able to take in the appearance of the Flareon. Flare flinched at the near immediate reaction to his presence at the house, and his face almost seemed shocked to find a large, orange dragon instead of a small, black Umbreon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare opened his mouth to speak\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</div></font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Tsuki</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><div align=\"justify\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But nothing came out, instead Flare just stood there, eyes wide, frozen in place, not sure what to say. Flare, unlike the Umbreon he had been working with for the past week or so, found it difficult to interact with others aside from the occasional greeting when he happened to run across guests that insisted they pick their own berries instead of letting staff do it. The Umbreon made it seem so <i>easy</i>. Maybe that's way he did not find it hard to talk to him. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"H-h-hello!\" Flare blurted out due to his nervousness, only making things even more awkward for him. <i>Oh my god it would have helped if Bree would have mentioned he had a Charizard as a roommate of all things!</i> He internally screamed. <i>He knows good and well I don't do good around new mon! Maybe he gave me the wrong address!?

Already he could feel the blood rushing from his body as he began to get cold feet. He could feel his world getting smaller with every passing second he stood before this giant among Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon as he tried to maintain eye contact, but finding himself unable to. <i>Damn it! Why did I have to be born with such a timid nature!</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Deep down he truly wished he was just given the wrong address. He was not sure he could handle this prolonged feeling of awkwardness for very long as he stiffened up.</div></font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Twines</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><div align=\"justify\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cUmbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard stated.

Did I do something wrong?</i> \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, sorry!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard paused. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry for what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry for disturbing you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare spun around and shyly started for the sidewalk. <i>I can't do this right now, I'll just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 say I found the wrong address!</i> He then pictured in his head the following conversation that next day about why he wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard immediately gawked\u00e2\u0080\u0094he took a quick look back inside, his heart dropping past his gut by now\u00e2\u0080\u0094he'd already spooked Flare off! <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWait\u00e2\u0080\u0094!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard called, slightly panicked. Flare jumped and his ears flattened. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou're alright, no worries! Come back, I can grab Umbreon for you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he offered, letting the door open.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare moaned quietly to himself, <i>Awhhw! No\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 now what is Bree gonna think?</i> The Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon turned back around to see Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tail slip back into the house. He looked back out to the street, <i>Can I still\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?</i> He frowned, the door was still open. <i>I've gotta close that though! Awh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare entered and eventually closed the door behind him. He took in the look of the living room, the small dip of Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spot on the couch compared to Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much more craterous one. Meanwhile, Charizard stood before the entrance into the bedroom. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cFlare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard called \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I didn't scare him off,\" the dragon looked back at Flare.</div></font></span><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Original</i></div></span></div></div>",

Of course he would forget to mention something like that...</i> Flare sighed. \"You would forget to give me an address if I didn't ask for it...\" he muttered to himself, his shyness eclipsed momentarily by slight agitation, but he still managed to keep his composure and laugh it off as to not come off sounding offensive.

Flare was not able to keep eye contact, that he could tell. Charizard stared at Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back from above. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0094 my name is Flare.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the dragon copied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you see me from looking down so much?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare only shook more, much to Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annoyance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know, maybe if you could see other Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faces you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be shaking like that in front of me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare clenched his eyelids shut, <i>Why\u00e2\u0080\u0099d you go and bring that up?</i>, he complained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he whispered. The Flareon knew that what Charizard said had some factor into his timidity, but it was hard, <i>so</i> hard! To his luck Umbreon seemed to have gotten out of the shower at this point. Charizard watched Flare as he slowly crept past him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 if only he knew how awkward it was. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBree you in here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Flare disappeared into the other room, almost hitting his head on the wall, Charizard looked intently at the Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon. Surprisingly, Flare was cute. His tail fluff, his adorable ears, his drooping tail\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 his little butt\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Charizard exhaled with difficulty. He was arousing himself without meaning to. Maybe if he got Flare to leave before the night ended, he could finally have some fun time with Umbreon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It then struck him. He had two Eeveelutions in the bedroom ahead. One of them was a worthless fire type, while the other was his best friend. Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye twitched and he started to become more and more turned on. The flesh hidden by a slowly widening slit wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t easy to hide at all when he was horny. He hatched an idea, a sick idea, but possibly one he could pull off. It required the best of circumstances. Charizard sat on the couch while the two Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon in the other room talked. He smirked. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If Flare is still here by the time Umbreon is asleep\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Charizard will make use of such a possible cum load. Charizard lolled his tongue out, his rod having extended to a foot. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Though, Umbreon wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just ignore this friend going missing\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Flare's nice and is another evolution in their line\u00e2\u0080\u0094what could he do to fix that? Well... maybe he didn't have to make Flare into a load of cum. <i>That's a bit risky... Could I have some fun with both of them maybe?</i> Charizard thought lustily.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His eyes widened and he quickly realized his open boner was not going to be a good first impression, so he waddled behind the wall for a second. </div></font></span><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Original</i></div></span></div></div>",

It must have been at least a foot or two above his head, and would require him to leap to make it up there. The frame of the bed itself looked like a small, but sturdy wall with a thick comforter, sheets, and a plush, black blanket that matched the wood frame, cascading over the top of it. <i>That's not so... surprising, his roommate is a Charizard after all,</i> he thought as he began to scan the room for the Umbreon he saw walk by earlier. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um... Bree?  Where did\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm up here,\" Came a voice from above. A soft gentle glow emanated from the Umbreon's forehead, giving away the spot he had chosen to relax. He had been there the whole time Flare had stepped in, his head hanging over the corner of the bed, watching Flare with his matching yellow eyes. \"You seem surprised?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare just stared at him. A tinge of agitation gnawing at him. He really wanted to give Bree a piece of his mind for not giving him a proper heads up, and putting him through what he would personally consider hell, but as he looked deep into those yellow eyes he felt that anger fade. How could this Umbreon he only met a little over a week ago have such a calming effect on him? <i>How do you do it?</i>Already he could feel his nerves loosen... finding the voice he struggled so hard to find. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Does\u00e2\u0080\u0094 does it not bother you having a bed you have to jump onto to get in?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why don't you jump up here, and you tell me?\" Bree spoke as he patted a spot down along side him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Umm... okay?\" <i>Did he just invite me to join him in bed? No\u00e2\u0080\u0094 he's just being...</i>Bree. The Umbreon who he watched converse with a Loppuny on the first day of the job, completely oblivious to her flirtatious antics! <i>I still can't believe he was so confused about why that Loppuny was so upset with him!</i> This was just another one of those moments. Flare reared his hind legs as he prepped for the leap, then with a \"Hmph!\" he sprang up onto the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As soon as Flare's paws made contact with the plush surface, he felt the bedding beneath him sink significantly; far more then he expected in fact. \"What the\u00e2\u0080\u0094!\" Was all he could manage to say before landing with the grace of a newborn Ducklett. Everything went dark as he sank deep into the mattress. All sound muffled except for Bree's laughter which rang throughout the room after watching his new friend face plant into the bed, only his fluff visible beyond the horizon of covers that enveloped his body upon impact.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You gotta just <i>plop</i> yourself on the bed, otherwise you're gonna sink in real deep!\" Bree chuckled as he watched Flare remain motionless. \"Soft huh?\" Bree smirked while skillfully making his way over to where Flare laid, before plopping himself down along side him, lifting him a little out of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare could feel Bree's body touching ever so slightly against his fluffy mane, a blush of embarrassment burning beneath his bright red fur. He was not used to being so close to another, but he maintained his composure some how, enjoying as the bed hugged around him. <i>This\u00e2\u0080\u0094 this feels incredible!</i> <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What on earth is this bed made of!?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Altaria down\u00e2\u0080\u0094fairly expensive stuff, but it's fire proof and ungodly soft!\" Bree said with glee as shimmied in place a little, sinking him self deeper into the bed. Flare found himself being pulled closer by gravity, but he did not fight it. He felt far too comfortable to even bother. He could feel the warmth of the Umbreon as his body made contact with his.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I don't get it\u00e2\u0080\u0094 how can I be okay with this? It's almost like I've known him for years!?</i> His thoughts were interrupted by the Umbreon's soothing voice as he spoke with out his normal excited tone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey\u00e2\u0080\u0094 you really shouldn't allow what others think get to you... you know?\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare just laid there... listening what his new friend had to say.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You can't please everyone in this world... no matter what you do. Dwelling on how others think of you will only make things far worse,\" Bree's usual excitement was beginning to bleed through his speech again \"throw caution to the wind and be yourself! Let your personality do the talking for you!\" His voice started to die down again. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It will be hard at first, but over time you will find it easier to be yourself around others. Take it slow and in small strides,\" the Umbreon gave flare a gentle smile.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare could feel his body temperature rising rapidly; A totally new feeling of embarrassment washed over him, one he'd not been expecting.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>What am I feeling? Am I seriously falling in love with Bree!?</i> Flare began to shift a little. He could feel his groin aching; His member started peeking from his sheath and pressing tightly against the plush mattress bellow. <i>No, no, no! This cannot be happening! I can't let him notice me like this\u00e2\u0080\u0094</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Flare? Are you ok\u00c2\u00ad?\" Bree was cut off as Flare stood up suddenly, tail lowered to hide his shame.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm sorry Bree\u00e2\u0080\u0094I forgot\u00e2\u0080\u0094there's something I must go take care of!\" Flare did not even give Bree a chance to respond before leaping off the bed, heading towards the living room where the exit was located.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait!

The cool air immediately caused him to sneer and gain some composure. His plan was set: either wait for Flare to leave or Umbreon to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\u00e2\u0080\u009c... you o.k.\u00e2\u0080\u0094?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry Bree\u00e2\u0080\u0094,\u00e2\u0080\u009d</i> the dragon cocked his head around the fridge door <i>\u00e2\u0080\u009c... something I must go take care of!\u00e2\u0080\u009d</i> Charizard raised a brow, there was some shuffling in the other room.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\u00e2\u0080\u009cWait!

The dragon sharply inhaled in surprise but no harm had come to him, meanwhile Flare had his paws over the top of his head, moaning. The Flareon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s momentary plight of nervousness was overcome by a bruise forming on the top of his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAwh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Umbreon had left the bedroom to find a disgruntled Charizard looking at him for help, standing over a bamboozled Flareon. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cFlare, are you alright!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Umbreon rushed over to Flare while Charizard sat down on the carpeted floor in front of the startled fire-type. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat happened?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe er\u00e2\u0080\u0094ran into my leg I think and uh\u00e2\u0080\u0094now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of just there on the floor now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard explained rather bemusedly. Umbreon glanced up at his roommate, only to go back to tending Flare. Umbreon brushed his side against Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and sat next to him while in front of Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spread legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cCalm down Flare,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Umbreon cooed. Charizard was taken aback slightly by his cooing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou're fine, you're fine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he nudged Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder. Flare has done this before. Instead of dealing with his problems upfront, sometimes Umbreon would see Flare in the back room with his tail down and about had his whole head in an empty planter box. Comical as it was, Umbreon pitied him. This was generally the result of a rude customer, but what set him off this time? Normally there was something plausible, but... he was being <i>nice</i> to Flare.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>Ow,</i>\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare complained again. Umbreon managed to make him stand, soon leading the startled Flareon to the couch. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cCharizard, can you go get him something?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Umbreon asked. Charizard nodded, stood up, and walked to the kitchen again. With Flare situated on the couch, Umbreon felt the need to comfort him more. <i>Why did Flare bolt?</i> Umbreon wondered. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sound of the Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thumping suddenly made him think. <i>Oh. He's worried about Charizard. So it wasn't me then, thankfully.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard didn't get anything from the kitchen yet, opting to just stand and listen. He peeked his head out from around the corner and glared at Flare. Umbreon <i>cooed</i> for him! For that <i>wimpy</i> Flareon! Charizard clenched his claws. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou never cooed for me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard whispered crossly. He watched as Umbreon comforted Flare openly, becoming jealous by the second.</div></font></span><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Original</i></div></span></div></div>",

Already he could feel Flare starting to relax a little. \"Who would have thought a knock on the head was all you needed\u00e2\u20ac\u201d it's a good thing they let me take some of the berries home as a part of my pay!\" He joked in a attempt to lighten the mood. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yea\u00e2\u20ac\u201d ha ha... I guess you're right\u00e2\u20ac\u201d<i>shhhaa</i>!\" Flare hissed as he felt the tender lump that had formed. \"What berry was it again for something like this\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Persim?\" Thankfully the whole ordeal preoccupied his mind long enough that he no longer felt the presence of his cock peaking out from his sheath. <i>Thank god nobody noticed.</i> The thought of that awkward situation made his current predicament so much easier to cope with.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Close... but you would need to hit your head a lot harder then that before you would need one of those\u00e2\u20ac\u201d unless you're seeing stars. You aren't seeing stars are you?\" The Umbreon asked quizzically as he looked into Flares eye's for a moment. \"How many rings do you see on my face?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N-no\u00e2\u20ac\u201d I'm not seeing stars or anything like that,\" Flare spoke as he winced again, this time using the sore spot as a way to distract himself from the Umbreon's gaze, before having his paw lightly swatted away. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Stop poking it\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand the berry you would want is the Oran berry\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Persim is to treat confusion. You could also use Lum berry as a cure all, but unless you want the boss lady to chew you out, I don't recommend that...\" Bree shivered a little as he recalled the day he got caught using Lums as a go to for everyone's problem. He didn't know they were so hard to grow, single-handedly causing a shortage of said berry for about a month on his first week of the job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey Chariz\u00e2\u20ac\u201d oh! Did not see you sneak up on me there...\" Bree spoke as he reached for the ripe Oran berry he brought back before promptly thanking him then he used one of his paws to score a triangular shaped mark into the rind roughly the size of the bump on Flare's head, then peeling it away and sticking it between the Flareon's eyes like it were a post-it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uhh.. what was\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\" Flare was cut off as the Umbreon handed him the rest of the berry.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eat this\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand leave that berry rind on that bump\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit will help speed up the healing process,\" Bree spoke before jumping off the couch.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare crossed his eyes at the dark blue patch that had been placed on his head; giving it a few pokes. <i>Wow\u00e2\u20ac\u201d it really does help... bet it's going to stain though...</i> he thought, the prospect of going to work tomorrow with a purple stain on his head already starting to bug him. Already he can imagine the stares coming from the customers...and the questions... great. His train of thought was broken as Bree began to speak to him again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey Flare... I know you are not going to be fond of the idea, but why don't you stay here for the night? The bed is big enough for like, two Charizards, so there is plenty of room, and it's getting pretty late,\" Bree said as he looked towards the window. Already the sun began to fall, as twilight approached.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare tensed up, his embarrassment visible. Sleeping in the same bed with Bree and Charizard\u00e2\u20ac\u201d <i>oh god</i>, Flare looked back behind him to see if the Charizard was still there. Thankfully he did not seem to be paying any mind to them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That-that's okay... I can walk home!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nonsense!\" The Umbreon interrupted him as he already began to head towards the bedroom. \"Besides\u00e2\u20ac\u201d you know you love that bed!\" He laughed as he rounded the corner.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"W-well...\" but Flare could not think of anything. He looked back at the front door then to the window. It was getting pretty dark. He couldn't believe how fast time flies. He thought about just leaving, but what would Bree think if he just left. The neighboring forest he had to cross to get home also was not the safest place to be at night, and the twilight would play tricks with his eyes... \"Damn it...\" he muttered as he ate his berry slowly. That bed is pretty nice though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As time past and the sun disappeared behind the distant mountains neighboring the little village Flare decided to bite the bullet. He would have to stay. It was to dark for him to see clearly at night and unlike most his age\u00e2\u20ac\u201d he was not keen on being alone in the dark. Traversing the woods at night was not something he was particularly fond of, Bree looks to have already headed to bed and asking Charizard for help was out of the question...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a sigh, Flare leaped of the couch and proceeded to make his way to the bedroom once more. Thankfully it seemed Charizard was nowhere to be seen. Perhaps he was off wondering around in one of the other rooms. As he made his way to the edge of the bed, he could already he Bree's soft breathing, presumably already fully asleep. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taking Bree's advice from earlier, Flare crouched a few times as he prepared to leap back onto the bed again but this time he was ready. With a \"Hmph\" he made the jump, but this time he just allowed himself to be embraced by the bed as he landed with a '<i>Fwamph</i>' His heart sunk a little as he almost landed on the Umbreon, his body freezing up as he felt Bree's limp body roll towards him... but he remained asleep, not even fazed. <i>I guess he just as clueless in sleep as he is awake,</i> Flare thought. It took him a moment relax, especially with the Umbreon's body so close to him. He could feel his blush coming back, once again his shaft emerging from its confines against the covers, but this time he just let it be. He did not plan to move, instead he just sat there in the darkness. The dim glow of the Umbreon's gently pulsing rings slowly lul him into a deep...deep sleep. </span></font></div><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Original</i></div></span></div></div>",

Namely, the living room. After reluctantly handing the berry over to Umbreon, Charizard took to standing behind the couch and pretending to watch the sun set, but had really kept his eyes on Flare. Oh how jealous Charizard was! He flexed his claws every so often when he heard Umbreon soothing Flare, but when he invited Flare to stay that night, Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan had changed for the better. There was no chance at all that unless Flare left, he'd be a load.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard had ultimately been forgotten between the two Eevees, almost as if he wasn't there the whole night! However, when Umbreon invited Flare to sleep on his bed, on their bed for only them, Charizard was particularly angered.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard stood at the door frame to the room. The lights were all off, except for his tail, but dark enough so that Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glowing rings could be seen from the room. An Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glow was a treasured gift, at least in circumstances where their affection is showing, and those were for the best of friends\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but Flare?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Umbreon, as simply put, was the heaviest sleeper Charizard had ever witnessed. That damn fire-type, however, decided to sleep right next to him. Charizard slowly paced around the bed multiple times in an attempt to figure out a way to snatch Flare up from the bed. With the blankets being fireproof, his tail made for an excellent viewing source. Umbreon had his back to Flare, who himself was on his back\u00e2\u0080\u0094<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jaw dropped when he saw Flare\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and his open arousal. The dragon's face became red with anger and jealousy. <i>This fucking Flareon!!</i> He yelled in his mind, eyes wide with intent. It took all of his restraint to not jump on the lowly fire-type and hammer him for being so close to Umbreon with the boner he sported. Charizard backed up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He huffed, rather more loudly than he wanted to. Flare flinched and opened his eyes to the ceiling. Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gut dropped and he quickly tried to hide his anger with a face. Flare was awake, <i>Shoot</i>, he thought, <i>great. Just great.</i> Flare groaned softly and sat up, trying to figure out what was with the orange glow in the room, unlike Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yellow. Suddenly, it occurred to Charizard, why would he have to grab Flare? He's shy, but that didn't stop him from getting comfortable with Umbreon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey\u00e2\u0080\u00a6? Charizard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare whispered groggily. His eyes widened \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh my, I'm sorry\u00e2\u0080\u0094 do you\u00e2\u0080\u0094 do you have enough room? I could move\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 er\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard paused. For a moment he thought, then in his best innocent voice, he said \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm o.k., Flare. I just, I fell asleep on the couch watching the sun and, well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I realized that I didn't have the best first impression with you\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears perked slightly \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm also super sorry about you hurting your head, I\u00e2\u0080\u0094 I was terribly worried and felt really bad about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh...?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare tilted his head. He was slowly becoming more and more interested. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt wasn't your fault, Charizard. I'm\u00e2\u0080\u0094 I'm just really horrible with new people\u00e2\u0080\u0094 I\u00e2\u0080\u0094 you're fine, it's not you, it's me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare drooped his ears, his stomach feeling more and more tense.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard smiled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh thank you! I was so worried, I didn't want to scare you at all!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare looked up at Charizard again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was thinking maybe we could get to know each other? I saved a dessert for Umbreon but it's a lot. I mean, I could eat it in a couple bites but Umbreon probably wouldn't mind that you be treated to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach growled. He hadn't eaten since earlier that day, and felt slightly tense at the offer. <i>He's being so nice\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 maybe Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right. I should try a little more</i>, Flare thought. Some seconds of decision making pass before Flare says \u00e2\u0080\u009cO.k..\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard smiled widely. Flare made a slow motion to get up, trying not to disturb Umbreon, but when he rolled over he felt his dick push into the bed. His tail pressed hard against the sheets in embarrassment, and his cheeks flourished. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Oh my god I was hard!</i> Flare panicked. He turned his head to see Charizard but the dragon had already left the room. He gave a sigh of relief, he had some time to hide his\u00e2\u0080\u0094 <i>oh no, I was on my back! Charizard had to have seen me!</i>He nervously pressed his paws into the soft cushions, kneading them for a moment of contemplation. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard <i>did</i> have a dessert for Umbreon, and there was no way in hell he was going to give it to Flare without doing something malicious. He made his way to the fridge and grabbed out a berry mousse in a small, plastic covering. Small to him, anyway. Removing the lid, he found a small plate and placed it gently in the middle; If he weren't so focused on what he wanted to do with Flare he'd have been proud of the neat dessert.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard then walked into the living room and softly sat down on the couch with the plate placed ever so high to his stomach. His short legs stuck out into the air, but he twisted so that he was completely flat out and right with the couch. Flare had come out, the room lit with only Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tail, and he padded around the couch. Jumping up, he awkwardly settled himself at Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet. <i>He got real\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 comfortable\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it seems</i>, Flare thought, his eyes lit up when he saw the dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI uh, I want to apologize again, I know how intimidating I am and I feel quite ashamed about it sometimes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard lied, trying to keep his meek demeanor. Flare flicked his bushy tail.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAha, yeah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare agreed nervously. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut at least you\u00e2\u0080\u0094you try to be nice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought back to meeting Charizard at the door, but couldn't remember anything other than staring at the dragon's feet and worrying. Flare was looking at the dessert, but kept trying to keep his eyes on Charizard, whose face was full of timidity, unlike before. Flare suddenly felt\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 relieved. He didn't make a move for the dessert yet though, he wanted to be polite and wait.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know. I work the same job like you, sort of, but I burn more than weeds, I don't really talk to too many other people than Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 either,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm thankful you know what I'm talking about, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d This play on Flare was exactly what he wanted to happen. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Although red flags had gone up in Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head when he arrived, he slowly became adjusted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \u00e2\u0080\u009c Flare admitted. Charizard sighed deeply.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Umbreon is a great friend, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe really works for it, huh? I mean, he's so nice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard had gotten a question stuck in his head \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't think I'd be a good partner though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 if you know what I mean\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare stopped paying attention to the dessert on Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach and his face turned red, even more than it could have been from his red fur. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 oh!

Not again\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</i> Flare panicked, <i>wait, no. No. I'm going to push through this, I'm not going to run away like a weirdo again!</i> Flare scolded himself. Charizard was looking at the wall. The mousse was still on Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach, tempting as ever, and Flareon began to drool. He had ignored his hunger up until now. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you're nice\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 too, Ch\u00e2\u0080\u0094Charizard,\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears flicked. And he looked between his legs at Flare. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAww, thanks!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard returned, slightly surprised\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 <i>but prey normally fall for pretty words all the time</i>. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Now\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 how to get that dessert\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</i> Flare, with the confidence he barely mustered, slowly stood, his paws pressing into the couch, and then he placed a paw on Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leg. Charizard looked at Flare with positivity, Umbreon sometimes crawled onto Charizard for the heat he provided, which Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expression encouraged the Flareon to continue. Flare places his next step next to Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crotch for support, then above, and farther, until his tail brushed between Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs and tickled his parts. Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paws sunk into the dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s belly and somewhat made him wobbly, until he adjusted himself to be comfortable. Flare was right atop the mousse now, with Charizard beaming at his confidence. Flare was feeling a mixture of pent arousal and nervosity, and hopefully from the dragon's natural body heat he wouldn't notice the erection coming from him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The dragon still had one claw under the plate, and one claw free. Flare chuckled nervously \u00e2\u0080\u009cI uh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 may I have some?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard nodded. Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes seemed to twinkle with delight and his mouth descended onto the soft pillar. The mousse was sweet, like a berry, soft like whip cream, and it was about as big as his head, and definitely more than a single bite, more like twenty, would be needed to get at least half of it in. <i>He was going to give this to Umbreon?! What a lucky roommate!</i> Charizard was silent as he watched Flare eat the mousse, raising his claw to above Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back, his slit opening with extraordinary pace, the hot flesh coming out from the unintentional arousal of Flare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cLike it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard asked. Flare nodded, finishing his bite and swallowing. Charizard edged his claws right behind Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah! I've never had this\u00e2\u0080\u0094 berry stuff before. At least, not the cream and\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and stuff,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare smiled and took another bite. Charizard raised the plate slightly higher to where his claws below gave him the best grip on the plate, then waited for Flare to open his mouth for another bite. Flare swallowed another bite, then went for another\u00e2\u0080\u0094<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Simultaneously, Charizard seized Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upper body in a lock and shoved the dessert in his face. Instinctively Flare gagged and squirmed, eyes clenched shut in surprise. Charizard squeezed onto Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body and forced him into the soft belly below, and then went further to cram the food down Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s throat. The poor fire-type tried to resist the sudden forces but his head was bent back and the soft dessert felt like it had become much more dense and thick than he could handle. Tears of shock were forced out of Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes and he kept trying to resist whatever Charizard was doing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Charizard grimaced and smiled at the same time, if at all that were possible, and his shaft had reached its full potential, a foot. A long, girthy, fleshy, musky twelve inches of cock. The couch creaked slightly from the struggling, but Flare was unsuccessful in pushing off of the dragon's belly because of Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mighty strength in comparison. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choked down the dessert, his stomach bulging slightly, which he also found it harder to breathe. His tail thrashed and he couldn't do much other than tear up and take it. Once the dessert was smashed across Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s muzzle, fur and face, and splattered on Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chest, Charizard dropped the plate to the carpeted floor. Flare winced and, having much of his strength drained, gasped for breath, his stomach was a little expanded around his gut, which he felt was hurting him with every movement of his muscles, but more so from Charizard and his grip. Charizard then grasped Flare by the muzzle, and leaned in. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou like the dessert? You don't like me? You like Umbreon? <i>My</i> Umbreon?! My roommate, and you dare lay next to him with an <i>open boner</i>?!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard growled, clenching his teeth and snarling in a quiet voice. He was taking out all of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aggression on this wimpy, whiney Flareon.</span></font></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">Tsuki</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare could not believe what he was hearing! This anger was seething from Charizard's voice as he spoke. It sent chill of fear that pulled at his very soul and made him feel sick. <i>I-I didn't know!</i> Was all Flare could think. He wanted to scream, beg his apologies! How could he have known this Charizard had such feeling for Bree! It's not like he was an Espeon\u00e2\u0080\u0094 he can't read minds! He couldn't even read other's body language. He now truly knew that Charizard did not like him, but this level of hatred was something he could have never imagined!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare wanted to scream, but he could do nothing of the sort as long as Charizard kept his grip tight and him pressed firmly against his gut. Already the mousse that had been forced down his throat threatened to make its way back up, but the thick creamy desert remained down, far to thick for him to simply heave up. What was left on his face, nose, and the back of his throat only further inducing the feeling of drowning as Flare desperately gasped for air. All he could do was look up at the Charizard, his eyes wide with fresh tears streaming down his face, silently pleading with Charizard for him to stop what he was doing and let him go! The Charizard would never have to worry about seeing him again! He just wanted to go home! Unfortunately the face of mercy was not what he saw staring back at him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare managed a panicked squeak as he felt a great warmth brushing against hind quarters\u00e2\u0080\u0094prodding against his rear. <i>No-no-no-no-no! Please not this!</i> He thought as he remembered what the Charizard said about Eevees. Flare's struggles picked up as he frantically tried to get away, but he was far to weak to do anything! <i>Why! Why is this happening to me!</i> Flare looked up again at the Charizard, his vision now blurred by not only his tears, but the mousse that was smeared across his face. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"P-please!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I'll leave a-and n-never come back! J-just let\u00e2\u0080\u0094let me go! I-I'm s\u00e2\u0080\u0094sorry!\"  Flare begged between raspy breaths, not having the strength or the air to manage anything near loud enough for anyone but Charizard to hear.</span></font></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">Twines</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard violently squeezed Flareon, who winced and allowed his mouth to widen from pain. Without an answer, Charizard began to lick the mousse off of Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tears and messy face began to clear up with every lick. Flare shuddered and clenched his teeth, trying to deal with all of the torture. The dragon continued to hump and rub against Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entrance, his tip beginning to make his entrance soft. The Flareon sniffled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cP\u00e2\u0080\u0094 ple\u00e2\u0080\u0094 ase, y\u00e2\u0080\u0094 you\u00e2\u0080\u0094 you're hurting m\u00e2\u0080\u0094 m\u00e2\u0080\u0094 me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard continued to grope Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plushy hips while slobbering his muzzle. He pressed his tongue to the Flareon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck and trailed along up to his forehead with excruciatingly slow speed. Flare sobbed with his tongue hanging out while Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flesh throbbed, harshly colliding against his rear. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlea\u00e2\u0080\u0094ea\u00e2\u0080\u0094 ase!

Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s</i> pitiful sobbing became a bunch of unintelligible mumbles. Gradually Charizard opened his mouth, twisting his tongue around Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s snout. If Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes could go wider, they might as well have been from a Xatu. <i>Ohmigod! Nono! No no no! He's gonna eat me!! No, he can't! Where\u00e2\u0080\u0094 where's Umbreon?! Umbreon! Help! Please!</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard thrust his large hips, penetrating Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stretched ass. Just as Flare felt this, he tried to scream. But Charizard clamped down on Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth. All Flare could see was the top of Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s snout, and his very much needed scream of horror was muffled by the dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own mouth. Charizard moaned furiously as his hard flesh violated the poor Flareon, sliding in and out with relatively noticeable resistance. Instinctively Flare clenched his muscles and tensed up. The tapered rod was, at the same time, the most pain and most pleasure Flare had ever felt in his life. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly Charizard loosened his clamp on Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s snout, but shot his tongue into the Flareon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resisting mouth. The expression held in Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face was one Charizard had never seen before, was Flare\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 enjoying this? Who knew? Flare squirmed more violently when Charizard was penetrating him from two sides, but really couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t move because of the restraint. Charizard thrusted and pushed down on Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soft rear.</span></font></div><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Original</i></div></span></div></div>",

How did everything go wrong so fast? He was finally starting to open up\u00e2\u0080\u0094to break away from his own fears\u00e2\u0080\u0094with Charizard. He thought they could be friends\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Charizard made him feel welcomed when he started opening up to him! <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Was it that the Charizard put on nothing more then just an act to catch him off guard? Did he truly despise him so much that he saw him as nothing more then a quick fuck and a meal? What did he do to deserve this? Now here he was, being pinned to the gut of this enraged Charizard who just moments ago was making amends, feeling his large cock stretching his body to the limit, making him feel like he was being split in half! No matter how hard he tried to scream he couldn't\u00e2\u0080\u0094not as long as the Charizard had his maw clamped around his snout, his tongue thoroughly lodged down the dog's throat, and all while being forced to inhale his rancid breath as the dragon panted with each thrust.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare gagged on Charizard's tongue\u00e2\u0080\u0094the dragon's thrusts lamming what little air he could manage out of him. Flare's body convulsed involuntarily around the massive cock, coaxing pleasured moans from the mighty dragon as he felt his cock throb deep within him, coating his inner walls with his pre as it lubed his insides to allow for the cock to go even deeper. The sound of the Charizard's cock slipping in and out of his Flare's ass with a disgusting <i>squelches</i> and <i>slurps</i> echoed loudly throughout the house. He couldn't believe Umbreon could sleep through it! To make matters worse\u00e2\u0080\u0094Flare could feel his body starting to betray him. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Through all the pain, a subtle feeling of pleasure began to emerge in Flare as the Charizard's over-sized cock slammed at his prostate, despite the feeling of Charizard's red hot rod violently jostling about his insides\u00e2\u0080\u0094and as much as it hurt, Flare could still feel his own cock slipping free from his sheath, smearing his own pre and making a mess against the Charizard's soft belly...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If it were not for the fact he feared for his very life, Flare thought he might have been able to enjoy him self properly. However all he could think about were the ravenous gut that he was pinned against, and very real possibility of that maw silencing him, opening up and embracing him any moment now. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>P-please\u00e2\u0080\u0094 I-it can't e-e-end l-like this!

He had a feeling it would not be much longer now and felt like he would break any moment. The small Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon did not want to think about what would happen when the Charizard climaxed, not completely sure his little body could contain what this massive beast would force upon him... and <i>in</i> him more or less.</div></font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Twines</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><div align=\"justify\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094believe\u00e2\u0080\u0094it!</i> Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thoughts were interrupted by the violent thrusts.

The senses of a putrid tongue penetrating into his throat, the excessive groping of his rear, and the massive cock ravaging his ass were all making Flare groan in pain and moan in ecstasy. <i>Why am I\u00e2\u0080\u0094I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be enjoying this!</i> His tail and neck fur were tattered and matted with saliva, pre, and what was left of the dessert. His balls quaked, tensing up while his cock pulsed. <i>I\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094 no!</i> <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flareon let out a muffled cry of induced pleasure as he unloaded into the makeshift hole that was both of their bodies. The white ooze stained his fur and excreted out the sides where their bodies no longer touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite the orgasmic scenario, Charizard still found difficulty getting himself to cum. He did not like this Flareon any more so than other victims he had previously, and the fact this one was closer to Umbreon did not change that. At the mention of Umbreon in his mind, Charizard withdrew his tongue from the gaping fire-type, who automatically allowed his head to drop into Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chest, heaving and whimpering from exerting so much energy in one load. Charizard slowly withdrew from Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used ass as the Eeveelution lay down without a word, which, the thick rod that filled a hole, a new hole, had been removed, and now left the Flareon feeling empty, regardless of how much had been crammed into him in that short time.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was so little energy left in Flare that he could only sob and wait for Charizard to do\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 something. <i>Is he still going to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 eat me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?

I don't think he wants to\u00e2\u0080\u0094</i> There was a warmth, a warmth coming from behind, and not from below, encompassing his feet. <i>What is\u00e2\u0080\u0094 wait what is that?

Flare could not fight, he could not get up, he could not go back to bed, he could not sleep with Umbreon, he could only squirm to look at his feet. His face turned as pale as a Gallade.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The tapered penis was swallowing up his back paws. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"N\u00e2\u0080\u0094NO!

A sudden tug forced a surprised gasp from him as he felt the fur on his belly lift slightly, dragging through his own shame\u00e2\u0080\u0094his own small stain on Charizard's belly\u00e2\u0080\u0094while the crushing grip of the Charizard's cock was squeezing his paws painfully tight, saturating them in his vile pre. Already Flare's nose cringed at the smell of the musky scent that wafted across his nose, making him want to gag a little. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please\u00e2\u0080\u0094 I- I just want to go home!\" Flare begged, but the Charizard grin just grew wider as he gave his face another long, seemingly arduous lick, making sure to give him a detailed view of his gullet has it gaped before him\u00e2\u0080\u0094another hot humid gust of acrid breath ruffling his fur as the Charizard exhaled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why would I do that?\" The Charizard chuckled as he wrapped a claw beneath the trembling Flareon's head, forcing him to crane his neck up to look him in the eyes. \"After all\u00e2\u0080\u0094I still haven't even cum yet,\" Charizard moved his claw from Flare's head down to the back of his shoulders as he smashed Flare down against his belly once more and gave a single hard thrust as his entire body clenched, a pleasured grunt escaping his maw. The sound of Flare's panicked reaction to being pulled in deeper drove him wild. Oh how he loved this feeling of power over this <i>pitiful</i> excuse of a Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon! <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"P-please\u00e2\u0080\u0094  I-I'll do anything\u00e2\u0080\u0094 j-just- let me go!\" Flare pleaded as he attempted to free his hind legs, but his struggles were weak, the muscles in hindquarters having basically given out on him from the abuse his rear had received. Charizard seemed to enjoy what little token struggle Flare could manage though as he attempted to free himself. A pleasured moan bellowed from deep within the dragon's throat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How does it feel little Flare...? To be so useless that you couldn't even make a decent cock sleeve for a superior creature? Hmm?\" The Charizard spoke with no care and no compassion for his prey's plight. One could say he even relished the fear judging by the look on his face. He wanted Flare to beg. Charizard <i>wanted</i> him to realize just how <i>fucking pathetic</i> he was.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u00e2\u0080\u0094I..\" Flare couldn't even speak. His voice was caught in his throat as he choked back his tears. How could someone be so cruel? All his life he's had to live with these fears\u00e2\u0080\u0094this feeling of never amounting to much, it was partly why he was so shy. All he wanted was to avoid the judgmental views of others. That terrible feeling of being a burden to all he met, he didn't wish to be like this! He wanted to change! But just as he finally found the courage to do so\u00e2\u0080\u0094to open up to somebody\u00e2\u0080\u0094he gets <i>this!?</i> What he thought was a token of apology shoved down his throat, and his virginity violently taken from him! Flare couldn't even begin to put these feelings into words. Meanwhile Charizard's words were literally making him feel as if his very soul was being ripped in half. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"H\u00e2\u0080\u0094how,\" Flare sniffled \"h-how c-can you b\u00e2\u0080\u0094be so cruel!\" Flare was near incomprehensible at this point.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How can you be so weak?\" Charizard retorted as he gave another little thrust, forcing Flareon's shocked cry to be eclipsed by a loud and audible spurt as pre squelched out from around Flare's legs, further lubing him for his trip down the Charizard's voracious cock. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hehe, at least this way you will get what you wanted~ this is the only chance you have of getting inside of Bree after all!\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare cried as he felt himself sink deeper into the painfully tight and musky confines of the Charizard's throbbing cock. He could feel it's tip starting to lift his fluffy tail by now as it pulled him deeper, squirts of pre-cum splattering against his sore ass. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I- I don't w-want t-to die!\" He begged with a raspy voice through streams of tears as he extended his paws out in front of him, trying desperately to hook his sharp claws into the Charizard's belly as a last ditch effort to slow himself from sinking deeper.</div></font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Twines</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><div align=\"justify\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare sobbed, he was in so terrible a turmoil that his body kept convulsing with abuse, his lithe body autonomously writhing on the cum stained belly as his legs were yanked into Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mighty cock. The slickened tunnel was tight on Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thighs, as if itself were groping him separate to Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claws. The cum soaked into his fur when the strong muscle pulsed with pleasure. Each glob was a dense, warm substance that spread evenly along the small Flareon. Flare squirmed as his plush rear was swallowed up, his face red with fear and shame and pain and everything imaginably conceivable. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Umbreon, please help me!</i> Flare placed his paws under his stomach and curled up, trying to ease himself of the guttural pains that came with the dessert and rape. Flare couldn't keep himself from being tugged and lost his grip. His stomach was a soft bulge that hurt at the touch, to which he cried and cradled, weeping at the his own white cum stain, the last of his to stain his own fur before\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Eep!</i> He felt it. He felt the sloshy, hot embrace of the cum pool at his back paws. Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s balls were not seen, as they were internal, and at this it could only make his destination more 'at home.' It was less of a cum pool, but more like a reservoir that had less air compared to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 what he would imagine it'd be\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and the encasing was Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s musky crotch. Flare couldn't even look at Charizard, he couldn't stand his body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s condition, he could not bare to witness himself wallowing into a white mesh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 so instead he closed his eyes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and continued to cry like a newborn Eevee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard grinned, his cock was pulling Flare along and had gotten to Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rounded stomach. In spite of the pleasure he was receiving from his cock snack, he gently pressed against Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extremely soft belly, which he would have enjoyed to grope had their friendship blossomed a different way. It elicited a squeak from Flare, but Charizard did not want a bad image in his head, so helping the Flareon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journey down was necessary. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cPathetic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard chuckled, admittedly Flare looked cute still throughout the ordeal \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust pathetic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</div></font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Tsuki</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><div align=\"justify\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare cried as he felt the Charizard wrap his large claws around his swollen belly, carefully pressing him further down his cock. He felt like he would throw up any moment but unfortunately even his body lacked the strength to do so, aside from the occasional burp which gave him only brief moments of relief from the excruciating pain as well as reminding him of the berry mousse, a more welcoming flavor than the tongue by far, though still nauseating. He briefly thought about the mousse he had, thinking that if he some how ever made it out of this alive that he would <i>never</i> be able to look at one again. This thought was quickly drowned out by much greater concerns, such as the moist feeling of Charizard's tapered cock suckling against the ends of both his paws\u00e2\u0080\u0094pressed against his body\u00e2\u0080\u0094as it inched further up his painfully engorged belly. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know if you struggled more, you might just get me to cum you out,\" the Charizard whispered into his ears. Of course he knew all too well Flare was in so much pain that to move or struggle would be devastating, but he loved giving him a false sense of hope, no matter how small, and the little whine he got as a reply was something that forced a grin. Charizard moaned\u00e2\u0080\u0094his toes curling as he felt Flare's body sink further. Flare's once fluffy coat kept tickling his urethra in the most delightful way as the Flareon's body was yanked deeper into his prison. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"At least now you will finally have a purpose in life,\" Charizard cooed, shuddering as Flare's body convulsed within the tight confines of his cock. Every twitch\u00e2\u0080\u0094every little movement\u00e2\u0080\u0094he could even feel Flare's pulse and the vibration caused by his persistent whining. \"You're gonna have to try harder then that,\" Charizard smirked, pushing Flare a little deeper much to the the canine's discomfort.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>B-bree! Breeeeeeee!</i>\" Flare cried, his words forming only a pained whine as he tried to wake up the only one who could possibly save him\u00e2\u0080\u0094unfortunately he could not manage anything louder then he already has. It hurt so much to breathe\u00e2\u0080\u0094with every breath already requiring monumental effort. \"P-please\u00e2\u0080\u0094I-it hurts so...\" He couldn't even finish his sentence before he started to cry again.  Charizard's cock was now a little over half way past Flare's bloated belly, his paws pinned inside the cock with it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh\u00e2\u0080\u0094Bree can't save you now, you are already beyond the point of no return!\" Charizard smirked wickedly. \"I can already feel your tiny paws tickling me as you enter my balls\u00e2\u0080\u0094<i>Oh!!</i> It wont be long now!\" He laughed, rubbing more pre along Flare's body.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>He was right</i>, Flare thought. Flare could feel more and more of his body slipping from the tight grasp of Charizard's cock into the slightly more spacious chamber where soon he would be deposited. The hot touch of the dragons potent seed was slowly enveloping his paws even faster as the cock finally made it past the widest part of his belly! This really was it\u00e2\u0080\u0094this is how he would die...</div></font></span><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Original</i></div></span></div></div>",

Charizard was raving on the couch, finally moving on from stroking Flare, and he was now using his claws to jerk his ravenous cock. He could feel a spot inside of him that was filling up, and though he wished he had his own balls to touch, he settled with rubbing his crotch area.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don't want to see the world one last time?

It was supposed to be a surprise for Umbreon, after all. Flare stuttered a protest, but cramped in pain again, then his own mane got caught in his face as Charizard continued to slurp him down.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cLast words, Sloshy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard looked Flare straight in the eyes as the defeated Flareon tried to choke out another word. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho am I kidding? Cum doesn't talk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he gently pressed two claws to close Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Mmph! No! No!! Mphft!!

Charizard released a small plume of fire, drooling with ecstasy.</div></font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Tsuki</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><div align=\"justify\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare found his own voice to be muffled as his ears and fur were folded over his eyes, despairing from the outside world for good within the musky depths of his cruel captor. The throbbing pulse of the Charizard's cock and the disgusting suckling sound of precum slurping around his head deafening him\u00e2\u0080\u0094squeezing him so painfully tight, he thought he would soon black out from lack of air. Flare's body trembling from the fear, and the unknown that awaited him bellow. Never thinking this is how he would end, at the hands of a cold-hearted predator that simply did not like him, or care for him in any way what so ever. Even now he could feel the Charizard's claws on the other side of the fleshy walls out side his prison, teasing him, the sound of the Charizard thoroughly enjoying himself as he moaned and thrust his hips at the air, unable to contain this feeling of pure bliss this hapless Flareon's weak struggles brought him. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ooooooh... it won't... be long...now.. Sloshy...\" Charizard moaned through his teeth, small wisps of flame kissing the edge of his lips as he took slow, heavy breaths. He wanted to savor this moment for as long as he could. Nothing felt better then putting this useless excuse of an Eeveelution where it belonged, especially one that dare get between him and his Bree. A grin spread across his lips\u00e2\u0080\u0094oh how he wish Flare could see the merciless look plastered on his face as he gripped the widest part of his throbbing shaft with both claws, giving it a nice firm massage. Flare's muffled cries as his bloated body was pressed upon were music to his ears! The pained struggles, though small, still sent shivers of delight as the Charizard sprawled out along the entire length of the massive couch. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After he felt like Flare had enough, he allowed his cock to hang over the edge of the couch, letting the mass of his own girth and Flare's bob freely it the air. His cock stiffened every time it drooped down and causing it to bounce in a steady tempo while he laid back and enjoyed the feeling of gravity, with Flare being pulled deeper each time\u00e2\u0080\u0094emptying slowly into the tight confines of his musky prison. Charizard could only imagine the motion-sick feeling Flare had to be experiencing right about now. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Small ropes of clear pre, some with little red tufts of fur drooled from the tip of Charizard's tapered cock. He did will to catch any of the strings of pre that were flung about, using his wing membrane to catch them so they did not hit the carpet. He would have to make sure he didn't miss any stray ropes later though before morning came he thought before continuing his fun . He laid back onto the couch, a blissful look on his face while he let his body to the rest of the hard work.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If you thank we're having fun now, wait till you reach the end!-\" Charizard teased Flare's bulge as it started to sink behind the confines of his slit with his claws giving it a few more playful squeezes. \"I hope you put up more of a fight when you finally get down there\u00e2\u0080\u0094 the least you can do before I put you out of your misery.\" The Charizard taunted, electing one last muffled \"<i>Mmph!</i>\" from Flare before feeling the Flareon deposit fully into his balls.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's time for the real fun to begin!\" Charizard chimed as he placed a paw down on the squirming bulge Flare had made giving it a good playful squeezes. Unlike the tight confines of his cock, Flare now had a little more room to move\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Charizard had a feeling Flare's spirit wasn't over and done with, and Charizard would enjoy the wimps last moments to the fullest...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The pain Flare felt as Charizard squeezed his body from the outside was nothing more the excruciating, and to make matters worse he could not fight against it or curl up in an attempt to ease the pain. He felt like he would burst any moment, and in that brief second he thought that's what Charizard was going for. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"P-please... i-it hurts\u00e2\u0080\u0094! Please s-top!\" Flare squealed, not sure if he could manage anything loud enough to be heard through pulsing flesh. He could taste his own tears on the edges of his mouth as well as Charizard's pre. He could vaguely hear the Charizard speaking to him over all the sounds of his inner workings as he was being pulled deeper. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare could feel his lower body emptying in to the hellishly hot chamber bellow him\u00e2\u0080\u0094a faint tingle dripping over his little paws that were already submerged in the vile cum bath bellow. He whimpered as he felt his aching cock, still fully erect much to his discomfort due to all the unwanted attention it was receiving, springing free from his belly as the sensitive tip slipped past the tight muscular ring of flesh, and tracing down the fleshy walls of his soon to be slimy tomb, and to make matters worse, his world began to spin as wave after wave of painful contractions, all whilst feeling he was being thrown around as if he was on some hellish carnival ride. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Hnngmm\u00e2\u0080\u0094!</i>\" Was the only sound he manage through clenched teeth as he felt that tight ring crushing against his sensitive belly, and as soon as he felt his once fluffy tail was relieved of the pressure of being pinned to his back side, his lower body folded over under the tremendous strain to his abdomen, desperately trying somewhat to alleviate the pain\u00e2\u0080\u0094the tips of his paws feebly kicking against the fleshy walls as he tried to maintain a fetal position. Flare could tell the Charizard was enjoying himself from the outside. Every time his lower legs kicked against the fleshy walls, a pleasured moan could be heard as well as the Charizard's touch as he played with himself. Flare couldn't comprehend how someone could be so utterly heartless towards him\u00e2\u0080\u0094how he could be treated so horribly for no reason? He wouldn't wish these feeling on his worst enemy, but this Charizard... not only did he hate him... he was thriving on his suffering! He was nothing more than a toy to the beast, teasing him to no end and loving every second of it.</div></font></span><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Original</i></div></span></div></div>",

He couldn't breath\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCharizard's grip was clenching tight around his neck. Flare let out a choked gasp, his eyes would have been wide as saucers if not for the clenching walls preventing them from opening! He kicked frantically as panic set in. The grip was only growing stronger! He swore he would be crushed at any moment, but the Charizard had other plans as he felt the grip around his neck finally loosen, only to placed further up around his snout. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare briefly heard the Charizard taunt him before giving him one last tight squeeze, the walls squelching around him loudly as he was forced down with great speed as he felt the fleshy tube seal around snout before depositing completely within the confine of the Charizard's sweltering balls. Flare eyes\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfinally being free from the crushing force\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshot open as he gasped for breath, almost choking on the foul musk and thick seed that glazed over his body upon entry before breaking down in tears. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>It's so dark... so... dark</i>, he thought. Helpless and alone as he felt the walls clenching, kneading the Charizard's cum deep into his thick, matted fur. Flare still could not believe this was happening as he remained unmoving as his reality caved in around him like the fleshy walls. He was speechless, the anxiety he felt slowly build as he dwelled more and more on what would come. Flare was going to die soon, his existence snuffed out, and used as nothing more then another load for this sadistic monster that consumed him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He was still so young, and had so much to still look forward to... he would never get to feel the caring warmth of love... to experience the joy of making love with someone he loves. The more he thought about such things, the deeper he sank into despair, and it was not long before he started to hyperventilate as he felt the hot walls literally closing around him!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, when I say it's time for fun... I meant for myself of course,\" he heard the Charizard say. Those words rung clear in Flare's mind as the feeling of pure dread washed over him. The Charizard couldn't just let him die in peace. Hadn't he been through enough already? <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare curled tight, hugging his lower body as he wallowed in fear, crying. The Charizard had other plans though and soon he felt the Charizard fondling him as he did on the way down, coaxing him to struggle for this monster's own amusement.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"J-just l-leave me alone!\" Flare screamed, his voice cracking under the strain... to his surprise though, the Charizard seemed to listen.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I bet it's pretty dark in there...\" the Charizard's voice sounded almost like there was a hint of concern in it, but Flare knew better. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why do y-you care!\" Flare wept,  his sorrow was turning to anger as the Charizard spoke to him. He never felt so much hatred for another creature in his entire life. Already he could feel the flood gates opening and his rage building\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtingling from within his throat. The Charizard had began to speak but Flare had enough and cut him off with a \"<i>Fuck you! You...you...</i>!\" Flare couldn't think clearly as he found him self at a loss of words. Instead he just buried his head between his paws, his body trembling uncontrollable.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Haha! That's good!\" the Charizard chuckled as he gave his bulge a firm grab, electing a startled yelp form Flare. \"I was beginning to wonder if you were even capable of showing anger, though its not like it will do you any good now,\" he smirked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Tell me Sloshy... do you feel tingly yet? Charizard spoke with an ominous tone to his voice. He felt Flare freeze up upon utter those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare hadn't noticed until the Charizard had brought it up, but he could indeed feel a slight tingling sensation where his paws had been submerged. It had not been a strong sensation, but he knew that as time went on that would begin to change. The anger he once felt began to fade again\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis attitude reverting back to the scared Flareon he always had been after realizing what this meant. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No-no-no-no-no... \" Flare muttered as panic befell him once more, trying to do what ever he could to crawl back and away from the small pool of semen. Of course, this had been pointless. There was absolutely no room to do such, and instead he found himself stretching his legs out so to use the fleshy walls to hoist himself out of the liquid.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unfortunately for Flare, he only found himself sliding back down into the potent seed below, only spreading more of the smelly substance over more of his body. Charizard was clearly enjoying his pathetic attempts to delay the inevitable though as Flare could hear him moaning as he stretched the walls around him as he attempted to get away from the Charizard's seed. He even felt the dragon fondling him again from the outside, causing him to slip around and at one point being flipped over completely, momentarily submerging his whole head in cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare began to panic more as he choked violently on the Charizard's cum, desperate to catch his breath again while trying his hardest to wipe the sticky gunk from his eyes with his forelegs! The tingling he had felt just moments ago now intensifying to the point that it felt like his skin was crawling! <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please! I-I am\u00e2\u20ac\u201d I am s-sorry about what I- I said!\" He begged; the worry in his voice becoming more clear, much to the Charizard's delight. \"Please j-just let m-me go! I'll\u00e2\u20ac\u201d I'll do d-do what ever you want, just-<i>Aaah!</i>\" Flare cried out as he felt his captor's weight bare down on him!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You fucking coward... you don't even deserve to be called a fire type, much less be a fucking Flareon!\" The Charizard snapped back. \"I've seen new born Eevee's with more spine then you!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard's words cut Flare deep as the anger in the Charizard's outburst sent shivers throughout his body.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"P-please...hic I\u00e2\u20ac\u201d I n-never even w-w-wanted t-to sniff t-to be a F-Flareon in the f-first place!\" Flare sobbed, trying his hardest to form words. \"I-I was f-forced into hic e-e-evolving by hic b-by my father!\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare felt the Charizard shift, easing off some of the weight that he had put on the Flareon. Did he just strike a chord with him? Flare waited for him to say something... anything that might hint at such. Instead\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe Charizard's choice of words that followed only confused him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You never did answer me earlier... about the darkness...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"H-huh? W-what do\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\" what came next made Flare's heart sink like a stone. He felt the Charizard shift a little before he saw a faint glow in the darkness\u00e2\u20ac\u201dan orange glow that grew in intensity until the darkness that once blanketed him began to lift, revealing the horrors that were once hidden to him!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard wore a wicked smile on his face as he rolled over onto his back, his wings surrounding his body as he brought his tail flame into contact with his bulge using one claw while casually stroking his cock with the other. What followed had to be the most wonderful sound to grace his ears as Flare let out the most terrified scream he has heard yet\u00e2\u20ac\u201da burst of life coming from his captive as his bulge began to frantically thrash about with new found energy! Charizard groaned as he craned his neck back over the armrest of the couch, his tongue lulling from his mouth as a newfound wave of pure ecstasy rushed through him!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yesss\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 just like that... <i>umph</i> Sloshy... nhgh,\" Charizard groaned as he arched his back a little from the pleasure, his toes popping as they curled from the feeling of his prey's struggles.</div></font></span><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Original</i></div></span></div></div>",

This monster had revealed everything he once could not see, using the bright light his tail flame produced to illuminate the flesh prison. Flare could see in great detail as the walls pulsed around him\u00e2\u20ac\u201doozing fresh seed as they worked into his once fluffy coat. This monster\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe wanted him to witness first hand the horrors of being digested, watching as his body broke down to fuel the beast's next climax! At the moment there was nothing to see, but Flare knew that would change as time passed and the thought of that scared him more than anything. This was too much for him, and just like that, he felt his adrenaline levels spike! All the pain he had felt... the numbness that was his entire lower body... it was all but eclipsed by terror as he violently kicked at the walls. Watching as they conformed around, and absorbed his blows!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please! Just let me out!\" Flare begged through his tear-filled eyes, but no matter what he did\u00e2\u20ac\u201dno matter how hard he kicked and screamed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe Charizard just grunted, playing with him once more by pressing down on him hard, and forcing him into the ever growing puddle that Flare bathed in!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Keep up the good fight Sloshy! Maybe there is still hope for you yet!\" Charizard grunted as he gave his prey a firm squeeze. Of course, he knew Flare would not have what it takes to actually make him cum. This was not his first time around the block, toying with his prey, but he loved the effort all the same. He enjoyed the torment\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgiving his prey a false since of hope. It made the thrill all the more enjoyable! <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The process is slow Sloshy... you still have a chance before it's too late...\" Charizard spoke with a smug tone of voice. If Flare could see the Charizard's face, he would have seen him grinning like crazy.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Stop calling me that!\" Flare screamed, or at least tried to as best he could with his voice still sore, periodically filled with cum, and from Charizard's tongue having violated his throat. He continued to thrash about, doing what ever he could to try and fend off the Charizard's teasing prods as he tried  to submerge him into the rising cum. Flare even tried using his claws to attempt to scratch his way through, but no matter how hard he tried or how fast he swiped, his claws never took hold! The walls just absorbed the blows, and the seed allowed for his claws to glide right over! He could not get any kind of hold! His frustration was once again turning to worry as his voice turned into more of a panicked whine, as he tried so hard to fight for his freedom. Flare knew the Charizard was fucking with him, but the Charizard was clearly getting off to this. Maybe he could still get away if he could only make him cum!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"In about an hour or two it wont <i>matter</i> now will it!\" Charizard emphasized his statement with a forceful press of his claw, electing a pained yelp from Flare. He had Flare pinned and he made it obvious just how little he cared as he pressed firmly on his struggling form, moaning as he smothered him into his cum. Charizard began licking his lips in anticipation for the real fun as he felt Flare's panic intensify under his grasp\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis muffled begging making him spurt a few drops of precum onto his belly as he stroked his cock more, before finally letting up on the poor Flareon. He could hear as he gasped, finally getting some air after being forced under the cum pool. Charizard just grinned, enjoying the thought of making this bitch choke on his seed. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"As much as I want to feel you break under my grasp. I want to savor this moment,\" Charizard huffed. \"Any minute now, that tingling is gonna start to hurt... it's nothing compared to stomach acid, but its not pleasant either, and I'm gonna enjoy feeling you fall apart slowly, and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it...\" Charizard smiled. He knew his words were getting to Flare. He could already feel the Flareon quaking in fear again\u00e2\u20ac\u201da faint sniffling coming from him that only grew louder as his words sank deep. It took a moment but Flare finally broke the silence. If it were not for the stillness of the night, he would not have understood him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"P\u00e2\u20ac\u201dplease... show s\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsome mercy...\" Flare's voice was weak and pitiful as he stared with blurry eyes down at the tingling pool he had been submerged in, still shocked by what he sees. Not only had the tingling feeling start to gradually grow stronger, he felt his skin start to itch. Not only that, but a large amount of his fur had began to float to the surface of the come pool. He wanted to close his eyes\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto pretend none of this was really happening\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut he could not. No matter how hard he tried, his own morbid curiosity would not allow him to look away.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Flare snapped from his daze as he felt the Charizard thrust his hips, resulting in a startled cry from the Flareon as the cum splashed over him! Reality set in once again as he felt his world collapsing! He needed to get out! Flare frantically kicked at the walls once more, a look of horror plastered on his face a he clawed desperately at the entrance to his prison, trying desperately to pry open the fleshy tunnel! <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"P\u00e2\u20ac\u201dplease Charizard! I\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI don't\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot like this! I\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI just w\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwant to go home!\" <i>W\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhy!... Why c\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcan't\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI</i>, Flare froze up as he looked at his paws. They trembled uncontrollably , but that not what caught his attention. His claws\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe ones he tried to tear his way out with just moments ago\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey were no longer there! They were gone! He tried to feel them, but it was as if he never <i>had</i> them! It was after this realization that his attention was brought to his legs and that itchy sensation he had felt creeping up his waist! \"No...no-no- Ch\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Charizard! Please! I-can't... I d\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddon't want sniff t\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto die\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlike this! Please!\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare began to thrash about, the thick seed churning around him... churning! It was burning just like Charizard said! This can't be it! This could not really be happening! He was gonna die! His life snuffed out like he were nothing! Why was this happening to him! He never did anything to deserve this! <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well Sloshy...I would, but... I simply have no mercy to give to such a useless Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon... enjoy your final moments on this earth... it's not like anyone will notice your absence,\" Charizard grunted.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If Flare hadn't lost control of his emotions by this point, he did now. Flare cried out, ignoring the pain in his throat as he unleashed a powerful, rage\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfueled flamethrower at the tight confines of the Charizard. Of course such action proved futile as Charizard just chuckled before pressing down on his glowing bulge, snuffing out the flame entirely as Flare was plunged beneath cum once more.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You should not have done that Sloshy\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat might have worked on a grass-type, but not me!\" Charizard spoke, craning his neck closer to his Flare who desperately fought to free himself from beneath the rising seed. \"That little stunt of yours did nothing more then tickle a little. Though I have to admit\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit did feel pretty nice, but all you managed to do was speed up the process...\" he said, finally allowing Flare to breach the surface once more.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard had been right, Flare felt the temperature around him dramatically increase\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe walls baring down upon him with great force, threatening to dunk him bellow the now churning seed once again! Flare let out a pained whine as he tried to fight against the force. His back was starting to burn and his legs felt as if they would give out any moment! The tingling he felt early had now spread to every part of his body and in just moments his ears starting to feel the burning effects of the volatile seed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Without thinking, Flare reached up and tried to wipe the cum that clung to his face, but when he felt his paw give way, being replaced by a dull pain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe froze, staring wide eyed in horror by the feeling. The feeling was numb\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe feeling of his paw\u00e2\u20ac\u201dFlare watched as the shape of it slowly melted, then he heard a disgusting <i>plop</i> and just like that, he could no longer feel the end of his paw, just a dull throbbing where his paw used to be. Flare just sat there, staring ahead with a shocked look plastered across his face. He dare not look down... he knew what he would see, but when he suddenly saw the other paw give out right before his eyes, he could not help but follow its decent\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe sound of the glob splashing into the cum pool bellow with another sickening splat echoing within his mind. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare sat there, staring in horror as he had watched as a part of him seemingly break down before his eyes and dispersed across the surface of the churning seed, his red fur blending in slowly with the milky substance. He wanted to scream, but he found himself shaky, unable to process fully what he had witnessed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthen burst into tears again as reality set in... it was to late for him now. He was as good as dead, and nothing could save him. He had reached the point of no return...</span></font></div><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Original</i></div></span></div></div>",

His legs could no longer support the weight of the walls that were closing in around him, and soon found him self plunging below the churning seed, taking a mouthful of the disgusting sperm in the process.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard let out a low rumble leave his throat as he felt a part of the Flareon's body give out within him. The sound of Flare's pleas being cut short mid sentence made him shiver from the pleasure as he felt Flare panic within him! Already he could feel himself edging ever closer to an orgasm, but he quickly caught himself before he lost to his primal desires. He had to save himself for Bree, no matter how much he desperately wanted to paint the walls with this Flareon. Charizard took a deep breath, trying to drown out these wonderful feelings of Flare thrashing about inside him, trying to stay above the surface\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe occasional cries of the panicking Flareon making it to his ears when he manage to surface above the cum pool.

The walls were beginning to squeeze around him; relentless, waves of force threatening to crush him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard could feel his balls\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe internal muscles that made them up\u00e2\u20ac\u201dclenching tight around the wiggling Flareon to the point that he could see the bulge he made.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's time,\" Charizard cut himself off with a moan \"for you to serve a purpose, meat...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard placed a claw firmly on Flare. He relished Flare's dying pleas for help before giving one last firm grab. Charizard's eyes widened as he felt a rush of pleasure surge through him upon feeling Flare's fragile form collapse within his grasp. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Hngh</i>!\" He clenched the base of his cock as hard as he could\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis balls contracting as they tried to expel cum.

He moved fast as he clenched the base of his throbbing cock with his other claw, desperate not to let any of his newly made seed from escaping as he road out his climax. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I need to think of something else</i>, Charizard thought as he stared at the wall in front of him. He had to use every ounce of his will, to force himself to zone out completely. He just kept staring at the wall, thinking about nothing but the wall\u00e2\u20ac\u201devery little detail of it from the texture, to the odd shade of color it took under the orange glow from his tail flame. It took time, but eventually he felt his spasms fade until finally he had reached that point where he felt safe to release his death grip. A puff of flame burst from between his lips as he released the breath he had been holding, careful to cover its light with his wings as he sighed with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Hmmf</i>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 that was too close...\" he said with a great sigh as he felt a little bit of the fresh cum that he just made dribbling onto his belly.

Charizard grinned as he looked at the small amount of cum that had managed to escape and grinned. He could not fight the urge to give it a lick, pleasantly surprised by its unique flavor.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shame... I almost regret not eating you Flare... almost...\" the dragon grinned before cleaning himself of the small mess Flare had made, making sure not to leave any traces lift. He was proud... successfully managing to contain most of his Flareon\u00e2\u20ac\u201dinfused seed. <i>Eeveelutions always make the best loads</i>, now it was time. Charizard would make his move tonight and express these feelings for Bree that he'd held for far too long... but how? Charizard looked back towards the bedroom. He could hear Bree's heavy breathing, snoring softly as if nothing happened...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn, Umbreon... how does one become such a heavy sleeper?\" Charizard muttered beneath his breath as he thought about how he would go about it.</span></font></div><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Original</i></div></span></div></div>",

The thick slosh Flare made is taking a toll on his sex, which for the life of him he could not make flaccid or even stop leaking. Not like he wanted it to stop, anyways, but the thought still counts. His cock pulsed for every time he had tried to move, his internal cum-sac was filled to the brim, ready for release.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh Umbreon~!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard shuddered. Already he felt like bursting again once he started imagining himself and Umbreon in the room, his claws trailing along the dark-type\u00e2\u0080\u0099s small hips, his body pressing Umbreon into the sheets while he tasted the small Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fur like he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always wanted to, Umbreon weakly looking up to smile back at Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own lusty grin\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>Gah!</i>\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard winced and leaned forward to stand, bracing once more to stop himself from ejaculating. There was no time, he had to go now, or the night would be ruined.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He stood up, wobbling slightly. Charizard drooled at the good time he was about to have, the good time he <i>deserved</i>, the good time <i>Umbreon</i> deserved! He stumbled into the doorway of the room, his tail once again interfering with Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s natural glow like when he lured out Flare earlier. He shook with an overwhelming wave of euphoria and wanting. Umbreon was still asleep.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He tumbled over, barely keeping himself composed as he clenched the sheets at the foot of the bed. Then with effort he raised himself onto the soft, fireproof bedding and managed to loom over the sleeping Umbreon. His cock was standing out\u00e2\u0080\u0094the thick, hard base to the tapered, leaking tip\u00e2\u0080\u0094the throbbing, all out and hovering over Bree. Umbreon was on his back, paws in the air and his body partially hidden in the sheets, and his mouth slightly open, and the whole prompted a peace so calm that Charizard held back an \u00e2\u0080\u0098<i>aw</i>.\u00e2\u0080\u0099<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Agh\u00e2\u0080\u0094you sexy little thing! Presenting even when you're asleep, just another reason why I love you!</i> Charizard moaned while examining the rest of Umbreon. Flare was hard when Charizard arrived, but Umbreon seemed in need of a bit of encouragement. <i>I've been waiting for so long!</i> Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grin twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Umbreon flinched from the sudden force. Groaning, he tried to stretch\u00e2\u0080\u0094but two massive claws held his upper body in place. He huffed and opened his eyes to see Charizard. For a moment he floundered about the different reasons Charizard had woken him up, but an unnaturally strong heat and accompanying smell caught his attention. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cCharizard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Umbreon could not look down to see what it was, but more pressing question\u00e2\u0080\u0094now that he noticed\u00e2\u0080\u0094why was Charizard pinning him down into the bed?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Umbreon!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stupor made Umbreon snap his attention to the dragon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou're so\u00e2\u0080\u0094cute! And I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he was really trying to speak \u00e2\u0080\u009cI uh\u00e2\u0080\u0094for a long time I've been wanting to\u00e2\u0080\u0094well\u00e2\u0080\u0094it's all down there, and I like you and I thought, well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Umbreon gave Charizard a quizzical but interested look. Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gigantic body was covering up whatever you could see of Umbreon, who was both comforted and intimidated by the warm embrace.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy are you so\u00e2\u0080\u0094what are you do<i>ing!</i>?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Umbreon squeaked. His eyes widened when he felt something prod against his rear. Umbreon shifted uncomfortably. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCharizard? What's this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope I don't disappoint, for you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the dragon lowered his head and licked Umbreon across the forehead. Bree's eyes were swirls for a brief moment before shaking his head out of the dazing swipe.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey are you alright?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>Umbreon!</i>\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard boomed, Bree inhaled sharply when the dragon dove his arms under his body and wrapped him in a tight hug. \u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>Oh</i>! You're such a turn-on! I love you so much! You're so hot and adorable and I just can't keep hiding it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard squeezed Umbreon again, whose confused mumbles were drowned out by the orange mass. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cCh<i>mmph!</i> Wht'r <i>ygrrmhh!</i>\u00e2\u0080\u009d Umbreon pushed and strained to get Charizard off to no avail. The prodding became a pushing, and there was a discernible slickness that spread between his cheeks. Umbreon paused, wide-eyed. <i>He\u00e2\u0080\u0094he's\u00e2\u0080\u0094is that his...?

The Umbreon couldn't properly fight back against the dripping appendage that was now prying at the entrance of his ass, eager to make entry.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Char<i>mmph</i>! <i>Waimph!</i>\" Bree tried to object, but his words were thoroughly muffled beneath Charizard's gut! His mind was reeling about the things Charizard was saying, about how he made him feel good, and how he found him cute. Bree had never thought about the possibility of Charizard being gay in the first place, but here he was, pinning him into the bed, professing his love, all while preparing to fuck him!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bree was not sure how he felt about the predicament he was currently in. He had always had a thing for guys, he even had a few fantasies regarding his long time friend,  but this was so sudden\u00e2\u0080\u0094so direct! He was not sure what to make of it! He should be happy, but he had just woken up and Charizard seemed to be a whole different Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon as he professed his love for him! He was not used to this side of him at all, nonetheless feeling Charizard's touch\u00e2\u0080\u0094the warmth of the dragon's entire body baring down upon him as his cock tickled at his back door, and the overpowering musk wafting around his nose. Bree could not help but start to feel his own excitement build\u00e2\u0080\u0094his own secret fantasies he had for his roommate starting to become a reality\u00e2\u0080\u0094his emotions were conflicted as he continued to fight against the hulking mass on top of him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just relax Umbreon... there's no need to fight it...\" Charizard whispered as he gave Bree another affectionate lick against his chin, the only part of his body that was not buried beneath the dragon. He could see Bree's face straining as he tried to fight back, but he knew he secretly wanted this\u00e2\u0080\u0094a blush spread across Umbreon's face\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was a mission to get Bree to open up to him like he did. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard could feel the soft fur of the dark-type's plush butt resisting, not permitting access to what he desired, but he would not be denied. He has waited so long for this, and there was no going back now. Charizard proceeded to tease Bree's rear, being sure he was properly lubricated before he started. Unlike Flare, he loved Bree; Charizard did not wish to harm to the precious being beneath him. He wanted to be sure he was ready before he proceeded further, having gone no more than a inch or two within the Umbreon's tight ring\u00e2\u0080\u0094though he had to admit, it took every ounce of his will not to ravage that ass. The dragon's patience was rewarded as Bree's struggles slowed, and the familiar push of Eeveelution cock grew beneath him\u00e2\u0080\u0094its prodding a welcoming sign for Charizard to proceed further.</div></font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Twines</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><div align=\"justify\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>This\u00e2\u0080\u0094he's so huge!</i> Bree hyperventilated as Charizard moved his claws down to grope at his sides. <i>Is he really going to stick that in me? </i> Bree shuddered in pleasure when his own cock was smothered by Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gentle belly. Umbreon struggled to move his trapped paws. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCh<i>mrzmph</i>!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bree squirmed as Charizard started the action they both were waiting for.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard granted himself entrance, gradually thrusting into the tight, lubricated ring, the second hole he's made use of in one night. Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth gaped open and stars were in his eyes, while Charizard was smiling with hearts in his. Umbreon hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t taken someone as big as Charizard before, and already he could feel new muscles and places in his rear he hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t felt before. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!

Charizard knew full well that Umbreon would have one, he knew how much Umbreon would want this to happen, and it was only a matter of time.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cGa<i>hmph!

Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard dick was only softened by the surreal amount of pre that he generated, and Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fleshy insides. How long had he been waiting to do this?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard gasped internally when he heard Bree whimper, the final sign that this was as far as he was comfortable with, which surprisingly meant his whole foot of cock. Umbreon breathed in shaky successions as Charizard pulled out. The dragon tensed up while trying not to ram his cock back up Bree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tempting ass. He thrust slightly faster, a slick friction between the love, and a heated sensation in his cum sac.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Umbreon, while under the cover of the overpowering dragon and the soft grace of the bed, managed to stop struggling entirely and fitted himself into the only position Charizard was allowing\u00e2\u0080\u0094spread legs and two folded paws. He did not have the dexterity of a claw or a flexible tail to move Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0094he was simply stuck with his gigantic roommate atop him as the dragon set the pace.</div></font></span><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Original</i></div></span></div></div>",

Instead he passed himself as best he could\u00e2\u20ac\u201dignoring the beautiful sounds of their love making.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Ohhh! He's really getting into this!</i> Charizard thought as he looked down at his new found lover, his tongue hanging from mouth as he stared down at Bree\u00e2\u20ac\u201donly a little of the yellow from the moonlight Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon's eyes visible as he stared off ahead, his mind lost to wonder lust. Charizard could feel as Umbreon's body finally began to accept his rampaging coc. Umbreon's body still remained wonderfully tight even after, feeling every little detail of Bree's heavenly insides clench around his cock as if to never let him go. He could feel Bree's throbbing beneath his belly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlubing his chest much like Flare did when he ravaged him too.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your pleasure\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis my pleasure...\" Charizard huffed into one of the Umbreon's ears\u00e2\u20ac\u201dknowing the Eeveelution's body was reacting to his words as light whispers began to leave Bree's lips once his pleasure had built to unstable levels. Umbreon made the cutest expressions as he desperately tried to hold out longer, but Charizard knew he would not last like he could. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard made sure not to smother the poor thing to death as he took great effort in allowing the Umbreon's head to gasp for the breath he needed when their love making intensified. It had been over ten minutes now and neither one of them have cum yet, but both Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon were reaching their limits fast as both increased their efforts, seeing who would last the longest\u00e2\u20ac\u201dneither one of them ever wanting this moment to end as they enjoyed each other's embrace.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"M\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmy god Umbreon! You h-have no idea how long I have waited\u00e2\u20ac\u201d<i>mmph</i>\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfor this!\" Charizard said between strained breaths as he professed his feeling for dark-type beneath him. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I love you, Umbreon!\"</div></font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Twines</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><div align=\"justify\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Umbreon couldn't take it anymore, the moment Charizard finally said it, his cock erupted with shot after shot of white stain against Charizard and his sensual belly. Even though Bree was not large, and not even a fire type, Charizard still felt the power of Umbreon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arousal spraying between their bodies. The dark-type howled out in pleasure, much to Charizard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s limits, as when the dragon saw his tiny partner so drowned in his lusts, his own cock buried inside, he finally came. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All of Flare, or what had been of him, seemingly exploded from Charizard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inner workings, making his dick bulge and pump the thick slosh right into Bree's hole. Umbreon squealed suddenly from the rush of overwhelming cum, his gut ensuing pleasure and pain before he tried to hold it in. Charizard wanted to unleash everything. Immediately he felt the weight of Flare deposit through his dick.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bree winced and started to gag, before it was evident that Charizard was pumping too much and he was about to gag up cum through his mouth. With all of the willpower Charizard could muster, he pulled out while still brandishing ropes and ropes of sloppy seed. The dragon humped against the moonlight Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon as he finished out his massive orgasm, to which each lump of hot musk coated Umbreon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stomach almost as a fit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Umbreon released a moan of relief as he felt so much pressure escape through his backdoor, leaking onto the bed. However, he was interrupted by gigantic globs of seed splashing into his face, and legs, and paws, and belly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis whole body, save for his back. He clenched his eyes shut and pressed his paws, slippery as they may be, against Charizard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never-ending spew of slosh. <i>There's so much!! Holy shit!</i> Umbreon thought through the torrents.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard felt his rampage coming to a close as the last of his seed slapped against Umbreon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pinned form. He shut his eyes for a brief moment as lust overcame him, flopping to his side and letting his cock rest wherever it pleased, which meant Umbreon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face. The dragon huffed, his chest rising and falling with every deep intake of air. For the first time, he'd actually felt sleepy after such an orgasm... for his first time, he fainted beside Umbreon, leaving the dark-type to wallow in the pool of cum left both inside him, and on him.</div></font></span><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Original</i></div></span></div></div>",

The words Charizard spoke still rang clear in his mind. <i>I love you... Umbreon.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bree shifted a little under Charizard's cock, which still laid across his face\u00e2\u20ac\u201dits slick flesh gliding across his maw as it slowly retracted back into hiding. He could still feel the intoxicating effects of its musk lingering on the end of his noise, only just now noticing the similarities between its smell and the funny smell he has woken up to in the past. \"God... how did I never make the connection before...\" Bree muttered under his breath. It's not like he was unfamiliar with the smell of musk\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmaybe he was just too tired to notice such things in the mornings, after all, he was not a morning kind of guy by any means. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Letting loose a heavy sigh\u00e2\u20ac\u201dBree placed two paws over his enlarged belly, closing his eyes once again whilst he traced his digits over his cum-soaked fur. He felt such a wonderful feeling of fulfillment within him, unlike other times he'd had sex. Even now he could feel the heat radiating from Charizard's massive load, still just as hot as it was when Charizard came in, and onto him. <i>This is going to be a nightmare to clean...</i> Bree thought, but he did not mind, to him it was worth it. It was not long after closing his eyes did the Umbreon realize something\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsomething that sent a chill down his spine\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe had a guest over... didn't he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The scene that ensued would have been comical if anybody had been around to see it. A cum-drenched Umbreon flailing in state of panic as he tried to flip upright onto his feet, only to flop around like a Magikarp out of water, but the water being the seed he splashed around. Bree ended up falling face first once or twice, unable to gain proper traction due to all the seed he had been covered in, but once he finally did he proceeded to look across the bed eagerly. Bree held his breath in his lungs as he looked, praying that some how, some way, Flare managed to sleep through their fun.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>How the hell could I forget!</i> Umbreon was borderline screaming on the inside! How would he even begin explaining himself to Flare? Bree paced around the massive bed trying not to disturb anyone and leaving little splotches of cum where ever he stepped. <i>Wait... where did?</i> Bree looked over at where Charizard collapsed. For a brief moment his heart sank as he thought about the possibility that Flare had been smothered beneath the his roommate, but he quickly pushed the thought away. Surely he would have made some sort of ruckus if that was the case. Upon further inspection, it appeared Flare was nowhere to be found. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Oh thank god!</i> Bree sighed as his panic began to subside, but he was not out of the woods yet. If Flare wasn't in his room, then where in the world was he? Surely he did not up in leave at this time of night?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not wanting to look for Flare covered in cum, Bree jumped off the edge of the bed heading straight for the bathroom, quickly shutting the door and turning on the lights, before heading into the walk-in shower and hitting a button. The silence was broken by the sound of rushing water hitting tile, and the viscous fluid began to slip from the Umbreon's fur, pooling around the drain.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What is\u00e2\u20ac\u201d!\" Bree spotted something he hadn't noticed until now. <i>Is that... red hair?</i> Bree stared at the fur trap on the drain. Mixed among the black strands of hair were larger strands of red and cream colored fur. Bree looked down at his body\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsure enough, there was red hairs plastered all over his body within the seed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Did I happen to roll over where Flare was laying? Surely he does not shed this much... </i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thirty minutes passed by as Bree diligently removed the absurd amount of seed from his fur, astonished by the ever growing build up of fur in the trap, even clogging the drain a few times in the process. The sheer amount of shedding easily dwarfed a weeks worth of the usual amount, and by the time the Umbreon had finished, very little of his own fur could be seen among the soggy mess.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was obvious at this point that something was off, and a sense of unease began linger into the Umbreon's mind. The amount of fur was worrisome\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit would be hard to imagine such a large amount having fallen off without noticeable change in Flare's overall appearance. Bree decided best to just shake himself dry, not wanting to make to much noise this late in the night. His fur was short after all\u00e2\u20ac\u201d the drier was more of a convenience than a necessity.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 With the stealth of a natural born hunter, Bree made his way through the house in search of Flare, his steps unheard as he moved about like a ghost, his rings not aglow. The light from Charizard's tail flame was all he needed to provide the light for his natural night vision. The cum tracks he had made had traces of Flare's fur in them just as he suspected, but he did not jump onto the bed yet, fearing what he might see. First he would check the other rooms of the house\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmaybe this was all just some sort of misunderstanding. Maybe Flare had some allergic reaction to the bed fabric or something, causing a bunch of his fur to fall out. Maybe he left in the night to avoid the embarrassment.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bree's normal, oblivious demeanor faded as he searched, eyes on the lookout for anything that may tell of Flare's whereabouts, but other then a little bit of fur here and there, nothing seemed to be out of place. This was a problem how ever. If Flare was losing his fur, would it not be all over the place?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bree had began to grow increasingly worried as he made his way into the living room where the house entrance was located. Nothing, there were no signs of hair loss anywhere\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot even by the only exit. Bree's thoughts began to race, he had a bad feeling about all of this, and as much as much as he hated himself for thinking it\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis mind wandered to Charizard.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both Flare and Charizard were awake when he went to sleep. He had been aware of Charizard's predatory nature, and on a few occasions noticed him trying to hide it, but it was a rare occurrence, and he had been friends with the dragon for years. The dragon had been nothing but kind to him. He had no reason to report it to authorities, and even if he wanted to, he would not have had the heart to do so. But this whole thing was starting to scare him now. What if Charizard really did something to Flare, would Charizard really eat a friend of his? Someone as innocent and shy as Flare?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bree felt sick just thinking about it\u00e2\u20ac\u201dor maybe it was the seed that filled his belly. Whether it was due to his anxiousness, the feeling of being to full, or both, Bree started to feel as if something was about to come up, so he quickly made his way to the bathroom, back into the walk-in shower. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This once wonderful feeling of fullness did not feel so great now that the throws of passion were not apart of the equation. The jostling from the thick, heavy cum making him more nauseous as he picked up speed. He barely made it to the bathroom before the contents of his stomach abruptly forced its way up. Bree's body locked up as he felt all control go out the window, his stomach contracting, working hard to force the thick viscous seed out of his body. Bree clenched his eyes as he heaved over the drain, his eyes watering as his body strained itself. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The cum was far too thick to simply be expelled from his body\u00e2\u20ac\u201dinstead the cum just poured  to the floor from his mouth, the thick strands hanging from his maw as the Umbreon finally got the chance to take a breath. Bree just sat there a moment, taking time to collect himself again. If it were not for the unpleasant straining and the slight amount of bile that was mixed with the seed, he might have found the taste enjoyable.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I still can't believe just how pent up Charizard\u00e2\u20ac\u201d</i> Bree paused. He noticed something... the unpleasant feeling of fur within his mouth. Bree made a weird face as he seemed to lick at the air trying to spit out the hair, and after a few seconds he spat down at his feet.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"W\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhat is... this?\" Bree muttered, his voice shaky as he stared at what he spit up. A cold shiver went down his spine as he looked at the floor speechless. The cum that spluttered at his feet took on a distinctive red color. At first he thought he was staring at blood\u00e2\u20ac\u201dperhaps Charizard had ruptured something inside him during their fun, but a closer inspection revealed this to not be the case. \"Fur!? W-Why would!?\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\"  the realization hit Bree hard and fast as he slowly made his way to the bed, hesitating for a moment before leaping atop the mattress\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis rings bright as he surveyed the mess Charizard had made. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The once beautiful comforter was seemingly stained beyond hope of ever being cleaned, the white seed tinted red from the fur, that could not be have belonged to anyone else but Flare. \"H-how... how could he\u00e2\u20ac\u201d \" Bree felt his stomach turning again. What was left of Flare was currently settling within his belly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand Charizard had put him there!</span></font></div><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Original</i></div></span></div></div>",

For the first time in years, a deep growl emanated deep from within. \"Why...\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bree's voice was quiet at first, far too silent to wake the exhausted fire dragon who proceeded to snore, completely unaware that he had been caught red-handed. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Charizard!\" Bree shouted as tears filled his eyes... but the dragon remained deep asleep, oblivious to his partner\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat is until the slumbering dragon received a well placed headbutt right between the eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In hindsight, a headbutt directly to the face may not have been the brightest idea, but the overwhelming emotions had clouded Bree's judgment for the worst, and before he had known what had happen, he found himself on the receiving end of a skull bash\u00e2\u20ac\u201dBree's relatively light body thrown from the bed with ease as he soared across the room, colliding against the wall with a loud thud before crumpling to the floor. Bree clenched his eyes both in pain, and from feeling the very room rattle around him from the roar that shook the house's foundation.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the hell! Ow!\" Charizard stopped mid-sentence as he saw his Umbreon laying on the other side of the room struggling to stand. All the anger in his voice quickly turning to worry in a instant. \"Umbreon!\" Charizard was on his feet in an instant, fearing that he'd injured his partner. He did not give it a second thought as to why Bree attacked him in the first place, all that mattered was Bree's well-being.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Umbreon are you okay?\" Charizard's voice was gentle\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsomething few have heard as he helped the Umbreon to his paws, his touch delicate as to not make matters worse. Fortunately there wasn't anything serious looking from what he could tell, but something was off. Bree seemed tense, actively avoiding direct eye contact as he helped him to his feet, and even then he could feel Bree trembling within his grasp as he helped to steady him. The twinkle of his flame refracting off a fallen tear drop caught his eye. \"Bree?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How could you,\" Charizard felt his heart stop cold as he heard Bree utter those words, his voice was serious. This was unlike him, Charizard hadn't heard him growl before\u00e2\u20ac\u201dever! This was coming from the usually care free, cheerful Umbreon. Deep down Charizard knew why, but a part of him prayed it was something else, like throwing him into the wall on accident.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bree what are you\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't play dumb with me Charizard! Where's Flare!\" Bree barked. Umbreon had looked up at Charizard with his bright yellow eyes glaring back with an unfathomable hatred, which Charizard took a second glance in disbelief. Tears were brimming from the corners of the moonlight Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon's eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>How did he figure it out? What gave it away? But I made sure not to leave any evidence! Maybe I can still...</i> \"Bree just relax... I walked him home last!\" Charizard felt the clack of his jaws rattle his skull, seeing stars for a brief moment the weight of the tiny Umbreon's thick skull slamming into his jaw, catching him completely off guard and sending him stumbling back against the bed! Charizard, in a attempt to catch himself, used an arm as a brace as he feel against the soft comforter. He felt his claw land in something cold\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsomething very slimy. Charizard reactively pulled his claw away in disgust.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ugh!\" He froze in his tracks. <i>Oh shit...</i> Charizard stared at his claw\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis eyes as wide a saucers as he looked at the mess. His claws were drenched in cum, but that was not all it was. Long red hairs covered it, much like tar and feathers. He could hardly even see the orange of his own skin past the cum and fur! <i>What!? I didn't give Flare enough time to digest!</i> Charizard felt his world beginning to fall apart around him! He had been caught all because he was too eager to fuck Bree! <i>No! How could I be so careless!</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u00e2\u20ac\u201d I can explain!\" Charizard felt himself beginning to panic! His heart racing as he quickly tried to come up with something\u00e2\u20ac\u201danything! But nothing was coming to him. How could he possibly explain this to Bree! Deep down, he was tearing himself apart. The more he thought about it, the more he hated himself. He had just confessed his true feelings for Bree, and he accepted them! Now here he was\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtrying to come up with an excuse as to why he had killed Flare, when in reality he did so out of nothing more then jealousy and hatred! Even now as he thought about it, his other victims did something to deserve it, such as threatening him or Bree, neither of which Flare was guilty of! <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please do! Please explain your reasoning for\u00e2\u20ac\u201d<i>churning</i> Flare! You <i>killed</i> him, Charizard! While you're at it\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhow could you\u00e2\u20ac\u201dy-y-you use!\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\" Bree choked on his words as he held back the sadness that was eating away within him bit by bit \"you put that in me! You shoved F\u00e2\u20ac\u201dFlare right u\u00e2\u20ac\u201dup m... I can't\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou!\" As much anger as he felt towards the dragon, he would be lying if he said he did not still have some feeling for Charizard. The words he shouted at the dragon cutting him almost as deep as the betrayal of his trust. So many emotions, these feelings he felt... the words he spoke... they did not feel natural. <i>Why Charizard\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhy did you have to do this to me! And of all nights, why on this night!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard found himself at a loss for words again. His pride, his love, being crushed under these feelings of guilt from watching his precious Bree fight to hold back tears. Charizard could feel his own eyes starting to swell, Bree's words echoing in his head along with the sight of the Umbreon's emotional turmoil making him feel like a complete piece of shit. <i>How could I've done this to Bree?!</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bree, I'm sorry, I just...

He didn't dare to speak against Bree with his shame too great. He knew how Flare felt\u00e2\u20ac\u201d and he relished every moment of it. But he couldn't say any of that as it would only make matters much worse for him. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He wasn't just\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust some punk Charizard! What could he have possibly done to deserve what you did to him!\" Charizard shuddered from the weight of those words\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe emotional wounds they tore open cut deep into his heard. Bree might have thought what Flare experienced was true hell, but Charizard was willing to bet Bree's words were hurting him more than anything he could have done to Flare.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I... I...\" Charizard felt a swelling in his throat, preventing him from speaking. Beads of sweat crawling down his head, and the room felt blistering, even for the fire-type.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Answer me Chariz\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I was <i>jealous!</i>\" Charizard blurted. Bree flinched by the sudden outburst from Charizard. \"Watching you two talk\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwatching Flare brush against you and\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou <i>cooing</i> for him, it was too much for me!\" Bree stood there in shock as Charizard let out this rant, letting his thoughts spill out freely as he confided his feelings to Bree.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Watching someone so... timid, opening up to you as if he knew you for years! You weren't seeing it Umbreon, but he fell for you! I couldn't stand it! Tonight I was going to finally tell you that I loved you, but out of all the nights you chose to invite someone\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\" Charizard paused, gritting his teeth, clenching his claws \"when... I saw him laying next to you, you were buried within his fur, and Flare was just laying there with this look of content on his little face, splayed out for the world to see his shame!\" Charizard could feel his anger building once more, the memory of Flare sleeping with Bree with a hard-on like they were lovers still fresh in his mind. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bree took notice of this change in tone real quick. Without warrant, the dragon wouldn't just get pent-up like this. Bree's rage was slowly fading... something was... off. He felt uncomfortable around his best friend. Bree slowly found himself questioning if he truly knew Charizard.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Charizard I\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\"Bree was abruptly cut off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It should have been me in there! And you just let him cuddle up next to you like that!\" Charizard made crude gestures with his claws, swinging them rather threateningly. \"Might as well been fucking you!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By this point Charizard's mouth was beginning to smoke and  flicker, embers dancing from his lips as he spoke of Flare. Bree began to feel weak as he tried to hold back his tears. He could not believe what he was hearing. Charizard was speaking as if Flare's life meant nothing. As if he truly had no remorse for what he did to the poor Flareon! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Charizard please\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou're scaring me!\" Bree spoke out of worry, hoping the dragon would calm down, but Charizard seemed to be blinded by emotions, continuing to speak ill of Flare, seemingly unaware of Bree's discomfort.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I did Flare a favor! He wouldn't have even gotten the <i>courage</i>\u00e2\u20ac\u201dno, his prissy little ass wouldn't have even <i>tried</i> to say he liked you! Oho, but I did, me! My roommate, not his!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bree wanted to yell, but he found himself unable to do so despite his best efforts! Instead he proceeded to back away slowly as what little anger he had was gone completely, replaced by fear. He no longer felt as if he were standing in front of a dear friend, but instead a whole another  Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon entirely. This was not the Charizard he knew and loved... this was a monster.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How... how can you be so heartless...\" Bree muttered as he backed away from the angry Charizard he thought he knew, but after tonight's turn of event, it seemed he was wrong for thinking so. Charizard stopped shouting, turning his previously shaking tension into a brief reprise. Bree did not even wait for an answer before turning away from Charizard and heading into the living room, making his way towards the door. He could not stay here any longer\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot with how things were. He need to leave... he did not know where to, but staying here was out of the question. It was not safe being here.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Umbreon!\" Charizard cried out seeing Bree heading towards the door. Bree froze up upon hearing his name spoken. He looked back at Charizard, but it was not out of curiosity to hear what he would have to say. He had to keep an eye on the dragon. Of everything that has happened, trusting the dragon was out of the question, and his concern for his own well-being was all that mattered now.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard on the other hand saw that look of fear in Bree's eyes. It was a familiar look\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit was the same expression he's seen many of times from a Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon in fear of its life\u00e2\u20ac\u201da Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon that was ready to run. Charizards body stiffened. He did not want to make any sudden movements. Bree couldn't leave\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddidn't he see that he loved him!?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Umbreon please... let's just talk about this...I'm sorry...\" Charizard spoke with a hint of nervousness in his voice. His eyes locked on to the Umbreon who continued to stare him down with those widened, yellow eyes. The room was dead quiet as the two watched each other, waiting for the other to say something. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All remained quiet until a faint squeak broke the silence. Charizard saw Bree go stiff upon hearing the sound, and he knew why. Charizards eyes bolted to the source of the noise that he recognized to be the door knob to the house. Bree had slowly turned the knob about halfway during their stand off using his weak psychic abilities.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Shit this isn't good! He's planning to run!</i> Charizard thought. \"Umbreon... please... I'm sorry! I can fix this... please...\" Charizards eyes shifted back to the doorknob as he saw it turn a little further. He choked back an unexpected sob. Was he crying without realizing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard could see the terror in the Umbreon's eyes. It was like Bree didn't even recognize him. The door knob turned a little bit further, but Charizard could not remain still no longer after seeing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bree wait!\" Charizard took a step forward\u00e2\u20ac\u201das soon as he did, the door flung wide open and Bree was halfway out the door into the cover of night! \"No\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstop!\"</div></font></span><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Original</i></div></span></div></div>",

As he pressed his claw against the wall, he stuck his neck out to look around outside. While a Charizard has problems seeing in the dark like many other Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon, the house was hardly lit and his eyes were already adjusted. To the front of him, he saw the faint yellow brightness of Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rings dashing into the street. <i>He's running to the forest! I'll never find him there!</i> The dragon jumped out of the doorway and, with much adrenaline rushing through his body, took off with a massive gust of wind behind him, making the curtains flutter from the sheer force of his wings flapping. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bree managed to cross the road's white line\u00e2\u0080\u0094he looked back\u00e2\u0080\u0094Charizard was barreling down the entrance. The moonlight Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes were wide with shock and he gave a sharp yelp, increasing his pace and passing over the sidewalk. A quick flash of orange soared over his head and he skidded to a halt, Charizard landed in front of him, reaching with his claws to grab. Umbreon had turned tail and scrambled in the opposite direction, nearly losing his grip on the pavement. Charizard clenched the open air, gasping and, scrambling as well, he jumped into the air adjacent to Bree.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just as Charizard closed the distance, another swipe failed when Umbreon preemptively dashed right, trying to circle around back to the forest. Charizard shot a claw out and yanked back on the dark-type\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back leg, forcing a pained cry from the Eeveelution as he was dragged back. Charizard dropped out of the air and tumbled with Umbreon in tow, then they both fumbled until they lay on the grass. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whole claw was pressed forcefully onto Bree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth while trying to hold him down. Umbreon wasn't struggling, but instead clenching his eyes shut as hard as he can, biting on the dragon's claw, to which it hurt but Charizard stayed resilient.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tears began streaming down Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, and whilst Charizard had him pinned to the grass of their lawn, he already knew he had hurt Bree, bad. Charizard lifted Umbreon and squeezed him to his chest, hurriedly rushing inside and closing the door before dropping the hurt Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon onto their bed, on his back. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Umbreon screamed the moment the dragon withdrew his arms from him, his paws pressed against his face as he writhed on the Altaria down. Charizard snapped back and flinched as he looked on at Bree. The moonlight Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon couldn't put together any coherent thoughts, focusing on his leg so much that it hardly mattered that the dragon who splooged his friend was cowering over his actions. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard shuddered as he witnessed Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stretched leg. It looked like if Umbreon woke up and stretched his body, only to not let one let un-stretch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He ran to the kitchen where Umbreon kept the berries, the words from Umbreon earlier ringing in his head, <i>Lum berry, Lum berry! Fuck, what's a Lum berry look like!</i> Charizard grabbed as many berries as he could, recognizing only the Oran and Persim berries, but holding a bunch in his claws.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He returned to the room where Umbreon was sobbing, half screaming, and threw the berries onto the bed. One by one he tried to get Bree to eat them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but each time he'd bat at Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claws in fear of being strangled again. Charizard huffed, worried. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhich one is the Lum berry!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard asked, trying to be heard over the slowly fading whines of Umbreon. The moonlight Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon cried again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cT\u00e2\u0080\u0094the green\u00e2\u0080\u0094one\u00e2\u0080\u0094!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard cut him off by stuffing a plump, green berry inside of Umbreon's mouth, but he spat it back out, jerking away and curling up on his left side \u00e2\u0080\u009cg\u00e2\u0080\u0094get away f\u00e2\u0080\u0094from me\u00e2\u0080\u0094<i>chkh</i>\u00e2\u0080\u0094!!

His heart felt torn out of him, he felt so distant that the floor might as well be a void for him to fall through. Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faint sobbing seemed to echo in his ears as he staggered away. He rubbed his head with his claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I did this</i>, Charizard thought, <i>what do I do! His leg is so fucked!

Charizard had chased him and dragged him back to where he churned Flare, what would this monster do to him?

Charizard pursed his lips and pressed his head against Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s furred chest, beginning to sob. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUmbreon\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 you love me, right? Don't say you hate me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dragon tried to think of their many years together, attempting to come up with something positive\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Bree smiling, Bree conversing with him at the Caf\u00c3\u00a9, his small partner cradling next to his body as they slept together in this very bed\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it was a blur. Charizard held tight to Bree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body as he let out massive, conceded sobs, his body quaking with every throb of his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It had began to affect Bree as well. This was not his friend, but a monster. A monster crying over his lost friend, wailing his apologies for murdering an innocent Flareon, sobbing his excuses of how he never truly hid his activities when he took care of other Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon who threatened his Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Bree was biting his tongue, fearful of this predator, and torn from having a good friend ripped from his heart, two of which in the same night.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can't\u00e2\u0080\u0094you can't leave me, Umbreon!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard sniffled.

Shockingly still, staring into space as he loomed over the Umbreon he pinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i><b>. . .</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cCharizard? Charizard!! What are you d\u00e2\u0080\u0094doing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Umbreon tensed up even tighter, his tail between his legs. The dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth was open. Bree could see the widening, fleshy gullet that revealed itself after Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s massive tongue gave him a moist grope along his forehead, leaving it drenched in saliva. Immediately Umbreon had flashes of the situation\u00e2\u0080\u0094he saw Charizard letting go of him and leaving his disabled self on he mattress, he imagined Charizard at the Pok\u00c3\u00a9 Center, profusely apologizing, Bree visioned Charizard about to kiss him in a theatrical attempt to make up\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Homph!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard clamped his mouth over Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head. Their world was still for a moment, Umbreon shivering, looking wide-eyed down the dark tunnel as Charizard froze up.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly Charizard began to suck on Bree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head, massaging his tongue around his snout and head and ears, tasting every square inch of the Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, tasting faint remnants of his own cum despite the dark-type having washed most of it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Tsuki</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"C-ch\u00e2\u0080\u0094cha\u00e2\u0080\u0094zar!\" Bree could not seem to grasp his words as the room around him was eclipsed by a prison of fangs\u00e2\u0080\u0094his natural light revealing in vivid detail the contours of the fleshy tunnel glistening ahead, ready to accept him. The smell had been beyond foul, what one could expect from Charizard who primarily ate meat, and the grisly sound, and feeling of the dragons tongue as it slathered across his face left him feeling completely helpless.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Is\u00e2\u0080\u0094is this\u00e2\u0080\u0094he is r-really!?</i> The Umbreon had been brought back to the reality of his situation when the pressure around him grew tight, mashing him firmly within soft, slimy flesh of dragon tongue. A feeble yelp escaped Bree as his body stiffened upon feeling rows sharp teeth grazing along his ears and neck, threatening to bare down upon him at any given moment. <i>N\u00e2\u0080\u0094no... he\u00e2\u0080\u0094he wouldn't\u00e2\u0080\u0094he can't!</i> The throat before him closed, the gulp caused him to flinch as he watch the excess saliva that had pool up drain before his eye, the throat widening once again, allowing for a clear view of his destination. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bree snapped out of his fear induced paralysis as he felt his weight shift. Charizard had lifted him higher, tilting his head up to allow for Bree to slip deeper towards the sweltering hot abyss that awaited him, and for a brief moment, Bree managed to found his voice.</div></font></span><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Original</i></div></span></div></div>",

Just the sound of popping saliva thundering in his ear as the gullet closed in around his head was enough to make him want to scream.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Charizards eating me! He is actually eating me!</i> Bree's heart pounded hard and fast within his chest as he began to scramble frantically. In a vain attempt to pull free he tried using the dragons teeth as a foot hold with his front paws, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not bring forth the strength need to break free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In this moment, Bree's lower half dangled helplessly from Charizard's maw, his right leg fairly motionless whiles the left frantically tried to gain footing on what ever it could. Charizard just kept his eyes forward staring off blankly as he slowly raised a claw, gently grasping Bree's sides, pushing him further into his maw until both of Bree's legs hung from the corner of his jaws, with the base of his tail outwards of Charizard's mouth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard let his tongue wonder across Bree's soft fur, feeling Bree quaking in his jaws as he did so. Bree tried to beg, but the little Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon could only do so much to protest with the tight throat walls clenching his mouth shut. Charizard drowned out the sounds Bree made, paying no mind to the Umbreon's plight.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bree could only whine as he felt the dragon's tongue glaze over his soft belly, agonizingly slow. The tongue continued to explore farther much to Bree's discomfort, and soon felt the moist, warm touch of flesh prodding at his sheath, beginning to cradle his balls with the contours of the eager tongue.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bree instinctively tried to fight against the unwanted touch, only to lock up and cry out as pain shot through him! Bree went limp\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere was nothing he could do to fight back! He couldn't move his right leg without excruciating pain, and no amount of fear could over ride that! Instead he wallowed in self pity as the Charizard proceeded to tease his most intimate of areas, thoroughly coating him in copious amounts of the foul saliva. The warm touch of Charizard's tongue was getting to him. Bree squirmed as he felt the tip of the dragons tongue slide back, only to snake its way into his sheath, prodding at his head at first, before tracing around the sensitive organ. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>No\u00e2\u20ac\u201dplease\u00e2\u20ac\u201ds-stop this!</i> Bree was disgusted. He was being eaten, he was going to die! But that tongue, it felt unbelievable! Already he could feel the blood rushing to his groin, slowly engorging his cock. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>No\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI-can't, not now!</i> To Bree the pleasurable tongue to cock contact was too great and his body soon began to act on its own accord, grinding against the raspy surface of Charizard's intrusive organ. He could feel the blood rushing to his head, clouding his judgment for the better, as well as all other feelings as he began to rut against the slick appendage. The Umbreon's pleas rung silent, replaced by a pained whimper as Bree erratically thrashed against the tongue, grinding himself against it to the best of his ability, unable to hold back his desires any longer.</div></font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Twines</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><div align=\"justify\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard leaned his head back, eyes hazy with a blank stare. The glow from Umbreon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body had been cut off from the room with each swallow, yet the last two circles on his hips bucked with every hump against the dragon's broad tongue. Bree cringed for the pain, moaned from the pleasure, and shuddered from the reality that Charizard, his protective friend, was dooming him to a fleshy tomb. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>He can't do this to me! Why is he violating\u00e2\u20ac\u201dme\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnnghh!</i> Bree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s following orgasmic howl was silenced when Charizard took another gulp, forcing his mouth to close within the tight confines of the dragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throat. Although his balls felt empty from their earlier activities, Bree could not help but feel a surge of muscles in his lower body working to pump out another load. He whimpered and clenched his teeth together as the pain and pleasure collided, forcing a powerful shot of his white cum against Charizard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tongue. <i>No! No! It feels so good but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\u201dplease stop this Charizard!</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dragon worked his muscles to be able to swallow an Umbreon whole. Taking his claws off of his slowly softening rod, Charizard placed them onto Bree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rear. He groped and squeezed while shoving the dark-type deeper into his confines, pleasuring himself just a little more before the prey disappears. Bree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back legs\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis normal, frantic one, and his stretched, restrained one\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstuck out of Charizard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mouth awkwardly since the dragon did not want much suffering to come to this meal. He snatched up the healthy leg and crammed it into his mouth as it could still fold, but he gently grasped the hurt leg and guided it into his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Not my legs too\u00e2\u20ac\u201dow! I can't see either!</i> Bree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes were clenched shut because of the tight muscle that restrained his facial movements, leaving him cramped and with his paws stuck to his chest as he slid down the fleshy tunnel. With his tail swallowed, and his stretched leg being pressed and squished despite Charizard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts, Umbreon wanted to wail. Who does he call for help now? Instinctively his gut said Charizard\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut that's the problem! His supposed-to-be savior was sending him down into his plump belly instead!</div></font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Tsuki</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><div align=\"justify\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0From the outside, one could see the frantic struggles a hapless Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon fighting for its life as it that slipped slowly down Charizards gullet, his prey's tiny paws struggling in vain to alleviate the crushing walls that rippled along its body as he inched ever so slow to the ravenous belly just below it. In the darkness of the room, Bree's glowing rings could be seen through Charizard's bulging throat, the skin almost skin tight flesh providing a clear and vivid image of his body as well as every little twitch he made in an attempt to best to fight back against the peristaltic contraction that brought him closer to his inevitable fate as mere food.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard's heartbeat rang throughout Bree's ears, an underlying thrumming to a cacophony of splurts and squelches of saliva and flesh embracing him tightly. Try as he might, he could not drown out the sounds with his own cries, and thoughts, nor could he ignore them. He wanted to scream\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbeg for it to end, but the throat kept his maw clamped tight, leaving him to dwell on his fate while his mind ran rampant with confusion, anxiety, and fear. Even now the hellish sounds bombarding him were only made worse as the blood rushed to his head, seemingly amplifying, and dispersing any rational thoughts that may cross his mind. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To make matters worse, Bree's hind legs stiffened up as his now overly sensitive cock slipped beyond the yawning abyss of Charizard's throat, those tight muscles enveloping his twitching cock in a painfully tight embrace, racking his body with such overwhelming pleasure that it hurt. Despite this, Bree's body refused to obey his will and he found his hips bucking from the mere contact of his throbbing cock being crammed between his soft belly and rippling muscles of Charizard's throat. Fresh tears formed as Bree gritted his teeth, his whine bleeding through clench lips, bracing for even more pain to come once his legs begin to slip down with him...but it did not come, not yet at least.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>W-what? What is he\u00e2\u20ac\u201d!</i> Bree felt a tight grip just below his head, preventing him from slipping further, but this is not what caught his attention. Just beyond Charizard's gullet, Bree felt as his aching balls were caressed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcupped nicely within the crease of that powerful tongue, not only that but said powerful tongue now prodded at his backdoor, eager to get in. <i>No! Please\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot there!</i> \"<i>Mmmph!</i>\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bree locked up, his entire body going rigid upon feeling Charizard's thick, slimy, and incredibly hot tongue breach through his feeble defense. <i>I\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI can't fight it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It all felt so surreal. No less than an hour ago, Charizard was plowing his ass, making him feel pleasure no other Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon had given him... a wondrous feeling of dragon meat sliding within him, rubbing him in all of the right places, stretching him in all the right ways. Even now he could recollect the warmth he felt, every throb, and every twitch as Charizard's cock came within him... now as his tongue does the same, all he can feel is disgust. All the sensations he felt as it thoroughly tasted every part of him, something he once would have imagined as heavenly, now made him sick to his stomach.</div></font></span><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Original</i></div></span></div></div>",

His paws and uninjured left leg were curled up while he crawled sideways towards the head of the mattress, smudging his fur in cum again. Charizard grabbed more berries. <i>Maybe, I can get him to calm down\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 by confusing him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that might\u00e2\u0080\u0094no, sleep.

He pried open Bree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jaw despite his crying protests and shoved a whole berry into his mouth, which caused the black-furred Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon to gag, but ultimately swallow it down. Charizard did not know what berries were in his claws, as he left out the only three he recognized so that what he's doing might just work.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Umbreon choked down multiple berries\u00e2\u0080\u0094most of them being much larger than what he could tolerate in a gulp\u00e2\u0080\u0094so many that his belly had bulged about an inch. This caused multiple effects being applied to his body. He was sick and numb and sleepy and confused, but felt absolutely cured of all burns and poisons, at least. As he lay there in Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grasp, he slowly lost consciousness, watching the outline of Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worried face double, then triple, and then start rotating.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He was still fearful, but of what, it seemed to fade out of his head. Bree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes squinted to focus on the orange mass cradling him while he tried to figure out why his right leg felt weird and out of place. Charizard hugged Umbreon, watching the disoriented, tiny Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon close his eyes and droop limply in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I've got to get him to a Pok\u00c3\u00a9 Center.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard stood on the sidewalk in front of their neighbor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house.

I don't blame you for that, but I did mess up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Umbreon was out of tears to cry, and almost at a loss for words.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you mean?

I washed you off but you were still confused and terrified. I didn't realize Dragonite had severely hurt you until I\u00e2\u0080\u0094I had done something stupid and forced you to eat a ton of berries, I didn't know what was what but I thought it could help, but it just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I made it worse because you were pretty much having an effect meltdown. Saw your leg and... carried you here.

You can't tell anyone about this, what I'm about to tell you, Umbreon. Please promise me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked, tightening his grip on Bree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leg softly. Umbreon nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI went to his house. He opened the door for me, but as soon as he saw my face he started laughing. If I wasn't so bent on figuring out why he did this, I would have killed him on the spot\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 mockingly, he let me in and began to talk immediately about how he saw you and Flare alone at night. Told me <i>everything</i>.He hadn't gotten any tail for a whole month so the lonely prick went out and tried to grab you both, but when you and Flare rejected his random-ass request he got angry.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Told me about his water pulse and how he'd used it so much\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was a TM by the way\u00e2\u0080\u0094that he'd made his throat too sore to do it for a bit. Dumbass said it right to my face. He was planning on taking you back to his house and keeping you there. Oh, I'd gotten so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard shuddered \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just attacked him then and there. Fought him right in his own house. But\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Umbreon, this is what I need you to be silent for\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 what I did with him\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>With</i> him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I decided to make Dragonite go out the same way he took out Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cServes him right!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard paused hearing Umbreon cut him off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWait, you\u00e2\u0080\u0094you're not\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard uncomfortably jostled\u00e2\u0080\u0094a half Dragonite-sized load was brewing in his sac. If he didn't relieve himself a little at home, the bulge beneath his hidden cock would've made him harder than last night.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course I'm not mad at you! You had good reason to!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard was overcome with a surge of relief, one like being told you weren't in trouble, one like you were told that you had found a cure and were being congratulated for your efforts, one that said that someone still loved you. The dragon grabbed Bree and gave him the warmest embrace that he had never been able to give to another Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon before.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you, Umbreon!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next day, Charizard and Bree returned home after working, having readied themselves for each other. Charizard was ready for the moonlight Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon with another mousse he'd bought from the Pok\u00c3\u00a9 Mart, while Umbreon took some time to appreciate this newfound love, hopping onto their clean bed, compliment from the dragon while away from the Center, and waiting. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His dragon savior returned to find Bree in an unexpected, presenting position, tail in the air, beckoning him forward. Charizard placed his gift down before diving into their room, groping the Eeveelution's rear before getting onto the bed himself, girth sticking out and ready to pleasure his little lover.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know, it's a blessing you have opposable claws.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh~?

He had to admit, Flare was doing a damn fine job with those struggles of his, and all he needed was a little motivation. Charizard took a mental note about using his tail flame in such a way for future fun.  A sudden swift, well-placed kick caused the dragon to gasp, his eyes shooting wide as he bit his tongue in order to silence himself.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the hell\u00e2\u20ac\u201dHnngh!\" Charizard started to mutter to himself just before he keeled over, a familiar feeling of pleasure rocketed throughout his body. <i>Is he\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhitting my prostate\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwith his kicks?!</i> Flare must have taken notice to his captor's reaction, because soon after the thought crossed his mind, another swift kick, though not as well-placed, struck the dragon again, sending another surge of spine tingling delight up his body. <i>God damn it feels so good!</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey... settle down in there!\" Charizard spoke under his breath, his voice just loud enough that he was sure Flare would hear, and to punctuate his frustration, he mashed down on Flare's body in order to get the point across. Flare of course did not listen, to busy trying to fight for his life, and the pressure of the Charizard's inner walls squeezing him tightly by no means helped calm him. Instead, Flare's pleas only grew much louder as he panicked to get free from this hellish sack. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmph\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 shit...hngk...This isn't good...\" Charizard spoke under his breath as he sat up on the couch, his heart beating fast and his claw clenched tight around his cock. Flare was by no mean his first prey to be consumed by his cock, but who would have known this little shit would manage to find a way to bring him so much pleasure! Under any other circumstance this would have been a good thing, but Charizard was finding it hard to contain his composure! He need to go somewhere, and fast! Bree may be a heavy sleeper, but he was not gonna risk finding out if he could sleep through one of his climatic roars! <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taking a decorative pillow that had fallen to the floor a little while earlier, Charizard bit down onto it as a means to muffle his grunts. He needed to get out of the house, fast! Thankfully, the sudden shift of position seemed to have thrown Flare off, but who knew how long it would be before he find the sweet spot again. Already Charizard could feel the little bastard flailing around in a panic, trying to get another reaction out of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard carefully got up from the couch, and to the utmost best of his ability, made his way to the door, careful to make as little noise as possible. Fortunately he did not need to go far to reach the front door. As he delicately turned the knob he cringed as the handle screeched mid turn\u00e2\u20ac\u201d a sound he knew all to well would not wake Bree, but with tensions so high, it almost seemed deafening!  Once he had the handle turned, he proceeded to open the door, making sure as to not let the handle go in the process; he did not want to have to turn it again unless he had to.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Almost home free!</i> \"Mmmph!\" Charizard gasped into the pillow lodged in his mouth. It seems Flare found his barings again, but by this point the dragon had just started shutting the door to the house, quickly letting go of the door knob as if he were ripping of a bandage to latch it shut. \"You cheeky little\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI bet you think you're clever don't you!\" Flare only respond with another flurry of swift kicks, screaming to be let go.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh don't you worry, once I get somewhere nice and quiet, we are gonna have a little more fun...\" Charizard grinned, feeling Flare's panic rise. He knew the perfect place. Gently setting the saliva drenched pillow off to the side to be washed later, he flared out his wings and prepared to take flight. With a mighty kick of his legs, Charizard vaulted off into the night sky with unprecedented speed, heading off towards the center of the woods where nobody would bother him and his unruly little toy.</span></font></div>   <br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Alternative</i></div></span></div></div>",

The foliage that circled the lake perimeter grew lush and vibrant, providing an effective screen from civilization as well as dampening all sounds from the outside world that lay beyond them. It was an ideal  place to go about having his fun away from the prying eyes of others, and any sound that may be heard would likely go ignored out of fear the wilderness presented for those who were not prepared to face it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A cool, damp musk welcomed the rowdy fire dragon standing before the small cavern. While not much for humid environments, the cave provided a perfect balance for the Charizard, and its earthy aroma was a welcoming change from that of home, but right now was not the time to enjoy such simple pleasures, in fact he had something much better to look forward to in the coming moments. Charizard proceeded further into the cave, the light of his flame illuminating the rock wall around him. He only had to take a couple of steps to reach his destination\u00e2\u20ac\u201da thick mat of assorted plant matter he had built up, replaced, and all around maintained over the course of a couple of years.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Damn\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlittle guy's persistent!</i> Charizard thought as he stepped onto the slightly damp bedding, plopping down, and making himself comfortable before guiding his tail back around front, careful not to expose it too long to the bedding\u00e2\u20ac\u201da mistake he has done multiple times now. Thankfully the moist atmosphere kept the grass just damp enough that setting the bedding ablaze accidentally was fairly difficult, but fresh green grass still burned, and the black smoke it made was not something he found enjoyable in the small confines of the tiny cave. With a sigh, Charizard readjusted a bit before glancing back down between his legs. Ever sense knocking Flare around and taking off to the sky, Flare has been mindlessly struggling, desperately trying to find that sweet spot again, but now it seemed the little guy was gonna need a helping hand in order to get the results they both wanted. Luckily for Flare, Charizard was more then happy to steer him in the right direction again. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, listen for a\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare did not listen, instead he continued to aimlessly struggle, getting nowhere. Angry, Charizard cupped his claw around the frantic bulge, pressing down hard and pinning Flare in place before raising his voice. \"I said listen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare cried out as he felt the dragon smother him against the sack walls. He could feel the anger in Charizards voice, and despite wanting nothing more than to get out, he found himself freezing in place in fear of angering the dragon further. Everything was silent, only the sloshing cum that covered Flare and the sound of his little heart beating wildly in his chest could be heard. <i>Did\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddid he just tell me to listen!? What could he possibly have to say to me! Why can't he just\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust leave me alone!</i> Flare began to struggle once again, but Charizard quickly put a stop to that with a simple squeeze, making Flare think twice about resisting further. He was completely at the mercy of Charizard. As much as he would have liked to resist he simply could not do so... He had no other choices but to listen, and to expect the worse.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Listen... If you want any chance of getting out of this alive you better listen closely...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>W-what?</i> Flare fell still. <i>Did he... is he really...?</i> For a moment, a feeling of hope washed over him\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut that moment was short lived as doubt began to take its place. <i>No, he's bluffing, he has to be! Why would he\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthis is just another trick! Another way to fuck with me!</i> His tearful eyes swelled up again. \"Why should I believe you!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare didn't get a response from the dragon, only silence. He was not sure if maybe Charizard couldn't understand his horse voice, still very sore from his tongue assault from earlier, or if he  just didn't care...that is until he felt a gentle prod to his side, just bellow the glow from the dragons tail flame. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you feel that... I want you to kick directly opposite from where I am pressing.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Is he...showing me where to kick?!</i> Flare waited for the dragon to let up so he could move again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You only have one chance as I am sure you know... do not waste it...\" Charizard smirked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who knows\u00e2\u20ac\u201dMaybe if you \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 do a good enough job, I'll even let you go.\" Charizard knew what Flare wanted to hear, and he got just the reaction he wanted.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"R-r-really?!\" Flare stuttered, still trying to keep himself from crying. \"W-wh-what's-t-the catch!?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's the\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhat the hell do you mean!\" Charizard would have laughed if not for the fact he was getting impatient. \"Do you want me to turn you to cum! You better hurry, you don't have all night!\" Charizard gave one last firm push before pulling his claw away, taking a hold of his cock once again while using his free claw to guide his tail back to the spot he had just pressed, giving Flare some light to work with. \"I'd say you have about an hour before you reach the point of no return... and you wouldn't want to come out missing limbs would you?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You better make up your mind fast though. If I go soft, you can kiss your chance goodbye... What you did earlier was good, but I doubt you're that good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare's heart sank from the prospect of such a fate. What choice did he really have. Even if it was a lie, his fate would be sealed if he did nothing. Without further question, Flare quickly rolled over,  his back against the dim light, and his legs cocked,  ready to unleash hell against the walls around him. With a new sense of urgency provided by Charizard's last words, Flare began kicking with all he had, knowing full well his life was on the line... it only took a few kicks before they both got the reaction they both seeked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust like\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshow me just how bad you want out!\" Charizard huffed, stroking his cock slowly to Flare's frantic struggles, even giving the little guy a few firm gropes to incite more fear to fuel the fire. Just because he steered him in the right direction did not mean he was going to make it easy for him after all... not like it will matter in the end anyways. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Oh man, he's really going at it!</i> Charizard felt his heart rate rising from the excitement, and the thought of Flare giving it his all for a chance at making it out of this alive only made it more thrilling. Charizard closed his eyes, steadily putting more weight down onto his prey, his tongue hanging from the side of his mouth as he savored the moment, imagining the fear on Flare's face grow more pronounced as he became more desperate with each passing second. \"Mmmmm\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcome on now\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddon't tell me that's all you've got in you!\" Charizard taunted, making sure Flare could hear him. Sure enough Flare grew increasingly more worried, crying out as he exerted more energy pleasuring Charizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0No matter how hard Flare tired, Charizard only seemed to become more rough in his treatment, grinding down upon his small body, making it increasingly more difficult for him to fight back! With every passing second, Flare could feel the temperature of his prison rising, the heat becoming more unbearable even for a fire type such as himself. It only grew worse, but he could not afforded to give up, not as long as he still had a chance!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>This\u00e2\u20ac\u201dFlareon~!</i> The feeling of Flare's paws stretching him from within, doing what ever took to keep him from being crushed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe trembling of his frail body buckling under his grasp as he kneaded the bulge\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit's been too long sense he's experienced such pleasure having something inside him fighting for their life! Charizard found himself thrusting his hips, as he crushed Flare tighter against the back to allow for more stimulation. His mind slowly clouded\u00e2\u20ac\u201donly the thoughts of what to do with Flare as he came out filled his head. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maybe a little snack was in order. Already Charizard's mouth began to water. The idea of sucking Flare out tempting with each passing second. Just picturing the look on the Flareon's face as he came out, only to be stuffed down his throat excited him. Then another idea came to him, and the best part is that Flare will already be lubed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>It has been a long time sense I've had that kind of fun</i>, Charizard thought while he began to trace the rim of his ass with one of his talons, already lubing the soft flesh with the cum that started leaking profusely from his cock as he pondered the option of stuffing Flare into it. What better way is their to take someone out then to utterly humiliate them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare began to hyperventilate, putting everything he had into his kicks while fighting of the crushing force of the fleshy walls around him. Ever second that passed, Charizard steadily grew heaver, making it harder for him to breath. He watched helplessly as the cum levels rose higher, and higher! He could hear Charizard moans of overwhelming bless over the sounds of the churning cum that sloshed around him, his thrust growing increasingly more violent each time! Flare whined as the pool of seed reached up to his eyes, the fear of drowning in cum becoming increasingly more apparent by the second! He needed to keep fighting!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Oh please Arceus don't let this be it\u00e2\u20ac\u201dplease I beg of you!</i> Flare closed his eye, taking one last breath before going completely under!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Th-that's it\u00e2\u20ac\u201da-almost\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere!\" Charizard spoke between clenched teeth as he held for as long as he could. He could feel his sack clenching around Flare as he felt the Eeveelution's tiny body prying at the exit of his sack, ready to be expelled back into the world!</div></font></span><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Alternative</i></div></span></div></div>",

Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main job is to collect weeds and burn them so we can use the ashes for compost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you could have just gotten me for that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard teased, walking into the living room and plopping down on their couch.

It <i>was</i> a real bummer though. He sighed. This <i>should have</i> been his night. <i>Whatever makes Umbreon happy\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</i> Charizard reasoned. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Knock, knock.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dragon perked his head up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cMust be Flare,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard stood up \u00e2\u0080\u009cFlare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, let him in!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard headed for the door. When he grabbed the handle with his claw, he looked down expectantly. The fading light of day pierced the growing darkness of the room. Immediately he recognized the red fur of a small Pokemon, and the look of surprise which followed. Standing below the massive dragon was a Flareon whose hair looked to be on end and his mouth slightly agape. A distinct light yellow fluff was around the fire-type\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHello, you must be Flare,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard smiled warmly.

One of Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears perked when he heard the faint drizzle of the shower, then he stopped. The floor was carpeted.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare jerked suddenly.

Charizard made sure not to make too sudden of movement, as he didn't want to make Flare uncomfortable, and swept back over to the couch. The dragon was sure that maybe if he looked casual that Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend could relax in turn. While sitting down, Charizard looked back at Flare.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWanna wait for Bree with me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The dragon offered. Flare raised a brow, and a crooked paw, then he quickly glanced at the open door frame to where the shower noises came from. The Flareon mumbled something under his breath while exhaling exasperatedly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c... s\u00e2\u0080\u0094sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare slowly moved towards the massive couch. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I swear, if I didn't know he was so fucking nervous I'd tell him to see a Pok\u00c3\u00a9-center for all that shaking,</i> Charizard huffed internally, <i>\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 he does look cute though</i>.

Flare reeled back, a pink blush spreading immediately his face. The Flareon stuttered a small apology before Bree interrupted him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou're not wrong though, ha! It's fine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh\u00e2\u0080\u0094o.k..\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cFlare,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice caught their attention. With the firm statement of his name, Flare tensed up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnless you're set on going home in the dark, I suggest you spend the night here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the dragon switched his gaze towards Umbreon for confirmation. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood idea!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Umbreon smiled and hopped up onto the couch beside Flare, who found himself scooting over to make room.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAhha\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 about that\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0094I uh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bree gave Flare a concerned look. The Flareon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blush became much more profound when the Umbreon showed care for him. <i>Oh man! They're right, I can't just walk out there by myself, that's scary as hell!

Flare became stiff and shuffled his hips, a heat rising from between him and the couch, concealing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Umbreon hopped down despite only being up there for Flare to respond. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know how long we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll all be staying up, I'd like to be awake \u00e2\u0080\u0098cause it's Saturday night, so we've got some movies if you wanna watch them with us Flare,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bree made his way towards the remarkably unnoticeable television sat across from the couch and rectangular table. Using his teeth, he pulled open a small drawer, revealing a niche stash of tiny, plastic movie covers. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare attempted desperately to keep himself sat in his spot. He could not deny how much he was aroused. <i>How am I hard? Why am I\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Bree is so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 good-looking, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I can't be falling in love?</i> Squirming, Flare tried to concentrate on something other than Bree. He took deep breaths as his eyes moved across the room\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 there's the door, the floor, Bree, then\u00e2\u0080\u0094Flare flinched. Charizard was looking at him again. <i>Why does he keep looking at me? Oh my gosh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 he's not looking as my ass right? Is he\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 checking me out?</i> Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears fell again as he gave Charizard a nervous smile. <i>Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being really creepy, what is he thinking?</i> His smile became a shaky frown.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Can't Umbreon tell how much Flare is blushing? Oblivious as ever, I guess. It's a wonder, Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dick is out and Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even able to tell</i>, the dragon briefly checked on Bree as the moonlight Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon rummaged through their disks. <i>It's been fifteen minutes and his new friend has a boner for him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I swear you're so lucky to have me, Umbreon, else you'd be raped by bigger boys</i>.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Charizard turned his attention back to the uncomfortably aroused Flareon sitting on the couch. </span></font></div><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Alternative</i></div></span></div></div>",

Umbreon released a disapproving exhale before hopping up next to Flare, who tried to scoot away, yet unable to hide his slowly retreating cock. Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s embarrassment was getting the better of him, luckily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chest rose and fell with every quickened breath he took. What was Umbreon going to say? Get out? Weirdo? Creep? The moonlight Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon was crouched next to him, face to face.

He witnessed the dark-type place a paw over the other Eeveelution\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. \u00e2\u0080\u009cY\u00e2\u0080\u0094you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou're our guest, and I'm happy to make you happy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard made a noise in his throat that sounded like a panicked squeak. He gulped. Umbreon was returning the gesture! \u00e2\u0080\u009cFlare\u00e2\u0080\u00a6? Flare uh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 are you\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Umbreon slowly stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cCharizard I think he fainted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i><b>\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou're sure you have to leave?

Turning tail, the fire-type walked back down to the sidewalk. Bree sighed, closing the door and walking back to the couch. Charizard, while he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meaning to make Flare scamper off, knew that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make Umbreon any more excited this way by doing that to Flare.

Flare was gone, he had Umbreon all to himself! And now it was time for him to finally tell Bree how much he loved him! That was his plan, after all!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn't know whether to take this out with Flare around because\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 well you know how Flareons burn their food right?

His pace was a upbeat as he entered the kitchen. His roommate got him a gift? The last time Charizard got him a gift was because he had accidentally stepped on his tail, before that he'd broken the washer. Multiple times, Bree was slightly disheartened, his friend was always apologizing profusely even when he had done nothing worthy of hate.  Though, it did get quite annoying at times when Charizard forgot where his tail fire rested. <i>What'd he do this time?</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere! Go to the couch and I'll bring it to you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard shook with giddiness. He didn't confess to Bree when they walked home together, but he can do it now! Bree left the kitchen, and although he did crane his neck in a vain attempt to peek at what the dragon was doing, the fire-type just about reached the top cabinets and definitely blocked whatever was on the counter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou ready?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cClose your eyes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cO.k.\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard held his breath as he cradled the berry mousse he had bought from the Pok\u00c3\u00a9 Mart that day. He cautiously made his way towards the carpeted room, planning on setting the gift in front of Bree. The Umbreon sat in the softly illuminated room, his rings glowing, eyes closed, while Charizard, as quietly as a plump dragon can be, tiptoed his way in front of the t.v.. The massive fire-type gently placed the plated dessert onto the small table.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAaand, you can open\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i><b>Ahh!</b></i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bree jumped, Charizard glanced outside. The startled Umbreon shot open his eyes to see Charizard passing to the window.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWas that Flare?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSounded like it, I'll g\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard and Bree were cut off by another shrill cry. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe's still out front! What's happening?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bree jumped off the couch, heading towards the window as Charizard opened the door. The dark-type stood on his hind legs, placing his paws on the ledge, and looked outside. A third squeal was cut short suddenly, and Bree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears flattened. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCharizard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bree realized the dragon was already rushing outside.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he neared the street, Charizard noticed immediately that their neighbor, an abnormally small Dragonite as he found out they were the runt, making them stand eye to eye, was crouched over. Charizard carefully examined the chubby flying-type\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back. The normally bubbly, cheery Dragonite looked tense. His massive bright-orange tail blocked the view of where he was huddled on the sidewalk. Charizard raised a brow, he swore he heard a tiny Flareon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scream of horror just moments ago, right outside. Bree was inside the house, likely about to come out and see what was wrong.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A weak moan came from the direction sweating Dragonite, it was different from his neighbor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice. Meek, small, in pain. Charizard puffed out his chest, Dragonite rose, head down and holding something in his arms. The ground around him was damp, a darker gray as if it were splashed. His neighbor knew water-type moves, he had demonstrated them on a hot day once when there was an extremely awkward block party about a year ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard called from a couple of meters away. Dragonite gasped, tail straightened out, jerking his head to look at Charizard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDragonite, did you hear\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard saw a cream-colored, wet tuft of fur flop against his neighbor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The orange fire-type repeated in a growl. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat's that in your arms!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The color drained from Dragonite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI found a\u00e2\u0080\u0094a,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he sputtered \u00e2\u0080\u009cit fainted and I was gonna\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat did you do!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat? I didn't do anything! I\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cLiar! You're the only one out here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard snarled, approaching the chubby dragon threateningly. Dragonite instinctively turned around to defend himself, revealing a dazed, drenched, red and cream furred Flareon limp in his arms. Bree stood behind Charizard, having made his way outside finally. Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes turned into darts and his frown became a menacing snarl. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0094!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dragonite dashed towards his house, Flare squeezed to his chest. Charizard took off with a mighty gust of his wings, a faint yelp came from behind as Bree had been blown back slightly. The angry dragon zoomed diagonally towards the fleeing kidnapper. Charizard summoned a blazing heat from his chest that rose to his mouth so fast it had only taken Dragonite three steps up towards his house. Decisively, Charizard spewed a concentrated blast that then dispersed into five discernable \u00e2\u0080\u0098arms,' stretching out across the wide frame of the running dragon. The intense flame slapped the culprit in the back. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dragonite threw his arms out and Flare went tumbling across the grass, while his captor fell on his stomach, shouting in pain. The thump of his belly on the pavement boomed. Dragonite let out a shocked roar, writing and twisting to feel his singed back. There was a visible scorch that spread along down his broad back and the roots of his lesser wings. Flare groaned, his lithe body sprawled out on his side.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bree had scrambled to his feet and ran as fast as he could to Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side, but when the dragon flew at Dragonite he had trouble keeping up, especially with the flashing light of Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fire making him skid to a halt. However, Bree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes widened when he witnessed Flare tumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cFlare!\u00e2\u0080\u009d As Bree called out the drenched Eeveelution\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, he saw Charizard looming over the downed, singed, straining dragon. He stopped in his tracks. Charizard was giving Dragonite a sinister grimace. In the back of his mind, Umbreon was apprehensive, because even though he knew Charizard was quite aggressive, he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \u00e2\u0080\u009cCharizard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The gigantic fire-type turned craned his neck to glance back at Umbreon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat happened?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis\u00e2\u0080\u0094coward tried to take Flare! Our neighbor! What the hell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard stomped on the flying-type\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tail, to which the burnt Pokemon let out a cry of pain. Bree winced, he then focused his attention back on the poor Flareon. He walked around the duo of dragons and headed straight towards the pitiful red lump on the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cFlare?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bree checked over the wet Pokemon and prodded his side. Flare stirred, releasing a sickly moan.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy h\u00e2\u0080\u0094head h\u00e2\u0080\u0094hurtsss\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d he whined \u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>owowoww!</i>\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bree frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard roared at Dragonite. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou f\u00e2\u0080\u0094you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The dragon was blistering with anger. He yanked on Dragonite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs and dragged him around. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>Ahahh! AAHhh!</i> My back! <i>AhhAAhA</i>!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dragonite yelled as he was dragged, his belly rubbing along the ground. He could hardly make out the outline of the two Eeveelutions on his property. Charizard strained to pull the flying-type into his house, forcing him up the platform and through the door. Gathering the strength he could muster, he jumped onto the Dragonite and conked him across the skull. Charizard raised a brow, waiting\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Snore.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d knocked him out. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll deal with <i>you</i> later,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard growled silently, straightening himself and closing the door. The fire-type waddled over to Bree and Flare.</div></font></span><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Alternative</i></div></span></div></div>",

The Flareon tensed up even more, shaking slightly as Charizard returned to Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099 s slowly realizing, shocked expression. <i>Why is he\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 looking at my ass? Does he know? How does he know!</i> The cheesiest of grins spread across Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, revealing a set of teeth as he turned his head and winked at Flare. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If a blush could change someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fur color permanently, Charizard had just witnessed it. Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes were widened, his tail puffed out, paws forced together, and his fur sharpened, all while his red face became rosier. Charizard flicked his head at Bree as the moonlight Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon rummaged through the disks. Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jaw dropped. He had been read like a book, and this dragon didn't make a scene about it, opting to help instead! Flare threw his head into his paws and clenched his eyes shut, squirming his hips to conceal his obvious arousal.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat movie do you think we should watch?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bree asked, his upper body still bent over in the box. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard put a claw on his chin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAny ideas, Flare?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cA\u00e2\u0080\u0094anything\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare squeaked, Bree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear perked up. Charizard rose from the couch, walked over to the crouched moonlight Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon, and plopped down next to him, eliciting a flinch from the dark-type as the plump dragon shook the floor. Bree looked over Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s belly for a brief moment.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow about this one?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard reached inside the box and pulled out a cover.

The shaking Flareon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fur was on edge as he stared wide-eyed at the screen, seemingly unable to look away. The Umbreon he clung to gave him a sense of safety, he was his pillow, his stuffed teddy bear\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 like the one he had at home whenever he was stressed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard was content with the movie, however he had to constantly worry about where his tail was as the lighting reflected off the t.v. at times. Bree was stuck between a hot dragon and an overly warm Flareon, so he was constantly shifting his hips to pry himself from the both of them, but to no avail as Flare kept pressing him back into Charizard.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the safehouse!

Umbreon winced as Flare nudged him into Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s massive hip. Flare quivered as Bree huffed from the two abnormally heated fire Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>Ghuh</i>, you guys are too toasty\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bree sighed.

AhhHH!</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare seized Umbreon and released a weak moan before going limp. The Umbreon also gave a small groan before going limp as well, leaving Charizard staring at the two with a bewildered face. The screen went dark as bold lettering signalled the ending of the movie, Charizard tapped his claws together nervously. There were two fluffy Eeveelutions knocked out and laying against him, one who was completely still and the other whose body rose and fell with heavy breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHuh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the dragon stated. He cautiously rose from the seat, leaving the two slumped over into the padding of the couch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI better make that bed then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard walked over to the t.v. and removed the disk, turned the screen off, then headed back into his and Bree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The massive mattress inside of this bedroom took up nearly half the room to accomodate for his draconic size, and it had to be fireproof because of his tail flame, so it was made out of a rare material. As he grasped the blankets, he felt the Altaria down, the soft padding that made the bed and kept it burn-free. The bed was his domain while the bathroom was Bree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, although the shower still needed to be Charizard-friendly\u00e2\u0080\u0094but that was perfectly fine with the Umbreon he lived with.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bree couldn't make the bed with his quite limited paws, so Charizard took up the job with his opposable claws. Sometimes it's a pain\u00e2\u0080\u0094he's made the bed nice and clean only to fling the sheets across the room when his wings stretched. Although he's able to get his claws around the bed, it's never been as flat as when it was made the first time, unlike the psychic who installed it in the first place.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo much for the mousse, Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too tired for that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard sighed, resting on the made bed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMight as well go to sleep then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he got up and headed for the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bree could feel the gigantic heat source leave him, allowing him to slide onto the couch with a smaller heat-ball resting on his body. The cream fluff covered most of Bree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drowsy vision along with his half-lidded gaze. The light emanating from the screen vanished, leaving the shadows of his bioluminescence and Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tail to light up the room instead. He figured Charizard thought they were asleep, because only minutes go by and he could hear the familiar shuffling of a dragon attempting to fix the blankets.<br>\r\nFlare stirred, fluttering his eyes open to see the Umbreon he had stuck himself to. He squinted, then let out a tiny gasp, his earlier red blush returning just as fast as the movie had made it go away. His arms were around Bree, and they were laying at an angle which prompted Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jaws to drop as he froze up. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Did he faint from the movie too? No, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too brave for that, please tell me he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just asleep!</i> Flare shuffled and wiggled his way from off of Umbreon, only to slip and clench his eyes shut as the impact jolted Umbreon awake. Bree lazily allowed his attention to shift towards the now stuttering Flareon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0094I uh it\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was just\u00e2\u0080\u0094I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know er\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>Shh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</i>\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bree whispered groggily. Flare paused. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m tired, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just go to sleep now\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I think you should lay on the bed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Umbreon slumped his head back down into the soft, cushioned embrace of the couch. Flare hesitated before slowly pushing himself up to sit, shaking his fur and making his tufts puff out again, he could feel the blood rushing to his crotch as he gazed at Umbreon. The dark-type was huffing, tongue out, and was overly drowsy for someone so calm.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cBree?

Flare twitched.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Hot?

He made his way behind and found the entrance to the bedroom, a given as he saw the flickering light of Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orange flame. <i>That must be the bedroom.</i> He peeked his head into the room and looked around. When his vision landed on a massive foot, he jumped. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard inhaled sharply and stepped back, having almost stepped on the miniscule Eeveelution. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAck!

The dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms were stretched out, slowly wrapping around Flare.

Get comfortable, o.k.?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare nodded and jumped over to the pillows, rolling over and immediately diving under the blanket. There was only one medium-sized cover that lay over the sheet to the mattress. Charizard giggled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m gonna ask Umbreon something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, he fell asleep on the couch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare mentioned, making the dragon stop at the door.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cReally?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare curled up beneath the delightful cloth, already lulling to sleep. <i>This whole bed, just for me! Wow! They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so nice! Bree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s idea for me to stay turned out to be a good deal! Shame that Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tail can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stay in here at least\u00e2\u0080\u0094</i><b><i>fwomp!</i></b> Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes shot open as he bounced slightly. He glanced over to see the gigantic fire-type getting into the bed. The Eeveelution was still, blinking. <i>C\u00e2\u0080\u0094Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gonna\u00e2\u0080\u0094is he sleeping with me?! What?! I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too scary!</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare shuffled uncomfortably, seemingly unable to move from the middle of the bed as Charizard settled himself under the sheets. <i>I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let him think I hate him or anything! B\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094even know him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</i> Flare plunged his face between his paws and into the mattress. <i>I think this will do.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nervous. Damn it, I did it again. I thought Flare was perfectly fine around me after I winked\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 thought he would get the jist of him liking Umbreon. Whatever, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to sleep, Flare can be as timid as he wants as long as he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t throw a fit about me,</i> Charizard sighed and rolled over to face Flare, who was curled up in a poofy ball underneath his bed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blanket. <i>How is this Flareon as cute as Umbreon? I think I really do have a thing for Eeveelutions.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I think he's looking at me! Darn it! It's gonna be so hard to sleep with this dragon looking at me all night!</i> Flare wiggled his nose and closed his eyes, releasing a yawn. <i>Does Charizard sleep with his tail under or over the covers?</i> Suddenly preoccupied with this question, Flare attempted to ignore the massive fire-type as sleep overtook his mind, the bed comforting him while he drifted off\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i><b>Snore\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 snore.</b></i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare opened his eyes again. <i>Is Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 sleeping already? Oh my gosh, he snores\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 guess I won't be sleeping tonight like I thought.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare stirred, again. For the tenth time. Moving from the middle of the bed might make even the unconscious Charizard think he's got the whole thing, although Flare wasn't making any sense. Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s open mouth released large, elongated snores as Flare stared at him. The Flareon watched the dragon as it slept\u00e2\u0080\u0094it could wake up at any time, obviously!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>That's a big mouth</i>, Flare thought. With himself in the middle of the bed, Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long neck had nowhere else to stretch but closer to him. Face to face, mouth to face, with waves of the dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hot breath washing over Flare and his head tuft, which was puffed up from the heat. The little light there was in the room only made the maw glisten slightly, but just enough for Flare to peer down the cavernous tunnel. <i>He could probably swallow me in one gulp!</i> He wiggled a bit. <i>I bet he could\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 if he wanted to.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He edged closer to the soft, fleshy opening. Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth hung open for some time, allowing the smaller fire-type to inspect that big tongue, the perfectly round mouth, his deep red throat. Flare shuddered as his arousal peaked, the small sheath that hid between his folded legs revealing his hidden lust. His balls ached as he envisioned the embrace of Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grand maw, a bulge slowly travelling down that long neck\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 reaching a pleasant destination, protected by a friendly beast, safe and snug and tight and\u00e2\u0080\u0094<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard yawned. Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes twinkled when the mouth opened wide, granting him a better view of the voracious space. He leaned forward to tease himself, there was enough space for sure to keep himself occupied. The dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth began to close with excruciatingly, tantalizingly slow speed while Flare exhaled shakily, his red face just inches away from Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s snout. Flare gaped at the wonderful sight\u00e2\u0080\u0094<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His gaping stopped as the maw he'd been looking at closed on his small snout. The Flareon froze, completely still as he locked eyes with the orange jaws of Charizard. <i>Ohmygod ohmygod! I got too close!</i> Flare kept his head in place as he grew increasingly aroused. <i>How is he still sleeping from this! Maybe I can move if he yawns again, or snores, or\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 oh man! I really hope he doesn't wake up!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It took all of Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willpower to hold back a chuckle as he looked at Flare through slitted eyes. <i>He likes my mouth, hehe. Who knew Umbreon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend likes the idea of being eaten?</i> Two miniscule paws gently placed themselves around his snout, followed by a pitiful press to free the owner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. The Flareon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes were giant, reflective saucers that revealed his flustered predicament due to his terrible restraint.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard gave a tiny smile before \u00e2\u0080\u0098yawning\u00e2\u0080\u0099 again. Flare quickly moved his head backwards and began to wipe off the bits of saliva from Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth. The dragon carefully edged closer to Flare and his unaware head\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 he opened his mouth more, and more, until he descended upon Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire head. Charizard heard, and felt, a shocked squeal, muffled from within his mouth. He squeezed Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, pressing his tongue against his forehead before letting go and giving a brief chuckle. Flare, his entire head drenched in saliva now, locked eyes with Charizard, jaw dropped and face flushed with a deep red, paws still and held out in front of him, frozen.</span></font></div><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Alternative</i></div></span></div></div>",

Flare snapped out of the trance, shrinking back into the bed.

What was even happening! Charizard just slobbered all over his head and now he's offering to do something? <i>I don't know you!</i> \u00e2\u0080\u009cJ\u00e2\u0080\u0094just uh\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d maybe he could just go back to sleep?

Flare didn't move. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou like it, and I want to make you feel alright with being here\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 because you know that I know about Umbreon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear perked up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe's asleep, not hearing us. Could sleep through a hurricane, that Umbreon. You like Umbreon, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare shifted again. Having trouble finding the adequate words to describe it, he shook his head meekly. However, it wasn't too convincing as Charizard huffed slightly. Now suddenly shaken by possibly having upset Charizard, Flare nodded hastily, fur on end.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cMe too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the dragon smiled \u00e2\u0080\u009cI like him. But he doesn't get it, I don't think. You're cute too, you know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he caressed Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dry fur. Flare squirmed and looked at Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claw on his body. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was gonna tell Umbreon how much I loved him tonight\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but he invited you instead. I was going to have a lot of fun with that dark-type.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears flattened against his head as Charizard pressed harder into his fur while simultaneously dragging him closer. The dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes were full of intent, a stare Flare recognized like with other Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon at work. The Flareon craned his neck to look at the pillows, and away from Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slitted eyelids which Flare dawned as an invitation. The dragon worked to get Flare within a hugging embrace. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cUh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 hah\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare mumbled, trying to force words out. His cock was still hard as he was grasped by the orange dragon and lifted, his body slumped halfway upon Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body and the bed. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy don't you let me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 help you with that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard reached around Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rear and pulled the rest of his body up onto his stomach, Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cream-colored tail was puffed out between his curled legs. The fire dragon rubbed his claws against Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hips, working to tease the small ball of fluff that he cradled as he calmly dug into its fur.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Why is he doing this?</i> The trembling Flare couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lift a muscle in retaliation. <i>He can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be trying to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 he's reaching for my dick\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</i>, Flare remained still within Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s warm embrace. The dragon sat upwards, stroking Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fur, teasing the small sheath he felt when he reached under the Flareon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tail, which Flare used to cover his member. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard squeezed Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing flesh, attempting to coax it into its full length. Flare wiggled in defense to Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continuous groping. <i>This is so weird! No one's ever done this to me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 before</i>. It wasn't hard to get a couple of weird stares when at work, especially from the bigger customers, but it's only now that Flare realizes what those looks meant. Flare whimpers as his cock withdraws from his sheath, twitching when Charizard massages his rear and dick at the same time, he shut his eyes and brought his paws down to his chest, folding them and lowering his face. Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back was pinned to Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fat belly, a soft embrace that cushioned to save Flare from Charizard and his constant pressing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you think?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard whispered, his neck craned so that his snout met Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cEr\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I'm not sure\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat would you say to Bree?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cW\u00e2\u0080\u0094what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould you say yes?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c...\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare hesitated, his stomach filled with butterflies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you're not B\u00e2\u0080\u0094Bree, s\u00e2\u0080\u0094so I wouldn't know\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charizard clenched tight onto Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rear, eliciting a meek yelp.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can show you how to make Bree like you, like you love him.

Charizard opened his mouth wide, his cavernous mouth widening for Flare once more.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, open your eyes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flare took a moment before finding his bearings, then he opened his eyes to see Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maw in grand display above him. His jaw dropped, stars in his eyes as the mouth descended onto his head. The hot tongue lapped at Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soaked face before the rest of Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jaw trapped his head. Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body was flooded with pleasure, his neck and head surrounded by soft, slippery flesh that squeezed and squished against it. Charizard suckled on Flare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire head while the Flareon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hips thrusted uncontrollably into the dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s welcoming claws.</span></font></div><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Alternative</i></div></span></div></div>",

There are hundreds of interactives that you could add to that need it more than this one, (because this one has a plan), and there's something for about everyone on this site, whether it be rated-E fantasy and happiness or XGC Porn, there's little doubt you won't find another place. </span></font></div><br>\r\n</td>",
