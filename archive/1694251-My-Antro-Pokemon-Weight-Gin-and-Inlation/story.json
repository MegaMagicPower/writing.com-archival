He opened his eyes and grumbled a little, not used to being woken up this early. He had gone to bed rather early last night because of the heavy storm that had suddenly sprung up and had been ready to sleep all the way through it, but when he had woken up earlier to find it was only 6:00 AM and it was still pitch-black out, he had assumed the storm hadn't let up. But now it was 8:00 AM and the sun was shining rather brightly into his room as if the storm had never been there. He had never known any thunderstorm to blow over that quickly, but weird weather was considered normal in this state, so he figured it was just another bad call on the weatherman's part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The doorbell rang again, which prompted Rye to sit up in bed and shed his covers, revealing his rather scrawny body. He couldn't have weighed more than 150 pounds and he was fully grown, but it seemed no matter how much he ate, he never gained even an ounce. His metabolism was unusually high and he honestly thought if there was a contest for thin men instead of strong ones, he would definitely win. It wasn't that he was anorexic or starved himself for any reason. In fact, in the eyes of professional doctors, he was perfectly healthy, albeit a tad underweight. It was just the fact that he was able to shed calories just as fast as he put them on with little to no effort on his part.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n, Rye's concentration was broken by the sound of the doorbell ringing again. Groaning in frustration, he finally rolled himself out of bed, slid over to his dresser, grabbed a shirt, put it on and went to go answer the door. He wasn't wearing any pants, but he knew people tended to get annoyed when they had to ring the doorbell more than three times. Thankfully, he managed to make it to the door before it rang again and he opened it, expecting to find a flustered person waiting for him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n On the contrary, however, there was nobody in sight. It was as if they had just vanished into thin air, which didn't make any sense since he doubted a ding-dong-ditcher would have bothered ringing the bell three times before running off. It was really unusual, too, since his front door was at the end of a fairly long sideways ramp that would have certainly delayed anyone that tried to run from him. And since there were no footprints in the wet grass in front of him, it didn't seem like anyone had hopped the railing to get away anyway.<br>\r\n  Rye was about to go back in when he heard a sound that prompted him to look down and nearly drop his jaw right off his face. There was a large basket sitting on his front step with a bundle of blankets in it that could only mean one thing: someone had abandoned a baby on his front step. This didn't seem possible or even fair that someone he probably didn't even know had dropped their responsibility on him for no reason at all. And even if he were to go to the police with the child, he doubted anyone would believe his story that someone had rung his doorbell three separate times just to run off and leave him with a baby for no reason at all.<br>\r\n  But just as Rye was about to have second thoughts, he heard the sound again, which caused him to duck his head down enough to see under the hood of the basket at the baby itself. What he saw nearly gave him a coronary in surprise. There was no doubt that there was an infant in that basket, but the sound it had made and the face he could see under those blankets seemed to deny the very laws of reality themselves. Not only wasn't the baby human, but the identity of the face he saw poking out of the blankets was almost like a gift from the gods.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"A... A Lugia...\" he found himself saying.<br>\r\n  There was no doubt about it. There was an actual living baby L.U.G.I.A. curled up in the basket, its eyes wide open and looking at him with a truly soft and beautiful pair of round, blue eyes. This was a creature that only should have existed in the video game world, but yet there was a living one sitting on his doorstep.<br>\r\n  In an attempt to make absolutely sure he wasn't dreaming, Rye reached down and gently peeled away the blankets to see the creature in its entirety. Sure enough, once the blankets parted, he saw the rest of the body that belonged to the avian head poking out the top. It couldn't have been more that 18 inches in length and resembled a Lugia in every way, shape or form. It was currently lying on its back, but once the covers were pulled away from it, it rolled itself onto its thick, rounded feet and turned to look up at him with a smile that made Rye's heart melt with adoration. It was just so cute that he couldn't believe this was really happening. Even though he knew Lugia were supposed to be in upwards of ten feet tall and over 17 feet in length, this rather petite baby looked like it had just been born last night. Why anyone in their right mind would abandon such a beautiful creature in the first place was beyond him.<br>\r\n  Wondering if it was safe to touch, Rye gently knelt down and very carefully held out his hands as he slid them under the Lugia's wings and slowly lifted it up. The Lugia didn't protest and Rye's legs almost went to jelly when he felt the incredibly smooth, firm, rubbery, silver skin beneath his fingertips. It was rather warm and incredibly cuddly, and as he held it up to his eye level, the Lugia looked at him with a gentle smile before it made a kind of crooning sound and moved its head to one side to gently lick his hand. Rye almost dropped it in surprise, but he managed to catch himself as he slowly pulled it close to him so they were eye-to-eye. He had heard Lugia were psychic, but he doubted this Lugia was old enough to communicate with him mentally or otherwise.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBut even though this was like a dream come true for him, Rye still had no idea what to do with it. It didn't seem right that someone would abandon such a wonderfully innocent creature probably just moments after it was born, and expect him to take care of it. Human babies were one thing, but Rye had absolutely no idea what to do with a baby Lugia. He wasn't even sure he was qualified to take care of such a wonderful creature. He didn't even know what to feed it.<br>\r\n  However, even though he had no idea what to do with it, Rye decided to accept the responsibility and would deal with everything as it occurred. The first thing he figured he could do was find out what to feed it. He figured young aquatic birds required mashed up fish or something, even though he was completely winging it. He looked at the Lugia, who was smiling innocently, and spoke very calmly to it.<br>\r\n  \"I bet you want something to eat, don't you?\"<br>\r\n  The Lugia responded in a rather unusual way. It made a kind of chittering noise that had a bit of a whine mixed in. Unsure of what to make of it, Rye decided to start with the basics. He gently took the Lugia in his arms, closing the door with the basket still on the front step, and carried it into his kitchen, where he set it on the counter and then went over to a cupboard to look for some canned tuna for it. When he located it, he turned and found a rather comical sight playing out in front of him. The baby Lugia was having quite a time trying to get a grip on the slick countertop. Its smooth, rounded feet kept slipping out from under it and it was flailing around like a novice ice skater. If it wasn't for its long, broad wings keeping it upright, he was sure it would have crashed quite a few times as it struggled to get some footing on the counter.<br>\r\n  Laughing a little at the comical sight, Rye reached into a drawer and pulled out a small hand towel that he laid out on the counter before gently placing the Lugia on top of it. It wobbled a little as its grip was adjusted, but it seemed to have much more success in keeping its footing on the coarse towel.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"There ya go,\" said Rye happily, patting it on the head and hearing it croon happily. \"I guess it doesn't help that you don't have any footpads, does it?\"<br>\r\n  The Lugia chirped playfully and Rye smiled as he brought the can of tuna over to the electric can opener and started to open it. He was actually in fairly high spirits. It seemed rather easy to please and Rye was just glad it wasn't bawling its head off like a human child would be. He had never been comfortable with loud noises, much less those of a bawling baby.<br>\r\n  Once the tuna was open, Rye grabbed a plate and tapped the can upside-down over it, resulting in a cat food-like plate of tuna fish with a bit more water than that. He then brought it over to the Lugia and placed it in front of it. It looked curiously down at the offering before it and then back up at Rye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Go on... try it out,\" he said, gently stroking it on the neck.<br>\r\n  The Lugia looked apprehensive as it leaned over and sniffed the tuna. Even though it was rather offensive to Rye, the Lugia seemed to smell a wonderful odor because it opened its mouth and started slurping up the mashed fish. It took large mouthfuls of the tuna and swallowed it without chewing it, each time making a happy trill as it continued to eat. And once the plate was clean, it went back for more but found there was nothing left. It frowned a little, which concerned Rye that it wanted more, but then it made a soft, purring sound and sat back on its tail, resting a wing on its belly before letting out a soft yet deep belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just before Rye could excuse it, something truly bizarre started to happen. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lugia's stomach suddenly growled violently. It was loud and sharp, and almost shook the countertop. The baby Lucia winced in pain and brought its wings to its belly, trying to calm it down. The Lugia looked at Rye in a pleading manner, expecting him to know how to stop the pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still hungry little guy?\" Rye asked a bit nervously, not liking seeing the Lugia in pain. The Lugia's nodded quickly and let out a cry of pain as another wave of hunger hit it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRye quickly opened up the cupboards and looked for something that the Lugia can eat. Something fishy. He spotted a dozen cans of Sardines and instant key snatched them. Rye set them in front of the Lugia. It tilted his head to one side and looked at it curiously. Luckily for Rye, it was an easy peel lid. Rye opened up the can and set it on the plate for Lugia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike with the Tuna, the Lugia was a bit apprehensive to the meal set in front of it, but before it coukd make the decision to eat it or not, another hunger pain struck. It picked up a sardine with two of its wing like fingers and popped it in its mouth. Rye noticed that he must really like it, because it instantly went back for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRye let out a sigh of relief. \"Whew! That was intence for a little bit. You alright there little guy?\" The baby Lugia nodded and flu tinier slurping down more sardines. Rye noticed that the Lugia apparently loved eating. It kept making little purrs as it ate with a little smile. The smile diminished, however, when Lugia finnaly ran out of Sardines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lugia's kept being glum about this for a couple more seconds, before it heard something that caught its 'ears'. It turned around and saw Rye opening up another can of Sardines, tapping the can upside down on a plate, and serving it to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't want you getting hungry again, do we?\" Rye quipped. Lugia stared at Rye for a little bit and smiled, then gave its full attention to its food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I should find a name for you. I can't just call you Lugia.\" Rye said to himself, watching the baby Lugia's glut. While he watched, he noticed there was little bit more Lugia than there was before it started eating. It's belly was already big, but Rye could tell it was getting a bit bigger by a few inches. It's arms and face had a little fat on them too, not so much that it was noticeable, but still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRye opened up another fan of Sardines and placed it on the plate for Lugia, figuring it would want more when it's done. \"HeHe, maybe I should call you 'Lardia',\" Rye joked at its weight. Suddenly, the Lugia stopped eating and started to chirp gleefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Do you...you like that name?\" The Lucia curled in response, and proceeded to rub its belly letting out a deep yet soft belch like before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse you.\" Rye chuckled. \"Alright...Lardia it is.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Meadow you were resting in managed to completely hide your body in the its grass. It covered you in a green quilt, poking your body lightly with its points. You couldent help but escape a small giggle at the tickling you were receiving. When you did, you heard the distinguishable sound of trampling grass close by you, which made you let out another giggle. You sat up to see what was the soared of the sound, despite already knowing what it is, and started laghing uncontrollably at what you saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your best friend Lucario, rolling around in the grass with joy, loving its tickles more than you were. The sight was too cute to bear, and couldent stop yourself from diving into the grass near her in a hug. You jumped and landed right on top of her. You hugged her tightly, wrapping your arms around her waist and tumbling down to the ground with her on top of you. By doing this, you earned an eruption of happy giggles from Lucario. She then began to nuzzle you laid there in the embrace, purring softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned, shutting your eyes to enjoy her relaxing purrs and warmth from her soft, furry body. You almost fell asleep in the process, to which Lucario saw and smiled. His tail wagged like crazy and sighed softly, letting warm breath wash over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both if you almost drifted into sleep in each other's arms, both of you snapped back in to reality by Lucario suddenly getting up followed by audible gurgling noise. You smiled, knowing exactly what that sound was, hearing it too many times before. It was Lucario's tummy and was growling with hunger. You giggled and gave her another cuddle, gently rubbing his tummy and glanced down at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to some...over feeding on your part, your lucario had become...well...fat. Not chubby or purvey in the of the spence, she was full blown obese. When she was laying down on you earlier, it wasent normal Lucario weight pinning you down, it was 400 lbs of soft jackal blubber. Her belly was as big as a bouldar, gently quivering at your hands touch. Her rear end alone was bit bigger than your torso, leaving just enough room for her tail to say freely. And unlike most Lucario, yours had a...pair of breasts. They were big, bigger then your head even! And wobbled and the slightest touch. However, instead of were her nipples would be, there's to little tufts of fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario never minded the extra weight, and nor did you. In fact, you secretly thought it made her more adorable with more to love. You kept rubbing her belly. Lucario was now on his back on the ground, purring with her eyes closed and living every second of your tender belly rubbing. You you tinier on and smiled, rubbing deeply into the pudge of her body. Much to your delight, your hand depressed a foot down in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep rubbing her belly for a couple minutes for you finnaly stop and helped your friend get off the ground. At her full height, she was actually taller then you by a couple feet, an added effect from your over feeding.

Broken branches ensured that looking down was essential, or else a potential fall might hurl you down hills. Fierce winds blew the very moisture from bare skin, leaving it dry and chapped. Fog and mist combined and surrounded everything like a blanket. It had laid itself down and over the entire region like a gaseous roof. The storm had not been exclusive to just Johto, but it had seemed far more intense here than anywhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Kanto to the east hadn\u2019t received as much rain. It seemed as though the rain would never stop. Reports had said that this storm had come out of nowhere. Clouds had formed and gathered in a matter of hours, seeping down from the mountains and smothering the small village beneath a mask of grey. There were hardly any warnings either. The sun had disappeared behind the westerly mountains in the middle of the afternoon as usual. Shadow usually bathed the small village of Blackthorn City, but with the cloud it might as well have been night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan had to walk almost horizontally as he blindly padded his way through the wind and rain. Not everyone could make it back in time before the obscuring weather came down. He had been outside when the storm began. Now he was at its mercy. With a full backpack rattling on his shoulders, he had more than enough to carry through the tumultuous weather. A single misstep would no doubt find him collapsed on the ground with his face pressed against the grass. There had been no communication from the village either since the fog had descended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to make it back before night fell. It wasn\u2019t exactly warm in the midst of this maelstrom already. When night would arrive, it would be impossible to find his way back. The cold wouldn\u2019t make it easy either. He and the pok\u00e9mon beside him would be forced to find shelter for the night, and the next morning make their way back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think a tree would be a good place to stay?\u201d Ryan tilted his head over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, let\u2019s take a Charizard up a tree.\u201d Alita, his pok\u00e9mon, said sardonically. \u201cI\u2019m sure fire and bark will work together just fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat else would work then? Do you see anywhere else for us to take a break?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just pop up a tent until the storm passes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to stay out in this weather? When the rain is coming at us from the side?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s also not that waterproof; it\u2019s like a flood out here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I could just sit on you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs much as I\u2019d love that, you\u2019d get cold.\u201d Ryan looked up and down his pok\u00e9mon. The Charizard was handling the weather a lot better than he was. She didn\u2019t have a coat, nor a scarf or gloves to keep her warm. No doubt the latter would just get wet and cold anyway. It might have had something to do with her body shape. Every time Ryan was forced into a battle against a six-year old, he found it embarrassing that his pok\u00e9mon was so \u2018maturely shaped\u2019. Nothing explicit but a soft, hefty, belly was present that jiggled quite uncontrollably. Younger trainers simply giggled and called her a \u2018chubby lady\u2019 innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlder trainers would shake their heads slightly when beaten by the pair. A relationship between pok\u00e9mon and their masters was less than accepted. While there was nothing unlawful about it, there were those with less than a favourable attitude. It didn't help that she was a little too eager to compliment her owner in public. It led to some awkward explanations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlita was a little taller than Ryan. At full height she was just a head above him on a good day. Her large wings were capable of lifting both her soft frame and her trainer into the air with ease, and they were good at wrapping around Ryan to pull him into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen maybe I\u2019ll just pull you in close.\u201d Alita bumped against her trainer. \u201cThen you\u2019ll not be able to get away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlita, come on. Keep those kinda thoughts for when we\u2019re out of danger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, don\u2019t be snappy with me.\u201d She joked. \u201cYou know I love it too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you see a house or some sort of shelter that we can stay in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019d build a house out here? There\u2019s nothing but rocks and stones.\u201d It was true. Below them seemed to be a sea of fog and mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair was midways up the mountain when the fog had descended. Currently they were trying to make their ways down, but with a line of sight shorter than his arm it seemed that they\u2019d be trying for ages. Vision had to be kept to the treacherous floor below. The wind would pick up loose stones and pebbles. Underfoot was treacherous enough that progress was slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if we keep at this until we reach the base, we\u2019ll still have a few hours left to get back.\u201d Ryan hunched over on his knees, gasping for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind walking in the dark.\u201d Her long tail swung forward with the fiery tip burning. Hisses of steam came from the raindrops\u2019 failed attempts to extinguish it. \u201cI got a little light.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to stay out here for another few hours, Alita. I\u2019m almost soaked to the bone already. With this wind I\u2019ll be a human icicle before long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll cuddle up and keep you lovely and warm.\u201d The Charizard giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have any idea where a little shelter would be? I have no idea how far we are from the bottom, and I don\u2019t want to find out.\u201d Ryan wore a small, black, face mask that covered from his chin to the base of his eyes. Usually it would be good for stopping his nose or his lips from behind affected by the wind. But with this weather, the rain seemed to pass right through it. The wind didn\u2019t help; penetrating through the woollen fabric and leaving it drenched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't even see the mountains, what makes you think I can see a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" He interrupted, pointing to a section of black to his left. The wind had blown a little more strongly in the last second, revealing the sheer surface of stone. \"I'd never have seen it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for then?\" Alita had to shout over the gust that picked up and brought the gale back down upon them. The pair was dunked back into the grey sea. \"Where was it again?\" A second glance showed that the mist had hidden it. Instantly, Ryan set off to press himself against the rocks. The surface was covered in cold rain, setting the drenched human even further. Not that it mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure...\" He said as his fingers combed the rock face. \"...that if I jumped in the sea now I'd somehow get drier!\" Sharp wind whistled along the nooks and juts out from the rock. They both had to shout over it to be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any luck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing! I can only feel rock!\" His arms were spread wide, his fingers dancing on the stone, searching for a dip that could be the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep searching! It's gotta be somewhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit it's here! We both saw it!\" Ryan pressed his face against the mountain to cut out as much wind as he could. Alita stood slightly behind him; helpless. Her arm span was not as wide as Ryan's. Both were dwarfed by her wings though. Wings? Wings! \"Alita, give me a strong gust! Blow some of this fog away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll give us a bit of looking space!\" Her impressive wings unfurled from her back. Though they were drenched in dew and rain, Alita could still move them. Several hundred pounds of air moved with lightning speed as her wings flapped just once. Like a cloth on a misted mirror, the fog cleared for a few seconds. Ryan's view did not change. He could see nothing but the rock wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it? It was just around here!\" The fog began to seep back mere seconds after it had cleared. Two pairs of eyes scanned the wall. Alita prepped her wings for another powerful beat, when a small sliver of black piqued in her peripheral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! On the left!\" Alita pointed to where she believed it was moments before the fog reclaimed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Ryan began to shimmy his way along the rock towards where she was directing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. But I can always flap again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe, you gotta conserve energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can't make it, you have to get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just wind, Alita.\" He rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it'll blow me away, and I'll never see you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've just used your wings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can cuddle up against you if you say you're cold.\" She smirked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite some hours after daybreak, the time drawing nigh to hours of noon, a fairly hefty, and plump blaziken lay lazily in her bed. The sun shining on her from the loosely fastened curtains, rousing her from her prolonged sleep. Letting out a lengthy yawn whilst she stretched, and tossed underneath her covers, she was greeted by the chittering of birds from outside her picture window and not too long after, the calling of her sister from elsewhere in the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gina, get your big butt out of bed! It's almost twelve already and you've gotta get ready to head to the gym with me, or did you forget again?\" The younger of the sisters, Ginger, exclaimed as she strolled over to her plump, older sibling's room. Gina grabbed her glasses from the bedside table and yawned once more prior to tossing off her bed sheets, revealing her pink Hello Kitty pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the plump blaziken was in the midst of clambering out of bed her little sister barged abruptly through the door. \"Come on already, we're going to be-\" Before having the opportunity to finish, her sister had given her a big, and fairly plump 'good morning' hug, pressing her lean sister into her pudgy middle. \"Yeah, yeah, I got'cha don't worry about it sis! I just wanted to relax until we headed out today, since I've got big plans coming up soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger looked down at her sibling's rather rotund frame and sighed. \"That's not the only 'big' thing around here, you really need to stop loafing around the house so much or this is never going to change you know that right?\" Ginger grabbed some of Ginger's pudgy belly and gave it a soft jiggle, making her older sister blush brightly. Gina, although unbeknownst to her sister, sincerely enjoyed her wide, doughy figure, and was more than happy to keep it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand however, her younger sister was slender by comparison, immeasurably more athletic, and furthermore far exceeding her when opposed in terms of health. So she thought that trimming herself of a few extra pounds couldn't hurt. Ginger released her grip on Gina's paunch and gave her a big hug right back before making headway for the door, raising her hand to wave behind her. \"I know that you have a hard time excising but you've got to keep at it, alright? I'll be out here preparing, get your clothes on and we can leave.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing at the thought of what was to come Gina unenthusiastically pulled off her pajama's and adorned her gym apparel, a pair of pink sweat pants and shirt adorned by dual white lines on either side. Though the suit was somewhat too small for her rotund frame, causing her belly to protrude very noticeably from underneath her shirt. Ginger had tried many times in the past to get a more suited shirt for her sister but Gina declined, too embarrassed to concede she needed a smaller shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be sure to make your bed by the way! If I keep doing it you'll forget how to!\" Ginger yelled to her sister from across the house once again. \"Heeey, who's the older one around here again? I got it dun' worry!\" Gina replied, and muttered to herself- \"Geeze, sometimes I swear she's gotta be the older one, but oh well, she does a darn good job of it that's for sure.\" Following her sister's routine orders, Gina set up her bed, pulling the disheveled covers and tucking them in neatly, while fluffing her pillows, and setting up her favorite Hello Kitty plush on the folded lip of her bed sheet. Finally with a sigh she was ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina ran out of her room, causing an audible 'thump' with every step she took, leaving her door ajar behind her. \"Okay, I'm all good to go, lets do this!\" Gina huffed, trying to get in the spirit of things as Ginger hefted up a heavy looking backpack and gave a nod. \"Alright then, lets!\" Ginger opened the door for her sister who jogged out and began heading in the direction of the gym, her sister locking up the house and catching up in no time at all as she usually did. Gina huffing and panting only a few blocks from home, sweating and already more than eager to call it a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Ginger sighed, unable to go off running due to having to tend to her sister, after quite some time the two had eventually made it to their destination. The two went inside the blissfully cool air-conditioned area where Gina proceeded to find a bench to sit on as she usually did, taking a few minuted to recover while drinking a bottle of water from the pack Ginger had brought with her. Wiping off her forehead, Gina made her way into the main room, several other pokemon doing their own sort of training. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was hitmonlee over in a corner sparring with hitmonchan, a rotund yet buff charizard lifting weights, glaceon with her head in front of an air conditioner, enjoying the cool refreshing air, while Ginger was on a treadmill, jogging as she usually did. Gina reluctantly went over to another nearby treadmill and began to run on medium-high speed, the utmost she could manage with her weight. Meanwhile Ginger was on the maximum setting while refusing to even so much as break a sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ran until Gina was at her limit, usually anywhere from an hour or maybe two on a good day, then headed back home. Ginger had her own equipment back at their home but thought it was nice to head out of the house regularly as well to get some fresh air. Upon arriving home they noticed a large mountain of boxes that had been stacked up on their porch, Gina being absolutely elated to see them. \"Ooooh, yay! They finally came, I've been waiting for these!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger was curious and sighed at the thought of what lay inside the dozens of boxes. \"You didn't order a ton of Hello Kitty plushies again, did you? You have an entire room filled with them now after the last time.\" Gina smiled and gave one of the boxes a pat-pat. \"Hehe, sadly no, I didn't. But I did get something that you might be happy with! Granola bars and protein shakes, lots 'n lots of 'em! Enough to last even me a month! They say that they're supposed to help you lose weight over time and that they're good for you.\" Gina smiled, trying her best to lug one of the heavy boxes into the house.</span></div></div>",

She's rather lazy and slothful, yet can be very easy to excite, especially when it comes to food. Her personality also luls her enemies into a false sense of security before a battle, where she demolishes them with fast attacks. If she was in a game, she would be level 50+. Uses mostly crushing and smothering attacks, which are surprisingly effective in conjunction with her large, flabby Body. She shows her affection by smothering people with her massive stomach, usually in a playful manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSignature Move: Meteoric Crack (jumps In to the air and falls butt-first onto their face and upper body, forcing them deep into her butt crack. Her massive weight keeps them trapped until they pass out)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Seren (F)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the majority of Snorlax, Seren is extremely lazy, but as she is still quite young and newly evolved, she has a bit more energy and is quite hyper at random points, much to the annoyance of People around her. She has an extremely short fuse, and tends to not take any nonsense from anyone lightly. Due to this, she has a bit of a reputation for being violent, although she is actually kinda soft and sweet once you get to know her. She can be a bit of a coward and is easily scared, but with a little convincing ,she'll do whatever it was...eventually. She is easily amused and has quite a short attention span, often going off mid-sentence to point out something, then carry on with the sentence as if nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSignature Move: Boob Slam</span></div></div>",

Where's my Pok\u00e9mon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Pok\u00e9mon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded. \"Yes! I'm ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Oak chuckled as he looked at the boy up and down. \"You look like you're ready for bed! Not for Pok\u00e9mon training. I hope you don't think you're going to train in your pyjamas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, professor,\" Ash shook his head. \"I got messed up this morning and I was a little late. But believe me, I'm ready for a Pok\u00e9mon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor sighed. \"Oh well, I guess you won't leave until you get your Pok\u00e9mon anyway. Follow me, Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Ash cheered as he followed the professor up the stairs towards the professor's lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were in the lab, the two had stopped at the same capsule from before, where the glass cover opened up once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've thought about it a lot and it took me a long time. But I've finally decided to choose Squirtle!\" Ash said as he picked up one of the Pok\u00e9balls and opened it, only to find it empty, much to his surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already taken by someone who was on time,\" Professor Oak replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sighed and placed the Pok\u00e9ball back in the capsule before he picked up the another one. \"I wish I haven't overslept. But now I will choose as my Pok\u00e9mon, Bulbasaur!\" Similar to the previous Pok\u00e9ball, it was empty the moment Ash opened it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one was also taken by a kid who wasn't late,\" Professor Oak added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointed, Ash placed the empty Pok\u00e9ball back onto the capsule and reached out for the last one. \"Well, that's no problem. Because my Pok\u00e9mon will be Charmander!\" Again, the Pok\u00e9ball came out empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The early bird gets the worm, or in this case...uh...the Pok\u00e9mon,\" Professor Oak continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh faced the professor with a saddened look. \"Does this mean all the Pok\u00e9mon are gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Oak swallowed, scratching his chin as well. \"W-well, there is still one more Pok\u00e9mon left but I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor, I'll take it!\" Ash interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor blinked. \"Are you sure about that, Ash?\" The boy simply nodded and Professor Oak sighed. \"I guess I have no choice...\" The professor flipped a different switch this time and in the middle of the capsule, a small hole appeared before a Pok\u00e9ball emerged from it. On it's top was a small lightning bolt symbol. Professor Oak picked up the Pok\u00e9ball and tuned towards Ash. \"I think I should warn you, there IS a problem with this last one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HAVE to have a Pok\u00e9mon!\" Ash insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, the professor handed the Pok\u00e9ball to him. \"Well, in that case...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of the cute and cuddly  Pikachu we all know and love, the pokeball opened to reveal something much more...fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pok\u00e9ball opened, releasing a blast of energy from it which quickly formed the silhouette of a large Pokemon. The Silhouette, however, kept growing and growing, and didn't show signs of stoping. Ash took a couple of steps back as the white energy threatened to absorb him in its...belly? By the time the Silhouette finally stopped growing, Ash couldn't tell what kind of Pokemon it was. It resembled some kind of blob, a rather big one at that as it grazed the roof and its sides made depressions in the wall. The only noticeable features was its two pointy ears on its head. As the light began to fade, the Pok\u00e9mon in question became much more visible and clearer. Finally, Ash could tell what Pokemon it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Snorlax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fat, gigantic, female, anthro Snorlax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe  behemoth Pokemon rubbed her fat stomach and took a long, deep yawn. She looked down over her mammoth boobs and noticed Ash. Figuring it was her new trainer, she proceeded to lumber over to the him, her very footstep causing the ground to shake with her weight. She was so big her head nearly touched the ceiling of the Labratory, and her earth-shaking footsteps caused the floor to crack under her.. Her vast hips swayed side to side and smashed against some equipment as she passed, antidotes and T.M's falling to the ground noisily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer absolutely gargantuan belly jutted out in front of her, wobbling like jelly each step she took. Resting on her obviously well fed gut was a set of massively oversized boobs, like beach balls filled with pudding cascading from her flabbily chest. Her Monstorous Booty wobbled along, wiggling like it has a mind of its own as it almost touched the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh watched her lumber closer, Professor Oaks Lab shaking with her weight and her footsteps leaving craters in the cracked floor. Her appearance made him feel weird, his face felt red and his crotch twinges in a funny way he wasn't used to yet. Snapping back to reality, he saw the gigantic teenager come to a halt in front of the counter, her massive shadow slowly loomed over him ominously, blocking out the light from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Snorlax looked down past her belly, smirked and leaned on her hip to get her new trainers hormones stirring<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, this is Terry. She's a...special type of Pokemon that was subjected to experimentation when she was a Munchlax.\" Oak smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nervously smiled.\"She's...ummmm...very big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry smiled, making her chipmunk cheeks puff up even more. \"Big? Come on, don't you think that's a bit of an understatement, lil guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's jaw hit the floor. \"You...you can...t-t-talk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said\" Professor Oak cut in, \"Terry was a test subject for a lot of experiments by some very bad people, one of those experiments was getting Pokemon to speak human\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked at Terry with a science of awe and fear, finnaly finding the nerve to make a proper greeting with her. \"Hi Terry, I'm Ash, and I'm gonna be your new Master!\"</span></div></div>",

The Hall of Origen was a temple above Earth in the heavens (Arceus's Dimension) where legendaries come to discuss matters in an orderly fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWel, it's supposed to be an orderly fashion. But it's usually a time and place where legendaries can express there hate for each other, and then start rivalries, and then try to kill each other, and have Arceus step in stop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as of late, things have...peaceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no more fights, no more shouting, no more threats to destroy anyone, no more actual trying to kill someone. For the first time in centuries, there was a total peace among the Legendaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Arceus hated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed a great deep sigh as she contemplated her thoughts in her room. Arceus didn't really need a room, since she doesn't have to sleep, but she had it made just the same. Despite it being a complete annoyance to her, Arceus missed the fighting in the Hall. Sure, in those days the world almost was destroyed, like, 15 times in only a couple of years, but at least there was something to do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she just lazing around the Hall of Origen, trying to find something to distract her from her boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might as well check in on the chosen one and see how he's doing.\" Arceus moaned to herself. That was the most recent of her thoughts since the boredom kicked in:Ash. Ash had made an impression on her when she met/ saved by him. He was selfless, passionate about his Pokemon, would do anything to earn there respect, no wonder he was the Chosen One.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus walked to the observatory room. It had a large, glass dome in the middle of it where the earth showed floating in space. \"Show me the Chosen One\" Arceus said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of Earth magnified on Ash's location. It zoomned in on Unova, where Ash, Cilan, and Iris were resting at a Pokemon Center. There, Arceus saw Ash currently feasting away on food, one of hos favorite pastimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus noticed how happy ash looked after finishing his meal, his content smile while rubbing his slightly swollen stomach. \"Huh\" Arceus said to herself \"I wonder what so special about food\". Arceus had never actually eaten food before. She was a legendary, they don't get hungry (or full for that matter) and they don't need any extra energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut seeing Ash smile like that because of food, Arceus was generally intrigued by the concept of eating now. Unfortanetly, there was no food in the Hall of Origen, so she would have to go to earth if she wanted food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it dawned on her. She had something to do, an excuse to get out and finnally do something fun! She nearly leaped for joy at the realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, calm down,\" Arceus told herself. \"Now... I think its time for a well needed vacation from being a goddess.\" Arceus started to glow a bright white light.\"And who better to help me relax...\" Arceus filled the room with light now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...than the king of gluttony himself, Ash Ketchum?\" Arceus giggled as she teleported to Earth.</span></div></div>",

The bright light soon formned and compressed into a quadruped shape floating in the air. Suddenly, light faded way and revealed the PokeGod Arceus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Mmmmmm it feels good to get out and visit my creation~\" Arceus chimed. Muscles that have been inactive for the longest time were finnaly moving again, giving Arceus a relaxing stretch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...where is the red-roofed building Ash is staying at?\" Arceus asked to herself. It didn't take long to spot it out, since she was hovering over the city and the PokeCenter stuck out like a sore thumb. Arceus smiled to herself, laughing slightly at how easy things were going for her today. As she descended upon the Earth, however, she came into a bit...of a snag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOOOM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe forgot about her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she placed her hold onto the paved street, her weight instantly cracked it and brought chunks of cement flying everywhere. By the time she rested her other feet, the street looked like it survived a tornado. Arceus surveyed the destruction she inadvertently caused and blushed. \"...ooops\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus looked over her body and realized that it was easily bigger than the street she was standing in, Her golden wheel knocked over an arena off a nearby roof. \"I...forgot how SMALL humans are.\" Arceus exclaimed. \"I know I'm big, but I at least thought there would still be room for my form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she spotted the PokeCenter, right at the end of the street. Arceus walked her giant body over, accident my uprooting trees along the way and squashing cars. After about a minute (and thirty thousand dollars worth of damage) Arceus found herself in front of the PokeCenter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness everyone's asleep, I never did like the media.\" Arceus mused to herself, envisioning a newspaper in her head. 'Alpha God Rampages Unova!'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...now....how am I going to fit in there?\" Arceus tilted her head to a side as she inspected the building below her. Not only was she too big tor the front doors, the PokeDenter itself came up to her KNEES. Maybe she didn't think this all the way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...there is one thing I can do.\" Arceus said as she started to focus here energy on her form. \"If this 'Cillan' is like that Brock that I've been watching, then what I'm about to do will set him bowing at my feet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once again, Arceus form started to grow bright. But this time, her body started to shrink itself. The PokeCenter soon came up to her torso, than neck, than head, until her body was finnaly small enough to fit through the doors (barely).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Arceus wasent done yet. The bright silhouette of Arceus started to shift. Her forelegs lifted off the ground, her hind legs starting to stand up on there own. Her forelegs soon rested on her now upright torso, turning them into arms. Her hoofs started to spread out, forming a 4 fingured hand from them. The golden wheel that surrounded her body just seemned to dies speed into thin air, like it was never there in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnaly, the part of the transformation took place. Her rear end suddenly poorer out two sagging orbs that threatened to envelope her tail. Her chest did the same, though the orbs did not seem to be quite as big as others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus's white shadow finnaly faded away, revealing a now anthropomorphic Arceus in the street. She now stood at 7.1 ft tall. Her white and grey hair still counties to defy gravity like before, but lightly dropped down to her shoulders. Although most people wouldn't ale notice of these things until they notice the most impressive features of her new form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus had a figure that human women would be jealous of.. Giant J cup boobs swayed and jiggled at the slightest movement, protruding proxy off her chest. However, unlike humans, Arceus didn't have fell the same biological features. What were they called again...nipples? Arceus's globes were were fielded with soft white fur, making them more comfortable than any human pillow. But her rack failed in comparison to her rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo giant Yoga balls of flesh bounced softly on Arceus's rear end. If she ever needed to sit dow she would need two chairs, and they still would overflow. Her tail say Curley atop her white orbs, wagging over them slightly, feeling the warmth they provide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus looked over her form and smiled. She would never tell her children this but she actually liked being in this form. She liked how big and soft she felt, and toying with human minds as she 'accidentally' bumped into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been so long since I've been in this form.\" Arceus gave her chest globes a squeeze, groaning as a wave of pleasure washed over her. \"Now I'm in it again, and my first victim...\" Arceus gazed at the PokeCenter across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...is the chosen one himself.\" </span></div></div>",

As she looked out at the lobby, she noted it was a very well kept affair, not a speck of dirt or dust anywhere to be seen. Three figures were in the lobby, but none of them, to her disappointment, were Ash or his friends. A Nurse Joy stood next to her Chansey and Audino. The young girl was attending to a rack of Pokeballs in some sort of machine. Arceus cleared her throat to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Welcome!\" The Nurse Joy replied cheerfully. She had yet to turn around to face her, unaware she was talking to the most powerful Pokemon in existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...hi...\" Arceus said. She had not a lot of experience with talking with humans, and this one seemed to be too preoccupied to even greet her properly, making things exponentially harder for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus looked off to the side as she remembered why she was here in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...do you happen to know which room Ash ketchum is staying in...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down the hall and to the right.\" The Nurse Joy said as she pointed down to the hall in question, still facing the machine. The Audino and Chamsey were also busy, doing assoted tasks for the lady as she worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Arceus thanked her and walked down the hall, she began to wonder how good of a nurse thst Joy was. She just gave information about someone to a random stranger she had never met. For all she knew, that could have been a kidnapper. She scowled and decided to punish her for her incompetence later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus faced the room that Ash was sleeping in. She was actually very anxious and began to fumble her 8 fingers together in a very un-goddessley way. The last time she saw Ash in person was technically hundreds of years ago in ancient Michina Town, where he had saved her from death and from ruining present day Minchina over a misunderstanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Ash. You haunted my personal thoughts everyday since I saw you. Now, i'm going to invade yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus opened the door into Ash's dark room. She could hear his partner, a Pikachu, snore softly in the dark. She turned on the lights so she could see and the room was illuminated. He and the Pikachu were curled up in their bed, most likely dead tired from their journey. Arceus blushed as she gazed upon her obsession, dreaming without a care in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized, however, that he couldn't teach her how to eat like he did if he was asleep. She pondered on this and came up with an idea. She could go about this one of two ways. Arceus could eighter be polite and wait for him to wake up, or...</span></div></div>",

The trainers started to walk to the field of Pokemon battle. Terrence, 17 year old Pokemon trainer from Saffron city was Hyped and ready for his upcoming match along with his trusty first choice Pokemon Sparks, a Pikachu. Sparks had been through a lot with his trainer, Mastering a skill-set of moves and abilities that could Challenge some of the largest and intimidating kinds of Pokemon, traveling along the lands defeating many gym leaders to gain the prized badges and even competing in the grand Indigou Pokemon league to try and help his trainer claim the title of Pokemon Grand Master. Even though he and his fellow Pokemon colleagues only lasted until the mid stage rounds, he put up one hell of a fight and even defeated some of the most ferocious opponents such as Charizards and Dragonites using his mastery of quick Attacks. So a charity friendly match was no longer the nervous ordeal it once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparks felt an Adrenaline rush as he waited inside his poke ball in his state of readiness as if he could take on any opponent thrown at him. \"Trainers please send out your first Pokemon!\"the irritatingly overexcited announcer bellowed over the stadium speakers. Terrence now arrived at his side of the Pokemon battle arena podium looked over to see his opponent was a female about Terrence's own age and sporting a rather hefty figure, Terrence thought she looked a little naive for a serious trainer even if she was dressed in sporty clothes and a cap and maybe she was just pity fodder who the league let in to the big time stadium because of this match being for charity, he thought she looked kinda cute but he was determined to concentrate on the match as he threw out the poke ball containing Sparks (he always used Sparks first and his main choice).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap opening of the poke ball, sparks materialized onto the field ready for action. (Okay bring it on! I feel like i could take on a Gyrados tonight!) thought the Nimble Pikachu. The other trainer looked out upon Sparks with a slight smirk as she reached for her Pokeball. \" go Cocoa!\" She yelled as she threw her poke ball onto the field and as the glowy outline of her selected Pokemon started to materialize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparks noticed this Pokemon was a larger type from the glowy outline, maybe a Snorlax or Charizard. However when the full materialization had taken Place, he could see in plain sight it was a female Raichu but never before had he seen one this size! Not only of amazingly tall height for a Raichu she was undeniably sporting one big and heavy figure,from her curvy assets to her bottom heavy hips and rear it filled Her comparatively insignificant sized opponent with ambivalence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n( Whoa! She's huge! What does her trainer feed her? Kangasthan Meat? and she sure is a big girl, her hips must extend from here to...no! Snap out of it! A Pokemon's Size and gender has never thrown you off before!) Sparks quickly changed his expression as he tried to reaffirm himself in full professional battlemode. ( She's just fat and lazy, that's all! The bigger they are, the harder they fall! She must barely be even to lift her tail at that size, ill take advantage of my speed as always! After all she's a Raichu, i bet she never even learned quick attack as a Pikachu, probably just had a rushed evolution so she could be a bully like all the other Raichus) Sparks thought with a determined scorn as his past in the wild before his capture by his trainer as he was always bullied by Raichus that took other reason than there own amusement at his fear of them. But After his training and experiences in Pokemon battling , Sparks had learn t tricks and abilities way beyond his size that had taken down many a Raichu in past battles and he loved every minute of showing them that his Strategy and speed and Outmatched them every time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n. Sparks had no intention of showing this particular Raichu any mercy. The Intimidating Raichu Cocoa gave Sparks a quick look and gave a cocky smile as she focused in on him. Sparks felt a mixture of anger and apprehension as he noticed her leer. ( Dammit, I hate it when Raichus look at me like that! ill show her not to underestimate me just because I'm a Pikachu!) Sparks thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sparks! She's just a typical Raichu under all that weight! You know what to do, volt tackle! End this quick!\" his trainer yelled. Oddly Cocoa's trainer just gave a slight smile and watched silently as Sparks bolted into action and started to run quickly in a zig zag pattern towards Cocoa, building up speed and electricity for a powerful volt tackle. After a unhindered run up, Sparks dived into the air headed straight for his opponents top half hoping to knock her down with one volt charged strike. Reacting unexpectedly quickly, Cocoa Span round and places her paws on her ample ass in preparation for a counter position, she quickly charges electricity from within and leaps backwards from the ground at amazing propulsion and speed, meeting Sparks midair with thunderous impact with her butt. * SLAM!* only given a second to react to her move, Sparks is catapulted away with twice as much velocity amongst a barrage of electrical energy omitted from Cocoa own Special style of volt tackle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being flung sharply across the stadium back to his own end, Sparks hit the ground sharply, ricocheting several times gathering painful impact bruises. Her electrical Charge was at a whole other level to his and although being an electric type it wasn't as Painful as other Pokemon types would endure, it sure stung as hell all over. Combined with the impact damage, trying to gather his thoughts Sparks could barely stand on his paws as he tried to asses what had happened. ( ARgh! that hurt like hell! My ears are ringing...how did she move that fast? I cant find my feet..i can barley see) As his vision returned slowly, currently at a blurry dizzy haze, he heard the distinct sound of \" THUD! THUD! THUD!\" from Cocoas giant paws resonating slightly from the soft plastic green floor of the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCocoa was making her way steadily but dreadingly unhurriedly towards him. A chill came over Sparks as his vision could now just about make out her gigantic frame standing over him. For the first time in the battle, Cocoa spoke to the Battered Pikachu who was struggling to make it to his paw, with a Feminine yet powerfully confident voice she stated \" Come on Little guy, give it up, I dont want to hurt you anymore. Just run back to your trainer and he'll zap you up inside your poke ball.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery Bad memory of Raichus who had thrown their weight around and bullied Sparks came bubbling to the surface of his emotions. He hated being told he was little and helpless, the humiliation he was already feeling at his Volt tackle being countered was enough but being told he should give up out sneering pity from a Raichu? Mustering up what little strength he could, Sparks refocused his attention on Cocoa and raised himself proudly on two paws. ( There's no way I'm giving in yet! I'll take her down somehow!) Sparks proclaimed to himself as feelings of steely Resistance filled him as he gave a defiant look towards Cocoa....</span></div></div>",

As if a vague memory of a dream, The stadium, his trainer, the noise of the crowd. All disappeared and replaced by the solid imagery of the beatings and taunting he used to receive from gangs of vicious Raichus that used to beat up and chase him because of his smaller size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if all his anger and prejudice against Raichus he felt had been focused into his thoughts and speech, Sparks barked out to Cocoa \u201c Only I decide when I\u2019m beaten you\u2026you..you Fat freak!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpark\u2019s words hit Cocoa like a Ice tipped bullet. Like Sparks, she had been victim to ridicule and bullying by other Pok\u00e9mon Due to her size in the past. But Not due to her small size, due to her large size. Ever since she was a Pichu she had always been unusually large for her breed and along with her expansive appetite which gave her a ultra-voluptuous figure that only made her stand out more, she was often the target of cruel insults and exclusion by other Pok\u00e9mon. All those words, those horrible words which triggered all the memories of loneliness and hurt. \u201c Lard-ass\u201d, \u201c Fatso\u201dand of course \u201cFreak\u201d, they all amounted to an old wound suddenly reopened by the scorning little Pikachu in front of her. She hated any Judgement or Degradation based on her weight.<br>\r\nFor what seemed like a short flash of time Sparks noticed how Cocoas previous expression of confidence had changed into a look of shock as his words sunk in, then Cocoa quickly looked away to the side as her cheeks turned red with a crimson of shame and hurt. Sparks saw what seemed to be a tear welling up in the corner of her eye, barely visible as she turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt dawned on Sparks very quickly what his impulsive verbal attack on Cocoa had done. His body was ready to gear up for another Speed attack but it seemed his frenzied insult had hurt her more than any physical attack could and he stopped . ( oh man, what have I said? I didn\u2019t mean it to come out like that!) Sparks thought with extreme regret. Sparks looked down very quickly towards the ground not wanting to look Cocoa in the eye as he was now feeling very ashamed of what his words had triggered. He slowly moved his face and eyes to face Cocoa and immediately apologize for his misguided tirade. \u201c I\u2026I didn\u2019t m-\u201c Before he could barely start his apology, Cocoa was now facing him directly with a very different expression. Her vulnerable visage just a second ago had been replaced with focused eyes and a wide cruel smile. \u201c So I\u2019m a freak am I? Well im gonna show you what this freak can do!\u201d cutting off any chance Sparks had to explain himself, as her now Slightly deeper and Anger filled voice boomed over him ,Cocoa Raised one her giant paws Over the repentant Pikachu and Brought it down upon him with extreme force. \u201c WHAM!\u201d Sparks was now pinned to the ground by Cocoas ample paw with ever increasing weight being applied to by Cocoas massive frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparks in incredible pain, tried in vain to utter out calls of Mercy, apology, help, anything to stop the immense pain and pressure he was being put under by the enraged Raichu, but it was useless, his body was under too much strain so he could barely make out gasps for air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCocoa! Stop it! You\u2019ve won, let him go!\u201d Cocoa\u2019s trainer Yelled from the podium, obviously seeing how far Cocoa was going. Cocoa was blind and deaf to any orders now, Any Pokemon that made fun of her weight was going to pay for it now, It\u2019s the main reason she had become such a formidable battler. Her days of running away and wallowing is in self-pity alone when she was in the wild were over, any emotional pain She felt was going to be paid back double in physical pain to any pokemon who made fun of her figure no matter what kind of Pok\u00e9mon and right now her sights were set on the Pikachu she now had beneath her right paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I got a special move that should teach you some manners!\u201d Cocoa yelled at Sparks as she removed her paw and turned around and bent her knees in preparation for a special move she had learnt for taking larger Pok\u00e9mon off their feet. \u201cEarthquake!\u201d Cocoa yelled as she sprung upwards into the air once again with unimaginable Speed and Propulsion. Sparks was momentarily released from the pressure of her paw crush and was barley catching his breath when he looked up to see Cocoas Giant rear starting to plummet towards him from above. * SLAM! CRASSHH!* with incredible dissension, Cocoas rear slammed down upon him and all but Sparks\u2019s head was smothered by the impact of Cocoas gargantuan body as the force of her Earthquake attack caused the Stadium ground around him to crack and split form the pressure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure of this devastating move made Sparks feel he had been sat on by a titanic goddess. The sharp Pain and shock caused him to black out. \u201c Ha! How do you like that!\u201d Cocoa boasted while closing her eyes in a satisfied manner. As she opened them her rage had died down as had the Shattered ground of the stadium and shock wave around her. Her expression changed from smugness to concern as she realized just how much devastation her attack might have caused to the silent and flattened Pikachu. She immediately rose from her position and stood up. \u201c Hey\u2026are you okay?\u201d\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sparks was slowly opening his eyes to the unfamiliar interior of the Pok\u00e9mon centre recovery ward.  As soon as his thoughts had cleared, he knew exactly the familiar scenario he had now found himself in, he had been defeated by an enemy Pok\u00e9mon  to the point of passing out \u2026After his foggy sight focused in on his surroundings he noticed his trainer Terrence and the Trainer of Cocoa were leaning over him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTerence with a look of relief, exclaimed \u201c Sparks old buddy! Glad to see you finally woke up! Your going to be fine champ, Nurse Joy said it was just shock and a few bruises on your body, two more days in the centre Max!\u201d.  Mellisa ( Cocoas trainer) Spoke as well. \u201c Oh im so sorry About what Cocoa did to you Sparks, she\u2019s never disobeyed me like that before, I feel awful about what happened and I can tell Cocoa does too, isn\u2019t that right Cocoa?\u201d Melissa turned to the back of the room and from a short distance away the familiar voice of a female Raichu was heard \u201c Rai\u2026rai\u201d (Translation: Yes\u2026I do).<br>\r\n <br>\r\n That very moment Nurse Joy walked in. \u201c Ahh as expected your little Pikachu is up about Mr Terrence,  as you can see if was mostly just a few bruises and pressure shock that caused him to pass out for so long, a couple of days to let those bruises heal over and he\u2019ll be as spry as a Pidgeot!  You should leave him alone to get some further rest and be fed after a short while but first If you\u2019d like to follow me to my office we\u2019ll go over His medication plan, now this Involved the New D-Grade pills that should be taken with meals..\u201d Nurse joy explained. Melissa chimed in \u201c Oh ive used D Grades before, Ill come with you Terrence, ill help explain anything you don\u2019t get about the poractical stuff. Cocoa, You stay here and Look After Sparks..maybe even Apologise aye? Good girl.\u201d Melissa beamed.  \u201c Okay Sparks will be back soon, take it easy okay?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  Cocoa Continued to look meek and apologetic as she started to take large, slow steps towards the bedded and bandaged Pikachu.  * Thwump!Thwump! Thwump!* The familiar soft thuds her Giant paws made reminded Sparks of the sharp feelings  of Dread he had experienced just a short time ago in the stadium, as the last time he heard those thuds it meant only that the towering Raichu was about to dish out a devastating attack.  However as Cocoa moved in close enough to kneel over the bed slightly ( she was tall enough so that her arms, chest and face were visible above the bed, something most Raichus would not come close to be able to do).  Cocoa looked at Sparks with soft, guilty eyes. Her expression brought out gut reactions in Sparks that were completely different  from before, intimidation being replaced with intrigue and ambivalence. What was really going on in that Titaness\u2019s mind? (Was she here to make fun of me? Was she forced here by her trainer? Is she genuinely sorry? Please gods don\u2019t tell me she had intentions of harming me\u2026.after all she is a Raichu and you cant really trust those brutes!). A great many thoughts passed through Sparks mind at that instant but they all seem to result in just  him posing a very neutral dumbfounded look on his face and awkwardly greeting her with \u201c Uhhh\u2026hi there\u201d ( Well that sounded dumb!) Sparks inner critic thought to himself at the casual utterance. Cocoa Slowly began to speak with an honest tone. \u201c Look Sparks,  I\u2019m really sorry about what I did to you, I just lost control. That move was supposed to be for taking Dragonites off their feet,I wanted you to know im not cruel by nature\u2026I was bullied a lot in the wild growing up because of my size and it\u2026well its no excuse at all but it still can still have an effect on me today when I hear certain  words..and I\u2019m really sorry\u201d.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n It very quickly sunk into Sparks why his words in the battle had such an effect on her, He was bullied a lot because of Size aswell in the wild..just for the opposite reason, for being small and helpless against packs of Cruel Raichus that used to lay claim to his area. \u201cCocoa, you have nothing to apologise for, winning a Pokemon match is what your supposed to do, what I said was just pure nasty and\u2026I want you to know I didn\u2019t mean any of it, I said it out of Jealousy..\u201d  after hearing her be so honest and open Sparks felt a striking desire to be follow suit \u201c  I was so jealous that I was defeated by you so easily I just lashed out and \u2026I had a bad past with other Raichus, I guess I was just directing my feelings I had for them to you\u2026I was so desperate to try and hurt you physically in battle I resorted to the worst form of damage\u2026verbal damage and I became nothing but an asshole because of it, I deserve everything I got\u2026sorry\u201d.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n After hearing Sparks confession Cocoas expression changed slightly more compassionate and upbeat as she told sparks \u201c Oh don\u2019t be silly hun, it doesn\u2019t matter what you said in the battle, Im a professional  fighter and I shouldn\u2019t let mere words cause me to lose control..especially  when I know my size is mostly my fault and there were was some truth to what you said..i shouldn\u2019t take my body issues out on an opponent like that.\u201d Cocoas ears and eyes drooped a little in an obvious showing that she was having a moment of self-loathing. As if Sparks was on auto piloted he stridently spoke back \u201c Don\u2019t say that! You bested me fair and square with your amazing skills and strength and you have a beautiful and powerful body and should not be ashamed of it!\u201d almost instantly after Sparks little speech he felt a sting of hot blood flow to his head as he became awash with embarrassment as his inner reasoning yelled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Ohh!\u201d She gasped and quickly moved her paw onto Spark\u2019s forehead as she knew the main cause of dark orange sparks spluttering from an electric mouse Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s cheek was most commonly high fever from a potentially life threatening disease.\u201d You didn\u2019t tell me you had a fever sparks! How bad is it\u2026oh\u201d. After a few seconds of checking his forehead she realised he was perfectly normal temperature. \u201c No\u2026my temperatures fine\u201d Sparks slowly told Cocoa with a tone of apprehension as the Small bursts of orange sparks came out. Cocoas feelings soon changed from concern to flattered appreciation as she knew there was only one other time Pikachus emitted dark orange cheek sparks, that being a time of intense love and desire. Before she thought Sparks confession of admiration of her looks and body could just be polite apologetic guilt but There was a saying amongst electric type Pokemon \u201c The Sparks don\u2019t lie\u201d, Taken aback at first at how A Pikachu could ever find a Raichu of her size desirable, Cocoa felt touched by the primal affections of this Little Pikachu, she then giggled a little at how the saying has double meaning as the Pikachus name in question is literally \u201cSparks\u201d and he certainly was not lying!. \u201c did I say something funny?\u201d Said Sparks as Cocoa lifted her paw from him. \u201c No, you didn\u2019t, and I think your obviously far from a fever, although you may be coming down with something else\u201d Cocoa said with a loving smile. \u201c Huh?\u201dreplied Sparks oblivious to what his Spark based reactions were showing Cocoa. \u201c Im just so glad you understand me and you forgive me...it means a lot to me\u201d As Cocoa explained with a gentle voice to Sparks her gratitude, she leaned in and gave an innocent yet passionate kiss on his cheek as she closed her eyes.  Sparks turned a deep red in shock as the feeling of Cocoa kiss on his cheek felt like nothing he had ever experienced before, Could this warm feeling of affection really be coming from a Raichu of all Pokemon? The Breed he had written of as all arrogant jerks? Amongst the thoughts of Surprise swirling in his heated head Sparks knew one thing above all, he was really enjoying this moment.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs in what seemed like a flash, Terrence and Melissa walked in  and beheld  Cocoas Action on Sparks. \u201c Whoa!\u201d exclaimed Terrence. \u201c Cocoa! Bad girl! Leave that poor Pikachu alone!\u201d Yelled Mellissa. Cocoa quickly snapped away from Sparks and Looked slightly embarrassed at hangdog at her master. \u201cheh heh, you don\u2019t need to be angry with Cocoa, I think she was just making a very heartfelt apology, Sparks doesn\u2019t seem to be against it\u201d Terrence said with an almost college jock like approval. \u201cStill...Sometimes little missy here needs to learn not to be so headstrong when im out of her view for a few seconds aye?\u201d Melissa beamed at Cocoa. \u201c Come on Cocoa, we need to get ready for that Match tonight, say goodbye to Sparks!\u201d. Cocoa turned to Sparks with a warm smile and said \u201c Thank you for forgiving me Sparks, you really are a special Pikachu\u201d. Sparks now feeling a sudden pang at sadness at the prospect of a goodbye replied \u201c no, thank you for understanding, its just such a shame we probably wont get to know each other more..\u201d Cocoa continued to smile \u201c Oh don\u2019t be so sure, fate has a way of bringing pokemon together when they want it bad enough\u201d and with a wink, Cocoa Walks off with Melissa as the human trainers make their farewells.  \u201cGoodbye Cocoa\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSpeaking of which Terrence walked to wards Spark\u2019s bedside, where Sparks expected him to inform him of the latest training schedules after he was out of the centre.  \u201cwell I\u2019m glad to see you and Cocoa seem to hit it off,  because Mellissa has invited me over for dinner at her place and she said she\u2019d love it if you could come along too out of poke ball on free foot little buddy, she wants to make you a special meal as well to make up for what happened, I take it you\u2019d like that?\u201d. Sparks heart raced at the news. \u201c Pika!Pika!\u201d The words Terrence heard where filled with such enthusiasm he knew what Sparks wanted in his response. \u201c OK champ, we\u2019ll be there on Thursday night.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Terrence approached the expansive, well maintained entrance to Melissa\u2019s house for the dinner he and Sparks had been invited too, which turned out to be more of a farmhouse ranch, he released Sparks from his Pokeball. \u201c Now Sparks, on your best behaviour Okay, I get the feeling you want Cocoa and Melisa to think you\u2019re a well behaved Pikachu!\u201d. Terrence explained. \u201c Pika!\u201d Sparks replied enthusiastically. the heart of the little Pikachu was beating faster than usual at the anticipation of being at Cocoas home and meet her again. He knew in his heart that the idea of a Pikachu and a Raichu becoming mates was a mere fantasy but that didn\u2019t help in how he thought of her. He just hoped their friendship wouldn\u2019t be ruined by him saying or doing something stupid. He just hoped to the heavens that they got along and she still liked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrence rang the doorbell and it was promptly opened by Melissa who welcomed him in with a hug . \u201c Come on in guys, I can tell Cocoa Cocoa has been excited to see you Sparks, I think she has a soft spot for you!\u201d Melissa addressed to Sparks. he blushed a little at this as he slowly plodded into the entrance and was immiedtaley awestruck by how large and lavish this house was, upon thoughts of his impressions on the outside, it would seem this was more of a ranch or a farm or something considering the expansive land the house was built around. \u201c Wow, this place is pretty swish, You actually own this?\u201d Terrence asked. \u201c I do now, this whole place with its grounds is actually a Taraus farm and a Pok\u00e9mon specialist care ranch for injured or troubled Pok\u00e9mon that need special help with training. It used to belong to my Aunt but she taught me everything she knew and moved away abroad, She asked me if I wanted to take Up the place and I was more than ready for the challenge, so I guess you could call me the administrator of this place.\u201d Mellissa explained back to Terrence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pikachu glanced around at the expansive living room area the entrance hall lead into he noticed lots of Pok\u00e9mon exercise apparatus and toys. It seemed like a house designed more for Pok\u00e9mon than it was people. Then the striking sight of Cocoa standing by the couch hit his vision dead on. She looked just as bold and bountiful as ever with her huge frame but the her warm greeting smile and wagging tail gave off a new aura of Pleasant vehemence about her. \u201cWelcome Sparks, I\u2019m so glad you came!\u201d Cocoa said with a smile. \u201c Oh my pleasure, believe me, your trainers house is beautiful!!\u201d Sparks beamed with a slight blush; he couldn\u2019t help feel even more nervous the more Cocoa showed compassion and excitement towards him. \u201cYour Pok\u00e9mon must love it here hen\u201d Said Terrence. \u201c Oh yeah I try and keep them out of there Pokeballs as much as possible, Cocoa here is never in hers except for transport, she\u2019s not just my champion and pet, she\u2019s my friend as well, isn\u2019t that right my little princess?\u201d Melissa said in a baby talk kind of way as she walked over to Cocoa and stroked her Ears and face all over with sentimental fondness. \u201cChuu..chuu\u201d Cocoa purred out as she closed her eyes to indulge in her trainers affections. ( little princess huh? More like Conquering Empress!) Sparks thought ti himself with a giggle as he saw how surreal it looked to see Cocoa be so docile like a pampered meowth. ( he found it Difficult to believe this fearsomely large pokemon with such devastating attacks could be treated like a giant cuddly teddy bear.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Cocoa, Sparks, into the Kitchen, I made a special dinner for you guys, Terrence take a seat in the dining room, ours will be ready soon!\u201d announced Melissa. Cocoa and Sparks made their way on all fours into the Kitchen, Sparks was ripe with anticipation to see what had been made, by the way Mellisa was talking, it seemed unlikely it was just gonna be regular Pok\u00e9mon canned food. The Kitchen that Sparks was presented with looked like it was installed yesterday, everything was clean and gleaming and the floor was made of black and white tiles with a clear and disorientating reflection. Coming from the upper surfaces of the kitchen was the enticing aroma of cooked meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they both stopped on two paws to wait for Mellisa to get them the food, Cocoa turned to Sparks and asked \u201c So Sparks you ever had human food before?\u201d , \u201c not really. A few snacks here and there\u201d Sparks replied. \u201c Oh you\u2019re in for a treat here then!\u201d Cocoa beamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Guys, I made double loaded Burgers for you guys, These are the size I usually make for Cocoa Sparks so just eat what you can OK?\u201d Melissa said and she placed the huge burgers down on the floor on surprisingly high class looking silver plates. Melissa then walked back to the other side of the kitchen to finish her and Terrence\u2019s meal and left Cocoa and Sparks to their meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Huge burger, bursting with fillings and grilled meat before Sparks caused the Pikachu to gulp in amazement at its size. Cocoa licked her lips and greedily started taking huge bites of her burger as she lifted it to her waiting maw with her paws. Bit by bit her burger started to disappear. Sparks looked on at amazement at the huge female Raichu before him, guzzling down huge chompfulls of the burger that was in her paws. ( Damn, I can see where she got that body from, Shes amazing!) A lot of Pokemon may be averse to the ravenous appetite Cocoa had, but for Sparks it was just one more free spirited aspect of her that made him appreciate her. Cocoa momentarily stopped to look down at the little Pikachu still looking bedazlled at her Gluttony and the size of his own burger. \u201c You gonna start there little guy? Don\u2019t worry if you cant eat it all, Id be more than willing to finish anything you cant handle\u201d. Cocoa told Sparks with a hint of making fun of his limited stomach size. Sparks\u2019s competitive proud side came out at this and he gave a confident smile back with sharpened eyes. \u201c Oh don\u2019t worry! I won\u2019t let a burger defeat me!\u201d Sparks retorted with cockiness as he started to take bites from the side of the burger, trying to catch up to Cocoas speed a little. ( mmm Man this is good, so many flavours, this is SO much better than human food!) Sparks continued to munch away, the heavily packed meat of the burger and the gooey thick cheese were starting to take their toll on the poor little Pikachy as his belly started to stretch outwards into a tightly packed ball shape. When Squeaks was barely even half way done he had to take a rest as the mouthfuls of high fat burger meat and all the trimmings with it were causing an overload of sensations he\u2019d never felt before. As he sat down to take a rest he noticed Cocoa was just finishing her last bite of her burger and she finished it off with a satisfied gulp.\u201d *Beeellcch!* \u201c Finished! Man, I love Melissa loaded burgers, you having trouble there spark?\u201d said Cocoa. Sparks felt so belittled by how she made it look so easy, if he were to give up now less than half way done, he thought he\u2019d look like some kind of fragile culinary wimp! He had to at least try to finish it. \u201c ugh..no way! Just pacing myself, I can finish this no problem!\u201d Sparks tried to proclaim proudly. Cocoa Placed her Empty plate down beside her and grinned calmly back at Sparks, she found it amusing how his stubborn competitiveness was stopping him from admitting defeat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sparks starting to look very overwhelmed by the half eaten burger. He defiantly got off from his sitting position and onto to his two back paws to prove he was not going to be defeated by its Calorie filled power. Cocoa raised one eyebrow as she looked to Sparks with relaxed intrigue. \u201c So, you really think you can finish this meal?\u201d Asked Cocoa with toying provocation. \u201cOh I can and will!\u201d Sparks said with a determined smile. \u201c Well that sounds like you accept my challenge! Finish the meal and lets say it counts as you beating me in a Pokemon match m\u2019kay?\u201d Cocoa declared. \u201cYou\u2019re on!\u201d Sparks met her Challenge with great enthusiasm, he may have many different feelings in him with regards to this Ravenous Raichu before him, but above all he was a battling Pokemon, and a challenge was a challenge! How could he refuse a chance to beat this formidable opponent if all he had to do was finish half of a hamburger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparks began taking more bites one after the other to gradually ware down the mass of Meat before him, By now his stomach was starting to make unsettled churning noises. Cocoa just looked on in amusement, as if she knew the result of a game before it had even started. Sparks was determined to eat this damn burger, it was only about a quarter left now. He felt he was taking his stomachs endurance to its absolute edge but It would be worth it just to show Cocoa he could do it. (Maybe if I can show I can eat as much as she does, she\u2019ll have some sort of new respect for me!). Sparks thought to himself to give him an extra incentive to manage the gargantuan burger. As Sparks finished of the last morsel of the Burger, he lay flat on his back and panted heavily as if he\u2019d just finished a marathon. \u201c *Pant, pant*\u2026There\u2026I finished the whole thing\u2026not bad for a Pikachu huh?\u201d Sparks said in a strained, exhausted voice whilst smiling triumphantly at what he thought was a pretty impresessive feet of appetite considering his size, the burger looked like it was almost as big as him! \u201cSure is Sparks! You\u2019re halfway to winning!\u201d Cocoa said with a hint of devilish glee at the revelation. \u201c Huh? Half way? What do you mean, I finished it all!\u201d Sparks replied with shock and confusion. \u201c The Challenge was to finish the meal sparks, this was just the first course, don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t notice those Sundaes on the Kitchen counter?\u201d Cocoa said as she tilted her head slightly to the direction where two mountainous and indulgent looking ice cream Sundaes were resting . \u201c You mean\u2026those are for us and not our trainers?\u201d Cocoa asked in horror. \u201c Oh no, as a guest Mellissa always makes sure she makes desert, after all its only a teeny little bit of ice cream, don\u2019t tell me your gonna quit on me now?\u201d Cocoa revealed to the stuffed looking Pikachu , knowing all along there wasn\u2019t a hope in High water that Sparks was gonna win this little challenge of hers. Sparks gulped in slight dread, she was obviously toying with him, but he had to at least try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMellisa walked in form the other kitchen prep area room. \u201cOh my Sparks, you must have been hungry, you cleared your plate! Im glad I made this desert for you both, I thought it would go to waste! Here you go you two, bonne appetite!\u201d Mellissa placed the Two Sundaes in front of the Pokemon along with two spoons and left back to Her meal with Terrence. \u201c Mmmm triple fudge, marshmallow and vanilla supreme! I love it when Mellisa makes these, dig in Sparks!\u201d Cocoa beamed as she Picked up the spoon and started scooping large portions of the sundae into her Salivating maw. Sparks just looked on in amazement at Cocoa indulging in the ice cream, there was something about the way she enjoyed her food unashamedly that really appealed to his inner senses. He knew he couldn\u2019t stare, above all it was rude and he had his own little challenge to attend too. Sparks slowly dragged himself on to his two back paws again, the heavy weight and pain in his now distended stomach making it harder for him to move his body. He shakily reached for the spoon and took one tiny scoop out of the Sundae. Placing the spoon in his mouth his taste buds sent a sensation to his brain that told him while delicious, the sundae was packed with more calories than he could handle. As he swallowed the first mouthful, his stomach made a deep gurgling noise, he really was at his limit food wise now. Only managing a few meagre mouthfuls more, Sparks collapsed forwards onto the floor in a daze of ice cream induced bewilderment. \u201c ohhh *Groan* Cocoa\u2026I can\u2019t do it, its too much!\u201d Sparks groaned out . As he was saying this, Cocoa was just about finishing the last few spoonfuls of her sundae, she was obviously moving at a much difference pace to the struggling Pikachu beside her. \u201c *gulp* ahh delicious! It even had crumbled cookies in the bottom!\u201d Cocoa enthuistiastically said as she placed down the empty sundae glass and threw in the spoon. She then turned her eyes to the yielding Pokemon sprawled on the shiny floor. \u201c hmm..so I guess that means you give in huh? I win again?\u201d Cooa\u2019s tone was that of playful mocking. If there was one thing she enjoyed doing it was winning, especially if it involved showing a cocky male Pok\u00e9mon how they can overestimate themselves. She was unashamedly gonna enjoy this victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparks was realising what a jackass he was by trying to eat any of the ice cream at all, he should have just admitted defeat earlier but now he was feeling like he had bowling ball in his body and his head was spinning. Not only did he feel he\u2019d made a fool of himself in front of The Raichu that had defeated him at the stadium so easily, he now feared he might even be sick in front of her. ( Damnit, I would have thought she\u2019d of at least slowed down by that sundae, she ate it like it was a tiny cracker..i cant get on her level in Pokemon battling or food, im so pathetic..). \u201c You\u2026you win Cocoa *groan*\u201d Sparks meekly squeaked out, the pitiful sight of him not being able to make it to his paws was enough to Make Sparks give up any hope of trying to show he had any pride left. She\u2019d totally beaten him, plain and simple. \u201c You need more training young apprentice! The Sundae is only big in your mind, here let me show you how a champion does it!\u201d Cocoa said as she leaned one corpulent paw over to grab Spark\u2019s sundae glass and lifted it up to herself. She titled the glass towards her open mouth and with her other paw clutching her spoon she she started shovelling in the entire sundae slowly into her maw and was guzzling it all down with gluttonous aplomb. Sparks watched in amazement as in just a few seconds of greedy slurps and gulps she had finished off the entire Sundae like it was a glass of water. \u201c *slurp* Ahh! I always love it when I get seconds!\u201d Cocoa said triumphantly as she laid the now second empty sundae glass on the floor, wiped away the ice cream around her face and patted her expansive belly with both paws. Sparks watched on at this Raichus display of seemingly endless appetite with disbelief, he\u2019d never seen a female Pokemon be so unashamedly gluttonous like that, so shameless, capable and free\u2026Sparks couldn\u2019t logically explain why, but he was feeling deeply aroused by the display. A small flurry of Dark orange sparks emitted from the infatuated Pikachu\u2019s cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCocoa noticed the Dark orange flickers and knew exactly what it meant. ( So he likes a girl that can eat eh? This is so perfect! ) Cocoa gleefully thought to herself as she decided it was time to have a little fun with Sparks. \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCocoa dropped forward onto all four paws and crouched forward slightly so her face was positioned right next to Spark\u2019s on his eye level. She then lowered her eyelids slightly and gave an intimidating smile like a predator that had trapped its prey and knew it couldn\u2019t get away. Being in the state of physical helplessness he was in and having the huge Raichu of his affections staring him right in the face just made Spark\u2019s mind jumble with conflicting thoughts and emotions. \u201c uhhh\u2026Cocoa?\u201d he meekly asked. \u201c It was cute of you to challenge me, but you know this Raichu plays to win and I usually get what I want\u2026and right now I have you just where I WANT you!\u201d\u201d Cocoa smoothly explained to Sparks in a sultry and somewhat intimidating voice. Spark\u2019s cheeks turned crimson red with a surge of blood and adrenaline.. ( What the hell is her game here? She looks like shes gonna eat me..) Sparks panicked thoughts brought to mind. Once again Spark\u2019s stuffed stomach let out a gurgling groan and he clutched it as he felt a jolt of pain from it. \u201c Ughh, Cocoa I ate too much\u2026I don\u2019t think I can even move\u201d. Sparks said as his voice tone sounded more and more like a plea for help. Cocoa snapped out whatever frame of mind she was in before and sat upwards., her voice now changing to a more delicate and compassionate tone \u201c Aww my poor Challenger..you look like a Big pillowy Yellow Jigglypuff..so cute!\u201d. Cocoas making fun of Spark\u2019s condition would normally enrage Pikachus male pride, but there was a new feeling overcoming him. She was clearly dominant and showing it but somehow Sparks didn\u2019t oppose it, in fact he was strangely enjoying it to a degree. She was bigger,stronger and more capable than him, and he was comfortable with it now, to a certain degree he was even liking it despite the physical pain he was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Come on Sparks, lets rest this off on the couch.\u201d Cocoa said as she scooped him up in her paws like a Groom carrying their bride over a threshold. Sparks being too full and dizzy to put up a resistance to her carrying him like this. As Cocoa strided towards the living room, Sparks could only look up towards her full and vibrant face and admire her beauty as he was nestled in her paws tightly like a helpless new-born. ( she sure is beautiful\u2026) Sparks thought to himself as they approached the couch.</span></div></div>",

Sparks was still getting used to how it felt to have this huge female Raichu be so close to him without being in a battle situation as the ripples of her weight impacted on the Couch around him. Sparks sat up also and held his distended belly tightly as it continued to groan and churn. \u201c Ohh..Cocoa..im so sorry, I don\u2019t know why I ate so much,I feel so stupid.\u201d Sparks apologised to Cocoa. \u201c tee hee, I think its your stomach your apologising too really, it must feel like its been attacked by a burger typhoon!\u201d. Cocoa replied with playfulness. \u201c Ohh *Gurgle* It hurts so much..\u201d. Sparks continued to groan. Cocoa stroked Spark\u2019s back and ears with one paw. \u201c You really are in pain aren\u2019t you? There is something I could do to help if you want.\u201d. Cocoa mentioned with a hint of Seductive provocation. \u201cHuh?\u201d asked Sparks. \u201c A special massage, it nearly always works but we would have to get\u2026kinda close, would you be OK with that?\u201d Said Cocoa sounding increasingly enticing. Sparks gulped in nervousness, of course he wanted to be close to her but he\u2019d never done any more than hug other Pok\u00e9mon, a massage sounded\u2026dangerously close to an area he felt he was an unprepared explorer for right now, especially in his current physical state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Uhhh\u2026Sure\u201d Sparks gave permission for her offer as he was nervous and was spluttering orange sparks again, but he could tell from the look in her eye and her stroking paw that she knew what she was doing. He felt he could trust her, plus something that could help take away this ever increasing feeling of pain in his stomach? What did he have to lose? \u201c Okay Sparks, lie down on your side, face turning away from me.\u201d Cocoa told her new Massage client. \u201cOkay..\u201d Sparks obeyed and moved up the couch and onto his side like he was told. He was both excited and anxious about what would happen next. Cocoa flopped her huge body right next to him in a parallel position. Sparks could feel her warmth and size right next to him. \u201c Now relax your body, just let my paws do the work.\u201d Cocoa said. She moved her sizeable big paws across Sparks chest and then placed them on his exposed belly and pulled Sparks entire body next to hers, squishing him between her own wide belly and soft breasts. The sharp shock to Sparks\u2019 sensitive stomach caused a brief sting of pain . \u201c Arh!\u201d yelped Sparks. \u201c It\u2019ll only hurt for a second Sparks, just relax\u201d Cocoa reassuringly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCocoa started moving her paws up and down and then around and around rhythmically, The soothing effects of her massaging paws took effect almost immediately as Sparks Stomach churning noises dimmed as the indigestion and pain started to melt away. \u201c Ohh yeah\u2026keep doing that Cocoa\u2026it feels so good!\u201d sparks said perkily as he enjoyed the soothing sensation of her touch. ( how can a big girl like this be so delicate with her touch? She\u2019s just amazing!) Thought Sparks. After half a minute or so of massaging his Belly, Sparks stomach had completely settled and a warm feeling of bliss had come over him . Cocoa removed her paws from his mid-section and hugged his chest tightly, pulling him even together towards him in a tight embrace. \u201cYou enjoyed that Sparks?\u201d asked Cocoa. \u201c You made the pain just. Fly away somewhere! Thank you so much Cocoa, but where did you learn these abilities?\u201d asked Sparks. Cocoa hesitated a little as she knew the answer to the cuddled Pikachus question but it wasn\u2019t something she wanted to go into right now. \u201c Oh..from another Pokemon, I\u2019ll tell you about it sometime. How are you feeling?\u201d . Cocoa replied. \u201cYawn\u2026I\u2019m. Starting to feel so tired, sorry Cocoa I don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming over me..\u201d Said Sparks starting to sound drowsy. \u201c Oh don\u2019t worry Sparks, that\u2019s just the after effects of human food and the massage, you should just let yourself rest as the food digests.\u201d. Cocoa explained. \u201c mmm kay\u201d Sparks mumbled as he closed his eyes and settled in, Cocoas soft but plentiful body felt so snug and comforting around him. He had been totally squashed and encompassed by it before in the match when she sat on him sure but this was different. Her embrace made him feel warm, content and protected from anything in the outside world. Even the nasty memories of his past seemed as if they were being replaced by feelings of secure passion as he was snuggled up against her ample breasts and squishy soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c *yawn*..Thank you Cocoa, Ive never met a Raichu like you before, I have So much I want to ask you\u201d. Sparks drowsily said. \u201cYou\u2019ll get the chance soon, I overheard Mellisa earlier, Shes gonna invite your trainer and you for a picnic on Thursday. I get the feeling while your in town , your trainer wont say no\u201d Cocoa said with confidence. \u201c that\u2019s\u2026.nice\u2026.zzzzz\u201d Sparks mumbled quietly as he fell into a deep relaxing sleep, nestled in Cocoas paws and only really half listening. \u201c Heh lights out Sparks, sweet dreams\u201d. Cocoa said sweetly as she gave Sparks a small peck of a kiss on the back of his head and started to join him in the land of nod. Both electric Pok\u00e9mon now pleasantly making purr like Snores as they peacefully sleep off their meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMellissa and Terrence who had been idly passing the night with their dinner and talking about many a Pokemon training and breeding subject walked in with glasses of wine planning on resting up themselves. \u201c Oh my.. Terrence I think we better go to the conservatory instead, I don\u2019t have it in me to wake these two up.\u201d Melissa said with warmth as she found the image of the two Pokemon curled up on the sofa precious beyond belief. \u201c Wow..I never thought I\u2019d see Sparks with a Raichu like that, especially one that defeated him in battle so hard, he\u2019s usually such a standoff hot head with Raichus, Cocoa must be something special to him.\u201d Said Terrence. \u201c Well its good they can spend more time with each other then, come on lets leave these little love birds alone\u201d. Melissa replied as they both walked off to leave the Two Pok\u00e9mon alone. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nIt was a bright and sunny day and Sparks and his fellow Pokemon that belonged to Terrence were all out exercising and training in the large garden area of the Pok\u00e9mon league villa he was renting for the couple of weeks that the tournament was going on. Terrence may have been knocked out of the tournament but he always made sure his Pok\u00e9mon were all let out of their poke balls for training once in a while. Becker, a rather spry and focused looking male Hitmonchan who was Sparks best friend, was punching a makeshift punching bag made out of an old flour sack on and off whilst Sparks was telling him all about his recent meetings with Cocoa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c And you should see her trainers house, its huge and there\u2019s even a Pok\u00e9mon recreation center building out in the grounds plus a Taraus farm\u2026oh and she said she\u2019d show me more when im next there and she gets human food for every meal and she\u2019s always let out of pokeball and.\u201d Sparks was quickly gabbling excitedly about all his experiences when Becker cut him off. \u201c Whoa! Slow down Sparks, I can\u2019t believe your talking this much about a Pok\u00e9mon that beat you, a Raichu at that! Sparks reacted a little at realising how Cocoa had changed his world view on Raichus. \u201c Well\u2026She\u2019s totally different from all the rest ive known..She\u2019s special in a lot of other ways too.\u201d Sparks explained. \u201c Hmmm..you\u2019ve beaten up other pokemon for talking about opponents that beat you, and she kind of beat you badly\u2026what the hell happened between then and now to make you change like this?\u201d Said Becker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Sharella the female Charmander (also one of Terrence\u2019s Pokemon) overheard the conversation and approached to add her contribution. \u201c Oh I know what happened, at the Pokemon center when Cocoa and her trainer came to visit, that Raichu went in with a face of Shame but came out looking extremely pleased and happy about something\u2026so what did you do Sparks? Something spicy I bet !\u201d Sharella taunted. \u201c hey! She and her trainer came to apologise! That\u2019s all! How many Pokemon that put you in the center did that for you eh?\u201d definitely replied Sparks. \u201c Oh and how did she apologise?\u201d questioned Sharella. \u201c Well she kissed my\u2026hey! Why do I have to tell you any of this? Get back to your training if your just here to annoy me!\u201d Angrily snapped Sparks. \u201cheh heh, okay, seems I hit a sore spot! Oh and glad to hear you enjoyed all that human food at her Trainers place, maybe if I get sat on by a raichu I can get me a lobster dinner at their trainers place!\u201d Mockingly Joked Sharella as she walked away back to her exercises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmph! They think its all a joke\u2026\u201d Stated Sparks looking flustered at being coerced into revealing more than he was comfortable talking about. \u201c Hmm..Im surprised at your tastes Sparks, I never suspected you had an eye for the larger Pok\u00e9mon girls.\u201d Said Becker. \u201c Hey! Who said I had tastes for anything! \u201c Sparks retorted starting to blush a little. \u201c Oh come on, its obvious you like her I\u2019ve known you far too long to not know when a female Pok\u00e9mon has grabbed your hormones\u2026so have you mated with her?\u201d Becker said Bluntly. \u201cWhat!?\u201d Sparks was completely taken aback by this.\u201d I mean..where does that even come into it?\u201d replied Sparks. \u201c \u201cWell..you DO like her right?\u201d said Becker \u201c Well\u2026yeah but in terms of that\u2026I mean what does it matter? I\u2019m just glad I\u2019ve met a Raichu like her and we could be friends for what short time we can be together. I mean why would she ever be interested in a Tiny Pikachu like me anyway? \u201c retorted Sparks. \u201c Well\u2026lets put it this way, your saying a Raichu of her er\u2026size would usually never look twice at a Pikachu right?\u201d asked Becker. \u201c Well\u2026no\u201d replied Sparks \u201c but would a Pikachu of your size usually be interested in a Raichu of her size?\u201d proposed Becker. \u201c Well\u2026no\u201d. Answered Sparks. \u201c Well there you go, life is never as black and white like that! Shouldn\u2019t you at least let her know how you feel about her tomorrow when you meet? What have you got to lose?\u201d Said Becker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparks looked sheepishly at the ground \u201c I guess nothing\u2026in any case were only here for another week or so..its not like it would mean much if we became anything much more than friends..\u201d Said Sparks with a dejected look on his face. \u201c Sparks, you don\u2019t need to look at life like an endless highway with just one final destination, it can branch out onto any different road you like, a few days ago I was convinced you were happy to remain in the backseat of that car on the highway but now..maybe you should start to take control of the wheel?\u201d The Calm Hitmonchan said in a sermon like manner. \u201c Hmm..that's what I like you as a friend Becker, I can count on you to talk like an adult, not the potty minded bozos back there, but still what I really wanna do is properly talk to her, find out more about her. Why is she so different from all the other Raichus I\u2019ve met? I really know nothing much about her.\u201d Replied Sparks. \u201cWell whatever happens just be yourself and relax, good luck Sparks.\u201d Said Becker. \u201c Thanks man \u201c Said Sparks as he went back to running around in training for quick attacks, as he was zig zagging across the lush green grass his thoughts were locked on what he was going to say to Cocoa at the Picnic. \u201c Hmm..an adult..i need to act like one myself, Im not a na\u00efve Pichu with no brain of his own, I just need to talk to her seriously.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Sparks had been out of his poke ball all morning and had butterflies in his stomach as he waited curled up in the trunk of the car. (Man I can\u2019t help but feel excited every time I get to see Cocoa again.) Sparks happily thought to himself. Terrence reached their destination and pulled up at a small parking spot. \u201cOkay Sparks, were here! Let\u2019s get out now\u201d. Terrence yelled out. As he opened up the trunk, Sparks jumped out and onto the soft lush grass and noticed how the sun was beaming out brightly and the lake in the distance seemed to sparkle on its rays, absolutely divine weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they both walked to the picnic area, they could see on the Benches Mellissa and Cocoa were already there and were setting up picnic foods and disposable glasses, plates, etc. Sparks couldn\u2019t control himself from running ahead as soon as he saw Cocoa in the distance helping unpack various nick nacks from the baskets. Despite his cool logical side telling him to be mature and reserved about seeing Cocoa, Sparks couldn\u2019t help but act on impulse like a kid in a candy store and rush towards his desire. He stopped in front of the massive Raichu and started to pant to catch his breath. \u201c Wow, slow down tiger, I may have a big appetite but I\u2019d not dream of starting without you!\u201d Cocoa joked with a warm smile. \u201c Oh no..*huff* I was just er..really happy to see you!\u201d Said Sparks with a goofy smile as he caught his breathe. Sparks inner critic in his mind was telling him he sounded dumb but he remembered Beckers words about being himself. ( Well maybe I sound dorky and goofy but who cares? Cocoa seems to be comfortable with it, I like being goofy!) Sparks reassured himself internally. \u201c Hehe, you sure are a cute one Sparks, Come on, help me unpack all this stuff!\u201d. Cocoa responded with light banter. (Wow.. Trainers don\u2019t usually let their Pok\u00e9mon touch their carefully packed things like that, she sure is a different kind of Pok\u00e9mon.). Sparks thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Two Pok\u00e9mon helped Mellissa unpack all the picnic items and food, Terrence caught up with Sparks and greeted Mellissa. \u201c Hey there Mellisa, Cocoa! Great to see you again, Sparks did Mellissa tell you, you could touch those things?\u201d. Said Terrence to Sparks in a nagging tone. \u201c Oh no its fine, He\u2019s just helping Cocoa unpack things for me, Cocoa asked him to help. I have a special understanding with Cocoa, its almost like I can understand her Pok\u00e9mon language. Terrence was a little sceptical of this claim but he was surprised to see how Sparks and Cocoa were unpacking the items in unison in a very efficient human like manner. \u201c Well I have to admit ive never seen Sparks this focused on a task like that, following a Raichus lead like that, Cocoa sure has had an effect on him!\u201d Terrence proclaimed with an uplifting smile. \u201cCome on, lets have some snacks before we enjoy the weather and maybe play ultimate Frisbee by the lake aye? I brought some Poke Toys for the Chu\u2019s. said Mellissa as she unwrapped a lot of sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Terrence dug into the Sprawling set of snacks, Melissa unwrapped two large plastic trays full of what seemed to be some kind of colourful bread rolls. \u201cHere ya go guys, enjoy!\u201d She said as she laid them on the ground for the two Chu\u2019s to enjoy. \u201c They look great for Pok\u00e9mon food, what are they?\u201d Asked Terrence. \u201c Special home-made Poffins, well..i call them that anyway, there more like Japanese filled bread rolls but I think the idea of them being poffins is kind of cute, I make them in sweet and savoury varieties, Cocoa knows which ones are which by their colour by now.\u201d. Explained Mellissa. Cocoa and Sparks sat down and started to munch away at the Poffins, Sparks was excited to learn of all the different fillings and colours of them, there were egg and bacon, cream cheese, onion chutney, etc. ( and Mellissa\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon at the ranch get this kind of food all the time? No wonder Cocoa maintains such a size..). Sparks thought to himself after finishing just one he was already starting to feel full. \u201cHey Sparks, since there\u2019s 12 poffins in each tray how about we have a little game, if we ea- \u201c Cocoa started to say in a playful voice but Sparks immediately cut her off. \u201c NO! *ahem* I mean\u2026I think i learned my lesson from last time, I know my own limits when it comes to Mellissa\u2019s food!\u201d Sparks rejected her offer with a knowing smile, the fresh memories of his loss to the hamburger and Sundae still fresh in his mind. \u201cYou wimp.\u201d Cocoa teased while sticking out her tongue slightly. \u201c Yup, when it comes to food, that\u2019s me\u201d. Sparks replied in a playful tone. ( Wow, did I really just admit I was a wimp at something. Even as a joke I can\u2019t believe how This Raichu has changed me). Sparks thought to himself as he nibbled on a delicious curry flavoured Poffin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the Snack plates were finished (Sparks ate four poffins while cocoa cleaned out all 12 and still looked like she could handle a lot more). Mellissa and Terrence started to make off to a nearby clearing to play Frisbee with Melissa. \u201c Now Cocoa, I packed some Poketoys in that basket there, why don\u2019t you show Sparks around the lake and have fun?\u201d Asked Melissa. \u201c Raichu!\u201d replied Cocoa with energy. \u201cCome on Sparks, let\u2019s go for a walk first, I wanna show you the best view of the lake\u201d. Said Cocoa. \u201c Sounds great, I\u2019d love to talk to you for a while too, I cant think of better weather for it.\u201d Replied Sparks as he stood up and headed out as Cocoa carried the basket in her paws. As they walked slowly across the carpet like soft lush grass, Sparks looked up at Cocoa and slightly nervously started to ask about questions he was dying to know the answers too. \u201c Cocoa. Please don\u2019t feel you have to answer this but. Why are you so much larger than other Raichus? I mean height wise you\u2019re almost as tall as some humans\u2026\u201d Asked Sparks nervously. Cocoa looked back and smiled, she knew sooner or later this question would come up. \u201c Its Ok Sparks, Im not too sure myself why I\u2019ve always been so much bigger than other Raichus, Melissa and my past trainer took to me to some Pok\u00e9mon specialist doctors and I overheard them say it was a rare condition called Pok\u00e9mon Gigantism Something about exposure to a rare evolutionary stone when I was a young Pichu or something. I can\u2019t remember back that far\u2026and I don\u2019t really care either. There\u2019s nothing that can be done about my size and in the past I always hated my condition, but I\u2019ve come to accept who I am and love my own body the way it is. After all , I\u2019d never be able to do so well in Pok\u00e9mon battling without my size advantage.\u201d Cocoa explained. \u201c Well your right there, I\u2019ve never faced such an opponent like you in battle Cocoa, you fight with amazing strength and intelligence, any Pok\u00e9mon would be a fool not to respect you in the field, but. Did the Doctors explain anything more?\u201d. Asked Sparks. \u201cNothing\u2026they seemed pretty blank on what was going on with my condition, apart from my body structure and Increased appetite. There was nothing unhealthy found about me out of the ordinary and that was that. So you may aswelll just say I\u2019m a magic Raichu that thinks big and is big..heh \u201c. Cocoa said with a wink The two Pok\u00e9mon come to the edge of the lakes water and a beautiful panoramic view of the clear crystal lake unfolded before them. The Clear water was sparkling in the suns rays, interrupted only by the odd Magikarp leaping in and out of the water gracefully. \u201c Ahh its so beautiful\u201d Said Sparks as his eyes gleamed in admiration. \u201c It sure is..Melissa takes us Pok\u00e9mon here a lot..I have so many good memories of this place\u201d Said Cocoa as she seemed to be recollecting good experiences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
