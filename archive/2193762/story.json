            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another boring and typical day for Ami Okada, the delivery girl for the Speed Delivery fast food joint. Daisuke Uryuu is as lazy as he can be, dealing orders to her when given the chance at every turn, and is usually the boss around there when Mr. Honda away. She usually ends up trekking around the city, making delivery orders to various customers around town that need food. Her life seemingly is going nowhere at the moment. Her parents were finally struggling to meet ends meet, so she ended up dropping off of high school and getting her job full time to help out with paying rent. She wanted to finished high school, but her situation at the time made her unable to do that. She dreamed of one day writing her own manga to help her parents, who are supportive of her despite everything, as they are family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, we see Ami Okada, currently at the restaurant getting ready for another set of deliveries. She was loading up the food onto her car so where she can go to make the deliveries. She actually had a few addresses to go to. One of those orders is Haruka Tatomi, a famous actress for being a giant monster in the movies, and Ami is a fan of her surprisingly despite her being a kid. Guess she needs some good food for her to do her city smashing or defending job in the movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also her friend Lily Okna, a friend of Ami's also, a Japanese modeling lady who's rich parents own some major businesses, and she currently is modeling at the town, and has ordered some food for herself. Perhaps a salad maybe, maybe she could end up going there to visit for a bit if its not for the many orders she has to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also Toshio, a young 6 year old boy and his parents who are also rich and do various toy businesses. The much less sad about the trouble making boy, the better, but apparently the family has ordered a good meal, so perhaps head to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is also Sayama Kaiai, another friend of Ami as well who she befriended during her years at high school. Ami was always a bit jealous of her sexy body, though Ami does have a fairly good one for herself, but she was a good heart friend. She was currently at home right now when she made the order, so perhaps she can go there first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there is Old Man Matou, and nothing much is known about him, except he is pretty crazy and well, supposedly he lives in a bit of a dump of a place. Perhaps head there possibly to see him and give him his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2193762-The-Size-Project/map/15\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive...</a> (references to all characters here)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where does she head first for her deliveries?</span></div></div>",

You see, he is a crazed scientist who wanted to invention a size changing ray in order to end world hunger and help control population, well that is a good starter, as he went to college and got several scientific degrees in the process. That would be enough for him to be very well in life well, that is where the positives end. You see, he was so focused on his experiments and how ludicrous that they are that his wife ultimately end up leaving him when he was just like 40-50 years as he was so crazy. It was also reported he was having affairs and all of them involve size fetishes, to where his wife was disgusted with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatou always wanted to see how sizes can be so arousing, like when someone is small, or if someone is big, that is what he wanted to do, and he has watched old scientist movies, and monster movies, to get that understanding. As he watched them, he became more aroused, and was so demented that he decided to become even more focused on his experiments, and he just leaves anything out of his responsibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany would hear him talking about sizes and other strange fetishes when he is around, so they avoided him. Some even hated his mental strangeness so much that they prank his house by breaking in and stealing stuff. Breaking his devices, and even one point set it on fire. But this crazy scientist never gave up at all, and soon all of his work would pay off. One day a strange power source came from somewhere, and he grabbed it and placed it in his device, and then.... he predictably said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is finished, the size remote is done!\" he said, just as his famous remote with the G and S buttons, with a few additional buttons for good measure. He then turned and fired it on a random item and hit S. A strange beam was then fired from the tip of the remote, and it hit the item, causing it to vanished. The scientist then grabbed a magnifying glass to see if it shrunk, and he saw he shrunk a chair. \"It is perfect. Now, let's see what happens when I hit G.\" he said, and then he hits the G button, and surprise, it grew again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW, REVENGE SHALL BE MINE, I HAVE SPENT YEARS TRYING TO MAKE MY SIZE REMOTE, AND NOW IT IS DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" he laughed evilly, and then he decided to.</span></div></div>",

He has always been a fan of giant monster movies, so perhaps with his size remote, he could grow some unsuspecting person or animals in order for them to have their own fun onto the city. He can just watch the mayhem and see Tokyo get destroyed, and not have to take any blame for it at all from the police. It was genius, just grow someone or an animal and have them destroy the city unknowingly or just watch the fun play out on how they grew big or what not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Old Man Matou then got out of the house and then started to walk around the street, with everyone just going around with their day as usual, he then notices a few people he could test the growth remote on, well for this occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first group of people is several teenage school girls who were just coming back from school. Easy for perv shots for any perverts given that they can look up their skirts really easy, perhaps he could get some really big panty shots in the process and sell them on the internet for some big bucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother group is some young kids, all young boys were playing around the playground like the kids that they are. Surely they were having fun just playing the swing sets and what not, but he wonder what would happen if those boys were to grow big. He could see them really acting like giant monsters then and there. In fact, out of the group he could do that easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which group will he grow?</span></div></div>",

Wears nice pink sandals.<br>\r\nOccupation: Japanese actress (her education is home schooled or whatever)<br>\r\nBackground: Haruka may be a young girl, but she is a superstar in Japan. She has acted in several movies, mostly monster movies. Her favorite movies are the ones that she plays as some sort of a giant, as she likes being big and tall as buildings, good or evil. She always would love the chance to act like a monster when she can on set, and that is what people love about her, how she likes being a monster. She is often school by tutors at her job, but she doesn\u2019t mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Toshio Antozi (3\u20199)<br>\r\nAge: 6<br>\r\nSex: Male<br>\r\nAppearance: A nearly bald but black hair pale boy with green eyes.

At home he has many toys, including a diorama of a city where he acts like a rampaging giant, roaring and stomping the city to pieces. Again, his parents encourage him to make the others feel bad, as he excels along with his parents in the business world, toy wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Sayama Kaiai (5\u20190)<br>\r\nAge: 16<br>\r\nSex: Female<br>\r\nAppearance: Sexy for a teen, with short brown hair and blue eyes.

She if very shy and reserved, and thanks to her body, always feels like she is being stalked. She lives with her single mother in the rural country, preferring the peace and quietness of a small town. She is pretty clumsy, always tripping among other things.

(While this story is set in 1985, this is fictional so expect made up stuff here). This young actress has worked in the film industry for several years now, and even in the television world as well, but one thing we all know for sure that we love about this girl, she loves acting big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is what she has done for most of her roles, being able to stand tall in a miniature city, either protecting it or destroying it like a gleeful little girl that she is, it is always a fascination that she has gotten since her parents were also famous actors in many movies in Japan. However, Haruka is a special case as she likes doing big roles. Most roles for her has her being some sort of towering giant, where it is just for her being a friendly giant in a village wearing a ancient suit, or even the silly commercials of her being in a swimsuit for promoting products, she always love standing big in a miniature city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has watched many monster movies, specifically Godzilla, and all of those cool Ultraman shows, always wanting to get an idea of how those actors interact on those sets of miniature cities, and one day she got to do that at the age of 6. It was a simple role, she was simply destroying the city. The director loved how she smashed the city with her hands and feet, and while she acted like a big menacing giantess, roaring and stomping onto the scene, but it is where she got her passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously she was homeschool and had tutors on her set to keep up with her school work, but she doesn\u2019t mind as she does take her studies seriously, so she an get back to her favorite thing she likes doing, finding roles for her to act like a giantess. She was right now resting in her trailer lot when suddenly the door knocks. Haruka then got up, and went over to the door to see it was.</span></div></div>",

He appeared to be holding a small box addressed to her. It was probably a fan sending her a gift, she loved when that happened. It was one of those things outside of fan mail and guest appearances that let her know she was doing a really good job in the roles she's given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" she continued to smile to the deliver boy as she graciously accepted the package. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" he smiled back. He then began to get a little nervous. \"Excuse me, Ms. Tatomi\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm. If it's not too much trouble could I get your autograph.\" He asked before extending a pen and a piece of paper. \"It's just that my little sister is a huge fan and wants to be a great actress like you some day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Of course I'll sign.\" Haruka said with glistening eyes. She gently put down the package before signing her name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" the deliver bowed before running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka watched him go before taking her package inside. It was a little brown box addressed to her from someone named Matou. She didn't know any Matou so they must be a new fan. She loved making new fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's see what's inside.\" she said to herself before tearing open the cardboard. Inside was an even smaller white box wrapped in bubble-wrap. Of course she took a few minutes to pop the bubble-wrap. It was just so fun to pop. Once that was finished she finally opened the white box to reveal... \"A remote?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA remote. A small grey remote that looked like it went to one of her great grandpa's T.Vs. What was she supposed to do with this? It was then she noticed the \"G\" and \"S\" buttons along with a few numbers and dials. Not thinking much of it, she pressed the \"S\" button and watched as a yellow beam fired from the remote and at her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes went wide as she watched her custom made chair vanish before her very eyes. \"W-What?\" It was gone. Her chair was gone! What just happened. She looked back at the remote and then back to the spot where her chair had been. She watched the spot carefully and noticed a small black dot against her yellow carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent down to get a better look and what she saw let her shocked. It was her chair. It was so... tiny. How!? Was it, the remote. She looked back at the device and the two large buttons. If \"S\" made it shrink than \"G\" would... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed the button and watched as a red beam fired and in a flash her chair was back to normal. \"No way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she dreaming? She pinched her self to make sure. The pain she felt told her she was in fact very much awake. She ran back to the box with the name Matou on it. They were now officially her number one fan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could do anything else she heard a knock on her trailer door. \"Ms. Tatomi, It's Rei. We need you on set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right there!\" she called as she stared at the remote. </span></div></div>",

I just wanted know since this is a giant monster heroine story, what monster of the week would you like to do battle against?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Haruka wondered as she placed a hand to her chin. \"I could fight an alien... but then again giant robots are really cool too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the director couldn't help but chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all what was more evil than a bunch of tin cans bent on taking over the world? If the success of that Terminator movie over in America was anything to go by then she'd made the perfect choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that sounds like an excellent choice.\" The director smiled. \"Especially since the commercial success of that techno noire film over in America. What was it called again... the Terminator?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! That's the one!\" Haruka confirmed. \"There's nothing more scary than giant hunks of metal with glowing red eyes, metal claws, and huge lasers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe director loved the little actress's enthusiasm. \"Well it sounds to me you made the perfect choice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka nodded. She really did, and once this shoot was over she could focus on her new size ray and real giant monster battles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe director grabbed his megaphone and began to bark out orders. <b>\"ALL RIGHT EVERYONE, PLACES! I WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN GET THIS ALL DONE IN ONE TAKE!\"<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nEveryone began to scramble to their assignments as Haruka made her way onto the set. She loved the feeling of being in model cities. It made her feel tall. Not to mention there was just something oh so satisfying about standing head and shoulders above buildings and model civilians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe director took his seat, <b>\"WHERE THE HECK IS MADO!? HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE OUR MONSTER/STUNTMAN!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on que the sight of a metal frame walked onto set. Well it wasn't real metal, not entirely. The suit Mado was wearing was made out of foam and tubes that were spray painted and decorated to look like metal. The only real metal on this thing was the iron chest plate and the steel around the helmet. A helmet that was apparently wired to have the eyes glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all if anyone was rating the suit it would be a solid 8 out of 10. Not bad for an all practical costume. Take that cheap computer generated visuals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya mister Mado.\" Haruka greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to do battle against the mechanical terror of Mechabolico!?\" Mado joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka smiled. \"Sure! I'm gonna defeat the Skynet and save the day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"ALRIGHT EVERYONE, LET'S DO THIS RIGHT, 3... 2... 1... ACTION!\"</b></span></div></div>",
