            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a beautiful spring day as Brad and Karen rocked on the front porch glider. They had just finished a very strenuous day working on their newly acquired farm. Brad smiled at his wife as she leaned her head on his shoulder. The farmhands had just left for the day, leaving them alone to rest and enjoy the sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect it to be so much work, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.\", said Karen. \"That bull continues to be a problem though. I don't like the way he looks at me during milking time with the cows. The farmhands assure me that he won't jump or break through the fence, but he still makes me nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ole' Max wouldn't hurt a fly.\", said Brad. \"You're just being paranoid. I walked through that pasture and he didn't charge me or run me through with his horns. He's really gentle once you get to know him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the sun dipped below the horizon, the sounds of the farm died down and the cricket's started their repetitious chorus. The couple headed inside the house to prepare dinner and turn in for the night. They were half way through preparing dinner when the lights in the house suddenly turned off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn breaker tripped again! I think it's your turn to go check it out.\", said Karen as she nudged her husband toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad sighed as he went to find the flashlight and made his way out toward the storage shed at the side of their old farmhouse. The shed was clustered with many odds and ends from years past. He hadn't really had time to go through everything and he didn't want to just haul it away as junk. Some of the items in there might be worth a lot, or might make a nice addition in their new house. The house was still lacking when it came to furniture and decorations. They moved from a small apartment and didn't really have a lot of belongings to personalize their new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad aimed the light toward the breakers, noticing one of them had actually tripped again. As he got closer to the panel, he bumped into a large box, causing it to tip over sideways, revealing an odd door and wall panel. After restoring power, he walked over to examine the newly revealed area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This old shed was so crammed full of items, I never noticed that it had extra storage behind it.\", thought Brad as he walked closer.  The door was slightly ajar, and the panel looked out of place among all the antiques and junk strewn about the room. It was metallic and had a small screen along with a number pad on the interior wall. Pressing the pad didn't have any effect as the system did not seem to be powered. After moving a few more items out of the way, he opened the door and peered inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flashlight showed the contents of a decent sized room that was free from any kind of floor clutter. He searched the walls, looking for any kind of light source and found a switch close to the door. Light flooded the room, revealing a curious set of controls along one of the walls and a rather large booth in the corner of the room. Various mechanical devices lined the wall on the opposite side from the controls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be Uncle Jack's workshop. I wondered why all his tools appeared to be missing. He must have spent a lot of time in here to get away from everything and keep his inventions secret!\" He noticed a rather large bookcase with countless binders and books. \"Karen needs to see this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited as a child on Christmas morning, Brad ran into the house to retrieve Karen. \"Come with me! I found something amazing!\", he said as he took her hand, leading her outside toward the shed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Karen entered the room, she let out an audible gasp. \"So this is Jack's workshop! I bet you'll have a blast tinkering with all this equipment. It could certainly use some dusting though.\", she said as she wiped dust off a nearby shelf with her finger. \"Still, it's in pretty good shape considering it hasn't been used for months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren walked over to the booth and picked up a binder off the table. Wiping the dust from the jacket revealed the title of the book, \"Transformation Booth Operators Manual ver 3.25\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well... What kind of mad scientist stuff is this?\", said Karen with a chuckle. A small switch beside the book, once flipped on, brought the control panel to life. The screen lit up with many different options... Scan Subject, Transform Subject, were two of the words that stood out. \"Really, a transformation device? I think your uncle was getting a little senile in his old age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad walked over to a circled area on the floor near the booth. As he stepped onto the circle, the floor lit up and the screen beeped. Some distant mechanism whirred to life as he stood there surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look! It's scanning you. Maybe it's going to make a clone of you.\", teased Karen after she noticed the words \"Scanning\" on the monitor. Moments later, the screen read, \"Scanning complete. Human Male profile #1 successfully stored.\" Karen's curiosity had peaked as she began to flip through the manual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad, laughed a bit and cautiously opened the door to the booth. As the door opened, a bright light turned on, showing a fairly simple booth with a small control panel on the side. Aside from some papers strewn about on the floor, it was fairly featureless. The walls appeard to be made out of some kind of metal, and a large round dome protruded from the ceiling about 2\" in diameter and 1\" deep. Brad leaned down to pick up the papers as Karen continued to mess with the control panel. She was never one for reading a manual. She began entering commands into the control panel, marveling at the sophisticated prank that Brad's Uncle was playing on them from beyond the grave. Once the parameters were all complete, she sprang up and shut Brad into the booth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we're going to test out this \"Transformation Booth!\", teased Karen. In a few minutes, my handsome husband is going to become a primate for 24 hours.\", she said after sticking out her tongue and moving back to the control panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad chuckled and played along with his wife. He began making monkey sounds which got a chuckle out of Karen. As she pressed the button, the window to the booth's door slammed closed and a distant machine began to hum. Karen jumped at the noise caught off guard by the suddenness of the window shutting. As she walked toward the door, the humming stopped and the door opened a crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard Brad still making monkey noises as she got closer to the door. \"Wow, those sound a lot more realistic than before. If I didn't know any better, I'd say the machine worked. My turn to...\", said Karen as she opened the door. A loud gasp escaped her lips as she noticed the very confused monkey sitting on the floor, examining it's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of joke is this? Okay, where are the cameras. Nice try Brad! You really had me going there for a second.\", said Karen with a bit of concern in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monkey looked at Karen and shook it's head. It exited the booth, jumped onto the table, picked up the operation manual and began to... READ? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B... B... Brad?\", said Karen with a look of concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monkey nodded rapidly at her and pointed toward the book. The monkey's gestures seemed more human than animal and the expression on it's face resembled her husband too closely to be a coincidence. Karen sat there frozen as the monkey, formerly her human husband, made his way over to view the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top of the screen read...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubject: Human <br>\r\nSubject Gender: Male<br>\r\nTarget Species: Primate - Spider Monkey<br>\r\nTarget Gender: Male<br>\r\nTransformation Time:Instant<br>\r\nDefault Parameters<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTarget bodies parameters are compatible with the booth's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuration: 24 hours<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren pulled up a more comfortable chair from the corner of the room and pulled it up to a desk where she plopped down the operation guide. \u201cHoney, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll find a way to turn you back, I promise. For now, Let\u2019s go ahead and examine this operation manual, then we\u2019ll see what kind of food I can feed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOOO OOOOOO EEEEEEK!\", exclaimed Brad as he tried to say words but failed miserably. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brad turned around as the door shut behind him. He laughed as Karen went over to the device and fiddled with the controls. He decided to play along, so he made his best monkey sounds as he wondered what this device actually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was examining the panel on the wall when he heard a metallic clank and couldn\u2019t see out of the barricaded window. He was a little nervous as he heard the humming of a machine. Just as he looked up, a bright light shot out from the dome in the ceiling. And that\u2019s when things got really weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body went numb as his vision faded. It was hard to describe the sensation he was feeling, but it wasn\u2019t unpleasant or painful. It was like all the molecules of his body were rearranging themselves into something else. Finally the machine stopped and he opened his eyes as the hatch to the Booth released him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d, he thought as the room\u2019s size more than doubled. He tried to call to Karen, but his mouth wasn\u2019t cooperating. \u201cEeeeeek, aaaaah oooh ohhh\u201d were the only sounds that came out. He then noticed a furry hand in front of his face. Moments later, he realized it was HIS hand! Closer inspection of his body revealed that he was covered in fur. \u201cAnd what the hell is this?\u201d, he thought as he grabbed his new tail. \u201cHoly shit! I\u2019m a damn primate! That means that his uncle\u2019s machine was the real deal! He got really excited for a moment, until he remembered that he was the guinea pig and wasn\u2019t sure how well the machine would work to restore his human form. He seemed to still have his wits about him. \u201cLittle good that would do me if I had to spend the rest of my life in a zoo. I wonder what species of monkey I am? Or what.... sex!?\u201d, he thought as his hands quickly checked to see if he was still male. \u201cYep, got it.\u201d He quickly confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up to see Karen looking down at him with her mouth wide open. She made a comment about it being a prank, but her voice wasn\u2019t very convincing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe manual! I hope the answers are in there. His body was a lot more agile than he originally thought as he gracefully climbed up to the machine and grabbed the book. \u201cI don\u2019t have any thumbs?! Damn it! A small, but disappointing setback.\u201d, he thought as he fumbled with the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB...B....Brad?\u201d, questioned Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded and pointed to the book. \u201cHe was also excited that he could still read and understand language. Having his human intellect was at least some comfort to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was having difficulty turning the pages, so he put down the manual and examined the screen. Toward the end of the list, he read that the duration was set to 24 hours. \u201cDoes that mean that I\u2019ll revert to human in 24 hours or I can use the machine in 24 hours to change back?\u201d, he thought as he scratched his head like he normally did when concentrating on a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed his tail once again and was amazed how easily he could control it. He started to get a better look at himself when Karen interrupted his examination.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll find a way to turn you back, I promise. For now, Let\u2019s go ahead and examine this operation manual, then we\u2019ll see what kind of food I can feed you.\", Karen said as she gave Brad a reassuring hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad climbed up on the desk with Karen and read over her shoulder. </span></div></div>",

He thought about how sexy she looked as she undressed and walked naked, over to the dresser to retrieve her pajamas. He especially liked seeing her ample behind sway a bit when she walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Karen started to dress, she looked at Brad and snickered. \u201cLike what you see?\u201d, teased Karen as she looked at his very stiff primate erection. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait until your the right species again Honey. After reading that manual, it seems like we can really have a lot of fun with this device. I could modify this body a bit, firming up a few areas.\u201d, she said as she gripped her breasts and looked into the full length mirror. \u201cOr I could change into someone a little more sexy? Maybe you\u2019d prefer something a little hairier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked at his very stiff erection that he now sported and tried to cover it up, looking slightly embarrassed. He still smiled at Karen\u2019s comment. \u201cAt least she has a sense of humor about this.\u201d, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow there Honey, you can go take care of that yourself. I won\u2019t judge.\u201d, said Karen in a sincere tone. I think it\u2019s how monkeys spend a majority of their time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad decided to go find another room to sleep in after Karen blew him a good night kiss and turned off the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waddled his tiny legs out to the living room and decided to do a little research on his new body to help pass the time. He wasn\u2019t tired enough to sleep, so he managed to turn on the computer and, with some effort, was able to hunt and peck on the keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about that. I\u2019m an endangered species.\u201d, he thought as he scrolled though a page about his new form. \u201cMy Diet is plant based, with the exception of some types of grubs and spiders. I think I\u2019ll stick to the fruit for now. As he continued to read, he found a section on mating habits, along with a few photos of the act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down to see that he had another erection. \u201cDamn, I haven\u2019t been this horny since my teen years. I wonder if I received some natural instincts during the transformation.\u201d, he thought as he gently stroked it. He immediately felt an intense jolt of pleasure that caught him totally off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, anything is possible now. As much as it scares me to lose my humanity, there\u2019s something exciting about being in this body. He thought about some of the kinky desires that he had, all of which were possible with the machine. He imagined some of the sexy forms that Kate could become. A short Latino woman with ample breasts and an ass that could stop traffic. Maybe an Asian beauty or a bleach blonde bimbo with huge tits and big pouty lips. Most of his fantasies would involve his wife, but he had a few others that were a bit more extreme. In fact, he wasn\u2019t sure that she would understand, but would likely need her to change him back. Although, Karen is a bit adventurous. Maybe...\u201d, he thought as his mind wandered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad gripped his primate penis and began to stroke it, thinking about some of those possibilities. \u201cOh, damn! This thing is sensitive as hell!\u201d He looked at the mating images again and typed in a new search. He clicked the second link down and continued to stroke as he watched the two monkeys mating. He wondered what it would be like to live in a zoo? The thought of being trapped like this in a zoo, surrounded by lots of female monkeys turned him on more than he cared to admit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several masturbation sessions, he finally decided it was time to clean up a bit and get some sleep. He would have plenty of time to continue his explorations tomorrow. He climbed up on top of the entertainment center and drifted off to sleep. He wanted to see what this body could do. Maybe he could go out tomorrow after the help left. He didn\u2019t HAVE to change back as soon as the duration was up. \u201cA few more hours climbing the trees could be fun.\u201d, he thought before he drifted into sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karen got up early that morning and snuck out to the shed that housed the Transformation Booth. Brad would have to stay indoors to avoid detection unless he wanted a one way trip to the local zoo. She found out that you need a special license to own a spider monkey since they are endangered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren squeezed between some of the junk that was stacked in the front of the shed and made a mental note to straighten up this mess in the near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hit the lights and pulled up a chair to re-read a few sections of the operators manual. After reviewing it one more time, she was confident that she could manage to successfully transform herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst things first.\u201d, said Karen as she walked into the circle. As soon as she entered, the floor lit up as she heard a familiar sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuman Female Profile #1 Successfully Stored.\u201d, flashed across the screen. She looked at the profile details and confirmed that everything was correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s try some subtle changes.\u201d She copies her current body as a template and began adjusting a few things. She changed her hair color to platinum blonde and straight. She also increased her breast size by a cup, and took off a bit of weight and subtracted 5 years from her age. She hovered over the duration time and finally settled for one hour. She also set the start delay to 15 minutes. Right before she hit submit, she increased her bust another additional cup size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light came on in the chamber. She cautiously walked inside and gently secured the door. She took a deep breath, steadied herself and pressed the button. <br>\r\nThe window slammed shut as the device powered up. Moments later, the lights dimmed as the door\u2019s latch released. Aside from a very strange feeling, she didn\u2019t really look any different. She decided to go find Brad so he could witness the changes in her as they happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found brad in the kitchen eating a banana. He gave her a smile as she sat down in the chair across from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her watch.... 30 seconds to go. She smiled back and told Brad that he was in for a surprise. Brad noticed that his wife was transforming in very subtle ways, but the quickness of the transformation mad it easy to pick out. Her face was softening a bit and her hair was loosing it\u2019s color along with it\u2019s curl. The most interesting part was that her already impressive breasts were increasing size rapidly. Even her clothes grew to accommodate her new curvier figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren moaned a little as she felt her chest push out and giggled as she felt her new E cup breasts. She could see her husbands excitement by the look on his face as well as his manhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the changes were complete, Karen explained her transformation and how the Booth works. \u201cIt\u2019s just for an hour Honey. I want to make sure the process is reversible after the time duration expires. I re-read some parts of the manual and think I misunderstood the way the duration feature functions. I now believe that the duration determines the amount of time that must pass before it is safe to change you back. 24 hours is the standard setting because drastic changes, like yours, cause the transformed body to become a bit unstable. However, my changes are much less drastic and should not require such a long waiting period.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad made some monkey noises, but it was absolutely impossible to determine what he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not recommended that you try to alter your form until the time runs out, Honey. Removing the safe guards could lock your new form, or alter it in ways you won\u2019t like. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready to join the animal kingdom permanently. I might indulge you later this afternoon if this works out.\u201d, she said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was talking about the Transformation Booth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, after the cool down period ended, Karen successfully changed Brad back to his original human form, well, almost his original form. She mad a few small changes that she was sure he wouldn't mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husband and wife had a lot of sex that week. They both had experimented with the Booth and, by the end of the week, had a very good idea how the machine worked. They were ready to try some more extreme transformations. Brad had asked Karen to let him try something on his own. He would leave a token with his transformation so Karen could change him back at a later date and his transformation could remain a secret. He wanted to transform himself into one of the farm animals but desired some privacy with his new transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren lifted an eyebrow at this request, but agreed to the plan. She had to go out of town for a few days to visit her family, so that would be a good time for Brad to make the change. Brad explained that he would transform the animal he was swapping with into a small bronze statue or token and place it on the table in the lab.The farm hands would be there to take care of the animals, so he would be in good hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Brad helped load the rest of the luggage into the car and kissed Karen goodbye. \"So you're not going to tell me which animal, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\", said Brad with a smile. \"You can certainly try to figure it out when you get back. I don't want to turn back until later in the week. f you succeed, I'll let you choose my next transformation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\", said Karen enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ANYTHING.\", said Brad as he pushed her toward the drivers side door. \"You'd better get going or you're going to get stuck in rush hour traffic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren kissed him one more time and got in the car. She rolled down the window and as she drove off, waved and said, \"I love you! Hope you have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad waited until she was gone and smiled. He was so excited to try out his kinky fantasy. \"I'll be livestock for a week with no worries or responsibilities.\" He wanted to try this from day one after he knew the machine could really turn him back. \"Let's go get my new body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad turned and walked toward...</span></div></div>",

Peppa was a friendly sow and was easy to take care of. She greeted Brad with an oink, as he slowly led her to the outside section of the transformation booth. He opened the small gate tied her to the fence by the emitter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce secure, he excitedly ran into the room and activated the scanning beam. The screen verified that Peppa was saved as a preset. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this\u201d, he thought as he continued to transform Peppa into a generic trophy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the Peppa trophy was sitting on the table in the lab, Brad set device to the Peppa preset with a delay of 15 minutes. That gave him plenty of time to put himself into the pen with the other pigs before he became transformed..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad sat in the booth, contemplating his decision and whether or not he really wanted to go through with it. \u201cDo I really want to make myself into a big fat pig for a whole week? What would Karen say if she figures it out?\u201d Impulsively, he reached out and pressed the button before he could talk himself out of it. The machine went through it\u2019s stages, releasing Brad from the confines of the booth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019d better get to the pen. It\u2019s too late to change my mind now.\u201d, he thought as he set his watch timer and ran to join the other pigs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Brad arrives, he checked the time left on his watch. \u201c5 minute, give or take. Damn, this may be one of the stupidest things that I\u2019ve done. I willingly transformed myself into a fat little pig to roll around in the mud, eat slop, and get fucked silly by the boar.\u201d He felt his dick get hard at the thought of new position as livestock. His heart began to beat faster as he climbed into his new accommodations and watched as the timer neared zero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vision blacked out as he felt his body rearrange. Moments later, he was naked, and on all fours, and most certainly not human. He felt his body jiggle as he walked on his new hooves. His ears felt huge and he could feel his tail poking out of his rear. \u201cWell, I\u2019m now indistinguishable from a real pig. I hope it was worth it.\u201d, he thought as he got familiar with his new body. He squealed in delight as he wandered off to find the other pigs. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brad trotted along as fast as his little legs could carry him. He was still adjusting to his new eye sight. He could see a much wider view, but things weren\u2019t as clear as he expected. However, his sense of smell was picking up all kinds of new things. He felt something slapping his back and noticed that he was wagging his tail unconsciously. If he focused, he found that he could control his tail quite easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before he found the other pigs lounging lazily along the fence. One of the other pigs got up and ran up to greet him by rubbing her snout against Brad\u2019s face. It was certainly strange to see the other pig at eye level. He was now one of them, down to his DNA. He\u2019s the only one in the world that knows this isn\u2019t where he belongs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was starting to feel at home in his new body when he heard the banging of metal on metal. He knew, from experience, that sound meant it was mealtime. He saw Julie, one of the farm hands, carrying the bucket of slop over to the trough. Julie smiled at him and set down the bucket. \u201cHello there Peppa! I\u2019ve got a special treat for you!\u201d She went over to the gate and held out an apple. Brad excitedly ran over to eat the apple as Julie opened the gate. As he ate the apple, she slipped a leash over his head and waited for him to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie closed the gate and walked Brad over to the barn where two other farm hands waited. She tugged on the leash, directing Peppa to the back of the truck. Brad looked confused, but was pushed up into the truck by the two other men. He squealed in protest, but couldn\u2019t resist his forward momentum on the slippery wood ramp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry there girl. You\u2019re going to Farmer Joe\u2019s where you\u2019ll get to know their new hog. He\u2019s a prize winning pig and will produce some mighty fine offspring. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy yourself. Have fun!\u201d, said Julie with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad cringed at the thought of being away from the safety of their farm. \u201cOh well, she can just use the token to change... me...  back... Oh shit! I was so excited about changing, that I forgot to make a token. This is my new body until someone places me in the booth again. Damn it!\u201d, thought Brad. Karen had no idea which animal he had become and without a token, she would need his body to make him human again. How long would the farmer keep him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad couldn\u2019t have a more authentic experience than he was about to have. He just hoped he would be returned to Karen soon. Had Karen sold Peppa without his knowledge or was he just there to get impregnated?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was terrified but oddly excited about the whole ordeal. \u201cWell, not much to do now but wait.\u201d, he thought. \u201cI knew I should have just waited for Karen to return and oversee my transformation, but I really wanted to see if I could fool her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short, but bumpy ride, the truck backed up to the gate and released Brad into the pen. It didn\u2019t take long for the prize hog to find him and greet him. He half expected the Hog to mount him right then and there, but he seemed to want to get to know him first. Brad returned the greeting awkwardly as the male spread out on the ground beside him. After a moment of hesitation, Brad cozied up to his new mate and tried to relax. \u201cI don\u2019t even know his name.\u201d, thought Brad as he laughed at his own thought. \u201cNot that it really matters since I can no longer talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that afternoon, Brad was up exploring the farm when he noticed a couple pigs in the stalls next to him. The larger pig was poking around the other\u2019s backside. Brad continued to look on as the larger male mounted the sow. Low squeals and oinks filled the air as the male pumped in and out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad felt a surge of jealousy and a tingle in his loins. The two pigs certainly looked like they were enjoying the act. Brad felt hornier than ever watching the pigs go at it. He decided to go wake up his boar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrad poked at the boar\u2019s crotch with his stubby snout, intoxicated by the musky smell that the boar produced. The boar came to his feet and approached his new mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad presented his rear and squealed, trying to show that he was ready. \u201cEnough foreplay already!\u201d, he thought. He wanted release and he wanted it now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig briefly nuzzled \u201cPeppa\u201d and jumped up on his mates back, ready to mount. It only took a moment before Brad\u2019s piggy pussy was filled by the boar\u2019s hard cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... fuck ME! Ohhhhh... that... is... amazing!\u201d, thought Brad as he continued to get pounded by the boar. The first orgasm hit him by surprise as he squealed loudly. The sensation stayed with him as the boar continued to fuck him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 40 minutes, the most intense sex that he ever had was coming to an end. He just lay contently by his mate, hoping that the boar\u2019s recovery time wasn\u2019t so long.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the first few days, Brad started to become accustomed to his new routine. The farmer took good care of his pigs and he had lots of room to wander. After hearing a few conversations with the farmer, he determined that the boar\u2019s name was Henry. His frequent matings help reduce his nervousness of becoming a permanent resident. However, he was fairly certain that Karen wouldn\u2019t have sold Peppa without talking to him. It was a good opportunity to pair up Peppa with the prize winning boar. He just hadn\u2019t expected to be the one getting fucked. Although Brad had to admit that it wasn\u2019t a bad way to pass the time, especially with the really long orgasms. Being a sow certainly came with some interesting pleasures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad had lost track of time, but was pretty sure that he\u2019d been at Farmer Joes for at least five days, maybe six. He was just finishing up his meal when he saw the farmer coming to open up the gate. He walked over to Brad cautiously, trying not to spook him. \u201cTime for you to go back Peppa. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be the proud mother of a litter of piglets soon. You\u2019ve certainly enjoyed your time with Henry, haven\u2019t you girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was much more cooperative as the famed loaded him into the truck. He was quite relieved to find out that he was being returned, but would miss Henry and his short romance this last week. The idea of leaving Henry had more of an effect on him than he thought it would. He looked longingly at the boar as the truck drove away. It was sinking in that he wouldn\u2019t see Henry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren greeted Farmer Joe as the truck drove up to the barn. \u201cHello Joe! So was our attempt at match making a success?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeppa and Henry were two peas in a pod! She\u2019s definitely pregnant by now. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a hornier pig than this girl. She done wore \u2018ole Henry out!\u201d, said Joe as he led Brad down the ramp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad tried to act nonchalant as he was led back to the pen. After all, he at least wanted to make it hard for Karen to keep playing his little game. He had a few days left before Karen would make her guess and restore Brad and the original Peppa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were at the pen, Karen looked deep into Brad\u2019s eyes, but Brad tried to keep up the charade. \u201cSo Brad, did you enjoy yourself?\u201d, said Karen. It was only then that he noticed another Peppa in the pen. \u201cIt was time to turn you back, and I couldn\u2019t find you. So I put Peppa back into the machine and examined which animal the trophy was. I was a little surprised on your choice of body, but admire your sense of adventure.\u201d, said Karen with a smirk. \u201cLet\u2019s get you back to the booth, unless you\u2019d like to experience motherhood? That could be arranged.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad shook his head causing Karen to chuckle. She led him back to the machine and told him to stand on the scanner. \u201cWe need to transfer those piglets over to Peppa. It\u2019s a shame that you stole the best part of the experience. Maybe I should make you a boar so Peppa can have her fun before becoming pregnant? Maybe I\u2019ll be the boar?\u201d, said Karen as she walked back in to the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Brad found himself back in his body. It was strange to be human again and walk in two legs. Karen approached him and embraced her husband, giving Brad a very passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, How was it?\u201d, asked Karen. \u201cDo sows really have such long orgasms?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad blushed as he thought of how to answer that question. \u201c Uh, Yeah. It\u2019s quite an intense experience. You should try it sometime. It was fun, but It\u2019s nice to be back. I missed you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you did, but Henry seemed to help take the edge off!\u201d, teased Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad laughed and held his wife close. \u201cSo, I guess neither of us won my little game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast, there little Piggy. I was pretty certain that you were Peppa by process of elimination. I didn\u2019t think your acting was good enough to fool me. Besides, I think you\u2019re going to like what I have planned.\u201d, said Karen as she winked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brad was excited, but anxious about giving up his humanity, as he walked toward the cow pasture. However, it wasn\u2019t a big risk, he told himself. \u201cI trust Karen to get me back to this body. I bet she\u2019ll never guess which animal\u2019s life I took over. She\u2019ll probably guess I was one of the stallions or mares.\u201d, thought Brad. Becoming a horse also tempted him, but something about wandering lazily around the pasture was more appealing right now. He\u2019d have plenty of opportunity to try other forms. Soon he would be part of the herd, and just in time for milking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad located Dottie wandering up toward the barn. She was named this because of a few black dot patterns on her side. She was a young cow, and one of their best producers. He lured her up to the gate and escorted her slowly toward the shed, but didn\u2019t have any difficulty. Once she was scanned, he turned her into a generic trophy object and placed her on the table with a note. He carefully reviewed the settings in the terminal and slowly walked into the booth. He had made sure to set a delayed timer so he could put himself in the pasture before the transformation took hold. He hesitated as he stared at the button. \u201cIs this really a good idea?\u201d, he thought as he thought about it. But desire overpowered reason as he hit the button. The machine went through its familiar process and released him as the machine began its shut down process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo turning back now. I\u2019d better get back to the pasture and my new, simpler life.\u201d, thought Brad as he hurried outside. As he approached the field, he saw their bull mounting one of the cows. He imagined himself as the cow and tried to push down an erection as he ran to the gate. \u201cI won\u2019t have to imagine it in a few minutes.\u201d The thought of experiencing a life so unlike his own excited him more than words could describe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his watch and waited until the countdown reached 20 seconds before entering the pasture, The sound of a vehicle approaching made him nervous that one of the farm hands might see him. However, his concerns were unwarranted as he quickly shifted into his new body. He felt his mass increase drastically as he fell forward onto his hooves. He was now a Holstein cow and indistinguishable from his former human body., A low moo escaped his clumsy lips as he carefully took a step. He could feel his new udder swaying as his immense weight shifted. He slowly, but surely got the hang of walking as he marveled at the feel of walking on all fours. The lack of hands would take some getting used to. He swished his tail a few times as he looked back at his rump. He couldn\u2019t believe how amazing the Booth was. He could experience anything with this machine. He examined the rest of his body and became accustomed to his new vision. It was odd having such a wide view of his surroundings. He wandered deeper into the pasture to join his herd.</span></div></div>",

Instead of taking him to the buckets and stools, she continued to lead him to a smaller, but fenced in area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie patted Brad on the head, ruffling his fur. \u201cDottie, I need to introduce you to someone, and I hope you get along. Joe is bringing a little calf over who lost his Mom the other day. I think we have the best chances of pairing you up with her so she can take her as your own.\u201d, she said, more to herself than Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear a driver coming up the road, which must be Farmer Joes. The two greeted each other and exchanged pleasantries. Brad watched the farmer unload the calf and bring her to Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sad little calf looked totally lost and shivered a bit as she walked.She stopped just short of Brad\u2019s enormous body and let out a pathetic moo. Brad instantly felt sorry for the little guy and offered his udder to the newcomer. The calf sniffed Brad before slowly reaching into suck on one of Brad\u2019s teets. Brad helped the little calf along by nudging her closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoor little calf.\u201d, thought Brad as the calf began sucking on his teet.

The feeling of feeding the young calf was beginning to feel more normal since it was evening now and the calf had been with him for most of the day. He wasn\u2019t sure if the real Dottie would be so accepting of the new calf, but hoped that she would help the poor little calf out when it was time to change back. He had no intentions of raising a calf to adulthood. It would likely mean that he would have a calf of his own by that then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed without incident as he looked for for a nice spot to lie down for the night. His new calf, which he now knew was named Milly, snuggled up beside him as he drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was confused the next morning when he awoke. He tried to reach his face but his body didn\u2019t seem to respond to his demand. Slowly, his memory returned as he remembered that he was now Dottie the cow. Milly nudged at her new Mom hungrily, trying to get to Brad\u2019s udder. Brad slowly rose to all fours and began to graze on the grass, giving Milly access to feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Milly had finished her breakfast, she found another calf to play with and started running around, enjoying her time with her new friend. As Brad looked on, he saw the bull approach him out of the corner of his eye. Max gave him a friendly greeting before walking around to his back side. Brad grew excited as the bull poked his nose into his pussy, obviously liking the smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDottie\u2019s female hormones got the better of him as he quickly gave Max access to his rear.  He eagerly awaited Max\u2019s next move as the bull examined him. He would have a complete experience as a cow once he had sex with the bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax jumped up on his back, trying to push his cock into \u201cDottie\u201d as Brad did his best to brace himself to take the weight of the bull. It didn\u2019t take long before the bull found his target and jammed his dick into his mate\u2019s ready cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuuuuuuuck! ... Oh yeah! ... That\u2019s... the spot!\u201d, thought Brad as he felt the bull fill him.The first orgasm hit him by surprise as the bull continued to fuck him, increasing his tempo. Brad lost track of time and his surroundings as a feeling of pure euphoria washed over his bovine form. He could feel his mate\u2019s seed fill him right before the bull jumped off his back and strut away from his latest conquest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, This is so exciting!\u201d, thought Brad as he slowly started to regain his composure. Max had just screwed him and he had loved every minute of it. \u201cI hope he\u2019s up for another round before noon!\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure that he wanted to return to his human body as early as he originally planned. Milly depended on him, and it was only a matter of time before Max impregnated him, giving him his own baby. \u201cMy baby?! He\u2019ll no!\u201d, he thought as he pushed the image from his mind. I don\u2019t want to be a heifer for life.

Julie was a very trustworthy person and had been around a long time. Karen knee that she could trust her to keep a secret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Brad\u2019s around. You just won\u2019t recognize him.\u201d, said Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, how so?\u201d, asked a confused Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome with me. There\u2019s something you need to see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie followed Karen to the shed that held the transformation booth. After squeezing through a few boxes, they were in the room with the booth. Karen pulled up a stool and sat by the terminal. \u201cI assume what I have to tell you will sound like fiction, but bear with me. I believe a demonstration will be the best way to introduce you to the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie waited politely, but was curious where her employer was going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease step into the circle.\u201d, asked Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie walked into the circle and gasped when the ring lit up. She looked to Karen for some kind of explanation as Karen walked toward the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow don\u2019t freak out. This would be a really tough thing to believe without witnessing it first hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren pressed the button and the machine began its familiar process. Moments later Julie gasped as her twin stepped out of the machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis, as you can now see, is a transformation machine. We just stumbled upon it recently, but Have discovered that just about any kind of transformation is possible. Human, animal, inanimate objects. It\u2019s an amazing piece of technology! Brad spent a few days as a monkey accidentally. It seems safe enough and we have tested most of the settings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnimals? Like any animal?\u201d, said Julie excitedly. She blushed after she said that and tried to play it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure can! In fact, Brad has been spending the last few days as one of the farm animals. He was pretty secretive about which one so we could play our little game. If I find him I get to pick his next transformation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, can I try it? I mean, I have a few days off. It won\u2019t be on the clock...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Julie, I trust you and having you around would ensure that we can do it safely. I would rather the transformation not be a one way ticket. I need hands to operate the booth effectively and might decide to transform into something that doesn\u2019t have opposable thumbs, or even hands. Brad and I would like to try some more, let\u2019s say, adventurous transformations. But I have a favor to ask you first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These breasts of yours seem even bigger now that they are attached to my chest!\u201d, said Julie as she gave her new breasts a feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they have their advantages, but I think your body is even sexier. Yours are just the right size and you\u2019ve got a killer body! I\u2019m going to enjoy these next few days.\u201d, said Karen as she admired her borrowed younger body in the mirror. \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling adventurous, check out my top right dresser drawer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looked momentarily confused and then blushed when she realized what she was probably talking about. \u201cWell, I do have a date with Alex tonight. I wouldn\u2019t mind if you wanted to be a little adventurous as well. I get to choose my next transformation on Monday though, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you can have the whole week if you\u2019d like! I promise to not get to crazy with the booth until you\u2019re ready to turn back. I\u2019ll take good care of you, don\u2019t you worry!\u201d, said Karen as she hugged her old body. \u201cThis is going to be so fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie walked around the farm, taking care of Karen\u2019s normal routine. Karen eyed up the animals to see if any of the them paid too much attention to her original body. She spent most of the day eyeing up the stallions. It wasn\u2019t until later in the evening when she eyed Dottie acting a little strangely. She seemed to be keeping an eye on Julie and was a little flighty whenever Julie looked her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould Brad have turned himself into a COW? I don\u2019t think he\u2019s that adventurous. But still...\u201d, thought Karen as she had an idea. After conversing with Julie for a few minutes, she had her follow her over to the pasture. When she was close enough for Dottie to hear, her plan went into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just have to see the new trick that I taught Dottie!\u201d, said Karen as she held up an apple. \u201cIf I turn my finger clockwise, she will turn once and do a slight bow. OH DOTTIE! Come here girl!\u201d, said Karen as she twirled her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad lumbered over to Julie. He was glad that he was fortunate enough to overhear her talking to Karen. \u201cI won\u2019t blow my cover now.\u201d, thought Brad snuggly as he performed the trick for his Apple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood GIRL!\u201d, said the real Karen as she pet \u201cDottie\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow Karen! I\u2019ll be hear bright and early.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Julie!\u201d, said the real Julie with a subtle wink as she walked toward the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad greedily ate the apple, trying to look as casual as possible. Karen reaches out and ruffled \u201cDottie\u2019s\u201d hair. \u201cI win!\u201d, said Karen as Brad lifted his head in confusion. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have expected my husband to transform into a cow. You\u2019re a lot more adventurous than I thought!\u201d, said Karen as Brad put two and two together. \u201cI trusted Julie with our secret. She won\u2019t reveal it to anyone and it will allow us to try some more, shall I say, extreme transformations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA disappointed moo escaped Brad\u2019s lips. He was a little embarrassed that Karen knew which animal he had become. She probably knew that he had mated with their prize bull more than a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat little calf sure does appreciate you. You probably saved his life. You\u2019ll need to keep that up for another month before he\u2019s ready to take care of himself.\u201d, said Karen as she pet Brad\u2019s large, bovine head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad let out a questioning Moo as Karen\u2019s words sunk in. He hadn\u2019t planned on being livestock for a whole month. Although... it wasn\u2019t all bad. He had been enjoying Max\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard you\u2019re Max\u2019s favorite!\u201d, said Karen with a smirk. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Brad. I think it\u2019s kind of hot! You\u2019re comfortable enough with your masculinity to try new experiences. How does it feel to be free of your humanity and explore the female sex? I might have Julie help me transform into Max so we can have some fun. I hope your interested in being female on two legs as well! Oh isn\u2019t it great to have another person in on the secret!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was actually excited to have someone looking after him and Karen so they could try some more extreme transformations. He had a few kinky ideas for Karen and him. He would feel safer if someone was watching out for them to keep them safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like Max is coming for his favorite cow again!\u201d, said Karen. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t be missing out tonight either. I have, or I should say Julie has a hot date tonight. I can\u2019t wait to put this young, flexible body to the test.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMooooooo?\u201d, said Brad pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on DOTTIE! It\u2019s only fair. Max has been screwing your brains out all week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad hadn\u2019t noticed Max until he jumped up on his back to mount him yet again. In moments, Max found his mark and pumped away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave you two love birds to it! Your calves are going to be adorable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad gave into his carnal instincts and pushed back against Max as the euphoric feeling washed over him. He had to admit that he was enjoying his new life more than he thought possible. He could stand being a cow for another few weeks. He tried to tell himself it was because of his little calf that depended on him. Deep down though, he knew it was because he liked being fucked by his big, strong, masculine bull. He knew Karen was probably joking about him having a calf. Probably...</span></div></div>",

A pang of jealousy hit him as he thought about Karen going out with some much younger stud. \u201cShe is probably going to fuck him before the night was over.\u201c He thought. After he calmed down a bit, he realized how absurd it was for him to be upset. He had turned himself into livestock and had become the bull\u2019s favorite fuck buddy. He was in no position to judge his wife\u2019s actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad had enjoyed his little vacation from humanity. He looked down at the little calf as he searched for a nipple on his very full udder. It was quite a pleasurable experience having his udder sucked on. Almost as pleasurable as getting mounted by the bull. He certainly didn\u2019t want to remain a cow for life, but the short term experience had been a lot of fun. Although, the thought of being stuck longer  did sound a bit exciting. He knew that the experience would sour soon since he would probably Not be in heat much longer and the bull would lose interest in him.  \u201cI have no desire to birth a calf though. She\u2019ll have me back in my old body within the week. I\u2019ve just about had my fill of grazing in the fields.\u201d, thought Brad as he wandered closer to the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until Noon the next day when Karen came back to the farm. Brad saw her talking to Julie from a distance, but couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying. Julie put her hand on Karen\u2019s shoulder and laughed. After a brief conversation, they both went into the house. \u201cShe still has the same clothes on as yesterday.\u201d, thought Brad as he wandered back toward the bull.</span></div></div>",

He wasn\u2019t going to complain about the extra girth and length of his dick, not the added muscles. He looked at Karen hungrily and embraced her also enhanced body. Brad began to caress her huge breasts as Karen unbuckled his pants. The horny husband and wife didn\u2019t even wait until they were in the bedroom. In no time at all, they were naked having sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening, Karen cuddles up to Brad as they both lie on the bed, exhausted from their sexual escapades from earlier that evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmm... that was great, but we can do anything with the transformation booth. We don\u2019t have to restrict our transformations in any way. I would love to see what it\u2019s like to have a penis, and I bet you wouldn\u2019t mind transforming into a woman. A hot, sexy woman with big tits and a nice curvy ass.\u201d, said Karen as she stroked Brad\u2019s chest. She noticed Brad\u2019s flaccid penis begin to rise once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so you like that idea, don\u2019t you?\u201d, teased Karen. \u201cYou want to be my sexy little bitch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad turned red in the face, but his rock hard erection gave him away. \u201cWell, of course. I\u2019m as curious as you to see how the other half lives. We don\u2019t even have to chose a human form.\u201d, said Brad, waiting for Karen\u2019s reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like your sense of adventure, Babe!\u201d, said Karen as she lightly caressed Brad\u2019s hard on. \u201cIn fact, it doesn\u2019t even have to be a living being. How would you like to be my bra and spend a few days caressing these breasts?\u201d, she said as she rubbed climbed on top of her husband and dangled her huge tits over Brad\u2019s erection, causing him to moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWe need to be careful though. We can\u2019t transform at the same time without help. If we both transformed into animals, who would change us back?\u201d, said Brad as he tried to focus on the conversation while Karen had started titty fucking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me your fantasy Brad! Anything is possible, so what turns you on the most?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... want to be... an animal again. And... I want to have... a... genuine experience... as that animal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm...\u201d, moaned Karen. \u201cYou mean you want to fuck another animal. A REAL one?\u201d, she said as she increased the pressure and tempo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! To be treated... Oooooh... like... that... AHH... animal.\u201d, said Brad in between moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I like it!\u201d, said Karen. \u201cAnd why type of animal do you want to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou choose!\u201d, he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, this is hot! And one more question... What gender?\u201d, asked Karen right before wrapping her lips around his shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh GOD! YES, oh don\u2019t stop.\u201d, said Brad as he hesitated just a bit. \u201cFemale...\u201d, he said right before the orgasm took him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren swallowed the rest of Brad\u2019s cum and gave him a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked closely at his beautiful wife, looking deeply into her eyes for approval. Although it embarrassed him a little, it was something that he wanted to try, ever since they discovered the machine. \u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s too weird?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabe, I love you so much and I have some of my own fantasies that are even more adventurous than that. Of course I will help you scratch that itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad hugged his understanding wife and was relieved that she wasn\u2019t disgusted by his request. He would have asked her to be his mate if it were possible, but someone had to configure the device unless it was a one way trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren jumped out of bed and pulled on his arm. \u201cCome on, throw some pants on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, we\u2019re doing this now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course we are! I can\u2019t wait to see your reaction. No better time than the present.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what are you going to change me into?\u201d, asked Brad cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise!

NO PEEKING!\u201d, said Karen as she pushed Brad toward the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad sat down, trying not to look nervous. The thought of leaving the decision up to his wife excited him more than he would admit, but he was also a bit terrified that there could be complications. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled as she checked off box after box and speedily typed the transformation settings into the terminal. She set the delay for 5 minutes, smiled, and looked at her husband. \u201cReady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, actually....\u201d, said Brad right before the booth slammed shut. After the humming of the machine subsided, the door opened, releasing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I don\u2019t feel any different.\u201d, said Brad as he looked himself over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have about 4 1/2 minutes before your form is revealed!\u201d, said Karen as she embraced her husband, giving him one last long, passionate kiss. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss this\u201d, she said as she rubbed Brad\u2019s crotch that was already standing at attention. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m going to have one of my own since you won\u2019t be using that body for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA while? How long did you plan on...\u201d, said Brad before the transformation started. The room seemed to spin and grow at the same time until he found himself on all fours, standing on his pants. He felt hair all over his body and his vision changed revealing more of his surroundings. He turned his head, noticing the pink tail extending from his hairy ass. Brad ran over to the mirror on the wall to get a better look at himself. Staring back at him was a large white rat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren picked her former husband up by the tail and smiled at him. \u201cWell now. You\u2019re a fully functioning female rat in heat. I figured You could spend a few days getting to know my pet rats Bob and Fred a lot better. They will keep you busy for the first few days. After all, I want to watch you experience sex for the first time. You\u2019re adorable by the way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBob and Fred!? Those damn rats always wanted to bite me.. They are going to certainly have a new appreciation for my current body.\u201d, he thought. He was certainly going to have a much friendlier reception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm.... what should we name you now? How about... Fanny? After that cute little fanny of yours.\u201d, said Karen with a chuckle. \u201cLet\u2019s go make the introductions now. After a few days with them, I\u2019ll take you out to the barn so the wild male rats can have their fun as well!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck have I gotten myself into?\u201d, thought Brad. \u201cI\u2019m going to have Karen\u2019s pets doing their best to impregnate me over the next couple... how long? I guess I didn\u2019t say. Then she\u2019s going to release me  into the wild? Well, I\u2019ll have a bit more privacy there.\u201d However, the thought of Karen watching him get fucked silly made him even more excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren placed \u201cFanny\u201d in her hand as she carried her new pet back to the house. Brad could see the boys trying to get a better look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now boys! You make sure you take turns with this gal and treat her right!\u201d, she said as she placed Brad in the cage and shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad could feel Karen\u2019s eyes on him as both males began sniffing his behind, very interested in his aroma. The former man squeaked as Fred chattered in his ear. He realized that his female hormones were begging these two males for a hard fuck and he was about to lose his mouse virginity. He poked Fred and gave him easy access to his rear. Fred accepted the horny female\u2019s invitation and hopped up on \u201cFanny\u2019s\u201d back m, quickly finding his target. Brad squeaked loudly as the rat\u2019s penis filled his sex and began pumping in and out. Waves of pleasure engulfed his body and he pushed Fred deeper into him. He opened his eyes briefly to see Karen pleasuring herself as she watched Fred take her former husband. Her cries matched his own as the male rat pushed harder and faster. Finally, Karen\u2019s cry of release caused his own orgasm to hit. He forgot everything about his former life at that moment and writhed in pleasure as orgasm after orgasm finally took him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look like you enjoyed that as much as I did there Fanny!\u201d, said Karen as she caught her breath. Brad just nodded in agreement as his wits finally returned. Just as he was catching his breath, Bob climbed up on his back and began pushing in and out of Brad\u2019s female anatomy. He smiled inwardly as familiar sensations took hold of him a second time.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll be back in a few days, but don\u2019t worry. Brenda will stop by to look after you and will be house sitting while I\u2019m gone.

Karen, seeing Brad\u2019s confusion pulled her husband back toward the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI set a delay on the transformation. You\u2019ll be an animal right before dawn. I want to send you off in style. She gave him a passionate kiss and entered the booth. Moments later, a short, curvy Japanese woman with a beautiful curvy ass stepped out of the booth, her impossibly large breasts jiggling with even the slightest movement. She was wearing a plaid skirt that was way too short and a blouse that showed a deep valley of cleavage. She sauntered over to her husband and pulled him close. Brad had to duck down to meet her soft lips. After a passionate kiss, Karen pulled off her shirt, exposing her pillowy breasts. Brad\u2019s eyes grew huge as he reached down to cup them, causing Karen to moan softly. She pushed Brad back in the chair and straddled his erection between her breasts. Brad was in heaven as she teased him, slowly moving back and forth. He closed his eyes and leaned back into the chair. He suddenly felt Karen\u2019s lips over his dick...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad felt a little shake on the shoulder as he looked up to see Karen in her normal body. He was lying on the shed floor wrapped up in a few blankets. They hadn\u2019t even bothered to head back up to the house over night. They had sex on pretty much every surface in the shed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to get up!\u201d, said Karen as she handed Brad a robe. \u201cLet\u2019s head outside so we can get you to your home for the next few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nervously followed his wife outside. He wasn\u2019t sure what Karen had in store for him since he left it totally up to her. He wondered if she would stop at the chicken coop. Maybe he\u2019d be supplying the farm with eggs for the next few day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of being a chicken intrigued him, but they kept moving toward the barn. He was trying to play it cool, but he was pretty excited about his inevitable transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren looked at her watch and smiled. She reached down and gently cupped Brad\u2019s crotch. You won\u2019t have this for much longer. You\u2019re going to enjoy yourself. I think it\u2019s hot that you want to see how the other half lives. Do you think you\u2019ll let yourself get fucked? Fucked by a big, strong male? That turns you on, doesn\u2019t it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren\u2019s question caught him off guard a little, but the suggestion was making him hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm...\u201d, said Karen. You are certainly excited. \u201cThat\u2019s right. We\u2019re going to have something in common soon. I can\u2019t wait to see your face the first time. I think it will be a very moooving experience when Max makes you part of the harem!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad\u2019s eyes were wide at the revelation of what he was to become. \u201cOh my god!\u201d He thought as Karen turned his head toward Max mounting one of their dairy cows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat could be you in about 5 minutes. If you want it. But you DO want it, don\u2019t you \u201cBessie!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded his head and looked longingly at Max. \u201cYes! Oh my god, yes! You\u2019re an awesome wife and I love you so much.\u201d Karen pushed Brad into the pasture and closed the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I am a pretty cool wife!\u201d, she said with a wink. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting a delivery today. You\u2019ll be joining the rest of the new livestock. Julie will give you a name once she\u2019s had a chance to meet you. It will be almost impossible to figure out which one of you is which. Tell me how much that excites you. You could get stuck that way. I might have a hard time finding you. Heck you might not want me to find you once you\u2019ve been properly fucked. Oh, and by the way, you\u2019ll have your intelligence, but you won\u2019t be able to understand anything I say. After all, you\u2019re just a dumb fucking cow, aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled at his wife as she left him in the pasture, standing alone. Karen\u2019s talk made Brad was so unbelievably hard and needed relief. He reached for his cock, but found that his fingers had fused to become a cow hoof. He fell forward and quickly gained mass as black and white fur covered his entire body. Within seconds, he was indistinguishable from any other cow in the pasture. He quickly moved toward the other cows as he felt his udders sway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gravity of the situation finally hit him. Karen was the only person on the planet that knew what he had become but had absolutely no idea which cow was him. He was free to do anything that he wanted and would be treated just like any other cow. A lot of thoughts flooded his brain all at once. \u201cWhat would It feel like to be connected to the milking machine. What does grass taste like? Was she serious about the speech comment? How would he reveal his identity to Karen when it came time? Where the hell is Max?!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wanted Brad to enjoy himself while also letting him have a very unique experience. She not only took away his ability to understand speech, he wouldn\u2019t recognize any human that he interacted with, including her. \u201cI know he trusts me, but there will be at least a little bit of doubt in his mind. With no way to talk to me, he\u2019ll have to face the possibility that he will spend the rest of his days getting milked and serviced by Max.\u201c, she thought as she examined the token that she made during the transformation. \u201cAs long as I have this, getting him back won\u2019t be an issue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, that day, Brad wandered up toward some of the workers. He wondered where the usual crew was. He didn\u2019t recognize any of them. Where was... what\u2019s her name. Or... that guy that... or the one who...\u201d, he thought as he started to panic a little. At least he knew who Karen was. \u201cKaren, my loving wife, with her long... hair and those... SHIT! I have no idea who is who!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad trotted quickly up to the farm hands to listen to their conversations. He would be able to figure out what\u2019s what as long as I can listen in. He waited patiently for someone to start a conversation when the woman holding a bucket spoke. \u201cFolt Buh dreesum ex bobblay.\u201d All he heard was nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell? I\u2019m just a dumb fucking cow for real?! Karen wouldn\u2019t let me get stuck as a cow. She\u2019s just messing with me. Yeah, that\u2019s what\u2019s going on.\u201d, he told himself. Still, with no way to contact anyone, he was stuck in this body for who knows how long. He might as well enjoy the ride. The thought of being stuck like this added an element of danger to the situation which, to be honest, kind of excited him. He was pondering his situation when he heard the bell ring. It was feeding time and he did feel a bit hungry. </span></div></div>",

He had only had udders for a brief amount of time, but he could certainly tell that they were full. He was directed into a small stall where he couldn\u2019t move much and felt the equipment clamp into his udders, weighing them down a bit. He felt the suction pull at his teats and let out a slow bellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a very alien feeling, but not an unpleasant one. He had some food within reach, so he dipped his head and started to munch on some hay. He could see cow heads to both sides, and all of them were slowly chewing away at the fresh hay in front of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was over before he knew it and was released back out into the pasture with the other cows. Brad looked around a bit, but none of the cows seemed to want to socialize, so he lowered his head and started grazing. There wasn\u2019t really much else to do, and it helped pass the time. His first day as a heifer had been pretty un eventful and he started to feel a little drowsy. He saw some of the other cows lying down in the field, so he followed suit and drifted off to sleep soon after the sun set. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad opened his eyes when he heard the rooster crow and was momentarily confused. His vision was all off, his body didn\u2019t react properly and he was lying in the middle of a field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah... I\u2019m a cow still. Now to figure out how to get my fat ass up into a standing position.\u201d, he thought as he collected his wits. With a bit of effort, he pushed his massive body off the ground and got to his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad hadn\u2019t quite adjusted to his new body yet, so every movement still seemed strange, but kind of exciting. Walking on all fours was starting to feel natural and he was finally adjusting to his new field of view. Having eyes on the side of his head allowed him to see almost everything around him. He guessed that it was about 300 degrees of vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like another dull day until... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brad had only been grazing for about an hour before Jack, their border collie was rounding him with the other cows. He had noticed early on that he had been routed to a different pasture with the five new cows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was in the barn, a man guided him over to the examination area of the barn. Two women, who could have been anyone watched him approach a man with a stethoscope. It was odd how every human looked the same to him. The only thing he could determine was their gender. He wondered if one of the women was his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shit. That must be the vet. He had seen a few examinations and was getting a little nervous about where he was going to stick that hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren and Julie watched the vet examine the line of new cows. Karen was paying close attention to see if she could figure out which one was Brad. She figured that it would be pretty obvious if she payed close attention to the cow\u2019s reactions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was second in line and watched on as one of his herd was examined by the unfamiliar man. Most of the examination had seemed pretty tame until the man reached his whole arm into the first patient\u2019s ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad shifted his weight and gave an uncomfortable moo as he realized that he was next. It didn\u2019t seem to bother the female, so he tried to play it cool. As the examination wrapped up, another man put a tag up to the cow\u2019s ear and tagged her. Brad winced again as he watched the cow\u2019s reaction to the annoying yellow tag waving as she tried to flick the tag off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled as she noticed the second Holstein cow\u2019s reaction to her sister\u2019s examination. She was certain that that was the reaction of a former human who understood exactly what was going to done to her after they led the current one away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJanet! Yeah, that name suits her.\u201d, said Julie as they took the first cow back to the pasture. She seems like a Janet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was led to the vet who began to examine him, starting with his udder. Brad winced a little when the vet walked behind him and moo\u2019d loudly as he felt the vet\u2019s arm invade his ass. He saw the man with the tagger approach from the side, but Brad\u2019s ear kept moving, making it difficult for him to do his job. Finally he grabbed Brad\u2019s long ear and activated the machine, causing a sharp pain shoot though his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBessie!\u201d, blurted our Karen just as Julie was about to name the new cow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looked shocked that Karen had an opinion. She normally didn\u2019t take an interest in these sort of things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm... Okay, Bessie it is.\u201d, said Julie. \u201cShe does seem a little like a Bessie, even if it\u2019s a little cliche.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was happy to finally be taken back to his pasture and put some distance between the man who had just violated his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren reached down to praise Jack and give him a treat. \u201cThat was easier than I thought!\u201d, thought Karen as she laughed out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looked her direction, wanting to be let in on the joke..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Julie. I was just thinking about something that happened earlier in the day. Nobody but me would actually find it funny. Thanks for hanging around tonight to meet the new girls. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving got what she came for, Karen said goodbye to Julie.  She would be back in the morning when they released the cows into the other pasture. The new girls would all get some time with Max and Brad would be one of those girls.</span></div></div>",

He wondered briefly who it might have been, but gave up that train of thought, knowing that it was pointless. Karen had made certain that he wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize anyone, nor understand language. This modification had really immersed him in his current role. Although he still had his wits, there was little use for them in his new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad heard Jack barking and trying to herd him into one of the other pastures. He assumed that he was finally being introduced to the main herd and let their border collie lead him to his new destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the gate was closed, he looked around, but only saw the new cows that he had been grouped with. With nothing else to do, he put his head down and started to graze. It wasn\u2019t long before his attention shifted to a loud bellow coming from the across the pasture. He looked over and saw Max mounting one of his other companions. They had put him into the field with Max to make sure that he would be mated with the virile bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the moment he had been waiting for and the carnal act that Karen has teased him with. Max was about to make him a proper cow. Possibly a pregnant one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad casually moved closer to Max, hoping that the male would choose him as his next conquest. He was so unbelievably horny from the thought of having Max\u2019s huge dick inside him. He wanted to be fucked like the big dumb cow that he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax recovered quickly enough and walked up behind Brad who immediately presented his back side to the bull and lifted his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull didn\u2019t waste any time as he jumped up on the new cow\u2019s back. He found his mark in moments and pushed inside his eager mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooooooh FUCK ME! Oh God! Finally!\u201d, thought Brad as he Max started pushing into him. \u201cMOOOOOoooooo!\u201d, was all he could say as Max picked up his tempo. Brad was now trying to push Max deeper into him as he met his thrusts. The pleasure was almost too much to bare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren watched her husband from the distance and smiled. She was glad to see Brad give into his new desires so easily. She had never seen a cow smile, but she swore that was what was happening now. \u201cI will most certainly have to try this out myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother orgasm rocked Brad as his brain dogged over. Finally, he felt Max erupt into him, filling his with his seed. Every slight movement caused him to shiver with pleasure as Max rested on his sturdy back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Max dismounted. Brad never felt so used as he basked in the afterglow of sex, watching his new mate walk away without so much as a thank you. When he finally came to his senses, the full weight of what just happened finally registered with him. Max is going to keep this up until I\u2019m pregnant and I can t think of anything I want more. He was already looking forward to another round with his new mate as his cow hormones kicked into high gear.</span></div></div>",

Your wife is sitting over there. She\u2019s been Jack for a couple days now. She\u2019s still learning how to do his job.\u201c said Julie as she took Brad\u2019s arm to help steady him. \u201cShe\u2019s not very good at it yet.\u201d, she added in a whisper so only Brad could hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad accepted help as she helped him toward the house. It was becoming a bit easier to walk at this point, although his human body still felt wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you certainly looked like you enjoyed yourself as Bessie! I think all of the other ladies were jealous that you were Max\u2019s favorite!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad blushed and stuttered a bit, trying to think of a proper response. \u201cWell, I Uh... it was the hormones, Uh...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie put a finger to Brad\u2019s lips and winked at him. \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of hot! Most guys wouldn\u2019t be so comfortable exploring life from the female perspective. You don\u2019t seem any less manly to me.\u201d, she said as moved her arm around his waist, even though he didn\u2019t really need the extra support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren waited outside the door as the two entered the house. Julie hung back for a moment and whispered something to Karen. Karen nodded and Julie ruffled the hair on her head and caught up to Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad sat down on the couch to relax as Julie went to grab him something to drink. She returned and sat next to him after handing Brad the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what was it like?\u201d, she asked. \u201cI\u2019ve always wondered and as impossible as it is, you had first hand experience with it. Was the sex amazing? I bet having a dick that big in you was absolutely delightful!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad actually did a spit take at the question. He had always thought of Julie as the quiet and shy type. He certainly hadn\u2019t expected that kind of question from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, by the way... Karen had this note for you.\u201d, said Julie as she pulled out a note from her pocket and handed it over to Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear Brad, I hope you enjoyed that as much as I did. I decided to let Julie in on our little secret so we could both have some fun at the same time. I May have gone a little overboard with the settings and wanted to make it up to you. That young girl staring longingly at your body has the hots for you and I\u2019m giving you permission to have a little fun. You are horrible at reading these kind of things, so I\u2019m spelling it out for you. I\u2019ve seen the way you look at her when she\u2019s around. I promised to let her take my place for a while while I have some of my own fun. I\u2019ll be sneaking over to have my way with the neighbor\u2019s black lab, so I thought it was only fair. I\u2019m certain that you\u2019ll make it up to me. Julie will fill you in tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad finished reading and felt a hand caress his thigh. Julie was smiling sexily as she gave him a knowing look. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the way you look at me also Brad. I\u2019ve always wondered what it would be like to have my way with you. I\u2019ve spent more than one night pleasuring myself when thinking about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was speechless as he reviewed the note one more time. He looked over to see \u201cJack looking though the window. The dog nodded and walked away, giving him his privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked down at Julie\u2019s perky young breasts and smiled. He knew what was going on now. Karen was role playing with him like they\u2019ve done in the past. The booth just allowed them to explore these little fantasies much deeper than before. This was completely out of character for Julie and he\u2019s certain that he would have picked up on the fact if Julie has really been that attracted to him. He assumed that Karen had indeed told Julie about the booth, but Julie loved animals and was probably the one posing as Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie inched her hand closer to Brad\u2019s crotch and gasped a little when she felt Brad\u2019s erection. \u201cIs this your real one or is this the work of the machine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all mine. She\u2019s right you know. I have always wanted to get a better look at that body of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie perked up and removes her shirt, exposing her bright red lingerie. She bit her lip and helped Brad out of his shirt. She then straddled him and pushed her breasts out before her crush as she reached to unclasp her bra, exposing her naked chest to Brad at eye level. He began working her nipple with his mouth as she slid her pants and panties off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you have an amazing body!\u201d, said Brad as he examined Julie\u2019s naked body. You\u2019re a naughty little girl, aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if that was the next cue, Julie deftly unbuckled Brad\u2019s pants and pulled them off. His penis was at full mast as she bent over and licked the shaft. Brad moaned as she buried the tip in her mouth and started massaging it with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God yes!\u201d, exclaimed Brad as he was overcome by a wave of pleasure. \u201cThis is new!\u201d, he thought as he fell back into the couch. After a few minutes, Brad heard a plop as Julie came up to kiss him on the lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeeding no further encouragement, Brad sounds Julie around and pushed her to her knees until her ass was sticking up in the air. Based on her mom ans. she obviously liked being handled this way. Brad began fucking her doggie styled as his balls slapped against her. Things only got more heated from there. </span></div></div>",

That was the third round of sex that day and although he thoroughly enjoyed every last second of it, it was time to get dressed for the day. Karen had gone to the booth to change back into her original body, or at least he had thought it was Karen. It turns out that he really is bad at reading people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie came back in the room and cozied up to Brad, who was still naked on the bed. She kissed him passionately on the mouth before digging through Karen\u2019s wardrobe to pick out an outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Karen does really have a killer body. It\u2019s going to be fun to have these huge tits of hers for a while. I hope you\u2019re up for another go tonight.\u201d, said Julie as she felt her new larger breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked at her examining her body in the mirror and realized his mistake. It was Julie after all. That would explain the new positions that they tried last night. And as good as Karen was, she was a novice at blow jobs compared to Julie. He cringed first a just a moment at his mistake. Karen HAD given him permission though. The feeling of guilt passed quickly when he realized he was going to repeat the performance again tonight. Karen had been a little rough on him, but at least he spent most of his time getting nailed by Max. Life as a cow, without the sex, would have got old really quick. Besides, he was sure that Max had got him pregnant and he had no desire to be a mother to a needy calf. Although, he certainly was yearning for it this morning. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how much the hormones were directing my actions.\u201d, is what he told himself. However, he was already thinking about becoming Bessie again. The machine might be able to put him into a state of extended heat. Julie thought that her naked body was the catalyst for his erection and winked at Brad.</span></div></div>",

Julie has worn him out again in his wife\u2019s body and he got little sleep. He found Julie and Karen sitting at the kitchen table, having a cup of coffee. Both women smiled at him as he tried to figure out who was who. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, look who finally decided to wake up.\u201c, said Julie\u2018s body as she looked up at Brad. He hadn\u2019t expected to be confronted so early by either of the women about his activities yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie\u2019s scowled at him as she stood up and walked closer. \u201cSo you could t keep it in your pants, could you?

However, before he could say anything, both women started laughing Uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you he was that gullible.\u201d, said Karen in Julie\u2019s body. \u201cI don\u2019t fault you for having sex with Jules over there. It was only fair that you got to have some fun with her as well.\u201d, said Karen as she grabbed her original body\u2019s ass and kissed her passionately. They both turned to smile Seductively at Brad while their breasts pushed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad relaxed a bit, but couldn\u2019t help but be a little jealous. He wondered briefly if they would both be interested in a little threesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what\u2019s going on in that little head of yours. Too bad I have a date tonight. Julie\u2019s boyfriend is going to show me a good time. I promised Julie that I\u2019d help her with the machine. I\u2019ll need your participation if I\u2019m going to keep my word.\u201d, said Karen as she directed the husband and \u201cwife\u201d toward the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air was a bit frigid as Brad pulled his robe closed and quickly jogged to the shed. He welcomed the warm inside as he finally escaped the harsh wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Karen entered new commands into the controls, Brad whispered in her ear. \u201cI did have a good time. I\u2019ll be honest though. You had me a little worried, but I\u2019d still be up for trying it again. This time, you can fill Max\u2019s role.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled and gave Brad a quick peck on the lips. \u201cNow don\u2019t you worry about this little date. It\u2019s just sex and you\u2019re the only one that gets my deep and undying love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis put Brad at ease and took away some of the guilt from the past two nights. He loved his wife very much, but was excited to have an occasional distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on then, step into the machine.\u201d, said Karen to Brad. \u201cBefore you ask, it\u2019s a surprise. I think you\u2019ll enjoy it quite a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad, trusting in Karen, stepped into the machine as it completes its work. Once again, he didn\u2019t look any different than when he stepped in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime delay?\u201d, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guessed it!\u201d, said Karen as she waited for Julie to enter.

Horses maybe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to try that eventually, but that\u2019s not for today. I\u2019ve always wondered if the rumors were true.

We\u2019re going to be pigs, aren\u2019t we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that exciting!? I can\u2019t wait to see if it\u2019s really true. I bet you\u2019ll make a cute little piggy! I never, in a thousand years, thought I would get to experience life from the point of view of an animal. What a great way to spend a vacation away from all the troubles and cares of a human being!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I guess you make a pretty good point. I can\u2019t honestly say that I didn\u2019t enjoy my time immensely as Bessie. I wouldn\u2019t want to be stuck as a cow for life, but it was fun to try on a new skin for a bit. I wonder what it will be like to have a corkscrew penis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know!

I promise to make sure you are properly screwed at least 2 or 3 times a day. However, I can\u2019t ignore all the other ladies.\u201d, said Julie as she ran her hands across Brad\u2019s chest. You\u2019ll soon have 14 tiny bit sensitive little breasts running along this area. You\u2019ll also be helping with a worthy cause. I\u2019ve been feeding those baby piglets who lost their Mom a few weeks back. You\u2019ll be their new mommy since I won\u2019t be around to feed them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be raising baby piglets?!

I\u2019m really looking forward to this. There\u2019s no reason to talk about this with Karen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lips are sealed. Now come on, we need to get to our new home!

I\u2019d like to try this body on for size once I\u2019m human again.\u201d, said Brad as he caressed Julie\u2019s breasts until he felt a tingle run through his body. A surge of pleasure ripped through his body, causing him to fall forward onto the ground. He bulked up so quickly that his new girth jiggled uncontrollably for a few seconds once his transformation completed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look adorable! I gave you a little bit of a head start so you could meet your little ones. Don\u2019t you worry though. I\u2019ll be joining you shortly and we\u2019ll see how good pigs really have it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad snorted and oinked as he adjusted. She could feel his new breasts dangling from her flabby belly, making hier instantly horny. Julie opened the gate and walked into the pen with the new sow. \u201cSally was a very friendly girl and great mother. You\u2019re a carbon copy of her body, so your little piglets will be quite happy to see you. Go ahead and wake them up Sally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce nudged a few of the piglets, causing a chain reaction among the little piglets. Soon all the babies were squealing excitedly as they climbed all over their mother. Brad flopped over on her side so his babies could feed. The feeling of having 14 piglets feedIng caused female hormones to flood her brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie gave words of encouragement, right up to the point of her own transformation. Brad and Julie were now locked into their forms and we\u2019re indistinguishable from any other pigs. Once the piglets had their fill, Brad eagerly stood up and gave her new boar easy access. Julie didn\u2019t need to be asked a second time as he climbed on top of his horny mate and found his mark. Both pigs squealed in delight as they had sex for the first time in their new bodies. Brad\u2019s mind practically exploded from the intense pleasure that she felt as her big strong boar fucked her hard. Just when she thought she had reached the peak, Julie blew his load into \u201cSally\u201d. Wave upon wave of pleasure rocked their bodies as they basked in the afterglow and experienced their first of many hour long orgasms. </span></div></div>",

We can enter that little set of cages and tubes over there and spend the week as Karen\u2019s pets. Or B. We live dangerously and wander around outside and explore.\u201d, said Julie as she waited for the reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked over at the cage and noticed other mice scurrying around the compartments. \u201cIt looks like we\u2019d have some company if we played it safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. There are six females and one male in that cage. We have some options for a little variety if we want to go native.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have plenty of options. I only have you and the other male. You\u2019ll have a harem of 6! Typical man.\u201d, said Brad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, that would be 7 pieces of ass that I have to choose from.\u201d, said Julie as she looked Brad over. \u201cNone of them as as fine as you though!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was intrigued by being confined to a cage with a few males to keep him company. He found himself sizing up his male companion and liking what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy mice?\u201d, asked Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have a size and animal fetish. I figured that I could really have a great time by combining the two. We could actually stay this way much longer than a week if you\u2019re game. Karen has no idea who is who and won\u2019t be able to locate us until we want her to, especially if we venture outdoors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the cat?\u201d, asked Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah! You know as well as I that he hasn\u2019t caught a mice in years. You cant be serious!\u201d, responded Julie as she walked closer to Brad. \u201cRegardless of what we choose, I can smell how horny you are right now. You\u2019ll be in heat for the next five days. I have to warn you though. Every time we fuck or let a real mouse have his way, you will lose your ability to talk for 4 hours. I thought it would make things a bit more interesting. You could end up spending all your waking hours as a common rat if you get too horny. It would be rather difficult to ask Karen to change you back if you can\u2019t keep a dick out of that sweet pussy of yours. I like my women quiet and submissive.\u201c, said Jules as she rubbed up against Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you certainly do have a foul mouth as a male. What makes you think I can\u2019t control myself?\u201d, said Brad, trying to fake a confident response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie\u2019s latest revelation really peeked Brad\u2019s interest. He loved being dominated when he was Bessie and wanted to push those desires even more. He knew that he might not be able to easily avoid temptation when he was ready to turn back, but at least thought it possible with some focused effort. He wouldn\u2019t be in heat forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie whispered in Brad\u2019s ear. \u201cI know you can\u2019t resist. You are just itching to be my fuck buddy. It scares you that you might like it a little too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad shuddered a little bit as his libido surged. \u201cCome on and fuck me already!\u201d, said Brad as his voice cracked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeg me to fuck you Minnie. Tell me how bad you want it and I MiGHT pick you over those other cuties in the cage.\u201d Julie started walking over toward the enclosure leaving Brad alone on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad moaned in frustration and gave in. \u201cOKAY! I want you to fuck me hard. Make me your little fuck toy before I go find a real mouse to give it to me. You\u2019re right, I want to be a slutty little tramp who gets fucked all day. I\u2019m LOVE COCK! I crave it. I NEED it! There I said it! I mean every word and it\u2019s good to finally get that off my chest!\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit Minnie! You can just call me Max!\u201d, said Julie right before she pushed into \u201cMinnie\u201d. Brad was screaming Max\u2019s and directions on what to do to him until he lost his voice and could only squeak like a common mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I mention that the loss of voice was cumulative!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although Brad couldn\u2019t talk, he found a way to say that he\u2019s choosing the safe choice. It took them both a few minutes to figure out how to climb up to the table, but in their current bodies, it was actually fairly easy to climb. Entering the cage was very simple, but leaving was impossible. A large hole was centered in the largest compartment, allowing Brad and Julie to easily drop down to be with the other captive mice. The walls were much too steep and slippery to climb back out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad squeaked a few times, frustrated that he couldn\u2019t talk. \u201cI wonder if that was Julie or Karen\u2019s idea?\u201d, he thought as he dropped down into the cage. Julie followed suit and dropped down beside Brad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHome sweet home!\u201d, said Julie with a broad smile as she introduced herself to the other female mice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad had noticed that the ability to talk also gave him and Julie more extreme facial expressions. This was probably due to the muscles that were needed to talk also made more human like expressions available. Brad tried to look angry at Julie, but failed miserably due to his earlier activities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad went the opposite direction that Julie went and bumped into the only other male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great, he\u2019s going to want to mount me as well. Maybe I can slip by and...\u201d, thought Brad as the male just walked by, completely uninterested in Brad\u2019s female body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad ran past him and blocked his exit, now offended that the only other male didn\u2019t have any interest in him. \u201cSo what? I\u2019m not good enough for this guy?\u201d, thought Brad. \u201cYou\u2019re not much to look at yourself!\u201d, Brad tried to say but only managed angry squeaks. Brad posed sexily by the male, trying to seduce the obviously stupid mouse. \u201cI mean, don\u2019t they just see a female and hop on her back? Can a mouse be gay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male just sat back on his haunches as the strange female in front of him continued to chatter to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, it\u2019s possible that you\u2019re not as hot as you think you are Minnie. Bob might just have higher standards.\u201d, teased Julie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad glared at Julie, or at least tried to. It came across as more of a blank stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frustrated Brad was determined to get this mouse to mount him, and tried something a little unconventional. He moved closer to Bob and used his tiny paw to rub Bob\u2019s crotch. In no time at all, his member grew, then grew some more as a shocked Brad looked down at the incredibly large erection that Bob was now sporting. He certainly had his attention now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie realized this guy made her penis look small. Brad turned to look at Julie\u2019s reaction. As he did, Bob took that as an invitation and climed up on his back. Bob almost immediately found his pussy and slid his oversized penis up into Brad, filling him more than he thought possible. Brad lost his composure as his new mate made his eyes roll back into his head and squeal in delight. \u201cWow, who needs \u201cMax\u201d when I\u2019ve got this guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad didn\u2019t need words to express how much he was enjoying himself. Julie left the compartment pretending not to be put off by the display in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTalking is overrated!\u201c, thought Brad as he relaxed on the floor, completely spent.</span></div></div>",

She was in the bedroom modeling some of her old clothes with her new body enjoying how they held up to her new enhanced look when there was a series of loud \"Ook\"s and \"Eek\"s.  Karen sighed, \"Yes Brad, you can use the machine again I know.  Let me just try on a few more outfits first.  I want to make sure I look my best for the newly human you.\"  But Brad didn't seem to like the idea of his wife delaying his return to humanity.  Mainly because he wanted to get a hand full of his wife's new body with his own not hairy hands.  He kept pestering Karen until she finally relented.  \"Fine, let's go ahead and get you to the booth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad stood in the transformation booth and was very happy to here the whirling of the mechanical parts as he anticipated his body changing back into his own. Hell, maybe Karen would give him some 'enhancements' like she did to herself.  But when the booth door opened, Brad couldn't help but notice that he was still short and hairy and had still had a trail.  Brad voiced his displeasure and Karen had a good guess at what Brad was saying. \"I hope that you enjoy your new body for...lets see... The monitor says that the sex change has a 6 hour wait period.  Longer than I'd have guessed.  Well, enjoy yourself, I'm going to go ahead and finish trying on clothes and then I'll get a nice shower.  And maybe if you feeling less stubborn I'll let you have some fun tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Karen said, 'sex change', Brad looked down.  And sure enough the spider monkey penis he had gotten acquainted with over the last 24 hours had been replaced by a void.  Brad cautiously took his long fingers and poked around his new sex as Karen watched on.  Suddenly a lightbulb went off in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea of something that could be fun.  Be right back.\"  Karen left and as soon as she left Brad got a little more exploratory with himself.  These new feelings were very foreign, but were not unpleasant.  Before Brad could perform a full examination the door opened and Karen walked in with a chicken in hand.  Without speaking she put the chicken into the booth and scanned, she looked at Brad and shrugged, \"Never know when we'll need it.  Now lets try to change the girl.\"  And Karen typed in some information and the machine began to work again as after a few seconds the door opened again and out walked...</span></div></div>",

We\u2019ll call him... Bruce. Yeah, that name seems to fit him. Brice should have the instincts and mental capacity of your average male spider monkey. In fact, I could help you enjoy you\u2019re experience more by modifying that brain of yours as well. There are all kind of options, including taking away your ability to understand language or dialing up your animal instincts a bit more. You could have a much more authentic experience that way.\u201d, said Karen casually, as she examined her body in the mirror. \u201cI can\u2019t get over how sexy this body is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad quickly shook his head and made some unintelligible monkey noises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll just have to be patient Brad. I\u2019m not some cheap slut that you can just jump into bed with and start groping my tits. I want to have a nice romantic dinner out first. When I get back, I\u2019ll turn you into a more appropriate companion that will appreciate my new wardrobe.\u201d, said Karen with a wink. \u201cI bet you can\u2019t wait to get your hands on these!\u201d, said his wife as she flashed her new tits. \u201cIn the mean time, enjoy some play time with your new little friend.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad\u2019s new friend was sitting next to him, grooming him, trying to get his attention. As odd as it was still being in the body of a monkey, he did enjoy the attention. it was nice to have another monkey around. However, he did wonder what they would do with him once he transformed back into a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad couldn\u2019t wait for his evening out with his wife. He pictured her standing in the sexiest and skimpiest lingerie he could imagine. The thought of caressing her new body was actually starting to make him a little horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow be a good girl and stay out of trouble while I\u2019m gone.\u201d, said Karen as she opened a cabinet and took out some food. \u201cNow I\u2019m sure you two are hungry, so here\u2019s some food to tide you over until I get back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked down at the fruit on the table and chattered happily at the presence of fresh fruit. </span></div></div>",

He had only been a primate for a day, but was very familiar with his smaller, more agile body by now. However, being female was a new experience. He was examining his new anatomy a little closer when Bruce hopped up into the hammock with him. He made room for his new friend and continued to explore. It wasn\u2019t long before Bruce also took an interest in his female parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad jumped a little when Bruce\u2019s hand started to explore his crotch as well. He hadn\u2019t realized that he was putting on a show for his new friend. Bruce was also sporting a very large erection. It hadn\u2019t been that long since he had one of his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God!

I mean, I\u2019m not an animal, that\u2019s... well... uh, unnatural? I mean, well, I guess I can\u2019t blame him for getting excited.

It would be fun to let loose a little and would help pass the time.\u201d He wondered what it would feel like to let Bruce have his way with him and the thought did not disturb him. In fact, if he was being honest with himself, it kind of made him horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce jumped up on the workbench and sat next to him. Brad didn\u2019t run away this time and let Bruce get a little closer. Brad realized that he wouldn\u2019t be taking advantage of the chicken turned monkey. Being a monkey was probably a substantial upgrade and Bruce was naturally attracted to Brad\u2019s body. Brad wondered if Karen had cranked up his monkey instincts a bit during his transformation or if he just really felt these urges all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNobody would even know.\u201d, thought Brad as he reached down and lightly grasped Bruce\u2019s manhood.

He pounced on Bruce and began stroking in earnest. Bruce made happy noises as Brad decided to warm Bruce up with a hand job. After a few minutes, Brad\u2019s patience ran out as he lowered himself onto Bruce\u2019s tool. Bruce wasn\u2019t the only one making happy noises as Brad lost all sense of control. He could see his body writhing with pleasure in the mirror across the room. The site of his primate body having sex set off a very primal urge and the first orgasm hit him hard. He held Bruce tight as he bucked his hips, pushing Bruce deeper. A second orgasm hit him, then a third. Finally, when he didn\u2019t think he could take it anymore, Bruce blew his load into him and gripped Brad tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh FUCK!

She was purchasing a number of sexy outfits for him and would eventually end up in bed with him. That sexy, curvy body was going to be all his. Instead, he decided to cheat on Karen with another monkey. He wondered what she would think about that and was a bit ashamed for the first time. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t care? Maybe that\u2019s what she intended from the start? It was hard to say, but that wouldn\u2019t stop him from doing it with Bruce again.

'Stop looking so content, this is at least half your fault.'  Brad thought with a groan as he thought about how angry Karen was with him.  But what the hell did she expect him to do?  Twiddle his stupid little monkey thumbs?  'In fact, it's her fault I screwed, or I guess let myself get screwed by Bruce.  I didn't ask to be turned into a girl monkey or ask her to turn a chicken into Brucie boy here.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce didn't seem to care about Brad's inner monologue as he began to pick Brad's nose making Brad laugh, 'You know just what to say to a girl don't you.'  Brad thought with a laugh as he too put a finger up Brad's nose.  Soon after some playful touching, Bruce began to put his finger's in some very personal places to Brad.  'Whoa there Bruce, I just got yelled at by my wife for letting you do stuff like that, I'm not about to risk ticking off Karen again,' Brad thought as he pushed Bruce's hands away from his nether region.  At the moment Brad didn't know that a monkey could look heart broken, but Bruce had that sad look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad felt his heart sink, after all Bruce had just been trying to make him feel good.  Finally Brad came to a rationalization, 'You know what, screw it.  Karen's already ticked off at me, might as well have some fun.  It's not like Karen's going to get any more mad at me.'  And so Brad walked over to Bruce and began to reward his kindness by wrapping his long strong fingers around Bruce's shaft.  Over the course of the night the two would go at it a couple of times before falling asleep cuddled up together.<br>\r\n_______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brad!  What the hell!\"  The sound of a very angry wife awoke Brad the next morning.  \"I didn't do it!\"  Brad said, although it just came out \"Ah eee ooo ahh!\"  Karen seemed to get the idea of what Brad was trying to say, \"Don't give me that, I left to cool down thinking you'd know why you made me mad, and I come in here this morning to find you and Bruce sleeping in your own fluids!  Did you just go at it all night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not ALL night,' Brad thought, but there was he knew there was nothing he could say to cool off Karen who was turning quite the lovely shade of red.  Karen pointed a shaking finger at the transformation booth and simply said, \"Go now.\"  Brad didn't have to be told twice, he knew he was about to be turned into something he wasn't going to like, but the alternative was living with Bruce in the shed for the rest of time, and that would be the best case scenario.  Brad got into the booth and just hoped Karen would at least turn him into something that could try to talk her down.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brad's time as a chicken was quite boring at first.  Brad was so disappointed to lose a body that at least had opposable thumbs he wasn't sure what to do.  He tried to use his wings to open the door to the chicken coop and pick up random sticks on the ground, but that quickly proved fruitless.  Then Brad tried to teach himself how to fly, but as he scooted across the coop to try and get speed and flap his little white wings all he succeeded in doing was lose a bunch of features and tick off his fellow chickens when he accidentally whacked them in the face with his wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Brad began to settle down.  He ate some corn and enjoyed the crunch of the grain in his beak without the risk of chipping a tooth.  He even found a nice spot with a pre made next where he was able to squat and settle in for the night.  His dreams were nuts with a monkey in a maid outfit trying to find a milk cow in a sea of feathers that turned out to be his own.  Before Brad could figure out where the cow was he was awoken by what sounded like a blow horn in his ear crowing into nothingness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Damn it Roy!'</i> Brad thought as he glared daggers at the residential rooster. Brad disliked the rooster for that noise on a normal day when he's inside the house, but with Roy right here beside him the noise was 10 times worse, there was no ignoring.  <i>'Friday can't get here soon enough.'</i>. Brad thought as he awoke and ate some more grains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day went on Brad felt a weird pressure somewhere deep down.  It didn't feel like he needed to use the bathroom, this felt different.  And then as Brad heard a fellow chicken cry out, he turned to see one lay a big old egg, and Brad's eyes went wide.  <i>'Well, at least today isn't going to be boring.'</i>. He thought as he settled into his nesting spot.<br>\r\n__________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Friday came around, Brad was becoming an egg laying master.  Brad found the process of pushing the egg out of his body weirdly mediative.  As he ate his corn and throughout the day he liked to imagine the egg forming in his body like a cartoon until he was ready to push another one out.  He even got into the habit of comparing the number of eggs and their size with the other chickens.  And since he knew today would be his last day here, he wanted to go out with a bang.  He sat on his nest and concentrated as he felt a big one coming.  But right at that moment the door to the chicken coop swung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Brad, let's turn you back so we can talk like adults, ok?\"  It was Karen, she was a bit earlier than Brad had expected.  Brad let out a cluck that got lost in the other chickens clucking which if it could be understood would translate to, 'Give me a minute, I just got started with this egg.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Karen did not speak chicken and just saw that none of the chickens were coming up to her ready to transform back into her husband.  Her eyebrows began to twitch a little.  \"Really Brad?  You're going to be that immature?  Fine, see if I care.  See if I even bother coming back to turn you back.\"  With that, Karen slammed the door and Brad's egg finally dropped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well cluck.'</span></div></div>",

She was tapping her toe quickly as she looked down at the small sea of chickens.  \"Last call Brad, no promises I'll come back anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here!  Here!'

He went right up to his wife and nodded his head and even hugged her with his wings to get the point across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's either you Brad or a very eager chicken.  Either way you're going in the Transformation Booth.\"  Karen said picking up a very happy Brad.  The two didn't say anything as Karen placed her husband in the booth and closed it up.  Brad tried to fly up to see the screen to see what Karen was inputting, but sadly even after a few days of practice, Brad hadn't been able to figure out how to make a chicken fly.

Once inside, he made himself comfortable and flipped open his cup of mealworms and watched the game. Yelling occasionally at the screen, scaring the other hens in the process. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The more Brad wore Karen, the more she felt like she was able to 'see'.  She saw Brad enter the chicken coop as long black hair rubbed against her bikini top body.  She then saw two feminine hands reach down as Brad said, \"I've got a very special job for you Roy.\"  Brad said as she grabbed the rooster and took it back to the Booth.  A few button presses later and Roy the rooster was a matching blue bikini bottom which Brad happily stepped on once before putting it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for go for a swim.\"  Brad said before grabbing a towel and driving to the water park.</span></div></div>",

Bikini that was actually his wife a rooster transformed with the Booth?\"  Karen did her best to move her bikini top body around as much as she could to tell Brad she was paying attention,  Brad smiled and said,  \"Check.  Alright Karen, time to enjoy some fun in the sun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren was wondering what Brad was going to do first, take a relaxing swim in the lazy river?  Go on some giant slide?  Relax in the hot tub?  But no, Brad did something he'd never done as a man, he went right for the lounge chairs and began to rub himself with sunscreen.  Brad smiled as he enjoyed rubbing down his current body.  It was perfect for the water park and his bikini was crafted to fit him perfectly as it hugged his chest very well.  As he rubbed himself with lotion Brad made sure to get a little bit on his top just to tease Karen a little bit.  With that done, Brad sat back, put on his sunglasses and enjoyed the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the reasons Brad had done this, was to be a little shameless.  With his dark sunglasses on, and if didn't move his head at all, he could look at all the beautiful women he wanted, and hey, Karen could kind of see, he'd made sure of that, so she could look at all the dudes she wanted.  But Brad noticed an unexpected side effect of his transformation.  Not only could he check out women, he could see the dudes (and a few woman) who were checking him out.  Eventually Brad actually began to ignore the woman he came to ogle and became curious at who was looking at him.  Every single one of them thought they were being so smooth as they checked out his legs that went for miles and his wonderfully perky breasts hidden from the world by Karen.  But Brad was able to take note of each and every one of the lurkers and smiled to himself thinking that he was out of everyone's league.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough a guy did eventually managed to have enough self confidence to actually approach Brad.  This dude just waltzed up to Brad and said, \"You've got some beautiful skin there, be a shame if it got burned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already covered dude, thanks.\"  Brad said not even turning his head to the guy.  But this guy didn't let his first line failing get him down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well you're still looking like you're burning up, why don't we go ride that slide over there so we can take a nice dip in the water.  We'll get a two person ride down.  Don't worry, you can hold on to me, I'll keep you safe.\"  This overly tanned blonde dude actually flexed his muscles as he said this.  Brad and Karen both couldn't believe this guy, was he for real?</span></div></div>",

That's usually followed by bad news isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....\"  Karen said as she began to nervously walk around the shed, \"I don't know if it's necessarily 'bad' just...think of it as a fun and different.

I'm so sorry Brad.\"  Karen said sounding genuinely sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds pretty darn inconvenient.  But I still don't understand.  What do you mean by 'default' form.  I can still use the booth right?  So why can't I just have my normal body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should have probably explained what it means to change your default body.\"  Karen said as she pulled out the instruction manual and flipped to the appropriate page.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brad was stretching his legs out on the couch for one of his occasional trips inside the house to experience his human body again.  It turns out being a talking chicken as your default body according to the Transformation Booth was indeed a pain in the ass.  Because his default body was so small, he could only stand being in a larger body like his own for a few hours at most before he's forced to transform back.  And after that he can't turn into a human for over a day.  At first he turned into a human as often as possible, but over the last few weeks it had become more of a pain for Brad.  So now he only transformed when he and Karen got really horney or some special occasion like today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to love this recipe I found, this is going to be the our best anniversary dinner ever.\"  Karen called out from the kitchen as Brad drank his first beer in over a month.  \"I'm looking forward to it.  So, how have things been on the farm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been hectic, the farmhands have been a godsend.  Although Geoff has been hitting on me non stop.  I turn him down, but I can't exactly tell him I'm in a rewritten reality where my husband is a chicken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled, he was happy to hear that Karen was being faithful to him, although he couldn't say the same thing.  It was kind of difficult to convey to Roy the rooster that he wasn't always in the mood, but Karen at least seemed okay with that.  Brad was enjoying the smells of human food coming from the kitchen as he watched sports in solitude without any clucking in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Karen called out, \"Dinner time.\"  And Brad went to the dinning room that already had a spread of potatoes, rolls, gravy, and casserole.  Then Karen came in with the main event.  In the middle of the table Karen placed a perfectly roasted and seasoned stuffed chicken.  Brad felt himself throw up in his mouth, \"Really Karen?  Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"  Karen asked worried about her husbands sudden turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think this is at all fucked up?\"  Brad said pointing an angry finger at the chicken.  Karen's eyes went wide, \"Oh my God, I wasn't thinking!  I'm so so sorry baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I know who that is?  I didn't see Barbara Ann in the chicken coop today, did you go in the night and take her for slaughter!  Damn it Karen she's like a best friend to me!  All of them in the coop are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, Brad, please calm down.  She was old and dying.  We do this with all of the chicken all the time.  I thought you'd be okay with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not!\"  Brad said standing up and slamming his fist on the table.  \"So if I stop laying eggs before the year is out for me to turn back am I going to be dinner too?  Maybe you could invite Geoff over that day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not funny Brad.\"  Karen said the tears ruining her mascara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going back to the coop, I'll just eat some worms and wait til the Booth makes me turn back.\"  Brad walked off leaving Karen in a state.  She was so mad at herself for what she'd done to her husband and now she'd gone and turned his chicken friend into dinner.  \"I'm so sorry,\"  She said to herself, \"I need to make this better.  Brad's going stir crazy since he can't leave the house since he might turn back into a chicken in public.  I need to make this up to him somehow.\"</span></div></div>",

He already missed his chicken friend Barbara Ann who was probably settling in Karen's stomach by now.  Brad almost threw up at the thought.  If he weren't so depressed about the situation he'd probably laugh at how torn up he was over a chicken he would have gladly cooked just a few months ago no probably.  But being turned into a chicken and living with them for a few months changes a man's opinion on poultry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brad picked up a few seeds and gnawed at them a bit there was a knock on the chicken coop door.  Karen's voice came through, \"Can I come in Brad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in the mood Karen,\"  Brad said fairly coldly to his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ok, I understand.\"  Karen said feeling Brad's anger through the door, \"But, I have someone who wants to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren opened the door, and a familiar looking chicken clucked her way into the chicken coop.  Brad's eyes went wide, \"Barbara Ann?!\"  He went over to the chicken and picked her up and hugged her.  He looked at the door where Karen was still standing and his joy turned into bitterness as he said, \"But how?  This isn't possible, you probably just grabbed a rock and turned it into a clone or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No babe, that is Barbara Ann.  I took her off the dinner table and I dug around the garbage until I foundfound every piece I took from her.  I put her in the booth and used it to bring her back as well as I could.  She's perfectly healthy and will be around for a long time.\"  Karen sounded like she was tearing up, and Brad even through the door and the usual smells of the coop could smell that his wife did indeed smell like garbage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad could feel himself tearing up at the gesture, he put Barbara Ann up to his face to wipe his tears with her feathers.  \"Thanks...although she does weirdly still smell like lemon chicken and seasonings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry!  I'll put her back in the Booth the second I can and try and fix that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's ok babe, I like it.  And I can tell she likes it too.\"  Brad put his chicken friend down and left the coop to talk to his wife face to face.  \"Karen, thank you so much for this.  I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too!\"  Karen said embracing her husband, \"And I'm so sorry about dinner.  I should have realized that it was a bad idea and that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, it was an accident and you went out of your way to fix it.\"  Brad said as he gave his wife and appreciative kiss.  When the kiss broke Karen asked, \"How much time do you have left with your human body for the day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About an hour give or take.  Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make good use of that time.\"  And with a coy smile, Karen led her husband to the bedroom to make the most of that hour.  Things went pretty smoothly for the two as they adapted to Brad's chicken situation although there was a bit of a hick up about 3 months later.</span></div></div>",

Brad had really started to actually enjoy the simplicities of life as a hen, just sitting around all day with his thoughts as he layed his eggs had become pretty therapeutic.  He only used the booth on weekends for dates with Karen since it caused a bit of a strain on him to not be in his default body.  Brad was still counting down the days until a year passed and he could go back into his own body as his default form, but he knew there was nothing to be done so he simply enjoyed his time in the chicken coop with his fellow hen's and Roy the rooster.  Although the tv Karen installed was still a lifesaver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was pecking on the remote finding some sports to watch that morning when the chicken coop door opened.  In walked a young boy of about 10 years of age who was only about 4 feet tall at most, although from Brad's height it was difficult to tell.  The man took a basket and began reaching for some of the eggs from the other hens.  \"You know, it's a little easier to do this when I don't have to squat all the way down to do this.\"  Karen said smiling down at her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the Transformation Booth is letting you try all sorts of different bodies for different tasks, although I doubt that body will be able to handle the horses.\"  Brad said turning off the tv to talk to his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but my sister Brenda is turning into a hunk of a man right now to take care of that.\"  Karen said continuing to grab eggs.  A little while back the two had agreed to let Karen's vet sister in on the Booth.  It was making life around the farm easier for Karen and Brenda enjoyed trying out being animals.  She'd even shared the coop with Brad one night to try out egg laying, it was nice for Brad to share a nest with another talking bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then after we finish some chores, Brenda's going to take me to the theme park, I can't wait to ride those kiddie rides again.\"  Karen said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope the two of you have a good tiaaaaaamym.\"  Brad said letting out a tremendous yawn that sounded like a piercing cluck.  Karen almost dropped her basket as she covered her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that Karen, I've just been a bit tired the last few days.  I've had a hard time sleeping.\"  Brad said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything ok in here?  Do you need me to get you a pillow?  Should I change out the hay in here?\"  Karen asked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's fine, I've just had...trouble sleeping.\"  Brad merely said looking around the room innocently.  \"Okay,\"  Karen said finally reaching under Brad for his eggs.  But before Karen put the egg in the basket, she hesitated.  She stared at the egg for a weirdly long time.  \"Is something wrong?  Is it bigger than normal?  I swear it felt bigger when it was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Karen seemed to be ignoring Brad's words.  The 10 year old went to an empty wooden bucket and flipped it to stand on it.  She reached up to an old shelf and pulled down a candle and some matched.  Karen put down the basket with the other eggs in it and after a few failed attempts, lit the candle and held up Brad's egg to it.  She stared intently for a minute before she burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've had a hard time sleeping?  Of course you have, it's hard to sleep when you're banging Roy all night long.\"  Karen could not suppress her giggle fit as Brad just stammered, \"I...I don't...we....Ok, fine!  I've been getting a little bored and was watching some porn and...got in the mood and you weren't around to help me use the Booth so...I used what I had available.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm sure Roy was more than happy to oblige.  I'm just sad that instead of having your first child with your wife you chose to have it with Roy the rooster.  If you want to leave me for him and fly off into the sunset I won't stop you.\"  Karen pretended to cry as she continued to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!  Fine, you got me, my love for Roy burns hotter than our oven when you cook thanksgiving turkey.  But he told me he was using a condom!  That liar!\"  Brad said getting in on the joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure that he'll be a great daddy and you'll be a great mommy.  I can't believe I'm going to be an aunt!  This is so crazy!\"  Karen said gently putting Brad's fertilized egg back in Brad's nest where Brad would sit on it lovingly over the next three weeks when suddenly the egg began to hatch.</span></div></div>",

Sure enough with some more scrolling you and Karen came across pictures of Karen dressed in a bridesmaid dress standing next to chicken 'Brenda' and Roy the rooster with a priest in between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a thousand questions, but I don't think I want the answer to any of them anymore.\"  Brad said and Karen nodded in agreement closing her phone.  \"Well, there's only one thing to do now.\"  Karen said looking at her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that?\"  Brad said feeling a rumbling in his stomach that was either uneasiness from all the craziness or another egg getting ready to be laid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you've been married for a while apparently and you've never introduced me to your beaux, come on, let's go.\"  With that Karen picked Brad off of the table gently and carried him out to the chicken coop where they were met with a surprise.  Instead of one chicken coop, there was now two.  One that was there before with all the chickens in it, and now a second smaller one off to the side with a picture of Roy the rooster and Brad the chicken.  Karen stepped in and there indeed wait was Roy who looked up and clucked happily upon seeing his chosen mate.  Brad looked around and instead of just being rows of mini nests and a place for food and water this small coop also had pictures of him and Roy on the walls and a TV set up in the corner.  Karen put Brad down and Roy approached clucking in a friendly fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So turning this into my default form has somehow made Roy monogamous with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well with a chicken as beautiful and smart as you he obviously made the smartest choice.\"  Karen joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes.  And I bet I married him for his scintillating conversations.\"  Brad said as Roy continued to cluck.  This gave Karen an idea.  \"You know, we could put Roy in the Booth and give him the ability to talk.  It will probably make your time as Brenda much more tolerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I think I'd rather have conversations with humans.  I wonder how much I still hang out with the guys in this reality?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I want to make sure you're as comfortable as possible, so I know what I'm going to do.\"  Karen said deciding upon a plan.</span></div></div>",

One thing he wasn't expecting was to have the exact same female monkey body he entered the Booth with.  Looking down at himself Brad wondered if Karen had simply changed her mind and the lights in the booth were just for show, but the smug look on his wife's face and a a sinking feeling in his gut told him differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, you still have that body, I just made a few tiny little changes.  Who knows, maybe you'll actually like them, but I'm willing to undo them if you prove how sorry you are for cheating on me with a FUCKING MONKEY!\"  Karen yelled the last words with anger and hurt in her voice causing Brad to shudder.

There in front of her was a large cage, perfect for her pet monkeys. It had plenty of space to climb and even a tire swing. As she got closer to the cage a man turned around to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are! I was wondering where you ran off to.\u201d, said the now familiar man as he approached her. Let\u2019s get these two love birds back in their cage. I want some one on one time with my favorite lady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBen?!\u201d, thought Karen. \u201c But we met after Brad and I were... married.\u201d, said Karen as she looked at her hand. There she saw an unfamiliar diamond ring, quite a bit larger than her original one. \u201cWow! I\u2019m married to Ben!\u201d, she thought as Ben planted a kiss on her lips and gave her ass a little squeeze. \u201cHe\u2019s as sexy as he is rich! I wonder what we do for a living?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren swooned a little as he released her and rounded up the monkeys to put back in the cage. Brad was a lot more worried than he was earlier. Karen reset reality when she was in her much curvier body. \u201cThis must be her normal body now.\u201d, thought Brad as he looked down at his hairy, long arms. \u201cShit, this is now my body until, or IF Karen ever decides to turn me back. \u201cOook Eeeaak Ak!\u201d, exclaimed Brad as Ben shut the cage door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled broadly at Brad and winked. \u201cI won\u2019t count your first week. Have all the sex you want. I know I will!\u201d, whispered Karen to Brad after Ben was out of ear shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabe? Are you coming or not?\u201d, questioned her new husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren ran to Ben and took his arm, pulling him quickly toward the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce sat next to a stunned Brad and started grooming him. Brad sighed as he realized his predicament. He jumped up and sat on a higher ledge. He picked up a banana with his foot and peeled it with his hands. His tail grasped a nearby branch to help him balance. He realized that was becoming much more comfortable in his new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad\u2019s gaze shifted to Bruce who had climbed up to be with his girl. It dawned on him that Bruce was the only one who was going to fuck him for the near future. His little romp was fun, but he didn\u2019t want to be some dirty monkey\u2019s mate for the rest of his life. He would much rather be having sex with his wife and not some... hairy beast with a... big... sexy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad\u2019s libido was kicking in again as he looked at Bruce in a different light. \u201cDamn it! A monkey is making me horny! Look at those muscles and that...\u201d, thought Brad as he tried to shake his head to get some sense back. \u201cWell, if I\u2019m stuck like this, I might as well have a little fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce looked completely uninterested in sex at the moment. Brad wasn\u2019t exactly sure how to get him in the mood. Foreplay wasn\u2019t really necessary earlier. \u201cWhat does a female monkey do to get their partner revved up? He assumed that Bruce found him attractive, but maybe it was just because he didn\u2019t have other options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad lowered his head down to Bruce\u2019s crotch and decided that he was all in. He played with Bruce\u2019s penis a little  until it began to expand, then wrapped his lips around it and began slowly sucking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there you have it. I have a monkey\u2019s dick in my mouth!\u201d, thought Brad as Bruce guided his head, helping him find a better rhythm. After a few minutes, Bruce repositioned Brad and climbed on top of him. \u201cI\u2019m quite literally screwed!\u201d, he thought as Bruce pushed into him.</span></div></div>",

He was a recent acquisition from a local science lab. He wasn\u2019t quite sure what they did to him during that time, but he assumed it was mild. Maybe they tested hair care products out on him. Karen worked at the zoo with the monkeys, and was rehabilitating \u201cBrenda\u201d and \u201cBruce\u201d, so they could become permanent additions to the zoo. But luckily, for Brad, that was far beyond his month long sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pretty early in the morning when Karen came out to the cage to speak to Brad. Brad had made his last notch on the bar yesterday and looked forward to being human again. He quietly rose and let Bruce sleep, giving him one last look before he climbed down to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was still having lots of sex, but was a little more discreet about it. He waited for moments when he knew he wouldn\u2019t be interrupted or immediately after Karen and Ben went out for date night. He was certain that Karen never caught him and Bruce in the act, at least after the week long grace period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Brenda. Today\u2019s the day, isn\u2019t it? I told you if you could keep Bruce\u2019s cock out of you, you could become your old self again. I have to admit that I\u2019m a little sad to give up this new life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded his head and anxiously awaited his release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing that I don\u2019t have to. You see, Ben had installed a camera last month to check up on how you and Bruce were adjusting to your new environment. It turns out that he\u2019s quite thorough with his notes and wrote detailed descriptions of every sexual encounter that you\u2019ve had over the past month. I have to admit that I\u2019m impressed by some of your more adventurous sessions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad\u2019s jaw practically hit the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo then, I\u2019ll be nice and not count the numerous times that you sucked his cock or jerked him off. By my count, you\u2019ll be Brenda for another 3 months. You\u2019ve been a busy little girl! I think we are both much happier for now. I also have a little surprise for you. You\u2019ve been cleared to become a part of my exhibit! I think you\u2019ll be quite popular with the other males. You\u2019ll have all the monkey cock that you want! They may even be able to quench that libido of yours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad stood there speechless. Well, actually chatterless would be a better description. He would have tried to plead for his humanity if he could But knew it was a useless action. He wished that he had picked up sign language when Karen as learning it a few years back. He couldn\u2019t believe that Karen knew what he did to Bruce or what he let Bruce do to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling defeated, he turned around and was about to climb back up to snuggle with Bruce when he felt a sting in his side. The last thing he remembered was looking down to see a bright red  tranquilizer dart sticking out of his side.</span></div></div>",

He looked over to see an agitated Bruce trying to escape his small claustrophobic confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy hello there Brenda!\u201d, said an sharply dressed older gentleman in a white lab coat and bow tie. He recognized the the man as Dr Resnick, the zoo\u2019s head veterinarian. \u201cI already have your blood work result. I have to say, you are in tip top shape. You\u2019ll only need to quarantine for another day or so, then we\u2019ll introduce you to your new family!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad could see his reflection in the metal side of the cage. It had been a while since he got a good look at his new body. He shifted around, trying to make a comfortable bed with his blankets. He thought about how he ended up in this situation. He never asked for this, but his curiosity got the better of him. As much as he wanted to be human again, he had to admit that it was a unique opportunity to spend some time as a different species. He wasn\u2019t very keen on living his entire life as a captive animal on display, but a few months could be a fun experience. He would not have any other of the stress that goes along with being human. He would just have to reduce the amount of sex that he wanted to have. He had already expected that his sentence would at least be doubled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren came in later that evening, closer to closing time. She looked around to make certain that nobody would overhear her talking to Brad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was so hard on you the other day. I have had time to think about things, and I think I may have over reacted a teensy bit.\u201d, said Karen with a rare apology. You\u2019ll still need to stay at the zoo for the next three months, but I\u2019m not going to concern myself with what you do during that time. You seem like you are enjoying your new body, and I figured that it\u2019s only fair. Ben and I haven\u2019t quite kept up with you and Bruce, but we\u2019re at least not far behind. I just want a bit more time to get him out of my system.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad perked up at this offer. With his restrictions removed, Brad thought he might actually come to enjoy the next three months. He nodded his head to show his support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren\u2019s look softened quite a bit as she looked at her husband. \u201cI\u2019ll be here most days, so I\u2019ll be able to keep an eye on you. We\u2019ll start sign language lessons next week after you\u2019ve adjusted to the group. Some of the your other companions already know enough words to have a conversation. It will be interesting to see if you can communicate with them on your own by signing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren jumped a little as she heard the door open. It was Dr. Resnick finishing up his evening rounds. \u201cAh, Karen! You\u2019ll be happy to know that Brenda here is in excellent health. It looks like Bruce has a little separation anxiety. His favorite girl\u2019s world is about to get a lot bigger. I think Bruce will have a tough time sharing her with the other males. It\u2019s not like he has much of a choice. He\u2019s a bit on the scrawny side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBruce isn\u2019t scrawny!\u201d, thought Brad. He tried to vocalize his displeasure with the Dr., but all that came out of his mouth were unintelligible screeching sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled at Brad and started walking to the door. \u201cI\u2019m sure they will both do just fine. It was great to see you Karen. Don\u2019t be a stranger and please give Brad my best. We were planning to play a round of golf at the club, but we haven\u2019t set a date. Tell him to give me a ring if he\u2019s free this week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will, but he\u2019s on a business trip for a few months. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be happy to join you when he gets back.\u201d, said Karen as she winked at Brad and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad tried to picture himself playing golf in his current body and chuckled to himself. Having nothing else to do, he lay down in his blankets and quickly drifted off to sleep. </span></div></div>",

What would the other monkeys think of him. Bruce has been his only companion for the last month and he wasn\u2019t really sure how a monkey should act. Not having the ability to communicate verbally may make things a lot more difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren chuckled a bit and gave Justin a gentle push. Go ahead Maggie. They won\u2019t bite, or at least they haven\u2019t done that in a few months!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin looked wide eyed for a moment then gave Karen a glare. He shuffled into the enclosure and heard the metal bars close with a thud. Well, he was now officially part of the exhibit. Kids would be showing up soon to gawk and make faces at him through the glass. Him and Bruce would give them a good show and spark an interesting conversation with their parents on the ride home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did Bruce head off to?\u201d, he thought as he climbed up a rope to get a better look. After a few minutes of scouting, he finally spotted Bruce at the far end of the enclosure. He had already made a friend. After a closer look, he noticed that friend was female. Justin felt a ping of jealousy as he looked closer and saw her grooming her mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin\u2019s rage calmed as fast as it started. \u201cMonkeys aren\u2019t monogamous after all.\u201d, he thought as he forced himself to look away. The idea of Bruce with another female had hit him harder than he thought. His human sensibilities were starting to return to him. He got comfortable in a nearby tire swing, not quite ready to mingle just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud screeching sound almost caused Justin to fall out of the swing. It looked like the alpha was putting a young male in his place. Bruce was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alpha climbed up on a platform nearby and looked Justin\u2019s direction. Justin pretended not to notice, bu the alpha barely took his eyes off of him. He tried to hide his eyes so he could take a close look at the alpha without being obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, he\u2019s strong!\u201d, admired Justin as he looked him over. He hasn\u2019t taken his eyes off of me for the last hour. Justin\u2019s stomach fluttered a little as he realized that he was the sexy new hottie in the group. His gaze shifted lower and got a look at his package as he shifted his weight. \u201cBig too!\u201d, he thought as his human mind tried to snap him out of his trance. \u201cWhat the hell am I doing!? I\u2019m swooning over some ape like a love struck teenager.\u201d His new admirer was a great distraction as he forgot all about Bruce.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Brad and I fell upon one of his Uncle\u2019s inventions. It\u2019s an amazing device, but I kind of accidentally used it on Brad.\u201d, she said hesitating for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God! Is Brad okay?!\u201d, said Brenda as she tried to peak in the slightly ajar door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat, Uh, depends on your definition of okay.\u201d, said Karen. \u201cBrad... Brenda\u2019s here. We\u2019re coming in, so don\u2019t be alarmed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren opened the door and the two sisters entered the room. Brad sat on the table, looking a bit embarrassed, covering up his nakedness as best as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA spider monkey?\u201d, said Brenda flatly. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to believe that Brad is now a spider monkey? Come on Sis, what have you been smoking? Also, where the hell did you find a spider monkey? He doesn\u2019t look like any of the ones from our zoo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaren pulled her sister over to the machine and started typing in a few parameters. Brenda accidentally stepped on the circle area and was caught off guard by the machine noise and bright light. \u201cGo ahead and tell Brad to do something. How about some math problems. Here Brad, she said as she handed him paper and pencil.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda sighed, but decided to play along. \u201cOkay, 2+8?\u201d, she said with her arms crossed. With some difficulty (Brad misses his thumbs) he scratched out 10 on the pad and showed it to Brenda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha... what?\u201d, she said, surprised. \u201c12 x 32?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad showed \u201c384\u201d after a moment or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda took a moment to calculate it herself to see the answer was correct. After several more requests, she turned back to Karen who had just finished her data entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s either the world\u2019s smartest monkey, or your niot making this up.\u201d, she said with wide eyed wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll need to show you a small demonstration before you\u2019ll be totally convinced.\u201d, said Karen as she walked toward the machine. Nothing as drastic as Brad, but enough to give you a demonstration.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the booth, Karen pressed the button to begin the process. The door window closed with a clank, causing Brenda to jump. After a brief passage of time, Karen stepped out of the machine, completely unchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive it a minute Sis. The changes were delayed for maximum effect. They are changes that I could live with if the machine can\u2019t reverse the process. Just as she finished her sentence, her breasts inflated a couple sizes, her hair turned blonde, and she lost a few pounds of weight, giving her a much different profile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda\u2019s jaw just about hit the floor. \u201cWow!\u201d, was all she could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. I should be able to change back after the required duration has passed. From what I read, simple changes don\u2019t take as much time. Both women looked at the screen. Brad won\u2019t be ready until tomorrow afternoon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda reaches out and pat Brad on the head. \u201cYou sure do make an adorable monkey! I would love to take you to the zoo for a short stay. Imagine all of the great research we accomplish with a faux monkey joining the group. Our understanding of their social hierarchy would be amazing if we had Brad....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren put a hand on her sister\u2019s shoulder. Easy now Sis. Brad\u2019s has enough trauma for one evening. If this proves to be stable, you could experience it yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda\u2019s smile broadened as she looked at Karen. \u201cCan I try?!\u201d</span></div></div>",

What were you thinking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve had back problems for years because of these breasts. How about shrinking them a few cups. And I\u2019d like to be blonde with straight hair. While you\u2019re at it, dropping a few dress sizes would be nice. Oh, and one last thing... I want to be a bit taller. Maybe another 4-5 inches? And let\u2019s try that age feature.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren triple checked the data and finally motioned her Sister into the Booth.

Karen set up the machine as Brad patiently waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn\u2019t look like you can reach the button, there Honey. I\u2019ll activate it for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a familiar sound, the door opened releasing a very human, and very relieved Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was interesting, but I\u2019m sure glad that I wasn\u2019t stuck like that.\u201d, said Brad as he adjusted to walking on two feet again. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad you didn\u2019t know sign language Karen, or we could have kept communicating. I\u2019ve had enough bananas for an evening. Let\u2019s go out and grab some burgers and fries. It\u2019s not like we have to watch what we eat now.\u201d, said Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSign language?\u201d, thought Brenda as an idea hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on at the diner....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda flirted with the guy a few booths down as the group waited for their food. She was really enjoying the extra attention she was getting in her temporary body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren leaned up against Brad, happy that her husband is safe and has rejoined the human race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was quite an experience.\u201d, said Brad. Now that I know it\u2019s not permanent, I would kind of like to try it again. I mean, I really didn\u2019t get to put my new body to the test. It would have been great to climb around a bit and get a better feel for what it would be like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda looked back at Brad and gave him a predatory smile. \u201cReally Brad? You know, I could make that happen. You also mentioned earlier that you know sign language. I\u2019d love to research a few theories of mine about primate socialization. If I had a willing participant, it would be a unique opportunity to be able to communicate with my test subject. I could learn a ton in as little as a few weeks, maybe a month?\u201d, said Brenda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Uh... I kind of...\u201d, stuttered Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should definitely do it Honey! I know how much you wanted to escape the house and have some fun. Besides, we have plenty of opportunities to try some other, more adventurous, ideas when you get back. As a reward, you can change me into anyone your heart desires. ANYTHING!\u201d, said Karen with a wink. Something that she whispered into Brad\u2019s ear got him excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus, just think of all that sex you\u2019re going to have!\u201d, said Brenda as Brad blushed a heavy crimson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda and Karen exchanges knowing glances while Brad pondered the situation. The last comment actually made his mind up. He was just delaying the decision so he didn\u2019t appear to eager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d, said Brad, trying to make it sound like a huge sacrifice. \u201cNot for a month, but 2 weeks should be plenty of time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda got up and hugged both Karen and Brad. \u201cYou two are the best!\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now you\u2019re going to have to spend a few days in quarantine and have a complete checkup.

So, Kimmie, what\u2019s in her charts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Doc, she seems in great health. It says she\u2019s going to be with us until construction is done on her home zoo. They are also hoping that one of the males will have some success mating with her so they can strengthen the gene pool at their smaller exhibit.\u201d, said Kimmie as she gave Brad a quick wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the examination was done and he was led back to his temporary home, the gravity of the situation finally weighed on Brad. He was now far away from anyone that he knew and was stuck as a young and fertile female monkey named Darla, until his sister-in-law took him home. If anything happened to his wife and her sister, he would most likely be stuck in this body for the rest of HER life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could now be honest with himself. If he didn\u2019t really want this, he could have had Karen stop it. He was still excited to spend time with the other monkeys. He decided that he\u2019s going to not worry and play the part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his mind wandered, a male monkey called to him from across the room, showing interest in the new female visitor. He looked at the male body and wondered what it would be like to have sex in this body. It didn\u2019t take him long to decide that he was going to have a go at it. Letting go of his human apprehensions helped him relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty hungry though.  wonder what kind of food they serve at this joint?\u201d, he thought as he relaxed in the small hammock attached to the cage walls and drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brad suddenly became nervous when they reached the exhibit. He was a little bit anxious about whether or not he would be welcomed into the group. He took a couple of deep breaths and tried to look calm, but Brenda could tell that he was worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarla, just relax and have fun. I\u2019ll be right here the whole time and will monitor your progress. I won\u2019t let anything bad happen to you!\u201d, said Brenda in a sincere tone. \u201cFor the next few weeks, you don\u2019t have any responsibilities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad steadied himself as Brenda opened the gate for him. \u201cBrenda is right. I may feel like an imposter, but there\u2019s no way anyone would see me as anything other than a monkey. Let\u2019s do this!\u201d, he thought as he entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the monkeys, a few at a time, came up to investigate their new roommate. One of the females approached him chattering and began to groom his fur. It didn\u2019t take long for the others to go back to their business of playing or lounging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad felt more at ease now that he was finally with the others. The female playfully tapped him and climbed a nearby tree, expecting him to give chase. Moments later, the two new friends were chasing each other through the exhibit. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be with someone my own size.\u201d, he thought as he caught up with his new friend and began to groom her. It was exhilarating to be free to climb and swing after being stuck in such confining spaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad spent most of the afternoon lounging in one of the higher hammocks, people watching as kids and adults kept cycling through the observation area. It was odd being on display, but after the first few hours, it didn\u2019t even phase him. In fact, he played to the crowd a few times, making faces at the children and getting laughs in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until late afternoon that one of the males approached Brad. They had been stealing glances at him throughout the day, but seemed shy. The curious male was only there for a moment before the alpha male  leapt in to chase him away. The alpha came over and sat right next to Brad and reached out his arm to touch him. Brad noticed a musty smell coming from the male that was hard to describe, but was unique and rather pleasant. The male kept moving closer and finally started to groom Brad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad began to feel warm and tingly, realizing what was going on. The male was interested in him as a mate. Brad\u2019s hormones were raging as he submitted to the male, enjoying the close contact. The male was sniffing Brad\u2019s body and it was obvious that he liked what he smelled. The caresses became a lot more intimate until Brad couldn\u2019t stand it any longer and reached down to rub his partner\u2019s semi erection, hoping that he would put it to good use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male reacted immediately once Brad presented his female sex. \u201cOh, fuck!\u201d, thought Brad as the male pushed into him and began thrusting. \u201cI\u2019m... really doing... oh my... it!\u201d, he thought as the pace intensified. Pleasure rocked his body as he tried to push his mate as deep as possible. When the first orgasm hit, he heard a large screeching sound, only to realize he was making that noise. It was unlike anything he had ever experienced. He only vaguely realized that he had an audience of kids pointing and snickering. A second orgasm hit him as he shuddered and continued to shriek making some intense noises. Finally, the male stopped and Brad felt him release his seed as he just about fainted from pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Just... WOW!\u201d, thought Brad as he started to catch his breath. The male reached in and cuddled his mate as she enjoyed her state of bliss. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t deny how amazing that was. I can\u2019t wait for round two.\u201d, he said as he made eye contact with Brenda sitting in an observation booth, smiling. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the next few hours, Brad enjoyed swinging around the enclosure. It was exciting to find out how agile his arms, legs and tail were. He tested out hanging upside down with his tail. It was like having a 5th extremity. He kept jumping from branch to branch putting on a show for the zoo customers. For some reason, it was a thrill to be on display. He originally thought being stuck in an enclosure would get boring. But there were plenty of trees to dangle from and lots of company. He quickly caught on to monkey etiquette and would pick bugs out from the others whenever they were relaxing. He was hesitant at first to follow along by eating them. But he soon found out the tiny snack had a nice taste. After all, he was the newcomer to the group. He wasn't sure how the rest of the spider monkeys had lived together. He was appreciative that things seemed to be going well. He already felt like he made his way up the social ladder after one of the males chose to mate with with the 'new girl.' Brad couldn't help but remember how amazing it was to have monkey sex. The sounds and shrieks that came out of his vocal chords added to the arousal. Noticing parents shielding their children's eyes behind the viewing window made it seem even more daring. When he agreed to become a spider monkey for research, he never imagined it would include extra curricular bonuses. With about 25 monkeys sharing the enclosure, there only seemed to be a few males. Brad was proud that one of them chose him for some afternoon fun. He felt like the mating ritual gave him jungle-cred among the other females. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wearing clothing was an odd sensation. Never had Brad been in public like this. Knowing none of the other monkeys were wearing anything made him feel better. There was no shame among the animal kingdom to have their unmentionables visible to each other. While taking a break on a branch to crew on a banana, Brad noticed a male swinging back and forth. It was hard not to see his manly parts slamming around. The male sat and his monkey balls seemed to be painfully squished. Brad winced thinking how much easier it seemed to swing and play around with a female monkey body instead. He looked down smirking at his monkey vagina and was glad he didn't have to deal with being a naked male all the time. Their parts seemed rather bothersome without any clothing to keep them under control. He was fortunate Brenda turned him into a female monkey so he didn't have to worry about things like that. Going to the bathroom in public was another odd thing to get used to. The first time he had to go, Brad self-consciously went into a corner to squat for some privacy. However, after a few hours of swinging around the enclosure, he figured out the others didn't care. They would go wherever they were at the time. He'd have to make sure he wasn't underneath another monkey in a tree when nature called. There weren't any showers in the enclosure. Only a tiny fake pond that where he and the rest of them would stop for a drink. His human mind hoped that wasn't where they bathed. He didn't feel like drinking dirty monkey water if he got thirsty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad heard a commotion and noticed most of the females starting to make ooh oohs and ah ahs. He swung closer to see what was going on. Two males were squaring off for a fight. Brad followed suit with the other females and cheered them on. The two males began squirming, hitting and biting one another. It was obvious they were battling out the enclosure for alpha-male status. Brad noticed how familiar one of them looked and thought, \"Cool. That's the one who screwed me earlier! I hope he wins!\" Brad giggled to himself knowing his social status might rise a few notches if the other females remembered who the potential alpha-male chose for a mate earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight didn't take long. A few punches, kicks and wrestling moves caused slight damage to both participants. But after a few dominance maneuvers, the weaker opponent submitted. Brad let out an excited squeal and started clapping thinking, \"Yay! He won!\" His claps caught a strange glare from a few nearby females. Brad promptly stopped his human like celebration thinking, \"Oops. Monkeys don't clap!\" He played it off by hitting the tree hard and stomping his feet like the others while the new alpha male gave his own sort of celebration. The victor patted his chest hard announcing to the group that he had taken over. It immediately caught the attention of the females who seemed to be flocking towards the new alpha male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad swung his way through the crowd thinking, \"Step aside ladies!\" He managed to confront the new alpha first and started patting and rubbing his arms as if he was a band groupie. The male was still coming off an adrenaline high from the fight and let out celebratory chants and groans. His musky scent seemed more alluring now that he was sweaty from battle. He obviously wanted to show the group that he was now the dominate male. Other females had swarmed around. He had his pick of the litter now. Brad tried his best to look 'available' among the other groupies. Now among a swarming herd of eager females vying for the alpha's attention, Brad slipped behind him. He had no idea how monkey's flirted but figured a bold move would help separate him from the crowd. He reached around and stroked the alpha's penis watching it get erect thinking, \"That should do the trick!\" He juggled his balls around while the swarm of females were close.  To his surprise, the new alpha male looked down and thought it was a different monkey who offered the hand job. He scooped up another female and carried her off. She seemed to be gloating to the rest of the lady-monkeys that she won his affection. Brad crossed his arms in a human like fashion thinking, \"That little bitch! She stole my man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe groupies disseminated while the new alpha male started pounding away at the lucky female. Brad swung up high to a branch watching on and sulking. The female was enjoying the attention and let out mating shrieks and moans. Brad sighed jealously, \"That should have been ME!\" To make matters worse, when the female was done submitting she didn't even bask in the moment. She quickly swung off while a spider monkey baby took it's spot on her back while she tended to motherly duties. Brad groaned, \"She must have JUST had that baby and now she's hogging the new alpha male's attention? What a little monkey slut! She already has a kid while some us females around here don't have ANY yet!\" Brad's animal hormones were taking over. He watched the 'monkey slut' play with her baby and wished he had one of his own to tend to. He knew if he got pregnant with the alpha male's children that it would move him up the social ladder even further. He remembered how amazing it felt to be screwed earlier. Now that his former mate was the alpha male, it made him even more enticing. Brad began to form a plan wondering how to get the alpha's attention if he was going to have a chance to submit to him again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the zoo enclosure door opening snapped Brad out of his daydream. He looked over to see Brenda and a few other zoo employees setting out food. Seeing humans inside the animal dwelling made Brad think clearer, \"OMG? Am I really jealous of another female monkey? Whoa?! My new instincts really seem to take over in here!\" He quivered at the thought of being a pregnant monkey. He had no idea how long the gestation period was but knew it would extend his time significantly living in the enclosure if he got knocked up. He was doing this little experiment for Brenda's research. He laughed at how silly it was to be jealous of the monkey slut. This was really her home. Brad was just a visitor for a few weeks to help Brenda. He swung over to Brenda and signed, \"Hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda signed back while saying, \"Hi Darla. I hope you are hungry. t's time for a training session. You'll earn tons of bananas if you perform good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad playfully jumped up on Brenda's shoulder like he'd done for a free ride before. To his surprise, Brenda pulled out a travel cage and set it on the ground, \"Sorry about this Darla. But it's zoo protocol while transferring animals.\" Brad was a bit demeaned to be locked in such a small cage but knew it was necessary. They didn't need to raise any suspicion with the other zoo employees to why Brenda was treating this spider monkey different. Brenda carried Brad through a secret door in the enclosure. She began to explain, \"It's crunch time Darla. You gotta make me look good. My future funding and promotion depends on it. My boss and investors will be there to watch. We will just do easy stuff. We can't make it look like you are a genius. Don't try to act too smart. Just follow my lead and make a few small mistakes so you seem like a normal monkey. I'm telling you Darla...your performance is going to make or break my career! Please don't let me down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded and signed back, \"Okay. I'll do my best.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda smiled, \"Good. Karen wanted me to say hi for her. She misses you but can't wait to find out how exciting your spider monkey adventure has been.\" Brenda thought for a moment and suggested, \"The zoo closes early on Sunday. Maybe I could sneak you home for a night so you can spend some time with your wife.\" Brad nodded at the offer. It would be nice to see Karen for a while. Brenda reminded her transformed brother-in-law, \"...However...You'd have to stay in character. There's NO using the transformation booth while you are at home. You'll have to stay a spider monkey for the duration of your visit. I wouldn't want you to have any second thoughts about my star test subject not coming back to the zoo to help finish my research.\" Brenda seemed excited as they arrived, \"Okay Darla. You better be on your best behavior! My job depends on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded as he saw where they were going. It was......</span></div></div>",

Brad slowly walked into the area nervously as he tried hype himself up for the crazy adventure he was about to undertake for the sake of adventure and science.  Brenda could see the newest addition to her zoo (aka her brother-in-law) was a bit nervous but she couldn't exactly be seen giving an in depth prep talk to a monkey so she simply put on a smile and whispered, \"Good luck,\" and closed Brad into his new home.  Brad instinctively gave a thumbs up before quickly putting the thumb away as he mentally reminded himself to act like a monkey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how was a monkey supposed to act?  Brad cursed himself for not trying to pay more attention to the nature videos Brenda tried to show him.  '<i>Well, if I just acted like a normal monkey it wouldn't really teach us anything in this experiment so maybe it's good I didn't pay attention.</i>'. Brad thought to himself as he looked at his surroundings.  He could a few monkeys out and about, but it wasn't until he looked up that Brad saw another 15-20 monkey's in the trees above.  Most of them had seemed to have stopped what they were doing to observe the new female that had entered their territory.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Guess I should introduce myself.</i>'. Brad thought as he approached a tree.  He tried to wrap his arms around the tree base but once that was done Brad found himself at a stand still.  '<i>Ok, how the heck do I climb a tree?</i>'. Brad may have been a bit outdoorsy for an amateur inventor but tree climbing was not something he'd done before.  Feeling a bunch of eyes on him Brad quickly looked around for another monkey he could try to copy the technique of.  And sure enough on a tree to his left a female monkey had started climbing.  Brad let go of his tree and grabbed her's and looked up and tried his best to copy her techniques.  It was a lot slower, but Brad was making progress, he'd probably gotten about ten feet off the ground when the lady monkey Brad was following stopped, rotated 180 degrees on the tree so she was facing Brad face to face and let out an irritated bark like sound.  The noise unsettled Brad so much he actually lost his grip and began to fall to Earth when some instinct took over and Brad wrapped his long tail around a branch and saved himself.  After almost hyperventilating, Brad pulled himself up on his branch and looked at the monkey that just scared him, who had has now christened Lilith.  Lilith once again bared her teeth at Brad and let out a primal yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>All right, so far so good.</i>'. Brad thought sarcastically as he looked at his new 'friend' and all the judging eyes above him and decided what he needed to do now.</span></div></div>",

'<i>Ok, you don't want to hang out with me, then I don't want to hang out with you either.</i>'. Brad thought as he stuck his tongue out at tree monkey game and flipped them a finger in a rude gesture that would probably be more insulting if done to a human.  Brad walked around the spider monkey enclosure familiarizing himself with some of the plants in an effort to find a monkey to socialize with since that was the whole point of this thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad finally decided to approach a lone monkey that was crouching down by the artificial creek the zoo provided.  He got within a few feet of the monkey before it looked up at Brad, not wanting to make any sudden movements and risk getting shanked with a banana or something, Brad slowly and deliberately walked up to the loner.  But the crouching monkey didn't seem to actively hate Brad which was a good change of pace, but he wasn't super friendly either, he just turned to himself and picked at the dirt.  Brad decided to try to be more active and made a few soft and encouraging \"Oooh\"s and \"Aiii\"s as though to say, \"What's up buddy?\"  But as Brad approached he soon realized why this monkey might have been alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad let out a small gasp as he saw that the monkey seemed to have gotten into a fight with probably the tree group.  He had open bleeding wounds on different parts of his body and one of his long fingers on his right hand was most definitely broken.  <i>Jesus, if I had half those injuries I'd have gone crying to Brenda and you're just over here acting like a cool loner badass.  Well Fonz, let's try to get you some help.</i>. Brad was about to leave his newly named friend to try to go and wave down Brenda or some other vet to help Fonz out.  But then remembered his situation.  '<i>Damn, I can't exactly ask for help and I doubt that a monkey would whine to a human or else Fonz here would have done it already probably.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked around as the wooded compound as though hoping to find a first aid kit with bandaids and a brace, but then thought to himself, '<i>What am I doing?  I've got human intelligence, I might as well use it, plus I've seen enough tv to figure out something I can do.</i>'. And so Brad began to scavenge.  He looked around ground level for some strong sticks, vines, and long grass.  Once he found what he wanted he went up to Fonz again.  '<i>Ok new best friend, let's help you out.</i>'. And using the fresh water pumped in from the creek, Brad began to clean Fonz's wounds.  The monkey was a little hesitant at first, but soon Fonz began to enjoy the cleaning from the female.  Brad even picked some of the bugs that were starting to make homes in Fonz's wounds.  And Fonz helped out by disposing of the bugs with his mouth as he picked them right out of Brad's fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I don't think I've ever even fed my wife like this.'</i>. Brad thought with a chuckle as he put on some make shift bandaids with grass.  '<i>Better than an open wound...I think.</i>'. And finally Brad got to the big one, he gently grabbed Fonz's paw with the broken finger and tried to say some gentle, \"Hmmm\"s to comfort Fonz because this was going to suck.  Brad got the finger and with some vines and strong short sticks he made a makeshift splint.  Brad expected Fonz to run off or maybe even attack, but it turns out when clean someone you let someone eat from your hand they tend to trust you a little in the spider monkey world.</span></div></div>",

Well, I guess I\u2019m stuck like this until someone changes me back, so I\u2019m no longer a member of the human race. My DNA is 100% spider monkey.\u201d, thought Brad as Fonz continued cleaning. \u201cMmmm... That feels good. I\u2019m grateful to finally make a friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was so engrossed in his cleaning, that he hadn\u2019t noticed another male approaching them. The intruder suddenly screeched as he ran right at Brad, ready to attack. Fonz\u2019s lightning fast reflexes saved him from certain injury as he punched the aggressive monkey right in the face with his good hand. The monkey screeched as he retreated to the other end of the exhibit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad held tightly to Fonz, terrified of another attack. It was Fonz\u2019s turn to calm Brad as he held his face close to Brad, making reassuring noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad noticed a little more confidence and swagger to Fonz\u2019s movements. \u201cI need to hang close to him. He probably upped his social status with his victory.\u201d, thought Brad as he held Fonz closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFonz responded the way any male monkey might when having an eligible female hanging onto him so affectionately. Brad felt something push into his right thigh. It was Fonz\u2019s erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad froze as he realized that he was the reason for Fonz\u2019s current reaction. \u201cWell, that\u2019s the only way to reward him for his bravery. He might lose interest in me if I don\u2019t reciprocate.\u201d, thought Brad as he tried to justify his decision to have sex. Deep down, he was curious, but too ashamed to admit it to himself. His female body was taking in Fonz\u2019s wonderful scent and he wanted relief. \u201cYeah, for my protection I have to do this. I don\u2019t have much choice in the matter.\u201d, he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad, reached down and felt Fonz\u2019s cock and seductively caressed it with a light touch. Gripping Fonz\u2019s shoulders, he took a deep breath and lowered himself on Fonz\u2019s rock hard erection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA screech of pleasure forced its way from Brad\u2019s lips as Fonz filled him. He looked into his mate\u2019s eyes as he slid up and down, slowly quickening his pace..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOHHHH... Fuuuuuuuck that feels good!\u201d, thought Brad as he abandoned any remaining inhibitions. Fonz, pulled out and turned Brad around to fuck him doggy style. He could feel his mate\u2019s balls smacking against his ass as he continued to pound into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Brad\u2019s third orgasm, Fonz finished, filling him with his seed and slowing his pace, eventually pulling out of his horny partner. Brad, after regaining his composure, reclined next to Fonz, running his fingers through the male monkey\u2019s hair. The two spent the next several hours cuddling and fucking. </span></div></div>",

The patrons left, the workers trickled out of the zoo, and the sun went down as the clouds began to form.  Brad looked up and saw the black clouds looking very angry as thunder began to crack open the sky letting the rain poor down.  Brad looked around and saw that the few other ground level monkey's had made their way up in the the tree canopies.  But after his earlier experience both with tree climbing and the tree spider monkey crew Brad thought it would be best to stay on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFonz however didn't seem to feel this way, he seemed to be trying to indicate to Brad that he wanted to go to the trees but Brad held onto Fonz's non injured hand and shook his hand.  Brad couldn't believe he was trying to get a monkey to hang out with him for the night, but he wanted Fonz around for safety and although he might not want to admit it, comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked around ground level and saw a mini artificial cave.  He dragged Fonz into it, but once he got there he seemed pleased.  Fonz lied down against the back wall of the cave and held Brad close.  Brad looked out the moonlit opening of the cave and smelled the rain in the air as he leaned agains the warm body of Fonz.  <i>'This is actually kind of...weirdly romantic.  Thanks for the idea Fonz, I'll have to do with with Karen when I turn back.'</i>. Brad thought to himself as he closed his eyes and dug his head into the hairy chest of Fonz before drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n_______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Darla, wake up.  Darla.\"  Brad could vaguely hear a voice calling out for someone but he wanted five more minutes.  Finally a voice whispered into his ear, \"<i>HEY BRAD!</i>\".   \"Oooaahk?!\"  Brad said as he finally opened his eyes and saw the large human face of Brenda before him.  \"You've been asleep a bit longer than the other spider monkey's and I didn't want to you stick out over something you aren't consciously doing.  How was your first day, from the security footage I saw you already made yourself a special little friend.\"  Brenda said with a smile.  Brad was about to sign back an answer before he stopped himself to look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about anyone seeing us, this little cave you settled down in is actually a good place for us to talk.  No cameras in here and it's out of sight of the public.\"  Knowing he could speak, or at least sign his mind, Brad told Brenda about his day.  It took a while to get the message across but he told Brenda everything who tried to keep a very neutral face and wrote down some notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating.\"  Brenda said closing her notepad, \"Well day one down, two weeks to go.  I can't wait to watch what happens.  Oh, and have a treat, I figured you were having a hard time transitioning into eating bugs off your partner.  Don't worry, all the monkey's get them,\"  Brenda said as she dropped some pre cut fruit at Brad's feet who immediately dug in as he wondered what the new day would bring.</span></div></div>",

He went slow at first, but by mid day, was swinging through the trees like a pro. His new found confidence also helped his social status and he didn\u2019t feel like he needed to depend on Fonz for protection quite so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad carefully approached a group of females who were helping one of the Moms with her baby. The baby approached Brad curiously, and caught him off guard when he jumped playfully on his back. The other females seemed to approve and relaxed a bit as Brad took his turn playing with the baby. He was happy to collect a few more friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was relaxing in a tire swing, close to his new friends, when he spied Fonz and another female having sex. He was surprised at his own reaction of jealousy, but chose not to interfere. It seems like Fonz\u2019s confidence boost was noticed by the some of the other females and other females found him a bit more charming. The loser of yesterday\u2019s fight was having the exact opposite reaction, which pleased Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad had hoped that Fonz would approach him again in the evening, but his new rival seemed to be monopolizing his time. He started looking around the cage and noticed that the alpha male was looking at him curiously. He seemed to remember the staff referring to the alpha as Simon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad had admired the male from a distance, but was Intimidated by the leader of the group. \u201cDamn, this body is having one hell of an effect on my mind!\u201d, he thought. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of his attractive male body. \u201cI\u2019m sitting here admiring how sexy Simon is and the thought of him liking me back is giving me butterflies. These hormones are just too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Brad decided that he was going to Make his move (for science of course). And cautiously approached the male sitting alone in the tree. Simon\u2019s body language told Brad that he was accepting visitors, so he climbed closer to him. Simon looked like he was feigning disinterest to get \u201cDarla\u201d to work harder for his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlaying hard to get? I bet you won\u2019t forget this any time soon.\u201d, thought Brad as he lowered his head toward Simon\u2019s crotch. He advanced slowly, licking the male\u2019s penis until he was sporting a very large erection. Then, before Brad changed his mind, began giving Simon a blow job.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad certainly had the big male\u2019s attention now and could hear him respond as he continued to bob his head up and down. Now that he had his attention, he removed his mouth to look up at Simon. Simon embraced the forward female and helped lower her onto his erection. The tempo increased as Brad found himself involuntarily screaming from the pleasure that he was receiving. It didn\u2019t take long before Simon finished and pushed his back against the tree, panting heavily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraf  looked smugly down at Fonz as the alpha embraced him tightly, obviously taken with Brad\u2019s female form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been one week since this experiment had begun and Brad was the queen of jungle.  Not only was he the new favorite of Simon the alpha male, apparently being the alpha female of this group meant Brad had his pick of the males.  Every time Brad finished off one monkey another would be in line.  But Brad wasn't complaining, sex as a female spider monkey was a lot more enjoyable than he ever would have thought.  Not only was the sex very enjoyable, but Brad hadn't forgotten how some of the females had mistreated him on his first night.  Brad had started to get in the habit of actively stealing the mates from any female he decided wronged him.  After all, he had over 20 years of porn watching experience for original ideas and he also knew first hand just how to please a man.  Brad looked down from the trees and observed his domain where he ruled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it seemed there was an intruder in the kingdom.  Brad noticed Brenda had come into the exhibit and was looking right at him.  'Guess she wants me to check in, see you later Simon.' And Brad gave a goodbye caress to Simon's shaft to tease him a bit and Brad swung down to the cave where he and Brenda could communicate freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda put some fruit on the ground that Brad immediately dug into.  \"Got those especially for you, eat up.  After all I've seen that you've been using a lot of energy.\"  Brenda said in as monotone voice as possibly to be as objective about Brad's choices as possible.  After shoving a banana down his throat Brad signed, \"What else is there for me to do?  Throw poop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do whatever you want, but I have to inform you that your choices are causing you to stand out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad gave a laughing \"Ook,\" before signing, \"I can't help it if I'm the best at what I do, besides I usually wait until the kids aren't watching before I do my thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something I'm sure all parents are grateful for, but my co-workers have taken notice of you and I'm afraid action has to be taken.  I'm very sorry about what I just did to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was about to sign, \"What exactly did you do.\"  But suddenly Brad's arms felt very heavy.  Brad felt himself slumping to cave floor.  'She drugged me!  Brenda just drugged me!  What the hell!\"  Brad thought as Brenda bent down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have to do this if you hadn't been so...over the top with your actions.  Another worker was scheduled to do this, but I thought it would be better for you if it came from me so I can explain what I'm doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Brad couldn't sign, he just had to use his eyes to try to ask, 'What ARE you doing to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda seemed to understand what Brad was asking and she explained why Brad had to be drugged.</span></div></div>",

It's not <i>that</i> bad.  It was just a tranquilizer. It's harmless.  You'll wake up in about 5 hours.  It's protocol when transferring animals to another zoo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was alert but paralyzed.  He was slowly slipping into a slumber.  Brenda continued, \"We don't have much time.  You'll lose consciousness in a few seconds.  I'll try to explain fast!\"  Brenda went on to tell Brad the bad news.  The zoo that 'Darla' supposedly was transferred from for a typical monkey exchange program went belly up.  Due to the economy, the zoo went out of business and sold off their spider monkey exhibit to a different zoo across the country.  Since 'Darla' was originally from that zoo, she was included in the  business transaction. An animal moving company would be loading Darla and other animals on loan from the zoo to relocate them to their new home.  It was a normal animal transfer process that zoos dealt with all the time.  However, due to the low population of spider monkeys and the risk of theft, it was required to install GPS trackers on all the animals.  With a sorrowful expression, she told Brad, \"...By the way...you are going to be chipped.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad couldn't move but he knew what that meant.  He knew lots of pet dogs and cats were chipped so their owners could locate them.  He volunteered to become a spider monkey to help Brenda with her experiment that was ONLY supposed to last until this weekend.  Brenda was going to sneak 'Darla' out of the zoo and bring her home to use the transformation booth so Brad could return to his human life.  Now that wasn't possible.  Once Brad was chipped, Brenda wouldn't be able to sneak him away without alarms going off everywhere.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was almost completely out of it as Brenda kept explaining, \"There's nothing we can do right now but play along.  You'll be transferred to a new zoo and in the meantime your wife and I will figure out a plan to rescue you.  Just remember to....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad conked out.  When he awoke, he was inside a small cage in the baggage compartment of an airplane.  He tugged hard on the bars to no avail.  There were stacks of other spider monkeys in cages along with tons of other animals.  He had no idea where he was going.  He noticed a new scar on his leg that must have been where they inserted the GPS chip tracking device.  During his time at the local zoo by his home, Brad didn't mind that he was stuck as a spider monkey.  He knew it was temporary and he was helping out Brenda with her research.  However, now that he was among countless real other animals being transported across the country, he couldn't help but realize he was nothing more than a member of a common zoo exhibit now.  He had no idea when Brenda or his wife would come to his rescue.  For now, he'd have to tough it out as 'Darla.'</span></div></div>",

He decided to slip into character and rose through the ranks.  It didn't take long to earn his way up towards becoming the alpha-female.  From his prior zoo experience, he knew that monkeys were easily pleased.  The old fashioned '<i>hand-job</i>' didn't exist in the animal kingdom.  REAL spider monkey females never did it to their mates.  Using his human brain, Brad became an instant star with his knowledge on how to jerk off the male monkeys.  It scored him huge points.  The males all protected 'Darla' and eagerly looked forward to their next orgasm by hand job.  'Darla' quickly found herself moving up fast towards the top of the hierarchy as the alpha-female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just like their homo sapien relatives, spider monkey females had the ability to learn fast.  It didn't take long before other females were dolling out hand-jobs to the males.  Brad knew it was time to step-up his game or he'd lose his cherished position as the alpha-female.  He made sure the exhibit was closed for the evening so no humans would witness the act.  He approached the alpha-male and got on his knees.  He opened his girl monkey-lips and engulfed the alpha's penis.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the alpha male was confused at the offering.  He squirmed back and forth wondering what was going on.  However, he quickly realized how good it felt and let the female do her mouth trick.  Brad closed his eyes while sucking the alpha-male's cock.  He knew the act was necessary to maintain his position among the group.  He choked a few times but managed to swallow the alpha's load as it shot into his mouth.  The next thing Brad knew, he was surrounded by other males eager to experience this new mouth trick.  None of them had ever seen or received a blow job before.  Brad was backed into a corner of the exhibit surrounded by a pack of horny males.  He rolled his eyes thinking, \"Damn...the things a girl has to do to survive these days....\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad spent the next hour handing out blow jobs to all the males that lined up patiently waiting their turn.  After swallowing each one, he barely had time to think before the next one presented their monkey penis.  His jaw was sore but he kept on sucking.  Brad knew his his hard work would pay off.  He was now most popular female in the exhibit.  It was a comforting feeling to be protected by so many males.  There was no doubt he was the alpha-female among his competitors.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After successfully blowing his way to the top of the monkey hierarchy, Brad spent the next few weeks adjusting to the new zoo.  Now that he had the protection of every male in the enclosure, he didn't need to worry about other females coming in for attacks.  Similar to human females, monkey girls could be evil and vindictive.  They were all jealous of the alpha-female and constantly tried to come up with plans to overtake her thrown.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad enjoyed performing for crowds.  It was the only way he could spend time out of the monkey exhibit.  He proved to be a tame monkey and was trusted to mingle with the crowd during special demonstrations.  During school field trips he was brought out to take pictures with the children and would crawl up on their shoulders.  'Darla' was becoming quite the attraction for avid zoo-goers.  She was the only monkey who was trusted to keep her cool and playfully pounce around with humans.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad excitedly stood at the viewing window when he saw a group of kids coming up for a show.  Brenda attached a leash to his neck and escorted 'Darla' outside the monkey enclosure to work the crowd.  Brad loved jumping around an crawling on shoulders as he entertained the 2nd grade class.  'Darla' posed for tons of pictures while the kids laughed and clapped.  Eventually, their teacher told all the children it was time to see the elephants and they formed a single file line to the next animal exhibit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of escorting 'Darla' back to the  monkey enclosure, Brenda allowed her star performer to stay out longer.  Brad was surprised to see the last 4 children eluded the eyes of the teacher and sneaked back.  A little boy smiled and ran up.  Brad noticed how much he looked like the neighbor boy that lived next door.  The little boy smiled, \"It's so good to see you honey.  I'm sorry it took so long to help you escape!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda could tell Brad was confused and explained to her monkey companion, 'That's your wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was shocked to see Karen inside the body of a 7 year old boy.  He offered his arms out and the two embraced in a hug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little girl wandered up tugging on her dress uncomfortably and rolled her eyes, \"Enough with the reunion.  I gotta get out of these tights!  The sooner we finish this operation...the sooner I get my dick back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren explained to Brad, \"That's your friend Rick. Since you've been gone we've introduced the transformation booth to a few close friends.  We needed some help to come up with a plan to break you out of here.\"  Brad realized he'd seen Rick's disguise before.  He snickered seeing his friend in a copy of his own daughter's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother little boy ran up smiling.  Brad recognized the disguise as one of his friend's sons, \"Hey buddy! It's me..Thomas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad waved hello to his old college roommate.  He was glad to learn his closest friends were willing to bail him out of the zoo. Apparently they used the transformation booth to become copies of their own children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last child that broke away from the field trip came walking up.  Brad noticed the girl's striking resemblance to his friend's daughter.  With her long red hair and freckles, the girl waved, \"Hey dude.  It's me...Kevin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was impressed with all of his friend's willingness to help him break out of the zoo.  After giving everybody hugs, Karen explained, 'We don't have much time.\"  She told her monkey husband that the only way to get 'Darla' off the zoo property without the GPS tracker setting off an alarm was to cause a different zoo alarm system to activate.  She pointed to Brad's friends who willingly volunteered to help, \"That's why they took their children's places today.  Their teacher is going to notice they are missing soon.  An alarm will go off and all zoo employees will start to look for the missing kids.  Meanwhile, your GPS tracker alarm won't be as loud.  Nobody will notice that \"Darla' sneaked away. Once you are a safe distance away, we will cut the GPS tracker out of your skin and rush you home to use the transformation booth.  With any luck, your days as a monkey will be over soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren instructed to Kevin and Rick, \"Okay girls.  You two run that way!\"  Karen told Thomas, \"You run that way!  Try to hide so your teacher and the zoo staff have to spend lots of time finding you.  The alarm wont' shut off until you are found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin raised his hand, \"Is this a bad time to tell you that I need to use the little girl's room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren glared, \"I told you to go before we got here!  Ugh. Never mind.  We are running out of time!  Just run THAT way and you'll come across a bathroom.  You can hide in there and sit down to pee while you're at it.\"  Kevin ran off his as his daughter's pig tails hit the sides of his head.  Rick and Thomas ran the other way in attempts to elude the teacher. Karen ran off in a different direction.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike clockwork, an alarm began to blare.  The teacher finally noticed she was missing a few of her students and alerted the zoo authorities.  Brenda picked up Brad and carried him to an emergency exit while chaos ensued at the zoo. Nobody noticed they were suddenly missing a spider monkey.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A second set of alarms went off after Brad passed a checkpoint, but thankfully the plan seemed to have worked and nobody noticed.  Brenda looked around and dragged Brad out of the zoo and into a conveniently parked van.  They climbed in and Brenda reached into her pocket and pulled out something metallic and mean looking, \"Brad, I'm sorry we don't have time for an anesthetic and we need to get the tracker under your skin out.  Please bite down on the jacket so you don't scream too loud.\"  Brad decided he didn't want to look at the metal sharp looking tool and did as he was told.  Soon Brad felt a cut in his upper back area, he let out low \"Uhh\"s and 'Ook's every now and then but was able to keep relatively quiet as he felt Brenda's fingers digging into his flesh.  After a few minutes of surgery Brenda let out a very satisfied, \"Got it,\"  And with a satisfying crunch Brad heard the troublesome tracker break into a million pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad let out a cheer of joy as he tried to jump into the drivers seat of the van to make the final escape.  But Brenda grabbed him, \"NO, I'm not letting the fugitive monkey drive the get away vehicle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but it'd be cool.\"  A young voice said behind Brad.  He turned to see 4 children had just climbed into the back of the van.  Kevin continued, \"Think of it, a monkey driving, that'd be the perfect way for this insanity to end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we did that Brenda goes to jail, Brad goes back to monkeyville, and we end up in some juvie boot camp where we'll never change back.\"  Rick said trying to sound intimidating with pigtails and failing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous Rick,\"  Karen added, \"The four of us would just get a slap on the wrist...but I'd probably keep us kids out of spite for failing to save my husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even joke about that Kar...wait, is the Brad's monkey blood on the floor?  Dude, get that away from me.  If I get blood on this dress my wife will kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll probably just ground you for a week.\"  Karen joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe friends all laughed and joked as Brenda drove them back to Brad and Karen's where Brad was the lucky first transformer.  After 2 long months of being Darla the spider monkey, Brad the man (with some added inches in more ways than one) emerged.  \"At last!  I can speak again!  I can pee standing up again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I notice you didn't mention 'make love to your wife again' on your happy little list.\"  Karen said with her little boy arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that was just understood.\"  Brad said covering his flub.  Her looked at all his friends and continued, \"Guys, I can't thank you enough.  Without you guys I'd have been stuck in a freaking zoo giving out hand jobs and blow jobs to monkeys for the rest of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually you probably would have eventually felt your world crashing in on you as you accepted your new identity of Darla and eventually would have begun giving birth to your own spider monkey children as the matriarch of the colony.\"  Brenda said rather analytically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward pause before Rick said, \"On that happy note, I think I'd like my penis back thank you very much.\"  After a few minutes all of Brad's college buds were dudes again and Brad was giving them all hearty handshakes.  \"Guys, I swear after what you just did for me I owe each of you big.  You need a favor no matter how big or crazy I'll be there.  And with the Transformation Booth it could be just about anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the guys looked at each other and smiled,  Thomas added, \"We'll probably take you up on that off, but for now I think we need to leave.  I have a feeling Karen wants some alone time with you.\"  As Thomas, Rick, Kevin, and Brenda left, Brad turned just in time to see his wife jump into his arms and plant a big sloppy kiss on his face.  Brad fell back into the machine as he began to drop his pants down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show me your wild monkey ways 'Darla'.\"  Karen said as she helped her husband undress.  \"Well, you're not as hairy as my last few dozen partners, but I think you'll do.\"  Brad smiled as he shut the booth door for the added privacy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been one month since Darla the spider monkey had finally turned back into Brad the man and he was enjoying his humanity to the fullest.  He was enjoying all the little things he'd taken for granted before, like using the toilet, eat food that wasn't bugs or day old cut fruit, and not having to give out blowjobs to prevent yourself from being ostracized or attacked.  Brad was making good use of the enhancements to his body his wife had given him.  Not only was he making sure he satisfied her needs, but he was getting a lot more work done around the farm with his increased muscles and stamina.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day after working hard on a new section of fencing, Brad entered the house to find a lovely blonde woman in a stereotypical French maid's outfit.  \"Bonjour, que puis-je obtenir pour vous monsieur?\"  She said as she held out a glass of lemonade for Brad.  Brad smiled, even though he hadn't touched the transformation booth since the Darla incident that had not stopped Karen from using it just about every day.  Sometimes to experience animal life on the ranch, sometimes to man up and help with the grunt work, but Brad's favorite was when Karen turned into something for bedroom role-play purposes, and unless some French girl got very lost, that's what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lookie what we've got here, the place looks filthy, I'll just have to take you to the bedroom to punish you.\"  Brad said with a smile as he took the lemonade and downed it.  But Karen just looked at Brad with wide eyed confusion, \"Quelle?\"  She asked sounding confused and Brad had to take a minute to connect the dots but when he did he let out a laugh.  \"You actually turned into a French maid, do you even understand what I'm saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arr\u00eater de rire! Ce n'est pas ... si dr\u00f4le. Ok c'est mais arr\u00eate \u00e7a!\"  Karen said as she stamped her high heeled foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't speak French...but I think I know a language you can understand well enough.\"  Brad said as he approached his wife and picked her up like she was weightless and kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled and kissed her husband back and happily said, \"Nous pouvons me changer plus tard. Maintenant, emm\u00e8ne-moi, oh grand Am\u00e9ricain fort.\"  She didn't seem to Brad to be in a rush to change back yet.<br>\r\n____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning after a night to remember, Brad did his usual duties of checking the computer for the news and his emails.  He was glad to see the world hadn't blown itself up yet, so that was a plus.  But Brad suddenly felt his heart sink just a little bit when he read the headline of an email one of his old college buddies had sent him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><i>Brad!!  I need help, I'm calling in my favor.</i></b>. Brad opened up and read the email and knew that his streak of not using the transformation booth was about to end when he saw what was being requested of him.</span></div></div>",

Sorry to spring this on you like this, but I need to call in my favor.  You see, Natasha is back in town and...</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more.\"  Brad said with a groan.  He hated Rick's ex wife Natasha.  Rick hated Natasha.  Hell everyone Brad knew hated the woman.  When Natasha and Brad were dating in college she was constantly trying to get Rick to abandon his friends and only hang out with her.  She even tried to get Rick to change his major fashion design so she could pick all his classes for him and have him move to New York with her to support her modeling career.  And for a while Rick was doing everything she said, he was blinded by regular sex with a beautiful woman.  But after they got married their senior year and had little Sadie Rick finally got his priories in line.  He got a job as a game store manager to support Sadie and refused to go with Natasha.  So Natasha left Rick and her child behind to go model and party and sent divorce papers a few weeks later.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does Rick want me to turn into a dinosaur and eat her?  I'd do that even without him asking.\"  Brad said to himself before he got back to reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">...Natasha is back in town for her once in a blue moon check in with Sadie and insists on going out to dinner with me and 'whoever I'm dating' for a double date with her and her new manager/idiot boyfriend with a French name I didn't bother to memorize.  Damn it she knows I don't have time to date between work and raising Sadie on my own.  But I don't want to give her the satisfaction of seeing me alone.  So I was hoping you'd do me the favor of being my date.  Preferably as a woman so hot it will send her on a shame spiral.  The dinner is tonight so I'm sorry to rush you but I really need this man.  I'll come by to pick you up tonight.  Let me know if you can't make it, but damn it I really could use this win man.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled and looked down at his crotch, \"Sorry buddy, but it's time for you to take another vacation.  But don't worry, this will be for a better cause than monkey sex research.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you talking to your penis?  I know it has a mind of it's own but I don't know that it enjoy's small talk.\"  Brad turned to see a once again English speaking Karen behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it already loves your lips, I'm sure it would love your voice just as much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren kissed her on the forehead, \"I'm sure it would.  But why is one of my favorite friend's going away?\"  Brad went ahead and explained Rick's situation with Natasha.  \"Bitch.\"  Karen muttered, she despised Natasha for what she did to Rick and Sadie.  \"Let's go the booth now, we're going to make you a knockout that will make little miss boob job pop a tit with jealousy.\"  They then went to the booth and began to design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I go with a hot red head co-ed?  Natasha will be jealous of my youth, and I can be a steriotypicly hot headed red and slap her.  Can I please slap her?\"  Brad asked his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren seemed to seriously consider it, \"Maybe...but we might not want it to look like Rick is robbing a cradle.  We could go with the eternally 29 stereotypical blonde bimbo with boobs bigger than your head.  It'll be bad for your back but good for Rick's ego.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad thought about it, \"That could work, but would Rick really let a bimbo like that around Sadie...maybe but...oh I know.  I could see Rick going for a mature cougar who could take care of him and Sadie.\"  The husband and wife duo debated for a while over Brad's body but before Rick got there they made their decision.</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s probably the best way to make Natasha jealous.\u201d, said Brad as he weighed the options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was hoping that you would say that!\u201d, said Karen as she eagerly rushed to the terminal. Brad tried to look over her shoulder but Karen turned toward him, shielding the screen with her body. \u201cNo peeking! Why don\u2019t you go get in the booth while I design your new body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad sighed and entered the booth, waiting for the inevitable. He watched Karen ponder over some of the settings for a good 10 minutes before she turned toward him. \u201cReady?\u201d, said Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d, responded Brad moments before the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren anxiously waited as the machine did it\u2019s work. Finally, the machine stiopped and Brad walked out of the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked down at the massive breasts jutting out from his chest and gave them a gentle lift with his new dainty hands and giggled. His hand immediately went to cover his mouth, causing his breasts to bounce and sway wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, wow! These new titties are sexy as hell! What\u2019s up with this voice though? Why is my head all, like, fuzzy?\u201d, said Brad as he admired his new form in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we wanted to make Natasha jealous. I might have tweaked that pretty little head of yours to help with that. Rick deserves to have a little fun tonight as well.\u201d, said Karen as she put her hand on Brad\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou would have been too awkward and not very convincing If I hadn\u2019t made a few modifications. You\u2019re still you, but will be a lot less... Uh... shy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, he hasn\u2019t been laid, in like, forever. He\u2019s certainly not had a girl as sexy as me!\u201d, said Brad as he examined his new curves. A moment later, Brad looked at Karen and made a pouty face. \u201cUh, like what did you change? You made me so tiny!\u201d, he said as he had to look up at Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think \u201ctiny\u201d is the word I would use.\u201d, said Karen as she cupped Brad\u2019s right breast. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it Babe. You just have fun tonight and don\u2019t worry about anything. I won\u2019t hold anything against you tomorrow. Now, let\u2019s go get you dressed in that sexy new dress that I bought. It\u2019s probably the only thing that will fit those huge breasts of yours. I promise to reward you later by turning into this body and letting you have some fun!\u201d, said Karen as she grabbed his ass and planted a kiss on his soft, pillowy lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm... okay! I want you to use the thingy to make you act like me also!\u201d, said Brad with a broad smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely! Now, let\u2019s get you ready for your hot date!\u201d, said Karen as she tugged Brad toward the house. Brad couldn\u2019t help but walk with a sexy and confident sway of his hips as Karen followed him to the house.</span></div></div>",

What happened next was all a blur.  A beautiful petite blonde woman with some of the largest breasts Rick had even seen in person in a dress that barely held them in opened the door and after looking him up and down, kissed him.  Rick for a moment panicked thinking he'd gotten the wrong house, or had fallen asleep at the wheel and was having an amazing dream.   But then he remembered the whole reason he was here.  The kiss broke and Rick hesitantly checked, \"Uh, Brad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde twirled her hair with one hand and with the other put her finger around her lips wiping off some of Rick's saliva before putting the finger in her mouth, \"Mmm, yummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That uh, doesn't answer my question.\"  Rick asked as he felt the blood rush from his face to another part of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's my husband all right.\"  Karen said turned around the corner walking up behind Brad.  \"I got him all ready for you to rub in Natasha's horrible face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Brad know what he's doing?\"  Rick asked looking into the semi vacant look in Brad's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda,\"  Karen shrugged, \"Brad picked the blonde bimbo body, I just made sure he had a mind to match to maximize Natasha's misery seeing her all over you.  You know if Brad had his own mind he wouldn't be able to pull this off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I can see that.\"  Rick said looking Brad licking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ricky, when did you get so cute?  I could just eat you up.\"  Brad couldn't keep his hands to himself and pressed his chest up against Rick in a big hug and grabbed his ass while she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, yeah, I don't think Brad would do this on his own.  Thanks for that Karen, and he's totally cool with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"100%, now you two have fun, I won't wait up and Brad and I already decided you two can have alllll the fun you want tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to tell me twice!\"  Rick said now feeling Brad actively rubbing against his now throbbing member.  As Rick opened the car door for Brad, they heard Karen call out, \"Take good care of Barbi for me!\"  Rick waved Karen off and began the drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they pulled out onto the road Rick said, \"Sorry but we have to take a quick detour, I need to stop by my house to change into some nicer clothes.\"  Rick said referencing his work shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo, but I like this.\"  Brad said now reaching out to touch Brad arm, \"When did you get so muscly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uh, when I change from Sadie back to myself last month I did give myself some minor enhancements.  But I've been working out with some weights to make sure I keep the muscles you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds sexy,\"  Brad said with a purr to his voice, \"You'll have to show me your workout sometime big boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick had a big smile on his face, \"Well, I think I can arrange that if things go well tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wait til tonight?\"  Brad whispered into Rick's ear almost causing the driver to steer into a ditch for a moment.  The two friends eventually pulled up to Rick's house so Rick could put on some nicer clothes for the dinner date.</span></div></div>",

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to be a good girl.\u00e2\u0080\u009d, said Brad as he adjusted the very uncomfortable seat belt that got lost between his breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick held the door open for his date and followed Brad into the restaurant. It was a very nice place, although a bit expensive. He smiled as all the male eyes focused on his date. He saw Natasha and her date across the room, already seated. Rick places him arm around Brad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waist and led him toward the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHello Natasha. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great to see you!

Hello, Barbi! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pleasure to meet you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! Like the Sleeping Beauty movie? Cool\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you mean Beauty and the Beast, but Yes. Except I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m handsomer and better mannered.\u00e2\u0080\u009d, said Gaston with a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha reaches her hand out to Brad after a subtle jab to Gaston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHi, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Natasha. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so glad you could join us! Please, have a seat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRick pulled out a seat for Brad before sitting in the chair across from Natasha. Gaston was already seated when Natasha gave him a look before pulling out her own seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter approached with Menus and left the party to review the wine list. After some brief small talk, Brad excused himself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have to go fix my makeup.\u00e2\u0080\u009d, he said as he gave Rick a kiss on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll join you. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s give the guys a chance to get to know each other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d, said Natasha as she followed Brad to the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad entered the room first and was surprised to see such a large room with couches and large mirrors against the far wall. The restrooms were just through a door to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWow! This is nice. Couches and everything!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, said Brad as he sauntered over to the mirror and pulled some lipstick out of his purse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, how long have you known Brad?\u00e2\u0080\u009d, said Natasha. Brad suspected that she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe that Rick and him were a couple. Brad had the upper hand though since he knew Rick before he met Natasha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI met him when he moved to New York, but we were just friends at the time. We met up a few months ago and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when we started dating. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an awesome guy! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never been happier.\u00e2\u0080\u009d, said Brad before he puckered you and applied more lipstick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFunny, he never mentioned you when we were together. Did you meet at his work place?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, I was Ron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secretary. I would help out Rick from time to time. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such a great guy! And handsome too. I was glad he finally asked me out on his last business trip.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha kept grilling Brad on the details of their life. Once she was reasonably sure that the two were actually dating, the two women made their way back to the table. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br>\r\nRick and Gaston seemed to be hitting it off. They were laughing when their dates came back to the table. This time Gaston has the sense to pull out Natasha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo what were you boys talking about?\u00e2\u0080\u009d, said Brad as he leaned in toward Rick placing her hand on his lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad grabbed Brad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand to keep Brad from exploding further. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh just exchanging some stories. We ordered some wine for the table. The waiter will be back in a few minutes to take our order.\u00e2\u0080\u009d, said Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foursome continued to talk. Rick could clearly see that Natasha was jealous, but did a decent job of hiding it. Gaston was a good guy and he actually enjoyed the evening more than he thought he would. He hoped that Natasha had either changed for the better or Gaston would wise up and escape a miserable future. Having a gorgeous woman on his arm, even if it was only for tonight, wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting late, and the check had arrived.

The two couples each went to their cars that were parked close to each other.  Rick managed to look at his ex after pushing some of Brad's hair out of his face.  She wasn't as passive aggressive and demeaning to him as she used to be, but she was still definitely cold towards him and seemed to be very judgmental towards 'Barbi', although Rick was pretty sure that part was out of jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick decided he should at least try to be the better person and stepped away from Brad and offered his hand, \"It was good to see you again Natasha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha flashed million dollar smile that in the past would melt Rick's heart but now just made him cringe.  \"And I'm so glad to see you <i>finally</i> get yourself a date after our break up.  Good for you.\"  Rick couldn't help but notice a condescending tone to Natasha's voice.  A tone that Brad also noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me princess.\"  Brad said in a huff as he got in Natasha's face, (actually with Barbi's short hight he got more up in her breasts) and continued, \"The only reason he hasn't had any girl he wants is because he's been raising HIS daughter.  You remember, the one you left behind so you can go play pretend supermodel?  I have no idea what he saw in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me but you don't know a thing about me.  Rick, get your fluzy girlfriend off of me.  But you should really thinking about breaking it off with her.  I don't think she'd be a good influence on Sadie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>WHACK!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one instant Natasha was on the ground in a puddle with a red hand mark across her face.  \"Like, you have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.  I would be like, 100 times the mom you were.  Now I don't want to see you in Sadie or Rick's life ever again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you little!\"  Natasha was standing up about to go after Brad but their dates both intervened.  Gaston looked at Rick while holding Natasha back, \"I guess that wine was a little to strong for the ladies.  I've never seen Natasha act like this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish I could say the same.  Good luck with her Gaston.  I'll send you a friend request and you can vent to me anytime.\"  Rick said stuffing the short, blonde, ball of fury into the car and locking her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Rick got in the drivers seat Brad let out a laugh, \"WOW!  You have no idea how long I've wanted to slap her!  Turning into this body was worth it just for that.\"  Then Brad turned to Rick and looked at him in the moonlight, \"...although I should thank you for being my big brave hero and saving me from that evil witch.  And I know just how to do it.\"  Barbi went for Rick's zipper and he yelped out, \"Not while I'm driving please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how about we go to a hotel?\"  Brad suggested and Rick only needed a second to think about it.  \"You know what?  Yeah, let's do it.  My mom is babysitting Sadie all night and I need to let off some steam after what Natasha just pulled.  And I should be the one thanking you for saying some of the things I've wanted to say to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stars reflected in Barbi's eyes as she said, \"Well then, since I was a good girl like a promised, I think I deserve my reward.\"  And Barbi went to caress Rick's arms who smiled as he pulled into the hotel.</span></div></div>",

I mean Barbi!\u201d, said Rick as he fumbled with the key to the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbi waited not so patiently at the door until it swung open, granting the couple access to the room. The room hadn\u2019t seen a remodel in at least 30 years. The cheap motel setting only made Barbi more excited. \u201cSpared no expense!\u201d, joked Rick and he closed the door. \u201cOooh... it makes it seem kind of... naughty!\u201d, said Barbi as she tried to push closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his hand up as his horny date closed the distance between them. \u201cAre you sure about this? I mean, you\u2019re sure this isn\u2019t going to be awkward tomorrow?\u201d, said Rick as he stared down into a mountainous amount of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook Rickie... I\u2019m more than okay with this. This hit body of mine is horny as can be and I\u2019ve been looking forward to this all evening. It\u2019s still me in here, but I want to have some fun tonight. Like you said, I was a good girl and deserve it.\u201d, said Barbi in her melodic voice right before planting a passionate kiss on Rick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick didn\u2019t really put up a fight. He\u2019d been dying to get a better look at Barbi\u2019s body all night. He reached out and caressed Barbi\u2019s magnificent breasts, causing a moan to escape her lips. Barbi slowed down a bit to savor the moment now that she knew Rick was hooked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you help me out of this dress?\u201d, she said as she turned her back to give Rick access to her zipper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick carefully pulled down the zipper, exposing some sexy, lacy, black lingerie. He then unclasped the bra, finally releasing her huge tits. Rick wasn\u2019t known for his patience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbi removed the bra and smashed her tits up against Rick, planting her plump lips on his once again. She could feel his rock hard erection pushing against her. Smiling, she deftly unbuckled Rick\u2019s trousers and smiled as his huge member was released from it\u2019s cramped fabric prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me get this party started!\u201d, said Barbi as she bent down and kissed his erection. After a minute or two of teasing, she wrapped her lips around his cock and sucked, slowly at first, gradually increasing the pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God! WOW! You\u2019re aamazing Barbi!\u201d, said Rick as he leaned against the wall. Barbi looked up proudly as she pleasured her friend, obviously enjoying the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud plop, Barbi releases his penis and stood up, pushing her panties down to the floor. She stood there totally naked as Rick admired the sexiest woman that he\u2019d ever seen. She giggled and pulled Rick over to the bed where she pushed him back onto it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm... So Rickie. What would you like me to do now?\u201d, said Barbi as she climbed up onto him, dangling her tits in his face. \u201cYou like having these lips around that big beautiful cock of yours, but you really want this tight little pussy, don\u2019t ya Rickie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore than anything!\u201d, said Rick as he gazed up at Barbi. He began to suck on on of her nipples and played with the other with his right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me how bad you need me!\u201d, whispered Barbi in his ear. \u201cTell me how sexy I am! Talk dirty to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely, without a doubt, the sexiest woman that I\u2019ve ever laid eyes on. You\u2019re an amazing little cocksucker. You enjoyed that, didn\u2019t you!\u201d, he said as he reached around and grabbed her ass. \u201cAnd those lips! I want to feel them around my cock again! Please! Oh God, Please don\u2019t tease me anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbi lowered herself onto Rick\u2019s dick and began to work up a rhythm. She screamed as the first orgasm hit her, causing her to almost fall over. Rick held onto her and helped her increase the tempo. She was a woman possessed, and couldn\u2019t get enough of Rick\u2019s cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sexual escapades continued for another hour before they both collapsed on the bed, exhausted. Rick held Barbi tightly, feeling her breasts push up against him. She was panting slightly from her earlier activity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Like that was the best sex I\u2019ve had in a long while. This body is a heck of a lot of fun! I hope your up for another round or three!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick smiled as his hands explored Barbi\u2019s sexy curves. \u201cWe have all night Barbi. There are quite a few more positions that we haven\u2019t tried yet! It\u2019s still early and I feel ready for another go.\u201d, he said as he repositioned himself to give Barbi some oral pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Rickie! Oh! YEAH! RIGHT THERE!\u201d, said Barbi between gasps. \u201cI\u2019m your slutty little bimbo! I want to stay like this! Don\u2019t make me turn back!\u201d<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He gently separated his bombshell body from his sleeping friend and got up out of bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad noticed that something was different. He felt much more in control and the fog lifted from his brain. He ran a few test calculations in his head and noticed that he had his intelligence back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vibration behind him caught his attention and he turned to see his phone\u2019s screen flashing. He walked over to retrieve his phone as his huge breasts swayed. He picked up his phone and read a text from Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you had fun! You\u2019re bimbo thoughts should have worn off by now. I wasn\u2019t sure if you would come back if I didn\u2019t put a time limit on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was surprised to know that thoughts could be modified temporarily. He very clearly remembered everything that happened to him, but felt a very strong urge to act out his bimbo personality. \u201cDamn, that was something else!\u201d, he said as her stood in front of the full length mirror and played with his nipple. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the best sex I\u2019ve ever had!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was snoring slightly when Brad looked back at the bed. He was still in his dream girls body, but his normal mind had been returned to him and Rick was unaware of his current mental capacity. His smiled mischievously in the mirror and walked back to the bed. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, he decided that he would like to experience his new body a little more. He slowly lifted the covers and bent over and took Rick\u2019s penis in his mouth. It didn\u2019t take long before Rick opened his eyes as Brad stimulated him into a rock hard erection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked up at Rick and stayed in character. \u201cGood morning Ricky! I thought I\u2019d surprise you!\u201d, said Brad as he forced a giggle and placed Rick\u2019s penis between his breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick moaned as Brad continued to tittie fuck his friend. Brad kept this up for a few minutes before straddling Rick\u2019s dick and plunging it inside his slick pussy. Brad\u2019s cries of passion could no doubt be heard by the adjoining guest rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oh man, I can't believe I just had your dick in me man!\"  Brad smiled at his performance as he put those skills he learned in freshman acting class to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick seemed surprised at his friends development, but he wasn't a master of the Transformation Booth so he wasn't going to ask any questions, \"Huh, you were only acting like a bimbo because of the machine?  Could have fooled me, seemed like you were just acting like your normal Brad self, you've always had a thing for this D didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled and spit any remains seman he had in his mouth away before flipping off his buddy.  As the two got ready to take Brad back to the Booth, Brad noticed a bit of a spring to Rick's step.  He already knew it, but seeing the results first hand Brad was really glad he got his friend laid, and the fact it was with him turned out to be a fun bonus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pulled up to the house and Rick being a gentleman, escorted his date back to the Booth where Karen was waiting for them.  \"Rick, good to see you.  I take it since you didn't get back til now that the two of you had a fun time last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night and this morning, that bimbo thing you did to Brad did a real number on him.\"  Rick said complimenting Karen's handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night...and this morning?\"  Karen said giving her husband a knowing look.  Brad felt himself blush, he knew she knew that he'd screwed Rick this morning completely on his own without any bimbo influence.  \"Well, let's go ahead and get Brad back to normal.  I'm excited to have my husband back.\"  Brad did so and a few button presses later, the booth closed and Brad felt himself change back to his (physically enhanced but still his) normal back.  Karen was about to shut the machine down for the day, but Rick said, \"Hey...did you mind if I use the booth myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Brad and Karen's eyes raised, they weren't expecting this.  \"Sure Rick, you can use it anytime, but did you have something in mind or should we just transform you into something at random?\"  Brad asked his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it may sound weird, but I want to use the booth to try to help someone, you know.  Like you helped me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to turn into a girl and screw a guy?\"  Brad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  No, that's not what I meant, get your mind out of the gutter dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, go ahead and tell us what kind of body you want and how it will help someone?\"  Karen said sweetly.</span></div></div>",

Did you have to make my breasts so big!?\u201d, he said as he looked down and couldn\u2019t see his feet. He looked in the mirror and saw a very short, chubby, cute woman, looking back at him. He had the body of a woman who was probably a knockout in her early years, but had put on a more than a few extra pounds. His stomach wasn\u2019t huge, but did stick out a bit. Most of the weight went to his ass and breasts though. His breasts sagged a lot without the support of a bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seemed to like my tits a lot. I thought you might like a set of your own.\u201d, said Brad with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly what I had in mind.

I took care of a few mannerisms for you. You\u2019ll find that your body will feel quite natural.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren gave Brad a dirty look before taking Rick\u2019s hand. \u201cI have a good selection of clothes that I\u2019ve been collecting for all different body types. I have a floral patterned sundress that will look great on you! Luckily, I have a bra that should fit those breasts of yours. I had planned to get a little more exotic with my transformations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad\u2019s interest peaked when he heard his wife say that. \u201cHave fun buddy!

He would be a rather attractive, skinny woman with manageable breasts and a tight butt. She was definitely MILF material and would certainly turn a few heads at the retirement community. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with his future body, he saved the preset and went back to the house to grab some lunch. While Brad and Rick discussed names for their new identities, Karen snuck out to the shed to take a peek at Brad\u2019s attributes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, this won\u2019t do at all. This type of woman seems like a boring body. I think he should be similar to his previous creation. Let\u2019s see... He could be a few inches shorter than Rick, and a have a little more jiggle than his friend.\u201d, thought Karen as she chuckled when she cranked up the size of his breasts and ass. \u201cAt least he\u2019ll<br>\r\nbe balanced.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Rick, she was still a rather striking BBW and the extra pounds went to all the right places.<br>\r\nShe may have gone overboard on the size of her hips, but they really complimented the rest of her body. Karen completed the look by giving the body long, silky auburn hair and adorable heavy Southern accent. There are more than a few gentlemen who would appreciate the shape of this body. Especially if they were breast men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren pointed to the clock on the wall and pulled Brad to the door. \u201cCome on, quick dallying. You\u2019re going to be late for the book club.\u201d, said Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were in the booth, Brad stepped in the booth and after a brief hesitation, pressed the button. Moments later, a shocked and very naked red haired woman waddled out of the booth with a pouty look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019all changed mah settin\u2019s.\u201d, said Brad as he covered his mouth reflexively after hearing his new voice. \u201cAin\u2019t this somethin\u2019?\u201d, he said as he saw the shocked curvy woman in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Lordy! Ain\u2019t you precious!\u201d, said Karen with an exaggerated accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa\u2019am, I do believe mah boobs are down right small compared to yours\u201d, said Rick in a rather poor imitation of a southern belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled and laughed along with his wife and friend. Karen got one over on him, but he would survive the evening. I hope you had planned on something VERY exotic in the clothing department!\u201d, as he hefted his massive boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight this way, Charlotte!\u201d, said Karen as she led her to the clothing racks. </span></div></div>",

'Charlotte' and 'Ruth' entered and introduced themselves to the book club and managed to get seats near Rick's mom Sylvia which was easy since she was sitting by herself.  As he sat in an old wooden chair that creaked uncomfortably under his new wide waist, Brad realized he hadn't seen Sylvia in a few years and was surprised by her appearance.  She was once a plump and jolly woman but now she looked practically skinny and pale and seemed to only wear dull and muted colors with greying hair.  They introduced themselves and exchanged pleasantries before the book club began.  Both Brad and Rick were glad they weren't near the front of the group because 'Charlotte' and 'Ruth' were having a hard time keeping their eyes open.  Rick had more mental stimulation helping Sadie do her 2nd grade homework as opposed to talking about this mystery romance novel that had all the twists and turns of a 180 degree line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rick noticed he wasn't the only one bored out of their mind.  He saw that his mom Sylvia was also completely zoned out.  And after the book club meeting mercifully ended Brad and Rick struck up a conversation with Sylvia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Sylvia,\"  Rick said finding it a little odd to call his mom by her name, \"Are these book club meetings always this exciting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my saddle yes.  I've suggested a few books myself that would at least provide a modicum of stimulation and actual conversation, but that's not what these woman are here for, they simply want something safe and simple to do while their husbands play poker or watch their football.  Honestly that's what I miss the most about my husband and having a house full of family, that noise and chaos was oddly soothing.\"  Sylvia said with the sound of a woman who hadn't opened up in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my dear, if it's noise and chaos ya like.  I figure can always go down to tha waterin' hole and enjoy a few rounds.\"  Brad said cursing Karen's interference with his body for making him unironically call a bar a 'waterin' hole'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia seemed interested but was hesitant, \"I don't know, I haven't been to bar since my husband passed.  I always thought it was a bit unseemly for a woman my age to go to a place like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if three woman your age go it'll just be a perfectly normal good time.\"  Rick said with an actual bounce of excitement that sent a ripple throughout his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia nodded, \"You're right Ruth.  Come on Charlotte, let's go to the bar!  Who knows, perhaps one of us will get lucky.\"  Brad laughed with approval as for the briefest moment 'Ruth' had a look of horror on her face at the idea of his mother getting lucky.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After recovering from the shock that his mother actually still had a sex drive at her age, Rick managed to suggest going to a chain restaurant with a bar as their location.  It wasn't exactly the hippest place to drink, but at least they wouldn't be 90% under 30s trying to get drunk and/or laid.  And it certainly was quite chill as the bar part of the restaurant was mostly filled with couples waiting on their tables and a few people who at least seemed like they were single.  As they entered Brad couldn't help tapping his toes to a country song that was playing on the radio.  \"Oh I love this number.\"  Brad couldn't help but say even though normally he hated country music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three older ladies made their way to the bar and each got a drink as Sylvia began looking around.  \"That fellow looks handsome, but he's still wearing a wedding, we should stay far way ladies.  Now those two gentlemen at the other end of the bar, oh they have potential.\"  Sylvia found herself giggling.  \"Oh my, I haven't talked like that in a place like this since before my husband.  In fact it was actually a place like this were I met my husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't meet at church?\"  Rick said repeating the story his mom had told him years ago, but at getting an odd look from Sylvia, Rick recovered and said, \"I mean, you just seemed like the type of woman who would meet her husband at a church I mean.  Yeah.\"  Rick felt his face flush and buried his face in his Long Island ice tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I met my husband in a bar, it was such a dirty place.  The walls were just filled with posters of...\"  Sylvia was talking before Brad interrupted, \"Now Sylvia we can wallow in nostalgia like a pig in mud, or we can get to livin' today.  Now, without a second thought, tell me who's boots you'd like to be knockin'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHARLOTTE!\"  Rick said not believing his friend was talking to his mom like this, but his shock didn't end as Sylvia very quickly replied, \"The dark haired gentleman the blue jacket at the end of the bar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, let me take care of this for ya,\"  Brad said downing his Bloody Mary and sauntered with confidence up to the two men at the end of the bar.  \"Yoo hoo, gentlemen, are the two of you here alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men turned and seemed surprised at being addressed like this by this curvaceous southern woman, but the dark haired gentleman said, \"My brother here and I are actually waiting for my son, but he's going to be a little late so were just enjoying some drinks while watching the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to here that, your son must be might fine if he's half as cute as you are, but I thought I should warn you,\"  Brad pointed at Rick and his mom, \"Those two lovely and lonely women over there are both quite attracted to you but are afraid to make the first move, so if you're interested I'd suggest getting them some drinks because they are two women worth getting to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gentlemen seemed surprised by this offer, but didn't hesitate before ordering Sylvia and 'Ruth' another round of drinks and moving seats to be beside them.  The dark haired man was named Harold and had lost his wife a few years ago, and his older brother was a bit of a silver fox who recently had a divorce named Earl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold and Sylvia seemed to be hitting it off very well, they were swapping stories about their families and discussing all sorts of mutual interests.  While Earl was trying to get along with a not as interested Rick who tried to make up facts about himself, but most of the time Rick just deflected any questions about his personal life back onto Earl who thankfully seemed more than happy to talk about himself.  </span></div></div>",

But a few drinks later Rick really seemed to be relaxing and getting into his role and Brad enjoyed watching it.  Finally the games on the tv were wrapping up Harold broke his gaze from Sylvia to look at his phone, \"Oh darn, my son Robert won't be able to make it.  I was hoping you'd get to meet him Sylvia, and knowing my son he'd have very much enjoyed meeting your friend Charlotte as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's just unfortunate, but since you're not waiting for Robert now, does that mean you have to leave?\"  Sylvia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold pocketed his phone as he said, \"No, I think Earl and I have. found a good reason to stay for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother round of drinks later and Brad could feel the chemistry between Sylvia and Harold, if they were 30 years younger they'd probably be in rooting around in the bar bathroom or something, but for now they seemed happy just looking into each others eyes.  Or at least that's what Brad was thinking before Harold said, \"Why don't we get out of here,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia seemed to light up at this idea, but she looked over at Rick and Earl who were getting along, but there was still a weird tension between them thanks to Rick not being quite comfortable being an older woman being hit on by another man.  \"I'm not sure, I came here with Charlotte and Ruth and I'd really hate to leave them on their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad heard this and called out from another table, \"Don't y'all worry about me!

Brad laughed as he thought about Rick who had just gone through an ugly divorce and hadn't gotten laid in years, and here he was potentially getting laid two nights in a row by two different people as two different sexes.  Brad started up his car and went back home to his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brad entered their house, he saw a mysterious older man wearing nothing but jeans and a cowboy hat.  He had leathery sun tanned skin, a chiseled jawline, and greying black hair and a glorious black mustache.  Brad knew who it had to be and let out a playful gasp, \"Oh my deary, some mystery man has invaded my home, whatever am I to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled as she twirled her mustache, something she'd been doing a lot in the last hour with this body, \"I hear that there's been a very good girl somewhere around these parts, I just wanted to make sure she got the reward she deserved.\"  She said as she dropped her pants to show off what she had sculpted in the Transformation Booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad fake gasped and grasped his chest, \"I do believe sir that I have the vapors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever that means, I think I know the cure for it,\"  Karen said as she led her husband into the bedroom.</span></div></div>",

IT was right there standing up in front of me.\"  Rick's face was bright red, but it got even redder when Karen said, \"So...did nature take its course?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I blame it on the liquor.  He was right there and so naked, and I just...I kind of happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeehaw!

Sometimes in the bedroom Brad will make this cute little...\"  \"WHOA NELLY!\"  Brad said before his wife could reveal any of their bedroom secrets to their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These weren't normal noises, I thought they sounded weird...but then Earl grabs his chest and falls on top of me while he was in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence as Brad and Karen digested what they just heard, Brad was the first to talk, \"Bless your heart you killed him.  You screwed him to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HE DIDN'T DIE!\"  Rick said very loudly.  \"He just...may have had...a minor...little...heart attack.  He said it happened now and then, he got me to give him his medicine and he was all better.  But I had to leave there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\"  Was all Karen could say before she looked at Brad and grinned, \"After you slept with Rick the other night, didn't you tell me your chest was hurting a bit.\"  Brad got the bit and said, \"Oh my yes, just thinking of that night with Rick is making my heart pound and pound and....gak!\"  And Brad pretended to faint onto the floor making Karen crack up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not funny!\"  Rick said, but he was smiling a bit himself.  \"Well I just need to turn back, it wasn't just the thing with Earl.  I had to pick up Sadie from my sister's to take her home.  I had to make up an excuse that I was a new babysitter.  After I dropped Sadie off and made sure all her stuff was ready for school tomorrow I came straight over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not be hasty, tell me Rick, do you have any mortal enemies in your life that you want to, you know,\"  Karen mimicked slicer her throat, \"Because apparently you've got the body to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Rick was laughing a bit at this point, \"Yeah yeah, it's all fun and games until maybe I give you or Brad a heart attack next.\"  The group made their way to the Transformation Booth and one at a time turned back into their normal bodies.

A few hours ago Rick had dropped off his 8 year old daughter so that Brad and Karen could babysit her and Karen had left the house to get some food.  And of course in that short time period Brad had lost the little girl.  As the front door swung open, Brad was actually disappointed to hear his wife call out, \"Pizza's here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great!  Just great hon.\"  Brad said getting desperate to find Sadie as he began looking under couch cushions.  This odd behavior did not slip past Karen.  \"What in the world are you doing Brad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...may have lost Sadie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lost a little girl!\"  Karen said her voice slightly shrill, \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well after you left Sadie wanted to run around the house, and run around some more.  I was getting really tired since you made me get rid of my extra strength and stamina in the Booth since we were having a guest over.  So I suggested Hide and Go Seek, and half an hour later I've discovered that Sadie is really good at that game unfortunately for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she can't have gone that far.  She didn't leave the property right?\"  Karen asked joining the search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I checked the barn, she wasn't there so I figured she had to be in the main house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you check the shed?\"  Karen asked but Brad shook his head.  \"No I didn't, she couldn't have gotten in there, after all you locked it up after using it to transform back into yourself this morning.  Brad noticed that Karen had frozen in her tracks.  \"Karen, you did lock up the shed and shut down the Transformation Booth...right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren didn't say anything, she just took off and Brad followed very closely behind.  When they got to the shed the lights were on and the Booth was closed, but it sounded like something was in there.  \"Sadie?  Sweet?  Please get out of there.  That's not a safe place for you.\"  Brad said as he typed away at the screen to get it to open, but it seemed to be locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm playing with the screen!  I'll be out in 5 minutes.\"  The adorable sound of the 8 year old said from inside the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a toy Sadie!  Please come out and we won't tell your dad about this.\"  Karen said managing to sound calm despite the circumstances.  But the next thing everyone knew, there was a familiar noise coming from inside the booth, Sadie had successfully activated it.  Brad and Karen looked at each other in horror as the Booth door slid open to reveal a tiny and adorable looking black and white kitten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitten meowed softly as Karen took a breath, \"Ok, ok this could have been a lot worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's still not good,\"  Brad said as he pulled up the info from the transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubject: Human <br>\r\nSubject Gender: Female<br>\r\nTarget Species: Feline<br>\r\nTarget Gender: Female<br>\r\nTransformation Time:Instant<br>\r\nDefault Parameters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the default parameters she's not going to be able to turn back for at least 24 hours with a species change like this.\"  Brad said not looking forward to explaining this to Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't suppose Rick will let Sadie have a sleepover and let her stay here for 24 hours no questions asked?\"  Karen said hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it, when he shows up and his daughter isn't there to greet him he's going to ask questions and be annoyed with us to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, there's only one thing we can do.\"  Karen said as she came up with a plan.</span></div></div>",

With fire in his eyes Rick looked at Brad and said, \"Get the booth ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rick, this change was pretty drastic, Sadie won't be able to turn back for at least. a day.\"  Karen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that, it's not for her.\"  Rick said as he lead the group into the shed with the Transformation Booth.  Smiling down at the kitten in his hands Rick said, \"Sadie has been on a big fan of cat and kitten videos lately.  She probably saw the screen in the booth and thought she could use it to look up cat videos and accidentally transformed herself.  Sadie you've always been a handful, but I wouldn't change a thing about you...although I will be making you human again ASAP.\"  Rick handed Sadie over to Karen again before looking at Brad and saying, \"Sadie needs me with her on this, turn me into a mother cat now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Why do you need to be a cat for this?\"  Brad asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because she's so small and maybe confused or scared.  She needs a warm and calming presence that I can't quite provide with this body.  Besides, if she's going to be a kitten for a day then she's going to need her mother's milk and her real mom is a...\"  Rick covered Sadie's ears, \"A bitch.\"  He uncovered them, \"So she can't exactly provide for her.  I'm going in the booth, make me a mother cat that's nursing so I can take care of my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick made a convincing argument, so Brad didn't complain as he started to type in the correct settings.  Before the door to the booth shut Rick made sure to say, \"And since this is you're guys screw up you guys owe me one.  Oh, and since I'll need to eat you guys better get me some real fish and not some dry pellet crap you guys feed some of your animals.\"  Rick wasn't able to make any more demands before the doors shut and Brad activated the Transformation Booth.  A few seconds later the doors opened up and a lovely black and white cat that matched Sadie awkwardly walked out of the booth seemingly getting used to walking on four legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take you in,\"  Brad said as he picked up his friend who meowed in annoyance as Brad rubbed against the nipples on his belly, \"Sorry about that, those things are probably pretty sensitive right now huh?\"  Brad and Karen set up Rick and Sadie in the guest room on a pillow on the ground.  As soon as Karen put Sadie up against Rick, she cuddled up against her father and by instinct found a nipple and latched on.  Rick gave an pain filly meow but got used to the sensation and Sadie drank up.  Brad and Karen looked down at the adorable father daughter moment and left the two alone to cook up some fish for their guests.</span></div></div>",

After Sadie turned back, she was laying on the ground of the Booth.  Brad and Karen bent down to check on her as still cat Rick rubbed up against her face.  Sadie awoke and simply said, \"Kitty,\"  Upon seeing her dad up in her face.  She looked up at Brad and Karen and said, \"Oh, hi Mr. Brad, Mrs. Karen.  I had a really weird dream last night.  Brad and Karen looked at each other, they had decided that they should probably tell the truth instead of lie to the child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, you dreamed you were a kitten and you were with a guardian momma cat who watched over you all day and night?\"  Karen said sweetly causing Sadie to look confused, \"Yeah, I did dream that.  I was all black, but I couldn't see good and I was scared and then a momma cat helped me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As crazy as it sounds, that did happen.  You were a kitten and that cat beside you is that same momma cat.  And you want to know a secret?  That momma cat is really your daddy.  Here, watch this.\"  Brad pulled Sadie back as Rick entered the Booth.  Karen entered the proper info and soon the doors opened and Rick was back in his normal body.  He bent down and hugged his little girl, \"Don't worry Sadie, daddy's always here for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand, how long has daddy been a kitty cat?\"  Sadie asked trying to absorb all the insane information she was getting.  Rick smiled and said, \"That was actually a first for me.  I'd never been a cat before, but you have seen me after I used that Booth.  Do you remember Miss Ruth who babysit you a few times this month?\"  Sadie nodded her head.  \"Well Sadie, that was me.\"  Sadie's eyes went wide with surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, so if you were Miss Ruth, then does that mean you're my daddy and my grandma?\"  Brad and Karen smiled at the innocent question as Rick shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm just your...\"  Rick tried to explain but Sadie had another question.  \"Then does that mean I have a grandpa too?  Because I remember you went to go on a date with that nice Mr. Earl and...\"  \"THAT'S ENOUGH Sadie!\"  Rick said cutting of his daughter, but the damage was done.  He looked at Karen and Brad who were having a dreadful case of the giggles as they were both hunched over in laughter at Sadie's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadie it's...complicated.  Just...the important thing is that Booth is a powerful and dangerous thing that I don't want you using until you're older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I wanna be a kitty again!  Now that I know it was real I can have fun with it!\"  Sadie said now bouncing at the idea of being a kitty for real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"  Rick looked at the excitement in his daughter's eyes, he had a hard time saying no when she was like this.  \"I'll tell you want, on some weekends, if you are a very very very good girl and me, Brad, and Karen can watch you, you might be able to use it again.\"  Rick looked to Brad and Karen as though asking if this was ok, but they smiled having finally stopped laughing and gave their blessing to this arrangement.  With this Transformation Booth adventure in the books, they wouldn't have another too worth wild event happen until a month later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I really want to make some more cash so I can get Sadie some really nice gifts.  Especially since I think Natasha is going to try to buy Sadie's love more than usual this year after our fight earlier this year.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled, \"You mean the incident where I turned into your date, slapped the crap out of her, and then screwed your brains out?  Yeah that was a fun night.\"  Rick laughed as Brad scrolled past the 1,000th driving job Rick wouldn't like to have before saying, \"Why don't you just let Sadie use the Booth with you for Christmas?  It's something you know she wants to do, it doesn't cost money, and Natasha could never top it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick looked a bit hesitant, \"I don't know, she's still only 8, that seems to young to let her use the Booth even if she's supervised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\"  Brad said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of silent searched ended when Rick said, \"Oh, here's a good one, the city hall is setting up a North Pole thing, you know hire actors to play Mr and Mrs Claus and some elves and let kids sit in Santa's lap.  You know, I bet Earl would be a great Santa and Ruth would be a killer Mrs. Claus.  I'll save this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad raised his eyebrows, \"And why does Earl get Santa priority?  Why couldn't Karen or I be your Santa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earl's my friend too,\"  Rick said plainly, \"He's the only divorced friend I have really and that is a real bond.  It's just, I can only hang out with him when I'm Ruth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"  Brad said plainly looking at the ads again before he suddenly got really excited, \"Ooooo, I've got an idea.  What if we used the Booth for the holidays!  I'm saying we set up our own North Pole, I play Santa, Karen is Mrs Claus, you can be an elf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what makes that any different than the ones in the mall or city hall?  What's going to bring people out to your ranch?\"  Rick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, we have the Transformation Booth and a bunch of chickens we can turn into real life reindeer for a month.  None of the other places can offer 8 real reindeer.  I bet we can even make on with a red nose.  Oh we could rake in the cash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could work...or it could all be a cluster.  Have you ever run something like that before?\"  Rick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but how hard could it be?\"  Brad said as he began to brainstorm.  But this wasn't Rick's priority, he just kept looking at the want ads before he made his decision for the holidays.</span></div></div>",

He was trusted to watch Rick's daughter and now she was stuck as a cat for the next day or so.  Sadie didn't seem to mind her current transformation.  She was already rubbing her whiskers against furniture and purring.  She wandered over to a mirror that was propped up against the floor of the shed to admire her new body.  She turned back and forth in the mirror wagging her tail and looked up at Brad and Karen.  Although she could no longer talk, the way she manipulated her feline face and used her paws, she conveyed the message, \"This is sooooo cool.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren was relieved and reached down to pet Sadie's back, \"I'm glad you are pleased with your temporary body sweetie.  Given that cute pattern of fur you gave yourself,  I think we should call you Pepper.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie nodded her head up and down liking her cat name.  Karen didn't want to risk losing Sadie in the wild in case she ran off.  She thought of a perfect assignment to keep her busy while stuck as a cat,  \"You are in luck Pepper.  I heard some scratching and crawling sounds in our walls yesterday.  I'd love it if you'd investigate and help us take care of our mouse problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie's claws came out of her paws as she let out a hiss taking the attack position.  She eagerly ran out of the shed on all 4's and into the house in search of mice.  Karen shut the door to make sure she didn't get out and went back to the shed.  Brad was nervously pacing back and forth and asked his wife, \"What do we do now?  Rick is going to flip out if his daughter isn't here when he comes to pick her up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren calmly explained, \"Then we need to make sure his daughter IS here.  There's only one thing we can do. Hop in the transformation booth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout question, Brad got in.  He was relieved Karen had a plan to get them out of this mess.  She had a knack for coming up with tons of good ideas to get them out of jams like this.  He tended to over react when it came to crisis situations and was pleased his wife kept a level head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad sat down and heard the door shut.  He heard Karen putting data on the screen and moments later the transformation booth activated.  Brad felt the familiar feeling of his body morphing into a new form.  When the booth stopped, Karen opened the door letting Brad out.  Brad squinted his eyes going from darkness into light.  He was shocked to see how much shorter he was than Karen now.  He looked down and saw he was wearing a dress now.  Long hair dangled over his face as he instinctively grabbed at his crotch seeing chipped purple nail polish in his tiny fingers.  After coming up empty handed, he looked up at Karen with a few rhetorical questions, \"What happened to my dick?  Why am I wearing a dress?  And why is my voice so high?  I sound a lot like Sadie.\"  He recognized the dress, tights and shoes as the exact outfit Sadie was wearing before she transformed into a cat.  The hair dangling down was the same shade as hers. There was no doubt his wife turned him into Sadie.  He crossed his skinny arms and gave a snotty glare to Karen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled at her handy work, \"Awww.  You make such an adorable little girl.  That look is priceless and spot-on.  It's the same look Sadie gave me when I wouldn't let her have a snack earlier.  You'll have to practice a few more of her classic expressions if you are going to pull off being her when Rick gets here.  He's going to want a big hug from his daughter when comes through the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad kept glaring up and tapping Sadie's foot on the ground contemplating his current transformation.  He was happy his wife came up with a plan but he didn't realize he'd be playing the role of Sadie to execute it.  The more Brad thought about it, the less he was mad about suddenly turning into a little girl.  Karen was right.  One of them had to take Sadie's place.  Although Karen had a lifetime of experience in a female body, Brad had spent more time with Sadie and knew her personality better than Karen did.  If anybody was going to pull this off it was him.  Brad's bratty glare went away and turned into a sigh of relief.  He slowly turned around to look in the mirror.  He saw Sadie's reflection staring back.  He did a few faces, opened his mouth, and practiced some of her classic poses.  He finally let out a giggle looking up, \"I'll admit this was the logical decision.  But next time, a heads-up would be nice before suddenly turning me into a little girl.  I just hope the cheap-ass acting classes I took at my shitty high school will pay off so I can fool Rick into thinking I'm his daughter.  I don't remember acting classes covering anything about how to act like a whiny, manipulative, bratty and conceited little girl.  But until we can get the real Sadie back into her body, I'll do my best duplicate her mannerisms and behavior patterns to pull off being his daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren giggled, \"You're not going to fool anybody talking like that sweetie.  You'll never pass a little girl using such language.  Rick is going to know something is up when he picks up his daughter if you talk like that.  You can't swear or use such big words.  Sadie is only in grade school and wouldn't have the vocabulary of a middle aged man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad took offense after, \"Middle aged?  I'm NOT technically a middle aged man YET.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren couldn't help but laugh as she rustled her former husband's hair, \"Sweetie, you're not technically a man AT ALL anymore.\"     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad stuck his tongue out at the joke trying to act like Sadie would.  He plopped down on the couch and was practically swallowed by the cushions with his smaller size.  He flipped on the sports channel and laid back relaxing.</span></div></div>",

You need to practice acting like a girl if you don't want Rick to find out you are impersonating his daughter.  You'll be caught for sure if you sit down in a dress like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked down realizing with his legs spread, that the dress was riding up high.  Sadie's tights gave him the false feeling he was wearing pants and totally forgot he was wearing a dress.  He sat up straight and crossed his legs giving a snotty look to his wife, \"There.  How's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better. That hint of attitude is perfect too.  However, you need to change the channel.  Sadie isn't into sports highlights.  If you are going to watch TV you better sharpen up on your cartoon knowledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad rolled his eyes, \"I have a better idea.  Since I have such a small body right now there's something I want to try out.\"  Brad tore off into the master bedroom and climbed up onto their huge king sized bed.  When Karen caught up, Brad was jumping up and down giggling seeing how high he could get.  He then stood on the nightstand for a launch pad and did a flip onto the bed landing on his back.  Next, he crawled up on the shelf for a higher platform and did another flip onto the bed.  He laughed as Sadie's long hair suspended into the air with each jump and fell back down his shoulders, \"This is awesome!  Our bed feels like a trampoline with this body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren reminded, \"Settle down sweetie.  I know you are experimenting with your current body but don't forget you are a little girl.  NOT a little boy.  Girls aren't as rambunctious as boys at your age and wouldn't be jumping off of high platforms like that.  Be careful or else you'll bump your head. I don't want to explain to Rick why I'm returning his daughter with blood and bruises all over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad took a few extra high jumps saying, \"Fine.  One more jump and I'll stop!\"  He bounced high and misjudged his landing.  He tumbled off the bed awkwardly and landed in the splits position.  He was thankful he didn't land on his head but instinctively winced at the realization he was doing the splits.  However, there was no pain now that his man parts were gone.  He looked down giggling, \"This is amazing!  I'm so flexible now!\"  He tried doing the splits the other way and put both of Sadie's legs outward stretching his head to the floor.  He sprung up and lifted one leg up high being able to stretch it over his head giggling. He struck a pose with his arms up giggling , \"Ta-da!\"  he looked as Sadie's skinny arms and laughed, 'Freaky.  Check out my elbows.  They look like they are bending way too far backwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren agreed, \"That's how all little girl's arms are.  It's perfectly normal.  What's NOT normal is jumping around and doing gymnastic moves while wearing a dress.  Even Sadie would know that's not a proper way for a lady to bend her body while wearing such attire.  You'll have to wait until you get back home to slip into one of Sadie's leotards if you want to practice gymnastics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am home?\"  Brad quickly replied until he remembered his assignment, \"Oh yea.  I'll be going home with Rick today while I'm pretending to be his daughter.  I really hope I can pull this off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, 'Pepper' came running up on all 4's.  Brad scratched the temporary pet's back asking, \"Any luck catching a mouse downstairs in the basemennnnnt.....AHHHH!  Eww eww eww!  OMG that's so gross!\"  Brad let out a combination of surprised and shocked girlish shrieks while running across the room terrified after seeing Pepper was carrying a dead mouse in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled, 'Great job Pepper!\"  Karen explained to Brad who was still quivering in the corner, \"This is working out nicely.  Cat's love bringing their kills to their owners to show off.  We should be glad Sadie is acting like a real cat and taking care of our mouse problem.  By the way...your reaction was perfect!  That scream and quick temper tantrum after seeing a mouse almost looked genuine.  That was a perfect little girl reaction!  Your acting classes must have paid off.  I know you aren't afraid of a simple little mouse.  Nice job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad sat in the corner and lifted his legs to his chest attempting to hide underneath the material in Sadie's dress. He let out a bratty glare, \"I'm not faking it.  For some reason that scared the shit out of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled, \"Really?  I suppose that makes sense. You have little girl hormones now.  Using the transformation booth must have stripped away your eagerness to complete brave husband acts.\"  Karen did a test and pointed in the corner lying, \"Look!  A spider!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad shrieked and let out a long scream and ran across the room.  He saw Karen giggling and gave a bratty glare, \"That wasn't funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren winked, \"Sorry sweetie.  Gimme a hug.\"  Brad put his skinny arms up to share the reassuring gesture.  When they embraced, Karen reached down and started tickling the side of Brad's ribs. He let out a laughing shriek and fell onto the bed.  Karen continued to take advantage of her husband's new form and kept tickling.  In-between breaths of laughter, Brad squirmed around trying to get away, \"Hey!  Cut it out!  You are like 10 times the size of me now!  This isn't fair!  Let me go!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet!  The tickle monster isn't finished!\"  Karen continued the tickle session while Brad was giddy.  Karen pointed out, \"I forgot how cute Sadie's laugh was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad squirmed in-between giggles, \"Okay okay!  I\"m ganna pee my pants if you don't stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't wearing pants,\" Karen winked referring to Sadie's dress Brad had on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad managed to break free and got away from the tickle session. When he finally caught his breath, Brad smirked with a bratty pose, \"Ha ha!  I got away!  Try and catch me again!\"  Brad ran off as Karen followed yelling, \"I let you get away!  But not this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad took advantage of Sadie's body.  With a newfound energy, he was able to run around the house and crawl underneath things in attempts to elude Karen.  When she finally caught Brad again, the impromptu play session was interrupted.  Rick let himself in the house and smiled seeing his daughter giggling and having fun.  Karen whispered to Brad, \"It's showtime.  You better run up and give your Daddy a big hug.\"</span></div></div>",

Then before Rick could even step into the house and maybe see a certain daughter-turned-kitten, Brad opened the door and cried out, \"DADDY!\"  Putting on his most excited face Brad ran full force at his friend who effortlessly grabbed Brad under his arms and lifted him up before hugging him close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy's so happy to see you.  It's been a long day at work but you've already made my sun shine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the sun too hot though daddy?\"  Brad asked trying to play the part of an inquisitive child, this seemed to work as Rick laughed and said, \"Yeah, the sun is too hot, how about we go home and get ourselves some ice cream to cool off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!  Ice cream!  Ice Cream!\"  Brad chanted trying to be just a little bit annoying.  So far it looked like Rick didn't suspect a thing.  Rick looked at Karen who was at the door and asked, \"I hope she hasn't been too much trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No trouble at all, Rick, you can drop Sadie off any time.

I had something I wanted to talk to him about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren thinking on her feet said, \"I'm afraid you just missed him.  Just before you got here Brad turned into a bra for me, I'm afraid he won't be talking to you for a good 24 hours.  Maybe if you and Sadie visit tomorrow you'll see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ok.\"  Rick said, he seemed to want to ask a follow up, but Brad detected this and gave as big a yawn as he could.  Rick chuckled, \"I guess that's my cue to head home.  See you later Karen.\"  Rick then carried Brad into the back seat and buckled him in before beginning the drive back home.  Brad decided to continue to pretend to sleep so he couldn't talk and potentially give away who he was.  But before he knew it, only a few minutes on the road Rick spoke up.  \"So, you going to tell me why you are using my daughter's body Brad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad opened his eyes and yelped out, \"How in the world did you already figure it out?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick sighed, \"I wasn't sure til now.  Thanks for giving it away Brad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad swore causing Rick to say, \"Hey now!  Don't do that with Sadie's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but seriously, how'd you know it was me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought it was weird that Karen was really pushing me to come back to the house, especially WITH Sadie.  But the big giveaway was in the car.  No matter how tired Sadie is, she will always bug me to play Disney songs on the radio, she never fails.  The only question I had was whether you were Brad or Karen, but you already answered that for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew Karen should have been Sadie, she might have been able to catch something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but are you going to tell me where in the world my actual daughter is, or am I going to have to turn this car around and raise hell.\"  Rick said with a vague hint of a threat to his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadie's fine!  She's fine!  Karen's taking good care of her.\"  Brad said and went into the tale of Sadie turning herself into a kitten.  Rick audibly sighed, \"Well, as far as things she could have turned into a kitten isn't the worst.  And I trust Karen so I guess we'll keep this arrangement and head back to your place tomorrow evening to turn you both back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!  So now that I don't have to pretend to be Sadie anymore we can just spend the next 24 hours just chilling.  It'll be a like a guys day, it'll be great!\"  Brad said as he split his legs into a more comfortable and less ladylike position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see.\"  Was all Rick had to say in response as he finished the drive home.</span></div></div>",

When they got back to Rick's house they just watched action movie's until Brad couldn't stay awake any more, and now it was a new day and there were sports to be watched.  Brad and Rick figured they could watch one more game before they headed to the ranch to transform Brad and Sadie back into their proper bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brad downed a (root) beer he asked his friend a question that had been on his mind for a while.  \"So...you and Earl.  What's going on with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick put down his (not root) beer and seemed to think about it.  \"It's...complicated.  To be honest with you, I've only talked to the guy a few times since I first met him, but he's really the best friend I've ever had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\"  Brad said a little offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean that as an insult, it's just that Earl is like a...kindred sprit.  We're both recently divorced guys, we read the same books, we both watch similar tv shows, we even both like BINGO nights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like BINGO?\"  Brad said surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I like BINGO, what of it?\"  Rick said defensively as Brad just raised his hands to show he didn't mean anything by it.  \"Honestly I'd love to hang out with Earl a lot more...but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can only hang out with him when you're an old lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Middle aged isn't old, but yeah.  I can only hang out with him as Ruth, and then when I have that body there are indeed some romantic undertones we can't ignore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, am I hearing wedding bells in the distance?\"  Brad asked half jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick waited a minute and downed his beer before answering, \"Honestly, if I didn't have to deal with work, my mom, sister, and life in general I'd probably say screw it and consider doing just that.  I'd love to just move in with my best friend and daughter, that's the dream isn't it?  I don't know man, life is stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here here.\"  Brad said holding up his soda bottle and clinking it with Rick's beer as they ignored the conversation they just had and went back to shouting about referees and bad coaching.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ve always wanted to go, but I can\u2019t leave Sadie by herself and Harold is taking my Mom on the trip as well. Hell, if you wanted to go, I\u2019m sure that Robert would be happy to take Charlotte along. After your display at the bar, it\u2019s pretty obvious to the group what\u2019s going on. Karen could fill in for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad blushed a little at the thought. \u201cKaren wouldn\u2019t be keen on being alone for two weeks while I\u2019m away banging some young stud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, will you do it or not?\u201d, asked Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess, I can stand being in your body for a few weeks. Your job is easy enough that I could do it in my monkey form.\u201d, said Brad in a teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, Ha, hah\u201d, said Rick. \u201cI\u2019ll owe you one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping Karen will turn into \u2018Barbi\u2019 while you\u2019re away. I\u2019d like to experience her body from another perspective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren entered the room and sat down on the couch. \u201cSo what kind of trouble are you getting into this week?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad and Rick explained the plan to Karen and she gave her blessing. \u201cBrad has a good time in that body, and it would be fun to let loose a bit. I\u2019m in also! I\u2019ve been thinking that we might want to let them in on our secret when they get back. Especially Earl and his bad ticker so he can handle that slutty girlfriend of his.\u201d, said Karen with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick anxiously entered the booth after a few adjustments to his Ruth body. He had actually cranked up his body\u2019s sensitivity about 30%. He had given it a lot of thought, so he dialed it down from his original 100%. \u201cI\u2019d get stuck in that body with no desire to turn back!\u201d, he thought before adjusting the number to a much smaller percentage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have enough clothes to hold you for the whole two weeks?\u201d, asked Brad when \u201cRuth\u201d exited the booth. I carefully measured this body the last time I was in it and did some extensive shopping. I also wanted some more exciting underwear for the trip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad chuckled and escorted Rick to his car. \u201cSo Sylvia has the kids tonight and will need me there by 8:00 am tomorrow, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, so your wife has plenty of time to bone my body tonight before you\u2019re needed.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I mean, I had this thing inside of me when I was Barbi a few months ago and it was definitely not this big.\"  Brad said measuring out the size of his Rick dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren rolled her eyes, \"Don't be selfish, I'm the one who will be getting the most use out of that bad boy for the next few hours.  If you feel so insecure about it, you can make your own just as big when you turn back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad blushed a little bit as the doors closed Karen into the Booth and a few seconds later the doors opened to reveal the very sexy and very naked form of Barbi the blonde bimbo, Karen edition.  The wide eyed beauty was out of the booth for only a second before she saw her target, looking at Brad's naked Rick dick she said, \"Well don't you look yummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that body looks even better from the outside,\"  Brad said feeling the blood rush very quickly downstairs.  They didn't even bother going to the bedroom, they just did it on the floor of the shed kicking up dirt and dust for hours on end.  The squealing and screams of pleasure couldn't last forever though as after a few hours, they passed out from exhaustion on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours after sunrise Brad's phone alarm went off waking the pair.  Karen was already cuddling up against Brad as he said, \"Already morning, I've got to put on clothes and pick up Sadie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like fun, I'll go with you to give you some special attention in the car.\"  Karen began to caress her husband's current penis, and for a minute Brad really enjoyed it before he made himself stand up, taking a quick glans at the booth he realized, \"Damn, you must have really messed with your head, the Booth says you won't be ready to use it again for another half hour, but I've got to leave now.  I'd love to take you with me, but no, it's probably not a good idea to bring you in this state.  I really don't want to have to explain the birds and the bees or a blowjob are to Sadie at age 8.  Rick would kill me.  So I'll get Sadie ready for school, go to Rick's work, but when I get back here I'll turn you back...after another round or two.  See you when I get back, love you, bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Brad was off to experience Rick's day leaving Karen the bimbo behind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When parking to pick-up Sadie, Brad looked in rear view mirror to see Rick's reflection.  He gave himself a quick pep talk, \"Just go in...be cordial with Rick's ex-wife...get you're daughter...and get the hell out of here...\"  It was a strange feeling to suddenly be a father.  It was a small detail he hadn't really considered when agreeing to pose as Rick for 2 weeks.  In the divorce, they'd agreed on a complicated custody schedule for Sadie.  It was sometimes a day, and sometimes 3 or 4 in a row depending on the week.  Brad looked at the schedule Rick gave him.  He'd have to  pretend to be Sadie's dad for a 2 day stint this time.  He was pleasantly surprised to see Sadie had a softball game this afternoon.  He forgot that Rick was an assistant coach.  He knew Rick was  a sports junkie like he was.  Rick probably had to force his daughter to join the team.  Brad would have never pinned Sadie as a softball player given her girly personality, and the way she dressed and wore her hair.  Whenever she was around, he'd only ever heard her talking about gymnastics or dance class.  He'd never heard her bragging about her time on the softball diamond.  Brad was glad his assigned activity today was to attend the game as a coach.  He'd never watched girls softball before but figured it would be fun.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad barely had any experience taking care of a child and was about to get a crash course on being a responsible parent.  He already figured out how to do Rick's job without any problems.  He hoped being a father was just as easy.  Since he'd have to stay at Rick's house for this acting job, he was excited for Karen to come over in a new body to spend the night.  He could always sneak her inside at night or tell Sadie that Daddy was dating now to explain Karen's mystery woman presence.  Rick gave him the green light to experiment with his body as much as possible.  That meant Karen was going to test out multiple female forms so they both could enjoy this adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the child hand-off went well.  Brad hated Rick's ex-wife as much as he did.  The only thing good about her was her amazing body.  It was the reason Rick pursued her in the first place before realizing she was a crazy bitch.  Brad couldn't help but admire her fantastic ass during the quick exchange.  As he loaded up Sadie's softball equipment into the car, he considered asking Karen to become her one day so he could share stories with Rick about how great of a lay she was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the temporary father-daughter drove home, Brad wasn't sure what Rick called his daughter as a nickname and awkwardly suggested, \"So...sweetheart...or...princess...I'm guessing you want...Daddy...to start the DVD player for you?  What do you want to watch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie giggled from the back seat answering, \"Lady bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad wasn't current on children's programming and replied, \"Is that a new movie or TV show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  Sadie giggled, \"It's what my Daddy calls me. It was out I wore during my first dance recital when I was like 3 years old.  The nickname stuck ever since.  He always calls me his little lady bug...BRAD.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was thankful for the suggestion, \"Cool.  Thanks!  So...lady bug...what do you want to...\"  Brad suddenly realized Sadie knew he wasn't really his father.  He pulled over and looked into the back seat with an embarrassed face.  He'd somehow blown his cover within the first few minutes of parenting duty, \"How'd you know it was me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie smirked, \"I saw the plane tickets the last time I was over and saw my Dad was going on a 2 week vacation as Ruth.  I was wondering who he was going to get to take his place?  Then when you showed up in your car to pick me up I figured it out.  I'm glad my Mom didn't look outside and notice you dumb enough to drive your own car to pick me up.  You don't even have a DVD player back here.  And FYI, I'm supposed to be riding in a booster seat until I gain another 10 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad began driving to his own house realizing there was no need to pretend to be Rick anymore in front of Sadie.  She'd already figured out he was an impostor.  He told Sadie, \"In that case, we can stay at our house where the transformation booth is.  I'm assuming you'd like to spend some more time as a cat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie shook her head, \"Nah. I wanna try being a doggy this time. I've watched videos on youtube and can't wait to be a guard doggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.  But you'll have to wait to transform until after your softball game.  I need to at least TRY and be a parent while I'm watching you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie slouched down in the back seat and crossed her arms, \"I hate softball.  I always strike out and have to wear that stupid uniform.  The other girls on my team always make fun of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad suggested, \"You just need to keep your eye on the ball.  We can practice in my back yard when we get home.  There's still another few hours until you need to be at the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna go!  I just want to be a doggy!\"  Sadie complained with her bratty attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Daddy will be mad if finds out I didn't stick to your schedule.  Plus, he's one of the assistant coaches so I HAVE to be there in his place.  Don't worry.  After some batting practice, I'll have you hitting home runs in no time.  Not to brag or anything, but I used to be quite the baseball player.  I'll easily be able to teach you a thing or two.  Then the other girls on your team will stop making fun of you.  Since I'm a coach, I could let you play any position you want.  I could even make those mean girls ride the bench if you want me to.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For the  next hour, Brad pitched batting practice to Sadie trying to teach her how to hit a ball.  It was easy to tell she hated softball.  She kept a snotty attitude the entire time and didn't listen to Brad's advice on how to properly swing a bat.  Brad was getting frustrated and took a break to talk with Karen, \"Sadie isn't even trying out there!  She's going to make a fool out of herself at the game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren laughed, 'She's not trying because she hates softball.  Rick only makes her play because HE loves those types of sports.  That's why volunteered to be a coach.  Sadie loves gymnastics and dance.  She's a girly-girl.  I mean look at her!  She's been out there with you for an hour doing batting practice in a pretty dress with ribbons in her hair.  There's no way she wants to get dirty playing such a manly sport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked out the window realizing Karen was right.  Sadie had already ditched the softball bat and was picking wild flowers around the shed.  She wasn't the type of girl who seemed interested in softball at all.  However, it was Brad's responsibility to make sure she went to the game and to make sure he performed Rick's duties as assistant coach.  Rick would be mad if he found out Brad make him look bad in front of the other parents and skipped out on the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad and Karen watched out the window as Sadie looked around mischievously.  Thinking nobody could see her, she sneaked into the shed.  There was only one reason to go in there.  Brad pointed out, \"Oh shit!  She's going to use the transformation booth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren and Brad ran outside.  By the time they got into the shed, there was a happy golden retriever wagging it's tail.  It barked two times and put its front paws up to greet Brad.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad wished he'd locked the shed.  Sadie and Rick both needed to be at the softball game soon.  Or...at least their bodies needed to be there.  Rick laughed telling Sadie, \"You are quite the sneaky one.  I should have known you'd do something like this to get out of the game.  You need a collar so you don't look like a stray dog.  Come here girl.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie wagged her tail and obeyed.  She trotted over on all 4's to Brad as he told her, \"Sit!\"  Sadie obeyed and was thrilled to be treated like a real doggy obeying commands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile clipping on the collar, Brad said, \"Good girl.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie let out a growl giving Brad a view of her backside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smirked seeing Sadie had given herself a set of dog balls with a dog penis dangling around. He corrected his words, 'Oopsie. Sorry about that.  Good BOY!\"  Sadie excitedly wagged her tail and ran off to explore the backyard with her enhanced canine senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren asked, \"So much for the softball game huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad explained, \"Rick is the coach.  He has to be there.  So does his daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren was confused, \"Sadie just turned herself into a boy dog.  Now she can't use the transformation booth for around 5-10 more hours.  There's no way she can go to the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She won't.  But her body will.\"  Rick eagerly smiled with a giggle, \"I can't wait to re-live my old glory days!\"  Brad entered Sadie's information on the screen and hopped into the transformation booth.  Moments later, he emerged as Sadie's twin wearing her softball uniform and pink cleats.  He had her long hair in a pony tail dangling out the back of her baseball hat.  He smashed his hand a few times into Sadie's glove laughing, \"Woo hoo!  I can't wait to hit a bunch of home runs today!  Girls slow pitch softball will be a breeze!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren laughed at her husband's temporary body, \"Home runs?  You might want to concentrate on hitting singles with Sadie's skinny little arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad explained confidently, 'Swinging the bat is all about technique.  It doesn't matter how much muscle is behind it.\"   Brad typed Rick's profile on the screen and told Karen, \"Hop in the transformation booth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren snickered at the idea of transforming into Rick, \"So I'm becoming the coach huh?  This should be interesting.  I barely know the rules to softball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you a crash course in the car.\"  Brad explained as Karen transformed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Karen became Rick, she clipped a leash onto Sadie explaining, \"Come on boy!  You can come along.  I'll have to tie you to a pole or something in the dugout so you don't wander off.  You can be the team mascot and protect us!\"  Sadie barked twice and excitedly wagged her tail at her new guard dog responsibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the temporary father-daughter duo made their way to the car, Brad was excited to play softball in Sadie's place.  He mentioned, \"It feels so good to be in uniform again!  I don't know why Sadie hates wearing it so much?  With this thing on, it makes me feel so energetic!  I can't wait to run the bases and slide around!\"  Brad remembered driving the wrong car earlier when he was pretending to be Rick.  He pointed to his SUV explaining to Karen, \"Since you are Rick now, you gotta drive his car.  There's a booster seat in there I'm supposed to sit on as long as I'm Sadie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie stuck her canine head out the window.  As Karen started driving, she asked her husband, \"Okay...so what do I need to know about coaching softball?  Hello?  Brad...I mean SADIE...hello?\"  Karen looked over her shoulder to see Brad already had on Sadie's headphones and was singing along to a Disney movie on the DVD player.  He obviously engrossed in the movie and couldn't hear Karen anymore.  She figured it wasn't a big deal and would figure out how to coach softball on the fly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren's newfound manhood was stirring in her pants as they pulled up to the softball field.  Since her husband would be stuck sleeping as a little girl tonight, Karen was scoping out potential single Moms to experiment with.  She was looking forward to some fun with Rick's body later and couldn't wait to find a lucky woman to bring home.  She'd heard that Rick was popular with the softball crowd.  Since he was a coach, moms were always trying to find any advantage for their daughters to get more playing time.  Rick had bragged about how many single moms he'd had sexual encounters with over the years.  Moms would do anything it took for their kids to be successful.  Karen eyed the crowd with a smile wondering which one would be spreading her legs later.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad excitedly ran off to start playing catch to warm up with the other girls on Sadie's team.  Karen tied their temporary dog to a pole in the dugout.  She was glad there was another coach and figured she'd follow his lead on how to manage a group of 8 year old girls playing softball.   Rick's balls were throbbing between Karen's legs as she scoped out potential single moms in the crowd. She couldn't wait for the game to be over so she could take one of them home for some fun.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the drive home from Sadie's softball game, Brad was gleaming in the back seat.  He went 8 for 8 and snagged a dozen ground balls while playing shortstop. Karen barely knew what she was doing trying to act as the assistant coach.  It turned out knowing nothing about softball wasn't a big deal.  She spent most of her time in the dugout breaking up arguments and hissy fits between the girls.  It was more of a daycare than an actual softball game.  There were bouts of crying and sassy remarks.  Karen's experience as a woman helped her reason with the girls.  Sadie proudly stayed tethered to a post at the end of the dugout and barked in celebration for the team.  The other girls kept petting her and thought the dog was cute and a perfect mascot for their team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince all of them were stuck in their current forms until tomorrow, they decided to stay at Rick's house.  When they arrived, Sadie was pleased to get off the leash.  She ran around the backyard exploring while Brad and Karen went inside.  Taking advantage of being inside Rick's body, Karen didn't worry about calories anymore and cracked open a beer.  Brad was still coming off the adrenaline rush of playing competitive ball again.  Except for Sadie's pink cleats, he kept on her entire uniform loving the feel of wearing sports attire.  He headed towards the couch admiring the trophy he'd earned today being voted as the team MVP.  It was a small trophy with a bronze statue of a girl softball player in the batting stance.  It went home between games to the girl who played the best that day.  Brad proudly held it up explaining to Karen, \"Wow!  That was amazing!  It was a blast to be on the diamond again!  It was just like the good old days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren saw Brad about to sit on Rick's nicest recliner and took a fatherly tone, \"Not so fast young lady!  You are absolutely filthy.  Your uniform is full of dirt head to toe!  You're NOT sitting on my furniture until you take a shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad complained, \"Awww.  But I'm stuck like this until tomorrow.  I figured I'd wear Sadie's uniform around.  I love how it feels!  It brings me back to my old baseball days.  It's actually more comfortable than my guy uniforms ever were.  Not having to wear an athletic protector really helps loosen things up downstairs.  I never realized how much they got in the way until I played dick-less today.  Running the bases and sliding head first was much easier with Sadie's body! I was the only one who did that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren replied, \"That's because Sadie doesn't have any boobs yet. Girls your age aren't taught to slide head  first because later in life it will be extremely painful.  But since you mentioned your crotch...is everything okay down there?  I had multiple mothers come up to me during the game suggesting I bring Sadie in for a check-up.  They saw you grabbing and itching multiple times.  They were concerned Sadie might have an infection.  I couldn't help but notice you were itching down there the entire game too.  You should really take a look at things while you shower.  If Sadie needs to see the doctor, we should get her body there ASAP so it doesn't get worse.  I have some cream you can use in the meantime if you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad interrupted, \"...There's nothing wrong with Sadie's crotch. It feels perfectly fine to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what's with all the grabbing and itching today during the game?\" Karen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad laughed, \"Oops.  That was my fault.  I guess it was just habit of years playing baseball and constantly reaching down to adjust things.  When you play baseball in a guys body your athletic supporter needs tons of adjusting. I didn't even realize I was doing it.  Next time I play softball with Sadie's body, I'll try to pay more attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren laughed, \"Next time?  So you're already planning your next outing as an 8 year old girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad held up the MVP trophy he earned today playing in Sadie's place, \"Yep! After finding out how much she hates playing softball, I'd love to take her place on game days.  That was a blast being the best player.  I know Sadie will be thrilled to find out she won't have to play anymore.  I'm sure Rick wouldn't mind either.  Specially since he is the coach.  He will be happy to see his daughter's body actually trying and enjoying the game for once. When he gets back from vacation he's going to be pumped to find out Sadie earned the weekly MVP trophy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick's cell phone buzzed as Karen read the text with a grin.  She text back licking her lips knowing she was going to have a chance to experiment with Rick's penis tonight.  Karen gave her husband an option, \"I have a date tonight.  Do you want to come along or stay here with a babysitter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A WHAT?\"  Brad was offended that he would need a babysitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren reminded, \"You are the one who turned yourself into an eight year old girl.  Since I'm Rick, I\"m technically your father now.  I can't just leave you at home alone and be a bad parent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad glared at his wife's threat to leave him with a babysitter.  It would probably be some neighborhood middle school girl that was barely older than Sadie, \"Then I'm coming with you to dinner.  Let me guess.  You found some sexy softball MILF to have some fun with while you are stuck as Rick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My balls have been throbbing all day.  I didn't have any time alone after suddenly turning into a man and walking around with a penis all day.  You know what it's like.  Normally you have one of these things dangling between your legs all the time.  It controls your every thought.  I need to let some stress out and have some fun.  Jennifer just text me back.  She's Isabel's  Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember Isabel. She was the red head who played right field.  She got a few hits but there's a reason she plays where nobody hits the ball.  She couldn't catch a fly ball if it landed in her glove!  Not to mention she throws like a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She IS a girl.\" Karen laughed, \"And if you come along to dinner, you'll have to talk with her while me and Jennifer get to know each other.  I trust you can handle socializing with one of Sadie's friends.  Jennifer couldn't find a sitter on short notice and is bringing her daughter along on our date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can handle Isabel. Can I wear Sadie's softball uniform?  I love how it feels and it would be fun to wear it at the celebration dinner for the big win today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  It would be impossible to wash and dry it after you got it so dirty today. You'll have to wear one of Sadie's nice dresses.  It's a fancy place.  I figure if I impress Jennifer with an expensive meal that she'll drop her panties much easier when we get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad chuckled, \"That's a good plan! Women love it when you splurge for a meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best part is that it's not my money.  I'll be using Rick's credit cards so order whatever you want.  There's bound to be a good steak on the kids menu.\"  Karen snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad liked the idea of eating an expensive meal on Rick's behalf.  But he wasn't so keen hearing he'd have to wear something fancy to dinner, \"Back to this dress thing...Can't I wear a nice pair of Sadie's pants and a shirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren shook her head, \"Have you ever seen Sadie in a pair of pants?  You know she's a girly-girl. She'd love the opportunity to wear a cute dress to dinner.  As long as you are filling in for her, you'll have to play the part to keep her reputation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad grumbled. To avoid being babysat, it was his only option, \"Fine. I'll wear a dress to dinner, but you are going to have to help me choose the right shoes and accessories.  I'm not exactly up-to-date on my little girl fashion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'll help you find something cute so you don't embarrass Sadie in public.  This is kind of fun. I've never had a daughter to get all dressed up for a fancy dinner.  Meanwhile, it's going to take me all of 10 minutes to get ready as a guy!  You better hurry up and shower so  you can start getting ready. We are leaving in 90 minutes for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad laughed, \"90 minutes? What's the rush?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren giggled, \"There's no rush for me.  I'm a guy.  The rush is for YOU.\"  She reminded her husband, 'You're a GIRL.  Everything takes longer than you think when getting ready in a female body.  Specially when you begin with such a filthy body like that.  None of the other girls on Sadie's team got half as dirty as you did. Make sure to shampoo your hair 2 or 3 times before using conditioner so you get all that grime out.  I still have no idea how you got so much dirt in your hair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hustling\"  Brad confidently replied, \"I was sliding into every base and diving for ground balls in the field.  That's what earned me MVP today.  And hustling will earn me MVP next week too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren laughed at her husband's enthusiasm to fill in for Sadie on her girls softball team.  Karen noticed Brad's fingers and added, \"Just look at how dirty your hands are!  You'll need to deep clean underneath your finger nails to get all that dirt out.  You rubbed off almost all of Sadie's nail polish.  You'll have to repaint your nails before dinner too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad rolled his eyes.  When he became Sadie to take her place at softball, he never imagined he'd have to primp her body for a fancy night out.  He was thrilled to talk with Rick about posing as Sadie on game days so he could relive his glory days on the diamond. He just hoped his future outings as Rick's daughter didn't involve such extravagant dinner dates.  Brad understood what his wife was going through.  She wasn't used to having a dick and knew it was controlling her thoughts.  She needed to get laid all cost.  He didn't blame her for wanting to impress Jennifer with an expensive meal to trick her into some bedroom fun.  Brad was starting to feel a bit dingy from the dirt on Sadie's body that he'd accumulated from hustling around the bases.  He figured a shower would feel refreshing.  He wasn't thrilled that he was about to get dolled-up and wear a dress to dinner.  He would have rather sat around in Sadie's softball uniform all evening.  But if he didn't dress up, he'd be stuck at home with some pimple faced teenage girl babysitting him all night.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few weeks later, Rick's truck pulled up to the ranch.  Sadie excitedly ran out to give Brad a hug, \"Thank you soooo much for taking my place! You know how much I hate softball. I was worried since the tournament is lasts four days that my Dad would make me go as myself. I really owe you one Brad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled, \"It's my pleasure! Every time I suit-up in your softball uniform it brings me back to my old glory days on the diamond. Normally when I transform into you, it's only for a single game.  I can't wait to play double headers everyday during a long weekend and help your team win first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie explained, \"I packed everything you'll need in the bags in the back of my Dad's truck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad glanced inside the truck to see two enormous suitcases giving the impression Sadie packed for a month long vacation instead of a long weekend.  He laughed to himself knowing Karen always over packed whenever they went out of town too.  It was obviously a girl-thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie explained, \"My iPad is there.  You'll need it to facetime my Mom whenever she wants to check-up on me.  That means you gotta make sure to look exactly like I did when my Dad picked me up today.\"  Sadie purposefully held out her hands showing off her fresh manicure consisting of shiny pink nail polish. She wiggled her toes in her sandals to show off her pedicure explaining, \"Since I was going to be gone for so long, Mom took me out for a girls-day at the salon yesterday.  I got my hair trimmed and had about 2 inches cut off in the back.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was glad Sadie pointed out her hair was slightly shorter now. It was difficult to notice by the way Sadie had her bangs back and curled hair hanging past her mid-back.  He studied her nail polish and knew it would be easy to duplicate with the transformation booth.  He didn't have the heart to tell Sadie that he'd probably chip lots of it off while he hustled around the bases at the tournament.  Sadie was wearing a short play skirt and pointed to the band-aid on her left knee, \"Earlier this week at gymnastics I fell off the balance beam and caught my knee against the Velcro on the floor mat.  I also got this small bruise on the back of my thigh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was immediately concerned about Sadie's current muscle structure hoping it wouldn't affect his agility on the diamond once he transformed into her body, \"Are you sore? Can you still run at full speed? Have you been icing it?  Let me see how bad it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie turned her leg showing the back of her thigh.  Brad was relieved seeing how small it appeared.  Sadie explained, \"It's almost healed. I was a little sore for 3 days afterwards while doing the splits, but you'll hardly notice anything now.  You probably don't even need to wear a band-aid on my knee anymore.  The cut already healed over.  I just liked wearing it.\"  She pulled off the Barbie band-aid revealing minuscule remnants of a healed cut.  Brad was pleased to see her injury wasn't bad.  Sadie held up her elbows giving a look of disapproval, \"By the way...the dirt rash you gave me a few weeks ago at softball finally healed up. Would you PLEASE not slide head first with my body anymore? That was embarrassing having to walk around with red marks on my arms for a few days.  Not to mention my ribs were sore from how you jump down on my stomach so hard when you go head first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was disappointed hearing he wasn't allowed to do his famous arm slide anymore.  He hoped he'd have the self-control during close plays to remember not to dive that way.  Growing up as a boy on the baseball diamond, scrapes and bruises were evidence of hustling.  He knew little girls didn't like having any blemishes on their body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie continued updating Brad, \"FYI, I'm not talking to Annabelle right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad knew Annabelle was the red-head with freckles that usually played outfield.  She was one of the better girls on the team.  She could hit well and had a good arm, \"Why? I usually get along with Annabelle during your games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie crossed her arms in a bratty fashion, \"She wore the same nightgown I did to Ava's sleepover birthday party last weekend. It was AFTER I told her I was going to wear it the day before...and she STILL brought the same one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad laughed knowing little girl social circles were filled with complicated dynamics.  If two boys would have shown up in the same pajamas they would have ended up best friends. He didn't attempt to understand why they were fighting and laughed, \"Okay.  I'll do my best to give her the cold shoulder during the tournament.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie added, \"And Brittney isn't talking to Evelyn anymore.  When she came out in her new swimsuit Evelyn didn't say she looked cute. So they aren't BFF's anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was glad for the update. Now he'd understand why Brittney and Evelyn weren't besties anymore.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie added a few more updates on her social life so Brad knew some inside jokes to talk about in the dugout. Meanwhile, Rick approached and shook his friend's hand with a smirk, \"Are you ready to become my daughter for the next few days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad confidently nodded his head up and down, \"Hell yea buddy!  I'm going to bring the MVP trophy back to our hotel room every day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick laughed, \"I know you are the best girl out there.  But I can't give you the MVP trophy EVERY game.  As the coach, it makes me look bad if I'm always giving it to my daughter.  I've heard the other girl's parents complaining that I'm not being fair with choosing who the MVP is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie was looking forward to using the transformation booth and interrupted the adults, \"Ummm?  Can I become a doggy now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded, 'Sure. Karen helped me fix the fence where you sneaked out last time.  We got you a new bag of your favorite dog food too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie replied, \"Thanks. Throw it in my Dad's truck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was confused.  He assumed Sadie would be lounging around the ranch as a dog while he was taking her place.  Rick quickly explained, \"Plans changed.  Sadie found a doggy day care that she's super excited to stay at this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie's eyes perked up, \"It's soooo cool.  There's lots of other dogs there. The outside play area is huge and there's tons of obstacles to jump around. There's personal dog trainers during the day so I can practice obeying commands.  My Dad says if I learn all the tricks that I can enter a dog show soon.  I'll get groomed every day and I even get my own kennel at night.  There's a cute little doggy bed in each one. They'll give me my own bone to chew on while I\"m caged up at night.  I can't wait!  It will be the most realistic doggy experience I've ever had so far!\"  Sadie excitedly ran off to the shed saying, \"I'll leave my outfit inside the transformation booth so you can wear it on once you're me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad mumbled, \"Thanks.\"  He shook his head knowing he'd soon be wearing Sadie's play skirt and pink top with the words <i>Born-to-Dance</i> in glittery letters. In the background was a silhouette of a ballerina in a tutu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick let out a whistle seeing a college woman approaching with pornstar-like proportions, \"Who's the babe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad winked, \"That's Karen. I designed that body for her.  She wasn't thrilled about how big I made her tits but I couldn't resist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she was on a fashion show runway, Karen swayed her hips as she approached, \"Hi Rick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick drooled seeing how sexy Karen looked.  They told her about the change of plans and how she didn't have to watch Sadie while they were gone.  Karen smiled, \"In that case, I might hit the college bars with this body tonight and see if I can wake up in a dorm room or a frat house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad had programmed Karen's college body to have extra sensitive sexual desires.  He hugged his wife and planted a kiss on her lips, \"Before I lose my dick for the next few days, I'm going to need one more round with that sexy body of yours.  You in Rick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren licked her lips looking forward to being screwed by two guys at the same time.  She wiggled her DD's at Rick in a sexy manner enticing him to join their fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick high-fived his best friend, \"Oh yea!  I'm always up for a double-team.  We gotta make it fast so you can use the transformation booth to become Sadie so we can hit the road. The first softball game is this afternoon and it's a 2 hour drive. The coach and the team's star-girl can't show up late to the first game!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the first double header, the temporary father-daughter duo checked into their hotel room. Brad sprawled out on the bed closest to the balcony. Sadie's softball uniform was filthy head-to-toe after playing two games today. Dirt flaked off onto the bed spread as Brad giggled, \"Man it feels great to be in uniform again! Today was a blast. I went 5 for 5 in the first game and 4 for 5 in the second game. At this pace I'll win the award for highest tournament batting average.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was still sweating from lugging his daughter's two huge suitcases and his own bag. After he set them on the floor, Brad winked, \"Thanks for carrying my luggage in DAD. I would have helped but these skinny arms can't carry stuff that heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick suggested, \"Speaking of your skinny arms, you'd have a perfect batting average if you wouldn't have tried to win the second game with one swing. I still don't know why you insist on trying to hit home runs with Sadie's body? With 1 out and the bases loaded in the last inning, you popped out to SHORT left field. A simple ground ball anywhere would have given us the go-ahead run.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded, \"I couldn't resist. The pitch was right down the middle and swung for the fences. That lucky brat didn't even move. It landed right in her glove. I still can't believe that little bitch caught the ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick gave a disapproving glare hearing such foul language coming from his daughter's mouth. Brad laughed, \"What? It's just you and me in here buddy. It feels good to talk like normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick laughed, \"You're lucky Samantha pulled though and got a base hit to win the game for us after you choked. It's fine to talk normal while we are alone but you really need to watch your language outside of the hotel room. Don't forget you're only an 8 year old girl now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded, \"I know the drill buddy. During tomorrow's double header I'll be doing my best Sadie impression. I won't have to worry about going into public again until then. This will be fun to chill out in the hotel room like old times. Just two buddies hanging out like normal.\" Brad grabbed the remote and started looking at the TV guide channel, \"I'm sure we can find a game to watch. Check it out dude, we have all the movie channels. I'll find a good horror movie we can watch later.\" After scrolling down, Brad let out a giggle, \"Holy shit man! We have the Playboy Channel for free! This hotel rocks! Throw me a beer from the mini-fridge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick laughed, \"Yea right. You're not drinking beer in my daughter's body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww. Come on buddy? Just one? With Sadie's tiny body that's all I'd need to get drunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick took a fatherly tone, \"Absolutely NOT. If somebody smells alcohol on your breath I'd get thrown in jail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's going to smell my breath? We're just going to chill in the hotel room all night. It's only 4 o'clock. There won't be a good game on the sports channel for a few more hours. That gives us plenty of time to watch a movie first.\" Brad selected the Playboy channel excitedly, \"Hell yea buddy! A Lesbian threesome in Paris is just about to start!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme that remote!\" Rick snatched it out of Brad's hands and scolded, \"I'm not watching porn with you while you're in my daughter's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. But why'd you shut the TV off? At least put on a good horror movie or something.\" Brad complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick laughed, \"You agreed to take Sadie's place. That means you gotta do everything she would if she was here. You can't just sit in the hotel room the entire time between softball games. Neither can I. As the coach, I need to mingle with the other parents at the hotel.\" Rick opened their balcony sliding door that overlooked the pool. The sounds of girls laughing and splashing in the water park echoed throughout the open area. Rick told Brad, \"Come take a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad got off the bed and stood on the balcony. He saw all the girls from Sadie's softball team and all the other teams had already changed into their swimsuits and were having fun. Brad's eyes got wide, \"Oh shit dude. You aren't going to make me go down there are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick nodded, \"You have to. The real Sadie would have changed into her swimsuit and joined her friends within seconds of checking into the hotel. If you are going to pull off being her, you need to do the things she does. It's always the same at these tournaments. The girls swim until dinner while the parents sit around and have a few drinks. Everybody eats dinner around the pool chairs so the girls can keep splashing around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad ran his hands up and down the sides of Sadie's body, 'Awww. But I really like wearing this uniform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to slip into one of Sadie's swimsuits and meet her friends down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FINE. I can handle a few hours of the water park. It might be fun to go down some slides.  But after dinner, we're coming back to the hotel room to watch the game right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick laughed, \"Sorry sweetheart. After dinner, you'll have to shower off all the chlorine.  Sadie's hair will turn green if you don't stay up on hygiene.  Then my daughter will meet up with all her friends in the sitting area by the pool or in somebody's hotel room to hang out.\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad rolled his eyes sarcastically, \"Yay.  I can't wait to sit around and talk about clothes and boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick suggested, \"Speaking of clothes. Make sure to wear something cute.  It's always a fashion show with girls at these out-of-town tournaments.  It's not like when we were little boys and we showed up in dirty shorts and no shirt. The real Sadie would never leave the hotel room without looking her best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad grumbled, \"That explains the two suitcases of supplies Sadie packed for me.\"  After doing some quick math, Brad announced, \"Okay. This shouldn't be too bad.  I splash around in the water park for a few hours with Sadie's friends.  We eat dinner.  I shower and go hang out with her friends long enough to BS and have some laughs.  I'll pretend I'm tired and want to go to sleep.  I could be back in the room by game time and watch sports all night.  I can handle this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick shook his head, \"You can't come back to the hotel room until I track you down wherever you're hanging out with Sadie's friends.  Then you need to beg me to stay up for another hour because you're having so much fun. And then you need to beg me to have a sleepover in one of Sadie's friend's rooms.  Typically, 3 or 4 girls pile into each other's rooms.  You need to make sure never to invite Sadie's friends back to our room.  Having you as my wingman will make sure I have privacy in here every night to bring home a single-mom.  There's hundreds of them around from other softball teams.  I trust you'll be a good buddy and make sure to stay some place else every night we are here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad crossed his arms.  When he agreed to spend 4 days and 3 nights as Sadie, he never thought he'd be having sleepovers with her friends.  He assumed after the softball games that Rick and him would hang out like old times and watch movies and sports.  He forgot that Rick was horny and wanted to bang as many moms as he could on this mini-vacation.  Brad didn't blame him.  Had the roles been reversed he'd want his daughter out of the hotel room every night too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing screams of laughter echoing from the water park, Brad couldn't help but hear how much fun all the girls were having.  He figured it might be exciting to splash around and go on all the water slides.  Sadie's body was full of energy and he needed to burn some off.  He told Rick, \"Okay DAD.  I'll be your wingman. I guess it's the least I can do for letting me take your daughter's place on the diamond for this tournament.  It's been a blast playing ball again.  I just wish I could stay in Sadie's uniform the whole time. It feels great to wear it around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick laughed, \"You can't go down to the water park in that. You'll need to wear one of swimsuits sweetheart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Brad emerged from the bathroom wearing one of Sadie's pink one-piece swimsuits. He'd never worn such an item with a female body before. He tugged on the straps and pulled on the spandex materiel as it snapped back into place, \"Damn this thing is tight! It's like a second skin.\"  He bent over and stretched out amazed at how it stayed into place so well.  He ran his hands over his backside laughing, \"It would be nice if your daughter's ass had any padding on it. I never realized how bony her little butt was until I became her. It's not like when we transform into old chicks and hang out with the retired crew. My Charlotte-ass has tons of cushion to sit on with those huge thunder thighs. It's always a comfy with all the extra padding. But with your daughter's body, every time I sit down to pee I gotta brace myself with my arms on the edge of the seat so I don't risk falling in.\" Brad rubbed his bottom again laughing, \"There's nothing to sit on back here but skin and bone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick agreed, \"No kidding. My Ruth-ass feels great to sit on too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Brad did the front splits putting his legs in a very unladylike fashion facing the mirror.  Looking down at the reflection of his crotch he mentioned, \"That's cool. There's no camel toe at all. That extra fabric around the pussy area really helps conceal things well. I was worried there'd be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick interrupted, \"Ahem. You are in my 8 year old daughter's body! You gotta stop using slang terms like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry DAD.\" Brad laughed, \"I'm just getting used to wearing a girl's swimsuit. It's weird to have bare thighs. Thank goodness Sadie isn't old enough to worry about trimming her bikini line. I'm not sure how to use a razor around lady parts yet. I better figure that out if I ever wear a swimsuit as Charlotte.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick laughed, \"It's not that difficult.  I did it a few times on that weekend getaway with Earl when I was Ruth. Anyways, you need to get down to the water park SADIE. And don't forget a cover-up dress to wear through the hallways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad sarcastically replied, \"Yes Daddy.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first Brad wasn't thrilled about having to socialize with Sadie's friends off the softball diamond.  But after a few minutes of splashing around in the pool, he started to enjoy the refreshing cool water.  The sun was beating down on the water park and being in the water felt refreshing.  Multiple pools were filled with girls from all the different teams staying at the hotel for the tournament.  He started hanging out with Sadie's friends but managed to mingle with a few other girls from their rival teams.  He inadvertently ended up making a new friend. Her name was Ashley and she loved going down the water slides as much as Brad did.  The other girls on Sadie's team were more concerned about talking and pointing out all the cute brothers who were around.  Brad wanted to take advantage of being a kid again.  It was mostly boys that were going down the slides.  Brad ended up spending most of his time with Ashley giggling and running up the stairs together after each slide into the pool.  Brad was pleased when Ashley invited him for a sleepover in her hotel room tonight.  He knew he was supposed to be a wingman for Rick and had strict orders NOT to bring the sleepover to their hotel room.  Rick had his eyes on some single Moms and wanted the place to himself for some bedroom fun.   Brad graciously accepted Ashley's offer knowing Rick would be pleased his daughter found a place to crash tonight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen dinner time came around, Brad joined back with Sadie's friends for poolside pizza.  He couldn't help but notice he was getting the cold shoulder from the rest of the girls on her team.  It certainly wasn't from his performance on the ball field today.  He nearly had a perfect batting average and threw tons of runners out at first.  He quickly realized it was because he was hanging out at the water park with a member from a rival team. After spending lots of time this season taking Sadie's place, he was familiar with how little girl's social circles worked. He hoped he wasn't messing up Sadie's social status for her. He told everybody about Ashley and how nice she was.  The other girls just nodded with snotty glares and didn't seem interested in Sadie's new friend.  After pizza, Brad tried to invite Sadie's friends to hit the water slides again with Ashley.  They denied the request saying they wanted to wade in the pool and talk.  Not wanting to sit around and gossip about boys, Brad blew off Sadie's friends and joined back up with Ashley on the water slides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Brad returned to the hotel room to shower up.  Sadie's one piece swimsuit was still wet and dripping onto the floor as he entered.  He saw Rick was ready to hit the hotel bar and putting cologne on, \"Good luck finding some ass tonight buddy. There's tons of sexy Moms out there with great tits.  Don't worry about me.  I'm crashing in Ashley's room. I'm going to want details on the slut you bang tonight. The craziest and most wild sex always happens in hotel rooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick smirked seeing his daughter talking so crass, \"Thanks for being a good wingman. But you'll have to wait until your back to normal for details.  I'm not going to discuss my sexual adventures with my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad struck a sassy pose, \"Don't be a selfish jerk. I'm your best friend. I'm not really your daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But you're in her body.\" Rick reminded, \"And as long as you are a little girl, it just feels weird to discuss adult stuff like that with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad rolled his eyes, \"Fine. But when I get my dick back, I wanna hear everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick agreed, \"Deal. Don't forget to wash all that chlorine out of Sadie's hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded as he headed towards the bathroom, \"I know. That's what I'm doing now.  I'll use conditioner like you said. It's going to feel nice to get cleaned up.\"  Brad had gotten accustomed to wearing a tight girl's swimsuit all afternoon.  He'd learned from watching others making adjustments to the material around their bottoms if it got wedged into an uncomfortable position.  He quickly ran his fingers inside the spandex material of his crotch letting it snap back properly into place laughing, \"I didn't realize there was any truth to that old saying....it turns out having sand in your pussy is super annoying.  It's weird because there's no sand at the water park but tiny specks keep coming out. My tiny snapper is going to need a good once-over in the shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick laughed hearing his daughter use such a slang term to describe her anatomy.  He got a kick out of being able to talk with Sadie as a friend rather than a father. He pointed out the obvious, \"It's not sand you moron. It's dirt from the softball field.  Maybe your snapper wouldn't hurt if you stopped sliding head first.  Sadie told you to stop doing that.  She's sick of the bumps and bruises she has to deal with when she gets her body back.  That's where the tiny pieces of dirt came from.  It gets under the front of your uniform and makes it way down into your panties when you slide head first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad felt dumb for not realizing that. He crossed his arms with a snotty laugh, \"Nice try. I'm NOT sliding feet-first if the play is going to be close.  Hustling is habit from my glory days playing baseball. Plus, sliding head first is WAY easier without a dick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the coach, Rick appreciated Brad's hustle and sliding around the bases. However, he didn't want his real daughter to be upset when she got her body back in a bad condition.  He told his friend, \"Dude. It's little girls softball.  Half of them can barely throw the ball across the infield.  You haven't needed to slide head first yet to beat out a tag.  You're just doing it because it's fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad stuck out his tongue, \"Whatever. Don't you have a single Mom to chase down and trick into the sack...DAD.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick nodded as he grabbed his wallet and headed to the hotel bar, \"Don't forget to wear something cute to run around in with Sadie's friends until bedtime.  You know she'd be devastated if her hair wasn't done perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad grumbled knowing it would be another hour until he finished getting Sadie's body ready.  He would have much rather sat around watching sports all night than go hang out with her friends.  He started the shower water and wiggled off the one-piece swimsuit. While hanging it  on the towel rack to dry, he caught a glimpse of Sadie's naked reflection in the mirror and thought, \"<i>Son of a bitch!  I really should have worn sun screen</i>!\"  He turned back and forth in the mirror seeing the difference in skin tone that was outlined of the exact shape of Sadie's swimsuit. There was even a crisscross pattern on his back from the straps.  He spent 3 hours outside in the blistering heat and Sadie's skin was starting to show signs of burning. He looked down laughing at how white her stomach and chest were compared to her arms, legs and all the other skin exposed to the sun. He made a mental note to wear the most powerful sunscreen he could find at the water park tomorrow after the softball games.  He knew Sadie wouldn't be happy to get her body back sunburned. He was already on thin ice after repeatedly giving her body back with bumps and bruises from sliding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n45 minute later, Brad turned back and forth in the mirror thinking, \"<i>This is gotta be okay right</i>?\"  He wore a sundress that Sadie packed for him. He managed to blow dry his hair and use her curling iron to add some bounce.  He clipped in a few barrettes with bows to hold his hair out of his eyes. The hardest part was finding matching shoes.  Sadie packed 10 pairs of varying styles.  He wished he'd gotten a quick tutorial on which shoes to wear with what outfit.  He settled on a sparkly pair of silver flats that he thought went cute with Sadie's dress.  He was tired of primping her body and ready to get out of the hotel room. He packed an overnight bag with a nightgown and toothbrush for the sleepover in Ashley's room. The last item he crammed into Sadie's backpack was Mr. Bear.  Brad rolled his eyes knowing it was Sadie's favorite stuffed animal and she'd never be caught sleeping without it.  Since he was living her life for the time being he had to do his best to act like her.  He hadn't slept with a stuffed animal since he was a little boy.  He knew girls slept with them much longer in life. He even knew some grown women who still had their favorite stuffed animal in their bed at night.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brad saw Rick's truck pulling up. He got excited knowing when Rick came around it meant he'd transform into his daughter to play softball.  Brad asked his wife, \"Whoa?  Is it Tuesday already?  I didn't realize I was becoming Sadie today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren was equally confused, \"It's only Monday. Your weekly stint as a little girl shouldn't be until tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick parked his truck. His daughter Sadie looked excited as she ran off to the shed into the transformation booth.  Moments later a golden retriever excitedly ran out.  Sadie had obviously transformed into her show-dog form. Rick clipped a blue collar on and pet his canine-daughter, \"Good boy.\" Sadie let out a bark and started sniffing and exploring the farm. She found a tree and lifted her leg to mark her territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad asked Rick, \"So buddy? What's going on?  I'm not supposed to be your daughter until tomorrow? Is there a softball practice I didn't know about?  Ohh! Is there a game today?  I can't wait to put on a uniform again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick smirked, \"There's no game but you'll certainly get to wear a uniform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad went into the transformation booth and nodded, \"Cool. Is there team pictures?  Can we at least have some batting practice if I'm going to stuck as Sadie for awhile?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformation booth activated.  Brad's voice changed into Sadie's as he asked, \"So DAD, where's my uniform?  I'm drowning in my adult man clothes in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick opened the door and handed Brad the clothing Sadie was wearing before becoming a dog.  With no other clothes to fit he was forced to put them on.  He emerged wearing Sadie's plaid skirt, white top, and mary jane shoes. He crossed his arms looking up at Rick, \"When you said I'd get to wear a uniform I didn't think you meant Sadie's school uniform.  What's going on?  Do you need me to take a test for her or something?  That's kind of cheating isn't it?  I have a masters degree and would easily ace a 2nd grade test. Should I get a few wrong on purpose so they don't get suspicious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick shook his head, \"No. Do your best.  Sadie is a straight A student and I expect you to keep up her reputation at school for the next week.\"  Rick found Brad's male profile on the screen and started typing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked on in confusion, \"Dude?  You just locked me in your daughter's body for 7 days!\"  Brad attempted to unlock his profile but couldn't hack in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick nodded, \"I needed to make sure you didn't get cold feet and flake out on our deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What deal?\"  Brad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie curled up near a tree and had her head arched underneath.  Rick ran up scolding, \"BAD DOG.\" Sadie let out a whimper as Rick grabbed her snout, \"We talked about this.  You can't get caught sitting around licking your dog penis.  If a judge sees you doing that you'll lose for sure at the dog show.\" Sadie nodded and ran off to explore. Rick rolled his eyes, \"I should have never let her become a boy-dog. I caught her doing that 3 times last week on the drive home from obedience school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad laughed, \"Oh come on. If you could lick your own balls you'd do it too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick laughed, \"I suppose. But I wish her canine alter-ego would have been female. Then I wouldn't have to worry about her doing that all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad explained, \"If she was a bitch you'd have to worry about her getting pregnant by a real dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick shook his head at the thought of his daughter being impregnated in canine form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad spun around causing Sadie's plaid skirt to twirl.  After a few spins, he asked, \"So? Back to this whole locking me in your daughter's body thing. Why the hell am I a little girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick glared, \"Your memory sucks.  You agreed to do this months ago.  I promised Sadie I'd take her to the national dog show.  We will be gone for a week. That means you'll be taking my daughter's place at school and all her activities. You'll need to live her life for her while we are gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad remembered the agreement. He never thought Sadie would be trained well enough to qualify for the nationals and figured it wouldn't ever happen. It was a trade-off he agreed to do for being allowed to take Sadie's place on softball game days.  He loved playing ball again and getting on the diamond like old times. He gulped, \"Oh shit. That means I'll be staying with your super-bitch ex-wife the entire time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. But you better call her Mommy instead of that.\"  Rick laughed, \"Sadie recorded lots of videos on her iPad for you.  Now that you have her facial features you'll be able to unlock it and watch them.  She has instructions and details about what you are supposed to do each day.  For example, you'll make my daughter look bad if you don't brush up on her gymnastic moves before practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad groaned, \"Gymnastics? I'm all about wearing Sadie's softball uniform.  But a leotard and tights?  Come on dude. You aren't really going to make me do this are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick nodded, \"Yes. Gymnastics is twice a week in the evening plus 2 hours on Saturday so you better watch the video Sadie made for you.  She shows you how to do all the moves and stretches.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick sighed knowing there was no way out of this, \"Fine. But what about your super bitchy ex-wife?  I'm just supposed to act normal around her and pretend she isn't the most evil woman in the world?  There's no way I can ever forget what she did to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick appreciated his friend's gesture but explained, \"Don't forget she's your mother for the time being. As much as I hate her, you're going to have to do your best to put a smile on and pretend to be her daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad joked, \"She does have a great ass though.  I wonder if she walks around in her bra and panties at home?  Is there still only one bathroom at your old house?  That means I'll have to share mirror space with her while we get ready in the morning.  Mothers and daughters do that right?  They don't care if the other one is in the bathroom while they get ready.  DUDE...I'm going to get to see your ex-wife's tits everyday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick laughed, \"Don't get caught staring. Although you're really a guy on the inside, on the outside you are a 9 year old girl. You can't stare and drool over your mommy the entire time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad giggled, \"I'll try my best but I can't guarantee anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren walked up smiling at her husband, \"Hey there cutie.  That school girl outfit looks adorable on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smirked, \"Thanks. You knew about this didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren chuckled, \"Of course I did. I have a much better memory than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do for a week while I'm living Sadie's life?\"  Brad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be around to check up on you.  Thanks to the transformation booth, I can become anybody or anything. I could be a substitute teacher one day...a janitor...the new kid in school...a neighbor walking by...I'm pretty sure your MOMMY is still a huge slut.  I might turn myself into a guy and have a one-night stand with her.  If you hear noises from her bedroom don't come knocking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad laughed, \"I'll keep an eye out for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick whistled as Sadie came running up wagging her tail.  Rick told Brad, \"This took longer than I thought.  We need to leave now or you'll be tardy for your first day of 2nd grade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad joked, \"First day?  I graduated 2nd grade years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick explained, \"It's a 15 minute drive.  I'd suggest watching the first video Sadie made for you so you know where to go and how to act at school as her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren bent down to hug her husband, \"Good luck sweetie! I'll see you soon.  Maybe even today sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad hopped up into Rick's truck. Karen saw the way Brad got in the high vehicle and said, \"A bit of advice from one girl to another.  When you climb up into truck with a skirt on you need to be more cautious.  You just flashed your panties to world. And when you get out you can't jump down or the air will blow your skirt up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad appreciated the advice.  Knowing he'd have to get out of the truck at Sadie's school, he made a mental note to be more careful.  The image in his head of a skirt blowing up made him laugh thinking that trampolines were out of the question while wearing a skirt too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie stuck her head out of the window as Rick drove off.  Brad got to work watching the instructional video Sadie made for him about her school schedule.  It was nice to catch up on her friends and teacher's names.  He only really knew the girls on her softball team.  He found out where her desk was and where she kept all her stuff.  He was glad Sadie made videos for him so he didn't look like an idiot trying to impersonate her. He was also fortunate Sadie went to a private school.  That way he didn't have to worry about choosing outfits every day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith extra time left, Brad flipped through the video library and opened up one entitled gymnastics.  He advanced the video to watch the stretches and moves Sadie explained.  Brad was amazed to see her doing the splits and holding her leg up against her head while standing up.  In the next move, Sadie sat down and put both her legs behind her head demonstrating another stretch.  Brad thought, \"<i>Holy shit this body is flexible!</i>\" He started looking forward to testing out gymnastic moves.  He wasn't thrilled about having to wear a leotard but was excited to try out Sadie's bendy body.  Brad found another video labeled Friday-night sleepover at Anna's house.  Brad groaned finding out he'd be spending the night at one of Sadie's friends house.  In the video she explained which nightgown to wear and what stuffed animals and other supplies to bring.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick parked the car and smirked at Brad, \"Give daddy a kiss goodbye sweetie.  I won't see you for over a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith other parents and children around, Brad had no choice but to give Rick a big hug and kiss.  He carefully slid out of the truck so his skirt didn't flare up and headed into Sadie's school.</span></div></div>",

Since Brad's cover was blown on the car ride home last night, there was no need for him to pretend to be Rick's daughter any longer. He was glad he didn't have to get Sadie's body ready for the day. It was only a few more hours until he could use the transformation booth again.  He didn't bother running a brush through the messy bed-hair he awoke with. He was still wearing one of Rick's jerseys that he wore to bed last night. On Sadie's tiny frame, it hung way down past Brad's ankles looking more like a dress. Sadie was notorious for wearing her father's oversize sweat shirts and t-shirts around the house. Rick didn't think twice when Brad raided his closet for something to sleep in knowing his friend probably didn't want to wear one of Sadie's princess nightgowns to bed last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick got a kick out of hearing his daughter's voice yelling at the TV and rooting for the team. Sadie wasn't into sports and had a much gentler demeanor when it came to competition. What he didn't care for was hearing such crass language coming from his daughter's mouth. He continually had to ask Brad not to swear so much while in his daughter's body. Brad tried to bite his lip but kept slipping during high intensity plays on the TV screen. Before this morning, he'd never high-fived his daughter before or did a chest bump in celebration...which turned out to be a mistake after Brad went tumbling backwards from the chest bump. Weighing less than 50 pounds in Sadie's body, he bounced like a ball off of Rick's adult chest and landed hard on the floor. Brad had to hold back tears that instinctively came from such a fall while inside an 8 year old body. He acted tough as he climbed back up onto the couch for a more comfortable sitting position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was concerned for his daughter's body and snapped into parenting mode. He went to Sadie's aid expecting a painful crying session to ensue and put his arm around Brad, \"OMG! That was Daddy's fault. I'm so sorry. Are you okay lady bug?\" Rick picked up Brad out of habit ready to console his about-to-be crying daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad kept his tough-girl act and shoved Rick away, \"Put me down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick let go and asked, \"Well? Are you okay lady bug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad joked, \"I...WAS until you started calling me lady bug. Save that sappy stuff for when Sadie has her body back. I still have my guy-brain you know. I'm not going to cry over a little fall like that. It barely hurt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick slid away to the other side of the couch, \"Sorry buddy. It was just a reaction seeing my daughter's body tumble like that. Are you sure you are okay? That looked painful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad rubbed his slightly sore bottom explaining, \"I'm fine. It's just a stinger. It wouldn't have been so bad if your daughter's ass had any padding on it. I never realized how bony her little butt was until I became her. It's not like when we transform into old chicks and hang out with the retired crew. My Charlotte-ass has tons of cushion to sit on with those huge thunder thighs. It's always a comfy to sit on my fleshy Charlotte butt. But with your daughter's body, every time I sit down to pee I gotta brace myself with my arms on the edge of the seat so I don't risk falling in.\" Brad rubbed his bottom again complaining, \"There's nothing to sit on back here but skin and bone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick laughed, \"I'm not sure what you expected when you turned yourself into an 8 year old girl? You know it will be years until Sadie's thighs start maturing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad stood up with his hands on his hips and struck a pose in the oversize jersey. He purposefully stuck out his butt to the side joking, \"Fortunately for Sadie, she has great family genes. As much as we all hate your super bitch ex-wife, she does have an amazing ass. Odds are your daughter will end up with one looking just as great as hers.\" Brad laughed while rubbing his sore bony butt, \"Someday Sadie will have plenty of cushion back here to sit on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick rolled his eyes, \"Would you please stop standing like that with my daughter's body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad plopped down on the couch again and took a swig of root beer and a handful of pretzels. He noticed Rick was staring at him with a weird look, \"What? Is there something in my teeth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick snapped out of it, \"Sorry. When you brought up my ex-wife it made me realize how much Sadie looks like her. They have the same eyes, facial features and hair. It just sucks that every time I look at my daughter that she reminds me of her crazy bitch of a mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad joked, \"We have a transformation booth that could fix that. Sadie could change her hair color, the shape of her eyes or make her cheeks different. You could choose an entirely new face for her if you wanted to whenever she's around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick kept a proud smile, \"Yea right. I'd never do that. I love my daughter the way she is and wouldn't change a single thing about her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad replied, \"Dude. You gotta stop looking at me like that. It's freaky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick smirked, \"Gimme a break. You are in my daughter's body. I always smile at my little lady bug like that. There's never been a middle-aged man looking back at me through her eyes before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad knew a way to ruin the Kodak moment and lifted up his leg letting out a long fart, \"Whoa! That's going to be a stinky one! Girl farts are the worst!\" Brad used the oversized jersey to waft the smell towards Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick plugged his nose with a look of disapproval. He'd never seen his precious little girl perform such a crass act like that before. He had to remind himself it was really Brad inside his daughter's body. Brad was famous for his room clearing farts. Rick started laughing and suggested, \"Careful sweetie. You might want to check your panties after that one! It sounded a bit watery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be all this root beer and pretzels I've been eating all day. Sadie's body obviously isn't used to eating food like this,\" Brad replied while taking another swig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick sarcastically mentioned, \"Thanks a lot. You know I can't un-see that. I'll never be able to look at Sadie the same way now that I've seen her so something so disgusting like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. Then that means you won't look at me with those stupid-father eyes anymore. Mission accomplished!\" Brad lifted his butt again and let out an aftershock fart that lasted a second. He giggled, \"Yep! It's gotta be the pretzels giving me all this fart power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick groaned, \"Ugh! Go take a shit or something!\" Just then, Rick's cell phone buzzed. He saw the incoming text was from his ex-wife, \"To speak of the devil.\" Rick didn't bother reading the message and threw his phone across the couch, \"I don't care what that bitch has to say to me. I have Sadie for another 2 hours today. She's not supposed to bother me during our time together.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they continued watching the game, Rick's cell phone buzzed numerous times. Eventually, it started ringing with a call. Rick still ignored whatever his ex-wife wanted. Even though his real daughter was currently stuck as a cat chasing down mice at Brad and Karen's house, Rick stayed to the principle of not being bothered during his time with Sadie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the front door swung open. Rick's ex-wife let herself in walked up glaring, \"Is your phone broken or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad had a perfect view of her backside and pointed while mouthing to Rick, \"<i>I told you she had a great ass!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick snickered and quickly reminded Brad who just barged in, \"Sadie...your MOTHER is here....Apparently she doesn't think she has to knock anymore. Would you please remind your mother that she doesn't live here anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad shook out of his daze checking out Rick's ex wife's butt and snapped into little-girl mode, \"Mommy!\" He stood up for a hug as pretzel crumbs fell from the oversize jersey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ex was furious at her daughter's appearance, \"WHAT are you wearing? Have you even showered today? Your hair is a complete mess! Your skin looks greasy! Your breath smells terrible!\" She turned back to Rick complaining, \"Is this what you call taking care of your daughter? You just sit around and let her drink root beer and pretzels all day? You didn't even make her brush her teeth this morning? Ugh! It smells awful in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad knew one of his lingering girl-farts was still in the air. Rick defended himself, \"I'm just spending time with my daughter! I was going to clean this place and make sure Sadie looked presentable before you picked her up! Why the hell are you here so early anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not early. I'm right on time. You know our plane for vacation leaves in a few hours. You agreed months ago in the custody hearing that I could pick Sadie up early today.\" She turned to face her daughter disgusted at her appearance, \"Ugh! Go and change out of your father's dingy jersey and put some of YOUR clothes on please sweetie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad shared a nervous look with Rick about the situation. Unless they could somehow ditch his ex-wife, it looked like Brad would be getting on a plane soon in Sadie's place. Brad replied, \"Yes Mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ex quickly changed her mind. She followed her daughter down the hallway as if she still lived here and pulled her into the bathroom, 'On second thought sweetie...there's no way I'm taking you into public looking so disheveled. You need to take a bath and don't forget to use conditioner. This will give me plenty of time to talk with your father while you're getting cleaned up.\" Brad watched in a daze as the tub water filled up fast. He still had another hour or so until he could use the transformation booth. He was hoping to avoid having to bathe Sadie's body before turning back to normal. Mommy left the bathroom momentarily and came back with a handful of clothes for her daughter to put on after taking a bath. She set them on the counter and instructed, \"Hands-up. I'll take your dirty clothes into the laundry room and start a load. I doubt your lazy father has done any laundry around here lately.  This place looks terrible ever since I moved out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad had no choice but to put his arms up as she pulled the oversized jersey over his head. He wiggled out of Sadie's panties and suddenly felt embarrassed to be standing naked. Even though he knew mothers saw their daughters naked all the time, it was still an awkward feeling. He attempted to get into the bath quickly to hide his dignity. His temporary mother noticed something and got concerned, \"Hold on! What happened to your butt?\" Brad stood still as she examined the bruise that formed on his left cheek. Brad couldn't explain the bruise with the truth about doing a chest bump with Rick earlier that caused him to fall down hard on the floor. Instead, Brad played ignorant explaining, \"I don't know mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ex looked at her daughter's bruise and groaned, 'I can't believe this! That bruise is going to stick out like crazy while you are wearing a swimsuit on vacation. It's below your pantie line!\"  She tore off down the hallway yelling, \"RICK! I can't believe you let our daughter get a bruise!\" As the former spouses erupted in an argument, Brad slipped into the tub.  He hoped Rick could handle this situation or else it was looking like he'd be going on vacation in Sadie's place.  Brad wondered if they could somehow swap places before the plane left.  Otherwise, he'd be forced to live as an 8 year old girl for an entire week!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brad snapped into character and smiled, \"Daddy!\"  He ran up as Rick swung his daughter's body around while giving a loving hug.  Karen gave a thumbs-up when Rick's back was to her letting Brad know his first official acting job as a little girl was going well.  Brad started talking fast like Sadie always did explaining how much fun it was to be babysat by Karen and all the things they did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick seemed to buy the act having no idea it was his best friend inside his daughter's body.  He held up an overnight bag full of clothes and told her, \"I'm glad you had fun sweetheart.  But instead of going home, how about staying here longer and playing with Karen?  Daddy was just asked out on a date tonight and I'd like to go.  I won't be back until you are in bed so you can have a sleepover here.  I brought your favorite nightgown, toothbrush, teddy bear and clothes for tomorrow. I know this was supposed to be our Daddy-daughter date night but this came up suddenly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was relieved he didn't have to spend the entire evening pretending to be Sadie in front of Rick.  While he was stuck like this, he'd be able to stay at his own house,  Brad nodded with the offer, \"Yay! I love sleepovers!  But aren't boys supposed to ask girls on dates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick's eyes got wide as he nervously stumbled to answer his daughter, \"It's uhh..complicated.  Can you go play while me and Karen talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad ran off and hid around the corner so he could listen to the conversation.  Karen asked about the last minute date, \"So? Who's the lucky girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick blushed, \"ME!  Sorry for the short notice to babysit Sadie overnight, but I just found out there's bingo tonight.  Harold invited my Mom.  Earl caught wind of the event and wanted to make it a double date.  Robert heard about it and obviously loves older women so he made it a triple-date.  The guys are picking up the ladies in an hour.  I need to hurry up and use the transformation booth to become Ruth.  Where's Brad?  He needs to join me as Charlotte tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren laughed hearing Rick wanted to transform into an older woman again to hang out with his mother and go on a date with Earl.  Since Brad was stuck as Sadie for the next day or so, there was no way he could use the transformation booth to become Charlotte and join the retirement crew for bingo.  Karen needed to come up with a lie about her husband's whereabouts and saw the swimsuits hanging up to dry from when they were swimming in the backyard pool.  Next to Sadie's one-piece she wore before turning herself into a cat, was Karen's swimsuit.  She pointed to hers explaining, \"You know how much Brad loves it when I wear him.  I transformed him into that cute number earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick examined the spandex item and rubbed the crotch knowing it would excite his friend, \"Wow.  You got really detailed this time when you turned Brad into clothing.  You even put tags on him so he really looks like a store bought item.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren lied, \"Yea...He wanted a genuine experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick suggested, \"Hmm.  Do you think I could fit into it once I transform into Ruth?  Brad is probably bored just hanging there and wants to be worn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren shook her head laughing, \"Even if you managed to squeeze your Ruth-thighs into him, the style of swimsuit that Brad became is entirely too revealing for a woman Ruth's age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick laughed, \"You're right.  When I'm Ruth I'm the same age as my mother.  I can't imagine seeing her wearing something like that.  But since Brad is stuck as a swimsuit, somebody else is going to need to be become Charlotte.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren offered, \"I'd love to be Charlotte tonight and join you.  Brad is always talking about how much fun it is to pretend to be a retired older woman.  But unfortunately, I'm babysitting YOUR daughter tonight.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick thought for a moment and suggested, \"I've already told Sadie all about the transformation booth.  She's really excited to use it.  She has a fascination with cats lately.  I'm sure she'd be thrilled to spend a day as one.  That way you wouldn't need to babysit her.  She'd be fine on her own as long as you left food and water out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was listening around the corner as Karen was equally surprised, \"Huh?  Wait a second!  Are you saying you wouldn't have a problem with your daughter turning herself into a cat?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick answered, \"Not at all.  In fact, I was surprised to show up and see Sadie in her normal body.  I thought for sure she'd sneak off to the shed and turn herself into a cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren realized that it was pointless for Brad to have transformed into Sadie, \"I wish you would have mentioned she knew about the transformation booth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad ran up with a bratty face and interrupted, \"Yea!  What the hell man?  This means I turned myself into your daughter for no fucking reason!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was confused seeing his daughter speaking with such language. It only took a moment to figure it out, \"Brad?  I thought you were that swimsuit over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad scowled, \"Nope.  I'm your daughter for the next day or so.  We thought you'd be pissed off if she used the transformation booth and I was going to pose as her until we could change her back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, 'Pepper' came walking up on all 4's.  She rubbed her fur on Rick's leg and purred.  Rick picked up his former daughter-turned-cat and scratched under her chin, \"Hey there sweetie!  You make such a cute cat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad crossed his arms, \"Okay.  Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren quickly looked up the bingo hall's website and smiled, \"We're in luck.  There's a children's daycare area.  It must be common for grandparents to bring their grandchildren to these things.  It looks like you can come along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren and Rick both got into the transformation booth.  Moments later, Charlotte and Ruth appeared in their old lady clothes.  Rick bent down to Brad and grabbed his hand, \"This is a great idea.  I've been meaning to introduce my granddaughter to Earl.  This will be the perfect opportunity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad seemed jealous that his wife got to wear his Charlotte body while he was stuck as a kid.  Karen suggested, \"Don't worry...SADIE...I'm sure there will be lots of toys and other children your age there too. I'm sure you'll make some friends while us senior citizens play some bingo!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rick pulled up to Earl's house and nervously adjusted his hair in the rear view mirror and psyched himself up, \"This is totally normal, I'm just your average divorced man with the body of an older woman going on a romantic retreat with another divorced man for the wild and crazy experience of it.  Just a normal weekend.\"  Rick took a deep breath and finally got out of the car and rang the doorbell.  Soon the tall, handsome, and grey haired Earl was in front of Rick with a suitcase and an outfit that looked like it belonged to a lumberjack.  Earl looked down at Rick and smiled, \"It's great to see you Ruth, after the catastrophe of how our first evening together ended I was afraid I'd never see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad to see you not in a coffin yet.\"  Rick said flashing back to Earl's minor heart attack that night in bed mid love making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hurt!  I'm practically a young man.  In fact I just got back from my doctor and got a full bill of health,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that, but did you pack your heart medicine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl laughed and rolled his eyes, \"I almost feel like I'm married again with all this nagging.  Yes, I have my pills and...\"  Earl smiled and leaned in as though to tell a secret, \"I even got a prescription for a certain little blue pill I think you'll appreciate very much.\"  Rick's eyes went wide and his face went red, Rick only knew one little blue pill and it certainly would make sure Earl could never be called 'little' for about 4 hours.  Earl saw Rick's reaction and gave 'Ruth' a kiss.  Instantly Rick felt something different.  Rick's whole body shivered with pleasure and his knees buckled and he actually had to hold close to Earl so he wouldn't fall over.  He'd heard stories of kisses making girls feel weak in the knees but he'd never taken that idea literally.  Was this the 'little surprise' that Karen had mentioned giving him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was so flustered by this addition he didn't even address it, he just go into the car with Earl and the two were off on a weekend getaway to a cabin on the lake.  As the drive continued on the topic eventually got personal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been wanting to go to the lakehouse for months, but I never could manage to make myself go.  It was always a place I wanted to share with someone special.  Even my ex near the end of the relationship made both me and that place feel not special.  That's why I'm glad I met you Ruth.  You're a special person Ruth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I wish my ex made me feel that way.\"  Rick found himself saying, he rarely opened up about his relationship with his ex-wife Natasha, especially with someone he barely knew, but somehow Rick felt a weird brotherhood with Earl.  Although maybe brotherhood wasn't the best word for 'Ruth's relationship with Earl.  Rick continued, \"My ex always made me feel like I was second place to them.  They always tried to change me, it took me way too long before I had enough self respect to finally walk away from that toxic relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry you feel that way Ruth.  I have a sixth sense about this sort of thing so listen to me when I say you were born a very special woman.  You are strong and indipendent who should feel second fiddle to anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick chuckled at being told he was 'born a very special woman' thinking of the Transformation Booth in the back of his mind, but he appreciated the sentiment.  The two continued to share awful ex stories and laughing about it causing the trip to go by in a flash and soon they were at the lake house by sundown.  As they grabbed their bags Earl said, \"You know, the sunset hear is just gorgeous, the master bedroom has the best view in the house.  Let's go ahead and check it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rick unpacked his bags of women's clothing Karen had helped him pack he caught a sight out of the corner of his eye, he saw Earl down one of those little blue pills.

But before that could happen Brad noticed he had a few unanswered texts coming from Rick's number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope he didn't get into too much trouble last night.\"  Brad said with a grin remembering how Rick and Sylvia left the bar with Earl and Harold.

Let's go get some breakfast, I have a weird craving for baked beans.\"  With that Karen got up and Brad shrugged as he put his phone away and didn't really think about Rick's situation until he got a text a week later telling Brad and Karen his plan.</span></div></div>",

I mean, do you intend to stay in that body for the rest of your days?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick had suggested that the let Earl in on their secret. He cared about Earl too much to just up and disappear from his life. He was nervous about telling him the truth about his daughter and original gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, probably a much YOUNGER version of this body, with a much stronger back!\u201d, replied Rick as he stretched out his aching back pushing his massive breasts out. \u201cTruth is, that I haven\u2019t been this happy in ages and I\u2019m quite happy in this body. Rick will have to make appearances occasionally for Sadie\u2019s sake but I haven\u2019t worked out all the details yet. I\u2019ll need to explain this to her as well, before this whole situation is spirals out of control. Earl will be here in about a few hours. I\u2019m going to let him use the booth first so he will believe the rest of my story. I figure he won\u2019t mind spending a few hours as a 25 year old version of himself. For now, I need to have a talk with Sadie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie gave her \u201cDad\u201d a hug and smiled. \u201cYou promise to let me try the machine after I meet your new husband?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he might not want to stick around after he hears the news, but yeah. You can try it out.\u201d, said Rick as he hugged his daughter. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m going to let you have your first choice though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I want to be a pony! Come on... Da... I mean Mom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick hugged his daughter tightly before heading back to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Rick greeted Earl at the front door and introduced him to Brad and Karen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for hosting us for the weekend! I haven\u2019t ridden a horse in ages and I\u2019m anxious to ride the trails with that fine stallion of yours.\u201d, said Earl before noticing the little girl entering the room. \u201cAnd who might this little girl be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick cleared his throat and put his hand on Earl\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s Sadie... my daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl did a double take and looked confused. \u201cI had assumed you daughter was a little... um... older.\u201d, replied Earl, after a long pause. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick took Earl\u2019s hand and smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s something I need to show you. Follow me and it will all make sense.\u201d, said Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad and Karen gave the married couple some privacy as \u201cRuth\u201d led her husband to the booth. After a quick scan of Earl\u2019s body, Rick made some changes on the computer, keeping his body between Earl and the monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick turned and kissed Earl on the lips as he gently pushed him toward the door. \u201cJust press the button in the booth and try not to be alarmed.\u201d, said Rick as he gave him his best smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl shrugged and pressed the button. Moments later, a very handsome and much younger Earl stepped out of the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat machine did wonders for my arthritis! I feel a good 30 years younger!\u201d, exclaimed Earl as he walked pain free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny you should mention that. You are 30 years younger!\u201d, said Rick as he pointed toward the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl gasped as he realized the image in the mirror was his own reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have believed it if I hadn\u2019t witnessed it for myself. I feel amazing! You\u2019re not going to wear out this body so easily!\u201d, said Earl as he embraced his \u201cwife\u201d and ran his hands along Rick\u2019s ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick could feel Earl\u2019s arousal as he pressed up against him.\u201d There\u2019s one more thing I need to tell you.\u201d, said Rick as he took a deep breath. \u201cThis isn\u2019t my real body or identity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the look of concern on his wife\u2019s face, Earl tightly gripped \u201cRuth\u2019s\u201d hand. \u201cJust tell me Darling. I\u2018m sure it\u2019s nothing to be upset about. You are quite stunning my dear, but it\u2019s not only your looks that I am attracted to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t always... um... female. I transformed into this body to help Sylvia. I\u2019m normally a 25 year old man.\u201d, said Rick as he looked at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl, without hesitation, smiled and gripped Rick\u2019s hand tightly. \u201cWell now, that body seems to fit you just fine. Are you happy as Ruth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick nodded his head and looked Earl in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, there\u2019s nothing left to talk about. I love you Ruth and I\u2019m anxious to put this new body to good use. How about we head to our room and I test this body\u2019s endurance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick... Make that Ruth, wiped a tear from her eye and embraced her husband. \u201cHow about I slip into something a bit... younger?\u201d, said Ruth with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot just yet. Like I said, you are an amazingly beautiful woman and I\u2019d like to leave things as they are for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth smiled and followed her young husband to the house.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been 6 months since Ruth had told Earl about the booth and the two of them were indeed keeping themselves busy.  They pulled up to Karen and Brad's house as Ruth was looking through her Rick phone.  \"So, after we transform we need to go visit my sister and have dinner with her.  We then have to go to a stupid work party but we don't have to stay long and we can get to bed.  Then tomorrow we turn back into Earl and Ruth and we'll spend the day with my mom and your brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes love, but don't you think it's time we start marking plans for Evelyn?  It's getting harder and harder to make up things when I talk to people about myself.  I can only say I 'just got into town and started dating Rick' for so long.\"  Earl said with a sigh.  Ruth pulled up their calendar, \"We can probably squeeze some time for Evelyn to make a recreational appearance, have you thought of joining the book club?  We never spend time together as Ruth and Evelyn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't exactly make those meetings sound fun, but it's a solid first step to a new identity.\"  Earl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last 6 months have been non stop for Earl and Rick.  Since Earl said he still loves and wants to be with Ruth, the two have been making it work.  But Rick couldn't drop off the face of the Earth so Ruth would turn into Rick every other day or so for work and other activities.  But Earl and Rick didn't like being apart during these times so Earl took on the identity of Evelyn.  A 30 year old woman with black hair with a streak of silver in it and as skinny as a post with two watermelon's on her chest.  So Earl was dating Ruth while Rick was dating Evelyn.  And the two were working through their busy schedules to try to make things work over the last half year.  They were making their regular trip to the shed with the Transformation Booth to turn into Rick and Evelyn, but they discovered the door was locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck, they never do that.\"  Earl said but a voice answered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because we have a very good reason to do so.\"  Earl and Ruth turned around to see Brad and Karen standing there with crossed arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what's this good reason, because we've got a schedule to keep to and Rick needs to make an appearance.\"  Ruth said holding up her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're cutting you off from the Booth.\"  Karen said, \"You two have got to slow it down with the double lives you're leading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We only do it because we have to, and we've been good about it.  We've got a schedule and we keep to it, we know what we're doing.\"  Earl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?  Really?\"  Brad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah really,\"  Ruth said getting a little testy now, \"Now unlock the door and let us use the Transformation Booth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do that if you can answer one question.  Where is Sadie?\"  Karen asked looking oddly cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's my daughter?  Of course I know where she is she's....she's...\"  Ruth's eyes slowly went wide as Earl mutter, \"Oh no.\"<br>\r\nRuth started breathing heavily, \"Oh my God, where is Sadie?\"  Ruth scrolled through her phone, \"She's not at mom's we took her their two weeks ago.  She's not with my sister, so she must be...did we forget to pick her up from school? Oh God!\"  Ruth was getting hysteric as tears started to well up in her eyes.  Earl held his wife close trying to calm her while trying not to panic himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow breaking through the sobs of the large woman, was the meowing of a kitten at her feet.  The cat seemed to be wrapping it's paws around Ruth's leg to give it a hug.  Ruth wiped the tears from her eyes and said, \"Sadie?\"  The black and white cat meowed a confirmation and Ruth picked up her daughter and hugged her tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad interrupted the family moment by saying, \"She's been here with me and Karen in that body for a week now and you're schedule and double lives have been so crazy you haven't noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry baby.\"  Ruth cried.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's been fine, we've been taking good care of her, although we did have to declaw her with the Booth after what she did to the couch.  But the point is, this can't go on anymore.  The two of you have to make a decision.  Are you Earl and Ruth, or Rick and Evelyn.  It can't be both.  We'll unlock the booth so you can turn Sadie back and talk it out.\"  Karen unlocked the shed and left the three to talk it out.</span></div></div>",

Ruth and Earl shared a tear filled kiss as they came to this decision.  Ruth finally broke the kiss when Sadie giggled in the background watching her now mom kissing her new dad, both of whom were old enough to be her grandparents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth sighed, \"Well, the easy part is over, now we just have to figure out what happens to Rick since I'm putting that part of my life behind me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can help out with that.\"  Brad said from the doorway, it seemed like he and Karen hadn't actually left and were just waiting outside of the door listening.  \"We think we can use the booth to rewrite reality.  We haven't really messed with it because it really drains the machine if we read the instructions correctly.  You'll all have to get in the booth for the changes to take place, but I gotta be honest, I don't know if you'll be able to use the booth again for a long long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth and Earl didn't even need to give it a second thought, they were in and Sadie, while disappointed she wouldn't be able to turn into kitty, puppy, or pony again, agreed with Ruth and Earl.  They three stepped into the Booth and Karen and Brad got to work.  It was complicated work setting the Booth's reality settings to work on three people at the same time, but it was the only way.  After almost an hour of typing and tinkering, the Booth sprang to life.  It shook and made more noises than it had ever made, but soon it's job was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Booth door opened and Earl, Ruth, and Sadie stepped out to a new life.  Not only had they successfully erased Rick from the map, but Ruth had a full backstory with a family history and making it so that Earl was the one who fathered Sadie and Ruth had given birth to her.  Brad and Karen had also given Ruth and Earl a little treat of making them in their 40s in perfect health and would age slowly as opposed to nearly 60 with heart problems like before.  As the three stepped out and looked at Ruth and Earl's new bodies the Booth gave a shudder and the screen went blank.  Brad and Karen tried to tinker with the Booth, but it wasn't springing back to life.  It seemed that massive reality rewrite had taken everything out of it.  Brad and Karen simply shrugged off the loss of the miraculous Booth.  They'd had their fun and figured it was easy come easy go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No going back.\"  Earl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't even considering it.\"  Ruth said giving her husband a loving kiss before they left the ranch house with Sadie skipping behind happy her new mommy and daddy we're happy.</span></div></div>",

This made things much easier since they only had to set up an identity for Rick\u2019s new body. Rick had kept her Ruth body\u2019s characteristics, but dialed back her age to her mid 20\u2019s. Her massive breasts didn\u2019t sag from age anymore and she was quite a knock out.

He had considered rescuing Rick from Earl.m and had to admit that Earl was quite a catch. Earl was in amazing shape for a man his age and would make a fine husband for some lucky lady. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad caught himself daydreaming about what he would do with Earl if the two were alone when the implications of his thoughts hit him. \u201cOh My...\u201d, he quietly said to himself. \u201c I do believe mah brain is a bit frazzled.\u201d, said Brad quietly to himself.

A few drinks later and Rick was really loosening up, he was even telling Earl a bit about himself, making sure to edit growing up playing with dolls instead of action figures and the like.  And even Brad was having a good time Robert.  Brad couldn't believe it at first, but he really enjoyed the looks he was getting from Robert, he liked that someone about 20 years younger than his body seemed so interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Robert provided Brad with another drink in the evening Brad said, \"You'd better be careful right there Robert, a lady might get the wrong idea about your intentions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert smiled as he said, \"Then I guess I'd better make my intentions clear then Miss Charlotte.\"  And displaying a degree of daring Brad had not expected he leaned over and kissed Brad right on the lips.  It wasn't long, but it certainly put some ideas in Brad's head.  The two then didn't even look at the other two couples and paid theirs bills and left the bar for the parking lot.  As they walked Brad wondered a mile a minute through his buzz what was going on, <i>'What's going on?  Did Karen adjust my sexuality with he Booth, or did I just have such a great time with Rick last night and this morning that I'm just really that eager to jump on this guys dick?'</i>. Robert wasn't having suck philosophical thought as his focus was only on those crazy curves on 'Charlotte'.  They got to Roberts car who opened up the back door for his lady friend and was messing with the seats so the back seats were laying down.  Brad saw the make shift bed being made and said, \"I do declare, I do believe I'm getting the vapors,\"  and he began to mock fan himself.  Robert turned and offered the back seat and said, \"Ladies first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Brad crawled into the back, Robert was on top of him.  Brad could have sworn Robert had 4 hands as he felt every curve, every love handle, get caressed or squeezed by the young man.  Robert used his quick hands to take off his pants and raise Brad's dress as the two got it on in the bar parking lot.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While sitting around the table, Brad didn't realize he was twirling his short gray hair and making googly eyes with Robert.  He wasn't interested in the conversation but felt the need to smile and laugh at all his jokes.  Brad had to admit he was having a good time.  He would have never guessed joining Rick as a retired woman would be so entertaining. It was a nice change to be on the receiving end of somebody else paying for the drinks.  Wearing a body with boobs..(although they were saggy ones)...had it's advantages.  It took awhile to get used to responding to 'Charlotte.'  With a woman's body, he needed a woman's name and liked the way Robert said it.  There was something about his accent and they way his voice got raspy when he said Charlotte that made Brad really like his old woman's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Charlotte was whisked off to the dance floor by Ruth.  Brad was taken off guard and asked Rick, \"What are we doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick winked, 'We're going to dance.  We are girls.  Girls love dancing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad pointed out, \"Calling us girls is a long stretch.  We are damn near elderly women in these bodies.  We could break a hip if we fall down on the dance floor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not going to booty-pop or anything.  Just shake your arms and butt around.  I needed to pull you away from the guys to tell you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two danced in the corner, Rick smirked, 'Okay.  This isn't so bad.  I'd never dance as a guy.  But for some reason having a pussy makes dancing kind of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick winked, \"Speaking of pussies...it turns out my old snapper isn't as dried out as I thought.  in fact, it's fully functional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad laughed, \"You were gone in the ladies room for a long time.  I assumed you were in there fingering yourself or something.  Did you get an orgasm?  I'm curious to find out if I could get one too with these old twats between our legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick grinned ear to ear, \"Yep.  Multiple orgasms.  And I wasn't in the ladies room.  I was in Earl's car.  He screwed the shit out of me in the back seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was shocked, \"OMG. You had sex already as Ruth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick nodded, \"I sure did.  We kissed for awhile then Earl lifted up my dress.  He tore off my granny-panties and the next thing I know...I'm spreading my legs and he's going to town on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You old slut.\"  Brad replied with a curious question, \"What was it like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic. Trust me, you are going to love having a dick shoved inside of you.  I could feel every inch of it.  Specially when it started throbbing and went off.  Being filled with cum was the best part.  It's so warm and you can feel it spraying out with every shot.  You're going to be amazed at how sensitive your lady parts get when it's filled with Robert's cock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was curious but wasn't sure he was quite ready for that, \"Whoa whoa whoa.  What makes you think I'm going to spreading my legs for Robert?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everybody has seen the way you've been looking at him all night.  You're acting like a school girl with a crush.  You've been laughing at his jokes and playing footsie with him.  The enhancements Karen gave us with the transformation booth are coming in handy.  Although, I need to speak with her about those damn granny panties.  Next time I'm Ruth, I'm going to ask Karen to give me a sexier pair of underwear.  Did she give you granny panties too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded, 'Yea.  I thought they were comfortable actually.  But I suppose if a guy is going to see them it would be nice to have sexier ones on.  What were you talking about the enhancements Karen gave us?  I had no idea she did that to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick laughed, \"Seriously dude?  You haven't noticed?  Think about it.  We are both guys in old women's bodies.  We somehow are walking around in heels and nice dresses like we've been wearing women's clothing our entire life...we can touch up our makeup flawlessly during ladies room breaks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled, \"You are right.  That was nice of my wife to give us those enhancements to make being women easier for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not all Karen did to us.  She obviously changed our sexual preferences.  Neither of us have obviously ever been into guys before.  You've been flirting with Robert all night.  I just practically begged Earl to screw me in the back seat of his car.  Like it or not, we both suddenly have a love for cock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was shocked to learn his wife did this to them.  It was all making sense now.  They were currently both straight women who were attracted to men.  Brad laughed, \"That sneaky little devil.  I should have figured Karen would do something like this to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick pointed to the guys at the table who were all getting ready to leave, \"Uh oh.  It looks like our dates are going home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad laughed, 'It's barely 9 o'clock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick explained, \"We are old.  It's probably past all of our bed times.  You better catch up with Robert before he leaves.  Maybe he could give you a ride home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Robert pulled into the driveway.  Karen was secretly watching through the window at what was about to unfold.  Brad wasn't sure how his first date as an old woman would end. He figured Robert would at least want a goodbye kiss.  Now that Brad figured out Karen made him attracted to men, he liked the idea of having a long goodbye kiss.  They small talked for a few minutes while holding hands in the front seat.  Robert was looking into Brad's eyes when he gave a compliment, \"Charlotte, your eyes are so beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad suddenly had little self-control.  It was like his mind was triggered somehow.  He put his head down into Robert's lap and undid his belt.  Robert helped shimmy his pants to his ankles as Brad engulfed his cock.  Brad had no idea what happened. One second they were talking, and now he had a dick in his mouth. Normally he would have been disgusted by such an act.  But with his new female enhancements, he enjoyed every second of it.  He bobbed his head up and down while Robert moaned in pleasure.  After a few minutes, Robert's cock tensed and sprayed deep inside Brad's throat.  Brad savored every last drop.  He even licked his lips afterwards to taste the residual seamen that he didn't swallow.  Robert pulled his pants up and escorted his date to the front door, \"That was amazing Charlotte.  You make me feel like we are in high school again.  I haven't gotten a blow job like that in decades.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad giggled, \"Gimme a call sometime' and went inside.  After Robert drove away, Brad kicked off his heels and walked upstairs to the bedroom.  He didn't notice how skillfully he lifted his dress up so ladylike while making his way up the stairs so he didn't step on it. The TV was on giving a dim glow to the bedroom.  Not wanting to wake up Karen, Brad tiptoed into her walk-in closet to find something appropriate to sleep in.  He borrowed one of his wife's satin nightgowns and quietly slipped into his side of the bed.  That's when he noticed his wife wasn't there.  He turned the lamp on for a better view and realized with his old woman vision that he was tricked. Where he thought his wife was sat a pile of pillows.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren came in from downstairs asking, \"It's barely 9 and you are going to bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad sighed, \"I'm an old lady.  I'm all worn out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren joked, \"Nah.  It's just your jaw that's probably worn out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad sat up embarrassed, \"Oh shit.  You saw that?  I had no idea what came over me.  We were just talking and suddenly I had Robert's penis in my mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren giggled, \"Let me guess.  He said your eyes were beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  He said that right before I started deep throating him.\"  Brad glared at his wife, \"Wait a second.  How did you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren laughed, \"When I turned you into a woman, I programmed some trigger words. When you hear the words...beautiful eyes...it makes you suck the man's cock who said it immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smirked, \"I figured you must have done something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren winked, 'I'll be right back.\"  She ran out to the shed to use the transformation booth.  Moments later, she came into the bedroom and was a man in his early 50s.  She gave a devious smile to Brad saying, 'Your eyes look beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad laughed unable to control his body as he started giving Karen a blow job.  In-between cock-licks, Brad asked, \"Is there anything else you programmed my old woman body to do?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That should help her have a better time and get into the sport.\"  Rick said enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren looked a little skeptical, \"Are you sure that would work?  From what I've seen with Sadie I've always thought she was a girl who wanted to focus on dancing and kitties and doesn't really care for sports.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she watches sports with me sometimes.\"  Rick said, \"Besides, I really want her to participate in a team sport, it'll be good for her.  All she needs is one friend to help give her that initial boost.  I know this will be good for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad and Karen exchanged a look before shrugging, \"If you want to be a little girl, go for it, get in the booth and design yourself on the pad.\"  Brad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick nodded enthusiastically, and after a few minutes of design the booth doors closed and out walked in Rick's oversized clothes was an 8 year girl with short curly black hair who was noticeably taller and more muscular than your average 8 year old.  Karen raised an eyebrow, \"Are you sure you didn't want to do this so you can just play sports again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I just gave myself a body of someone who would care about sports.\"  Rick said a little defensively, but Brad and Karen gave each other a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, so I'll see you both after the game to turn me back.  My sister Trisha is already dropping Sadie off at the game as we speak so I need to head out.\"  Rick said, but Karen quickly grabbed his oddly muscular arm.  \"Whoa there Rick, remember, you're 8 years old now.  You can't exactly drive to the game, and you need some new clothes.  Or were you planning on using a grown man's shirt as a dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, guess I didn't think of that.\"  Rick admitted a bit embarrassed.  \"I guess my name in this body is gonna be...Ricki?  No that's too obvious, how about Ronda?  Yeah, Ronda.  As for my clothes, they'll give me a uniform when I get there and sign up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren shook her head, \"No you will not Ronda.  I've got some of my old clothes in a box in the attic.  Brad, you grab that and I'll get in the booth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to use it for?\"  Brad asked before he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I doubt they'll let a little girl sign up for sports and be on her own.  So I'm going to become her loving father in honor of Rick doing this for his daughter.  After all, I can't go as myself in case someone knows us and asks questions.  And you can't go since you just used the Booth.\"  Brad nodded his approval of this plan and went off in search of little girl clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Karen!\"  Rick said, \"I mean, thanks mom.\"  Rick then gave Karen a big hug wrapping his arms around her waist.  Karen let out a small grasp of air as the surprisingly strong 8 year old wrapped her tight.  \"I'll make sure to go for a muscular model myself to match and explain your body.  Plus I'll probably catch the eyes of a few ladies.  By the way, is Trisha still single?\"  Karen said with a devilish grin.</span></div></div>",

Finally Karen and Rick pulled into the driveway, Brad laughed as Karen banged her head on the top of the car getting out.  He'd warned her that she'd made herself too tall and muscular.  When the two entered the house Brad had an ice pack waiting for his manly wife.  \"Thanks sweetie,\"  Karen said as she put the ice pack against her head with one hand and scratched at the stubble of her beard with the other.  \"I don't care if it makes me look more manly, I'm going beardless next time, this is driving me nuts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad chuckled, \"I told you to skip the 'rugged 5 o'clock shadow' look and just go full beard.  It's much more comfortable.\"  The three sat down at the dinner table where Brad put a chicken breasts on the table for him and Karen and put some cut up chicken nuggets on Rick's plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how'd the game go?\"  Brad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tt was great!\"  Rick said full of energy, \"We won in extra innings!  It was fantastic, I even had 5 hits.  Those little girls didn't know what hit them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, good for you dude, but I was more curious about how it went with Sadie.\"  Brad said as Rick felt a little embarrassed.  \"Oh, well, that went great too.  I broke the ice by talking about some 'Ronda's favorite cartoons which happened to be the same as Sadie's.\"  Rick chuckled at his own cleverness.  \"And once we got to talking, I started talking about how I loved softball and after I said I liked it Sadie suddenly got more interested.  She asked me to help her out with her swing, and at the end of the game she even got the game winning hit to drive me home!  It was awesome.\"  Brad said drenching his chicken nuggets in barbecue sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't even tell Brad the best part.\"  Karen said looking at the little girl stuffing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ereah!\"  Brad said with his mouth full of nugget, after finally swallowing he said, \"After the game Karen got us all snow cones.  Man I forgot how good those tasted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those things are just pure sugar.\"  Karen said and then looking at Brad she said, \"I though the girls deserved a treat for a good game...plus I wanted to look good in front of Rick's sister Trisha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded to his wife thinking of Trisha's rocking body, \"Go for it, you know you've got my blessing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, after I got the kids snow cones, the best part of the day happened.\"  Karen said with a smile.</span></div></div>",

Sadie and Ronda's team had rallied from behind to win the league championship.  Sadly it was also the last day of the season and Rick knew that 'Ronda' had to say her goodbyes.  Rick approached a few of their teammates as they all were looking at their little plastic trophies with pride.  A brown haired girl named Penny saw Rick walking up and said, \"Hey Ronda!  We did it!  We won, and you were so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the other 8 and 9 year old girls agreed and Rick smiled, it was true he'd been the best player on the team, but then again he had over 20 more years of experience playing baseball than them.  So he put on his best humble face and said, \"You're just being modest, you guys were also awesome!  Especially you Sadie.\"  Rick made sure to give his daughter some extra praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, you're the best Ronda!\"  Sadie then gave Ronda a big hug which made Rick's insides melt a little bit with joy to share this moment with Sadie.  But before she broke the hug she said, \"Are you going to be joining the rest of us next week for try outs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick just looked at the girls confused, \"Tryouts?  But the seasons over isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall blonde girl named Nancy shook her head and said, \"Well softball season is over, but cheerleader tryouts are happening next week.  You're so good at sports I'm sure you'll get in if you try out.  We'll all get to dance and cheer together at the pee wee football games.  Doesn't that sound fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I'll totally ask my parents about it, but they might say no.  But man that sure does sounds like the best.\"  Ronda said faking enthusiasm.  He'd done this to get his daughter into softball and learn about teamwork, but he wasn't interested one bit in joining a cheerleading squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!  We'll all get to be on the same team again, it'll be just like playing softball!\"  Sadie said.  Rick disagreed with Sadie about softball and cheerleading being the same thing, but seeing how excited she was he was definitely going to sign Sadie up.  She'd might be a little disappointed Ronda wouldn't join them, but they'll get over it and have a good time together.  As the girls were excitedly talking about cheerleading, Karen aka Ronda's dad approached the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there girls good game!  But I think it's time for us to go.  Say your goodbyes Ronda.\"  Karen said giving Rick his out.  But before Rick could say goodbye, Sadie came up to Karen and asked, \"Mr Sadie's dad, can Ronda sign up for cheerleading with us?  It'll be fun!  It'll be just like we're all on a team again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren's eyes lit up and smiled down at 'his daughter'.  Rick did not like that look.  \"Really?  I think that sounds fun too.  And Ronda signed up for softball for the teamwork and friendship, so why not, I'll definitely sign Ronda up for cheerleading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Traitor!'</i> Rick thought looking up at Karen, but he couldn't come up with an excuse to get out of this because soon he was surrounded by happy, laughing, and cheering girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the drive back to Brad and Karen's place Rick was in full pout mode with crossed arms and wasn't speaking.  Finally Karen said, \"Come on Rick, I thought this was what you'd want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I want to do dances in a skirt waving pom moms?  When have I told you I wanted to do that?\"  Rick said breaking his silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you told me that you signed Sadie up for softball, even though she wasn't crazy. about the sport, because it would be good for her.  I think that this will be good for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really a little girl who needs to learn how teamwork works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're acting like it.\"  Karen said a little sternly, \"Besides, you signed Sadie up for something you liked, isn't it fair for you to sign up for something Sadie likes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick didn't have a comeback for this, he just went back to pouting.  But he had to admit when Karen put it like that, she may have had a point in her own way.</span></div></div>",

I really want to see if Billy can handle the responsibility of owning a pet before I go for the real deal. I\u2019ll tell the family that we\u2019re dog sitting for a friend.\u201d, said Thomas pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re the only one that will know?\u201d, asked Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. I won\u2019t tell Alice, and the kids couldn\u2019t possibly know that it\u2019s actually you in disguise.\u201d, replied Thomas. \u201cWell, Karen will have to know of course. I already asked her about it since I wanted to make sure that she could spare you for a few weeks. I was surprised how easy that was. She seemed really eager to get rid of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa Ha...Maybe you should become the pet. It would certainly improve your looks!\u201d, joked Brad in response to his friend\u2019s taunting. \u201cOkay, I guess you did save me from living the rest of my life at a zoo as a fertile female monkey. I\u2019ll do it. This makes us even though!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas followed Brad and Karen back into the shed. He set the rather small cage down on the floor as he and Karen walked over to the machine. Brad made his way into the booth and waited for the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwwwwwwww! How adorable!\u201d, said Karen as she looked at the photo Thomas showed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad didn\u2019t like the sound of that. He was going to inquire what kind of dog Thomas was looking for, but was interrupted by the booth door slamming shut. After a few moments of vertigo, Brad slowly walked out of the booth on four legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh she\u2019s such a cutie!\u201d, said Karen as she reached down to pick you up. \u201cI could just eat you up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas grinned broadly as he put a pink bow on Brad\u2019s head. \u201cTime to go meet the fam, Rosie!\u201d He was certainly enjoying Brad\u2019s humiliation. \u201cDo you need to tinkle before we go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad tried to give him a nasty look, as the two humans burst out laughing. It seemed like it was impossible to look threatening as a cute little Pomeranian dog. Of course Thomas would make him female. \u201cOh well, a promise is a promise. At least I can relax for a few weeks without any worries.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad shuffled his little feet into the carrier as Karen said her goodbyes. \u201cYou\u2019re a good sport for doing this Brad. I\u2019ll have an extra special reward for you when you get back. Try to have fun with it.\u201d, she said as she kissed him on the head.</span></div></div>",

I hope the food isn\u2019t too disgusting and I can at least watch the game tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas opened the door to the carrier and gently pushed Brad inside. \u201cCome on Rosie, time to go!\u201d, said Thomas as he secured the cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren bent down to get one more look at Brad and gave him a warm smile. \u201cYou\u2019re a good friend for doing this. Just relax and try to enjoy yourself. I promise to reward you when you get back!\u201d, she said as she blew him a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas loaded Brad into the car and waved to Karen from a distance as he drove down the long driveway leading out to the main road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad found walking on four legs a lot more alien than his previous animal form. Being a primate was a lot closer to a human\u2019s movements and he missed having hands and feet that could grip things. He realized that he would be using his mouth to carry or interact with anything. Also, his tail wasn\u2019t nearly as dexterous as his spider monkey body. It almost had a mind of its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short ride, Brad stretched a little when Thomas\u2019s car stopped in the driveway. He was about to be introduced to Thomas\u2019s family. Thomas would be the only one in the know for Brad\u2019s next two weeks as the new family pet (on a trial basis). Thomas opened the back door to retrieve Brad. \u201cI really appreciate this Bud, but for the next few weeks, you\u2019re Rosie, a pedigree Pomeranian dog. I expect you to act the part. From this point on, that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to treat you. We can\u2019t risk exposing the truth to my family or any other prying eyes or ears. Neither Tina or the kids even know about the booth yet. I plan on letting her in on the secret in a few weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded in agreement and braced himself as Thomas picked up the carrier and took him into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina, Thomas\u2019s wife, was the first to greet the two as Thomas placed \u201cRosie\u2019s\u201d carrier on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, this is Rosie.\u201d, said Thomas as he opened the carrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad exited the carrier and stretched his legs. Tina gave a long drawn out \u201cAhhhhhhhhh!!\u201d and picked up their new resident. \u201cShe\u2019s such a cutie! You\u2019re going to love it here Rosie!\u201d, she said as she hugged Brad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad had always had a little crush on Tima and was certainly enjoying being held so closely to her chest. She had a very trim and athletic body and amazing green eyes. He had briefly considered asking Karen I transform into Tina, but thought better of it. She might not have appreciated Brad\u2019s choice of his friend\u2019s wife. He couldn\u2019t think of a way to bring up the idea without it being awkward. \u201cMaybe Karen will be open to it as part of my reward when I get back.\u201d, thought Brad briefly as he got a better look down the front of Tina\u2019s shirt.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly ran into the room, excited to meet the new pet. \u201cHey there Rosie! I bet you\u2019d like to go for a little walk, wouldn\u2019t you girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA walk did sound like a great idea to Brad. He started to nod his head before realizing what he was doing, but managed to play it off. </span></div></div>",

Right girl?\"  Tina said as she once again held Brad up to her very pretty face and kissed him on the head.  Brad gave an appreciative bark, that was a normal place for a dog to bark right?  So Tina lead the family and Brad into the kitchen where Brad's new nose helped him guess the food before he could even see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad barked in anticipation as Thomas laughed and said, \"Ah, hot dogs and beans night.  My favorite.  I'll get Suzie out from her room.\"  Thomas said leaving you with Tina and Billy.  As Tina finished cooking the hotdogs Billy the excited 7 year old ran around in circles around Brad excited to play with the new dog.  And Brad couldn't help but laugh and enjoy Billy's infectious energy.  Brad began to run around in circles following Billy around, but eventually Billy tired around but Brad was still excited to so he began to actually chase his own tail around much to the amusement of Billy.  The chase ended when a new smell arrived, Brad stopped running around and began to pant with his tongue out.  Thomas had returned with his 3 year old girl in his arms.  The little girl already changed into pink pajamas looked at Brad and looked like the dictionary definition of joy as she pointed and said, \"Look look!  A doggie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Suzie, this is Rosie, she's staying with us for two weeks.\"  Thomas said sitting his daughter down in a chair at the table where Tina was now placing the delicious smelling hotdogs and beans.  Brad quickly sat at the foot of the table eagerly awaiting a weiner to be tossed down to him for his supper.  But Thomas wasn't having that, \"No no Rosie, you can't have people food.  You're a young dog, you need special food.  Human food will just make you sick.\"  Thomas was saying in a cutie voice mainly to teach his kids, but Brad felt he was being talked down to and being screwed with by his friend.  \"Rosie, you need to eat this.\"  Thomas said as he placed a metal bowl in front of Brad.  It was filled with an ugly brown kibble that somehow smelled worse than it looked.  \"This is good for you, it will give you a nice coat and keep you healthy.  Dig in Rosie.\"  Thomas said before going back to the table to dig into his own food.  Brad whined a little and approached the table again, surely Thomas wasn't serious?  Billy looked down at his new friend and said, \"Can I give Rosie some of mine?  I don't need to eat it all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No son, human food can make dogs sick.\"  Billy looked even more sad than Brad felt.  So Brad reluctantly went to his bowl and trying not to smell it, began to put the pellets in his mouth and crunched down on them.  Even though it was a grainy pellet, it still somehow had a meaty taste to it, but that didn't comfort Brad at this time.  He never thought he'd say it but he was beginning to miss eating bugs he ate off his mates back from when he was a female monkey in the zoo.  But finally there was a miracle.  Brad heard with his new ears a sound of something meaty hitting the ground.  Brad looked and saw that Billy had 'accidently' dropped half a hot dog on the ground.  Brad had never been happier to eat processed meat in his life.  It was like an oasis in a grainy pellet like desert.  It was enough to finish filling up Brad's tiny tummy and finally the dinner with the family ended.</span></div></div>",

It was nice to take a break from the human race and the worries that went with it. He wondered if he slipped into the role of Rosie a little too easily. He was content to stay a pet for the near future. Tina had purchased a new brand of food that tasted much better than the dry kibble and he loved his time playing with the kids. Yep, life was good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad jumped and let out a bark after the door bell rang. He immediately ran toward the door to see who the visitor was. He paused for just a moment when he saw his wife at the door carrying a plate of something. Tina yelled down the hallway for Karen to let herself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy hello there Rosie!\u201d, said Karen with a quick wink. She fished around her pocket for something and held it out to Brad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad immediately recognized the smell of his favorite treat. He wagged his tail and whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit!\u201d, said Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad immediately plopped his but on the floor and waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood girl!\u201d, said Karen as she pet Brad\u2019s head. Karen leaned closer and whispered to Brad. \u201cYou\u2019re temporary stay is about to become a permanent one. The family has grown very attached to you in such a short period of time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe word permanent got Brad\u2019s attention as he raised his ears and tilted his head in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot you. We\u2019re going to adopt a stray from the pound and switch her out with you. You\u2019ll be back to your body by tomorrow evening. Unless, maybe you\u2019re not ready quite yet?\u201d, whispered Karen. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad thought about it for a minute and shook his head. He wanted to stay in this body for the whole duration. He was having too much fun and wanted to finish the next week on four legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay sweetie! No problem. By the way, here are your official papers.\u201d, said Karen as she held up an official looking document. Tina wants to enter you in dog shows and will need proof of you lineage, especially when she finds a stud to breed you with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren rubbed Brad\u2019s head and went to help out Tina with the dinner party. It sounded like all his friends would be there. He was pondering what Karen had mentioned about dog shows and breeding. He had been pretty distracted since yesterday afternoon and believed he might be in heat. He found himself wanting to get close to all the male dogs at the park yesterday. His curiosity was getting the better of him. Maybe he could fill in for Rosie during the competition. His human brain would certainly give him an advantage. His body was already perfect, thanks to the booth. He would win best in show with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad found the sunny spot and curled up and went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

The thought of being replaced should have made him nervous. Instead, he was kind of into it. The thought of being stuck as a dog added a sense of danger to his situation. He couldn\u2019t explain it, but deep down, he wanted to stay in this body even longer. It fueled a kink that he never knew he had.

I will let you change my body however you see fit!\u201d, said Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad eyed his wife hungrily and thought about the possibilities. He had decided to go for it. \u201cWell, I have something in mind. He walked over to the computer and adjusted the settings. He stood in front of the monitor so she couldn\u2019t see the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to let me take a peek?\u201d, asked Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, it will be a surprise.\u201d, said Brad as he escorted Karen to the booth. \u201cI just hope you give me a reasonably sized pair of tits this time. Those breasts were way beyond believable and got in the way of everything. I know they were fun for you, but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised.\u201d, said Brad with his not charming smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren hit the button and Brad waited for the machine to do its work. Once the machine started to power down, Karen walked out of the machine and looked in the full length mirror. Tina\u2019s naked body (Thomas\u2019s wife) was staring back at her.</span></div></div>",

They had watched Rosie for the better part of the week while the family was on vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie was a bit famous in the dog world now. She had quite a few titles under her belt and was still a favorite among the judges. She had a few high paying sponsors for a few very reputable pet supply businesses. Brad threw the ball another time and turned to Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaren, I love you and I have a very odd request. I want you to switch me with Rosie.\u201d, said Brad as his face turned crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to be a bitch again?\u201d, asked Karen. \u201cI mean, you spent over a month in that body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know... but hear me out. Remember how I said how awkward it was to be the family pet when Thomas knew my real identity? Well, nobody but you will know that I\u2019m really Rosie. I can fully enjoy the experience of being the family pet. We promised that we would watch Rosie again in two weeks when the kids go to camp and Thomas and Tina celebrate their honeymoon. You can switch me back then. Please, it\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren chuckled and leaned on Brad\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re just jealous of Rosie\u2019s new celebrity status. I mean you did all the work and she\u2019s reaping the rewards.\u201d, said Karen playfully. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I get it. You\u2019re going to owe me one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for being understanding Honey! I promise to make it up to you\u201d, said Brad excitedly. \u201cJust a few weeks, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may have to see what all the fuss is about myself.\u201d, said Karen as she called for Rosie.

I\u2019ll change Rosie slightly so nobody gets suspicious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren made an updated copy of Rosie before changing her into a male black lab. \u201cWe could use some help rounding up the cows. Now, get your ass in the booth. I hear a car coming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad anxiously entered the booth as Karen applied a few parameters. Brad was excited to have a genuine experience as the family pet. He missed playing with the kids and his close bond with Tina. He hid his erection as he waited for the booth to activate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren reviewed the parameters one last time and activated the machine. Moments later, Brad walked out, wagging his tail rapidly. He was going to enjoy the next few weeks in anonymity and couldn\u2019t wait. </span></div></div>",

He had to make a few guest appearances during the first few days, but was back to relaxing by his favorite spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until the third day that Brad had noticed that something was a bit off. He suspected that he was going into heat. The last time this happened, Tina had given him a pill to suppress it so it didn\u2019t interfere with the competition. By the fourth day, he found that his urges were almost unbearable. He knew that if he were confronted by any male dogs, he would find it difficult not to let his instincts take over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was pacing the room when Tina arrived home with a special guest. \u201cRosie, meet Dash! Dash is going to be spending a few weeks here. He has earned quite a few titles last year on the circuit. Almost as many as you! Your puppies are going to be adorable. I just wish that we didn\u2019t have to cancel our trip. But hey, an opportunity like this is tough to pass up. Why don\u2019t you two go out back and get to know each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo weeks!? Cancelled their getaway!?\u201d, thought Brad as he panicked. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to evade Dash for today, let alone two weeks!\u201d, thought Brad as he sniffed Dash\u2019s flank. \u201cDash here certainly is a fine stud. There are worse things to endure in life than this. It could be fun. I mean it\u2019s not like I have a choice in the matter. I might as well enjoy it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of getting fucked in his bitches body had stirred some deep desire in him. He licked Dash in the face and eagerly presented his rear to his new mate. Dash wasted no time as he mounted his horny bitch and pumped away. Brad\u2019s shame turned to pleasure as he pushed back, trying to get his mate\u2019s dick as deep as possible. The first orgasm almost made his knees buckle as it washed over him. He barely recovered from the first one before another one hit. This was the most pleasurable sex he\u2019d ever had. It was also at that moment that Brad fully submitted to his new role. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie maintained a standing position when her mate had expanded inside her. Once they were locked, she found herself squirming a bit to feel Dash\u2019s dick rub inside her. Rosie knew that she was going to enjoy her special guest. \u201cMy puppies are going to be adorable!\u201d, she thought as she enjoyed the sensation of being knotted with her mate. She would eventually figure out how to return to her human body, but those concerns were washed away by Dash, at least for the time being.</span></div></div>",

When he asked to have the complete experience, he had no idea that was going to involve being mated with a stud dog. He was finding it easier to relax and live as a simple pet. However, he still wasn\u2019t used to having sex anywhere and having so many onlookers. A neighbor boy pointed at him and snickered as Dash was fucking him in the back yard. He was really growing quite fond of Dash and his seemingly endless supply of energy. He wondered what his friends would think if they knew what he was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked up to see a person, who looked familiar, approaching the front door. It wasn\u2019t until Karen looked around the back yard did Brad notice his wife. She opened the gate and walked toward Brad. She knelt in the ground so she could talk quietly to her husband. \u201cWell, if you just wanted to have sex with a dog, you shoukd have let me transform into the male dog. Tina told me about her plans for you today, over the phone. I knew it was a bad idea to go along with your plan.\u201c, said Karen with an annoyed look on her face\u201d.

He shook his head in response to Karen\u2019s plan. He didn\u2019t want the guys to know that it was really him getting fucked by Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren sighed and stood up.and shrugged her shoulders. \u201cWell then, I guess you are enjoying yourself so fuck it.

Come with me and we\u2019ll transform you so you can have a little more fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad whined a little and lowered his head. While he had to admit, the experience wasn\u2019t at all unpleasant, he really wanted to be back in his male body. He had hoped that Karen wouldn\u2019t make him wait much longer and it looked like he would get his wish.The thought of birthing a litter of puppies freaked him out. He would endure her taunts as best as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren wanted to teach Brad a lesson. She had no intention of her husband living out the rest of his days in the body of his friend\u2019s female show dog, but he didn\u2019t know that. She would make him sweat a little more before changing him back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad followed his wife enthusiastically, anxious to be on two legs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the shed, Karen scanned Rosie\u2019s body to make a template then pulled up a saved configuration. \u201dGo ahead and hop in the booth girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad rushed in eagerly and awaited his transformation. Moments later, he stepped out of the booth on four legs. He looked himself over and realized that he was still in Rosie\u2019s body. Nothing had changed... or at least that\u2019s what he thought initially. There was one thing he noticed after a bit more inspection. He was most definitely, once again, a bitch in HEAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed Rosie! We\u2019ll get you your puppies back before Tina comes to claim you. I just thought you would enjoy a little more sexy time with \u201cSimon\u201d. It\u2019s only fair that he has some fun too and I know how much you enjoy getting mounted. It\u2019s quite natural for a dog of your age. Of coarse, we\u2019ll have to explain your disappearance at some point. I wouldn\u2019t have expected my husband to trade lives with a bitch, but you seem happy enough. Don\u2019t be embarrassed that you like doggie dick so much. I mean, you are 100% genetically a female dog, so it\u2019s only natural. I wont think any less of you and Tina will probably mate you a few more times. You still have so much to look forward to!\u201d, said Karen with a wide smile. \u201cAnd when you come to the farm for doggy sitting, I can help you itch that scratch.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad started to panic. How could he explain to Karen that this wasn\u2019t the life he wanted. It had been a pretty enjoyable experience up until now. He hadn\u2019t wanted this to be a permanent swap. He shook his head, pleading with Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t you worry. I\u2019ll give you both a bit of privacy. I\u2019ll let you and Simon get acquainted while I tend to a few chores.

He admires his tail one last time and waited to be back in his own body. He was actually starting to have a bit of fun as a primate. He had become much more agile with his body and had grown accustomed to using his arms primarily when moving around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Brad walked out of the pod and examined his much taller and less hairy body. Karen smiles at him and ran over to give him a very tight hug. She had transformed herself into her previous \u201cimproved\u201d version of herself. She slowly moved her hand down and rubbed Brad\u2019s crotch. \u201cI made a few \u201clittle\u201d changes. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d, she said before giving him a very passionate kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked down and noticed that his gut was gone, by the thing that really caught his attention was the extra large bulge in his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren unzipped his pants, releasing his much larger erection from it\u2019s tight confines. \u201cLet\u2019s give that a test drive, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled after he took a peek. \u201cI think I\u2019m okay with it.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Karen held her enormous breasts to keep them from swinging around. She would have made Jessica Rabbit look small with these monsters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re exhausted?! I\u2019m the one that has to carry around these tits and try to keep them from smacking me in the face. I think you went way overboard with the settings. I like like some exaggerated sex doll.

I\u2019ve got to go change back before I start to enjoy this too much.\u201d, said Karen as she pushed Brad\u2019s other hand away from her oversized nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on. You know that turned you on.\u201d said Brad looking lustily at his wife\u2019s temporary body. \u201cI was hoping that you could go a little bigger next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled at him as she got an idea. \u201cHow sexy would it be to be a real inanimate sex doll? Hmmmm... that could be interesting.\u201d, said Karen as she got up. \u201cJust a big rubber \u201co\u201d shaped mouth only good for sucking cock. Being used over and over again until you\u2019re placed back in the box and stored away. Or how about one of those more realistic ones? How would you like that?\u201d, asked Karen with a seductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad\u2019s erection was at full mast again. \u201cNow you\u2019re talking! That sounds hot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren picked up her tablet and did a quick search on sex dolls. She kept scrolling down until she saw a model that excited Brad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I thought you\u2019d like her.\u201d, said Karen. \u201cHer proportions should meet your expectations. Those tits are even bigger than mine. She\u2019s a bit on the chubby side, but has extra wide hips and a large plump ass. Is this the one you want?\u201d, said Karen as she gently teased his dick by sliding her finger along the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded and grabbed his robe, following his wife out to the shed that housed the Transformation Booth. He tried, unsuccessfully to hide his erection, but it just tented ip the front of his robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren used the terminal and loaded up the image of the sex doll and saved that as a template. Then, she looked at pictures of well muscled men, finally deciding on one of the taller fellows, not overly muscled, but lean and had a huge dick. She the saved that as another preset. \u201cYou first!\u201d, she said with a mischievous smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad, looking over Kim\u2019s shoulder, nodded in approval as Karen stood and walked over to the booth.

Yeah, Cathy was the name of your model.\u201d, said Karen as she picked up the token sitting next to Brad. We\u2019ll need this for later.

Here, I\u2019ll sit you down in front of this mirror so you can get a good look at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad felt Karen\u2019s hands as they gently lifted him out of the booth. He must have been a lot lighter since Karen didn\u2019t have much difficulty carrying him. He could feel his heavily padded ass resting on the seat as he saw his new body for the first time. He was just like the doll on the website. His firm breasts jutted out ridiculously far. His legs looked soft, but thick and his hips were extremely wide. His lips looked soft and luscious and his eyes were a beautiful deep blue. Slightly curvy blond hair fell down his back and chest, framing a angelic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is kind of hot. Unexpected, but could be a nice change of pace.\u201d, thought Brad as he examined his details closer. He could feel the chill of the air on his naked soft rubber skin. It was really an odd sensation not to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muscular man stood behind Brad and ducked down to whisper in his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe website has a money back guarantee. The real doll will be here in a few days. I think I\u2019m going to exchange you with the doll and send you back. You\u2019re going to be someone\u2019s sex toy. Just a lifeless doll getting fucked in every opening.\u201d, she said as she opened up his mouth in an \u201cO\u201d Position. \u201cSomeone\u2019s property. Used for someone\u2019s enjoyment, then discarded, anxiously awaiting your next fuck.\u201d, whispered Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad\u2019s body tingled with excitement as the sexy man played with his breasts. \u201cWe have plenty of time before that happens though.\u201d, said Karen in the male body as she picked up her new sex doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad wanted to scream for the man to fuck him right then and there, but sex dolls didn\u2019t talk. He was fairly certain that she was roll playing and would make him human again once the duration time expired. However, he was extremely excited about his next couple of days as Karen\u2019s new Cathy doll.</span></div></div>",

Brad looked on as the man pumped his dick a few times to get him ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Karen, stick it in me already!\", thought Brad. He was more turned on than he'd ever been as he anticipated getting fucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled and leaned in to play with Brad's gravity defying breasts. Brad instantly felt a huge wave of pleasure hit him as she began to fondle his silicon tits. He couldn't think of anything except for the pleasure he was feeling. It was beyond euphoric and he didn't think that he could describe the feeling if he tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoose strands of hair fell down to obscure a small bit of his vision as he watched Karen ram her dick into his doll cunt. He couldn't even remember his name as his owner thrust in and out in a quick rhythm. He could feel his breasts flop wildly as Karen didn't relent. \"OH FUCK! Harder! Oooooooooooooooh... Oh YEAH! Keep... going...\", thought Brad as he saw flashes of Karen's male body between his breasts flapping in and out of his vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren's body seemed like it could go on forever. Brad heard a loud plop as she removed her dick and picked up Brad. Brad was now staring directly at her huge tool as she pushed it into his mouth. He had a cock down his throat and he was loving every minute of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Karen pulled out and sprayed cum all over Brad's doll face. She smiled and pushed the Cathy doll off the bed. Brad's silicone body his the floor, tit's first, and bounced a few times before they finally settled. Karen reached for the remote and turned on the television, ignoring the doll on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad could do nothing but stare at the attractive man as he flipped through the channels. \"Use me damn it! You're just going to discard me like a used... Oh yeah. I'm just an elaborate sex toy now.\", thought Brad. \"This actually turned him on even more as he lay on the floor, with his ass up in the air. He could feel the cum dripping down his face and had a salty taste in his mouth. \"She's going to want another round,right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, she started stroking her dick again and looked over at her former husband with that blank stare on his ultra-feminine face. \"Those lips felt great around my cock, but I should break in every hole\", she thought as she got up and adjusted Brad's pose to better accommodate her next conquest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad would have moaned if he was able to as Karen started  ramming her cock in his ass. His heavy tits were swinging wildly with each thrust, intensifying his pleasure. One... two... three orgasms hit in rapid succession before Karen finished and filled his other cavity with warm sticky cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a pretty good fuck Cathy\", said Karen with her masculine voice. \"I bet you liked that, didn't you? You little slut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Please do it again!\", thought Brad as he looked at the floor on his hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren picked up Brad and placed him back on the bed in a very seductive pose and whispered into his ear. \"I ordered a few interesting articles of clothing from the doll company. I think you're going to like what I picked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad didn't care about clothes right now. He just anxiously waited for his next good fuck.</span></div></div>",

Just for fun, she put one of Brad's 3 piece suits on.  She figured since she was a man that she may as well wear something fancy for dinner.  She propped up Brad at his regular seat at the table and held up a wine glass to give an imaginary cheers.  Brad was forced to have the 'O' expression on his doll face as Karen chuckled, \"Don't act so surprised.  You were quite the toy back there in the bedroom....Cathy.\"  Karen was just about to start eating when she thought of something.  She got all dressed up for dinner and 'Cathy' was just sitting there naked in her sex doll form.  Karen explained, \"This feels weird.  You need some clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad groaned thinking, \"Clothes?  I don't care about clothes!  Finish eating so you can fuck me again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad had never felt so light as his wife picked him up and carried him over her shoulders.  She threw him face down on the bed.  He couldn't see her but could tell she'd headed into her walk-in closet for supplies.  When she came back, she slid something up his legs.  The material aroused Brad.  His sensory inputs loved any sort of touch, but there was something special about the item of clothing his wife was pulling up his bottom.  Material slid into his butt crack that sent a shock of arousal through his plastic body.  Karen flipped her husband over to finish making adjustments and pulled the front snug against his fake vagina smiling, \"There you go.  I'll bet it feels nice to wear a pair of panties after being naked all day.\"  Next, Karen somehow managed to slip the matching bra around his over-sized breasts.  She clasped the back for him giggling, \"Not that you needed the support...your boobs are always are stuck perfectly in a perky position.  But it's not proper to go without a bra.\" She held up Brad so he could see his reflection in the mirror.  He recognized the matching panties and bra he was now wearing as one of his wife's sexiest lingerie items.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was originally annoyed at his wife putting clothing on him.  All he wanted to do was get naked again and be screwed.  He didn't care what hole.  He had three now that each had their unique sense of arousal when penetrated.  However, the material of his wife's lingerie sent shocking feelings of arousal throughout his body.  Her bra rubbed against his nipples turning him on.  Her thong was snug and firmly in place. He curiously hoped she'd put more of her sexy stuff on him to continue the arousal.  He could tell she was affixing another item around his waist but wasn't sure what it was.  Tiny strings hung down in the front and back of his legs.  Karen explained, \"There you go.  That garter belt will hold up your thigh-high stockings perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Karen began pulling the nylons up his legs, Brad's arousal intensified.  There was something about the material that felt thrilling.  He kept getting more and more turned on as the thigh-highs were attached firmly to his garter belt.  All he could think was, \"More!  More!  I need More sexy material around me NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren held up two options as if her husband could speak, \"Hmm?  Are you more of a little black dress sort of girl...or would you rather wear this more formal bridesmaids gown of mine?\"  Karen held both items up to Cathy and chose the bridesmaid dress giggling, \"I'm dressed up so you may as well wear something fancy too.  Plus, I was always hoping somebody would end up getting another use out of it.  I never imagined my husband would end up wearing it to dinner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren stuffed Brad into the gown.  Once again, the material of the dress ran across his body and aroused him.  Karen slipped a pair of her 5 inch strappy stilettos on his feet poking fun at Brad's 'O' expression again, \"Relax honey.  It's not like you are going to have to actually walk in these torture devices.\"  While looking at Cathy's mouth, Karen got a fun idea, \"Hmmm?  A girl never goes to dinner without a little makeup!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a few items from her vanity and got to work.  As she applied a layer of lipstick, Brad's sensory inputs started going crazy.  Even though his body was plastic, his lips were extra sensitive.  His arousal continued to rise feeling his face being made up.  Karen put a light layer of blush and eye liner on to freshen up the doll's appearance.  Brad loved every brush stroke as he savored every touch.  He was disappointed when her handywork was finished and she put her makeup away. He wished she would smear more and more lipstick on him.  Or maybe some more blush.  He loved how the cosmetic items felt rubbing on his form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren propped her husband doll back on a chair at the dinner table in a ladylike pose with legs crossed smiling at her own joke, \"I can finally eat...now that you are all <i>dolled-up</i>...\"   She winked, \"I know you would have laughed at that one if you could talk.\"  Brad had zoned out his wife's conversation.  All he could do was concentrate on how amazing the material of his wife's clothing felt on his body.  He didn't hear her say, \"...By the way Cathy, you look adorable in my old dress. I wore it to a friends wedding a few years ago.  It was at that cute little place down by the....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad's sensory inputs were on overload.  Even though Karen was in a male body, she still gabbed away like normal.  Brad took advantage of being nothing more than a sex doll.  He didn't have to pretend to listen to his wife's stories.  He could just zone out and think of whatever he wanted to.  For now, clothing was on his mind.  The material of Karen's panties, bra, nylons and dress were arousing his entire body.  He had no idea how great it felt to wear women's clothing.  He wondered if it was only because of the extra sensory inputs he gave himself before becoming a doll?....Or did all women feel like this when wearing their own clothes?   He pondered the idea of using the transformation booth to become a human version of Cathy.  He wondered if wearing normal girl clothes always felt this good for real females.  All the satin and nylon wrapped around his body was a constant reminder of how sexy women's clothing made him feel.  He started to get horny thinking about what it would feel like if a bra actually supported his boobs bouncing around.  Or what walking in heels felt like?  Or what wearing a bikini was like?  He felt his body pulsing at the idea of wearing a satin nightgown to bed. If he ever did try out being a human woman he'd wear one of those for sure.  With any luck, Karen would put some of her pajamas on him for bed tonight.  He hoped it was one of her sexy nightgowns and not a pair of boring flannel itchy ones.  Since she dressed him for dinner, she would most likely dress him for bed.  Brad's sex doll brain was running a mile a minute while Karen blabbed on about nothing.  Brad made a mental note about how convenient it was to not be able to speak.  He'd have to try being a sex doll again so he could wear his wife's clothing and block her out at the dinner table. He wished she would stop talking and just carry him into the bedroom.  He was so aroused and wanted to be used and abused like the sex doll he was.</span></div></div>",

Karen has placed him on the bed, with her lingerie on and posed him in a very provocative position. After a minute or so, he heard Karen coming up the stairs, making a lot of noise. She came into the room and set down the huge box and leaning it up against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe package finally came! Oh, you\u2019re going to have an interesting time. You\u2019re going to be some stranger\u2019s toy for a while. I wonder what the customer will look like? I\u2019m a little jealous!\u201d, she said as she began opening the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, she finished opening the front of the box revealing another Cathy doll. She was dressed in a the slutty school girl outfit. Her skirt barely covered her ample ass and her top struggled to contain her enormous breasts. It was odd to see an exact duplicate of himself, and got a much better view of his model\u2019s curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren carefully pulled the Cathy doll out of the box and began stripping her clothes, carefully folding them and placing the outfit on the bed, next to Brad. She smiled and winked at Brad as she removed his clothes and began dressing him in the real doll\u2019s clothing. The sensation of being handled by Karen was arousing him as He watched his doll body in the mirror. The real Cathy doll was lying next to him on the bed, face down with her ass on display.. He admired her ass and was pleased that he also possessed the same one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! Now you look just like the real one. Let\u2019s get you ready.\u201d, said Karen as she took Brad over and placed him in the box. Have fun Honey!\u201d, she said as she gave him a peck on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his vision was gone as Karen closed the box and started taping it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is she playing at? She\u2019s bluffing, yeah that\u2019s it. She just wants me to sweat it out a little.\u201d, thought Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear Karen talking on the phone as she got closer to the box. \u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019m sorry, but I realized it as soon as I opened the box... Uh huh.... yeah, the Suzy model... okay, great! I\u2019ll drop the box off today before UPS closes... Thank you so much! ... Okay, you to! Bye!\u201d, said Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell Is happening here? I\u2019m going back to the factory!? I\u2019m not a real sex doll. How is Karen going to get me back!? Oh shit!\u201d, was all that was going through his mind as he felt his weight shift as he was carried out to the car. If he had been paying attention to his wife earlier, he would have remembered his token. With the token, Karen could bring him back whenever she wanted, no matter how far away or what kind of condition he was in. She was going to give him the real experience by being purchased by a random person, probably for a slight discount since Brad was an \u201copen box\u201d Item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad tried to relax since there was little that he could do about the situation in his present state. Karen must have a plan to get him back. He was freaking out until he remembered about the token. He was an idiot and felt bad for thinking that Karen was abandoning him. She was going to let him be used by some random person. He was trapped, at least for now, as some exaggerated female sex doll. How long he would be stuck, was a question that would go unanswered. The thoughts running through his pretty little head were exciting him more than he could admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays later, the box opened and he could see a brightly lit room that resembled a kind of workshop space. A man dressed in a plain white coat stepped toward Brad to retrieve him. The man placed Brad\u2019s sex doll body onto a metal slab. \u201cLet\u2019s get you cleaned up for your new owner.\u201d, said the stranger as he broke out bleach wipes and began to thoroughly wipe down Brad\u2019s Cathy body. He could smell the bleach and the caress of the technicians hands. If he had been able, would have moaned at the feelings from the technician\u2019s examination. After a very meticulous cleaning, he was packaged back up to prepare for shipment to his new owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of being stuck in this form kind of excited him, if he was going to be honest with himself.</span></div></div>",

In the darkness of a shipping box inhabiting the body of a rubber sex doll, all he could do was wait to be opened by a lucky customer. He had plenty of time to daydream imagining the possibilities of who had ordered himself a sex toy like Cathy. He had fantasies of being opened inside a frat house where there'd be plenty of guys to take their turn. He knew how horny college guys were and they'd be willing to experiment with all of his openings. Cathy would be passed around the frat for sure. He knew frat boys were famous for their sexual encounters. He hoped they'd treat Cathy like a real college girl. Brad got horny imagining the scenario of being triple teamed with one guy spreading his rubber legs while simultaneously being forced to give a blowjob to a 2nd guy. The third college stud could pound his thick rubbery ass while they gave each other high fives. Brad recalled how amazing it felt when Karen rammed him from behind. His enhanced sensory inputs were begging for all of his holes to be filled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther scenarios ran through his mind. At this point he didn't care who his new owner was. Whoever it was would be sure to use and abuse him. Nobody ordered a sex doll without sexual cravings and desires in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Brad was delivered. He heard a man's voice through the packaging who sounded excited, \"Honey! Cathy is here!\" Brad was thrilled hearing a married couple had purchased him. He wondered what sort of bedroom fun they had? It obviously involved a sex doll as a 3rd member to their experimentation. He hadn't considered a woman being part of his sexual adventures as a sex toy. He fantasized about them rubbing their breasts together and hoped the wife would wear a strap-on. He'd love to get hammered by a fake huge cock from one side while the husband chose another hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon being opened, Brad was pleased to see the wife was attractive. He couldn't wait until they were all naked together in the bedroom. The wife told her husband, \"Wow! Cathy is even more life-like in person. She will work perfectly to fool the cameras so I can commute in the HOV lane to work!\" Brad's rubber heart sunk while thinking, \"<i>NOOOO. I'm not a prop to get out of a traffic ticket! I'm a sex doll. I want to be fucked!</i>\" The wife continued, \"Cathy's hair looks real enough but I'll have to curl it so it looks more professional. That way she will seem like a business woman riding along in the passenger seat.\" Brad wanted to scream. He didn't turn himself into a rubber doll with porn star proportions to sit in a car the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the husband started massaging their new sex doll's breasts sending a pleasurable jolt through Brad's body while he thought, \"<i>Thank goodness one of them is touching me!</i>\" The wife jokingly slapped her husband's curious hand away, \"Stop it Billy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly giggled \"Sorry Maddie. She just seems so...real. This is amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie gave her husband a smirk, \"I'm way more real than Cathy. Don't you dare waste any of your energy on this toy until I\"m gone. You remember our deal. I'd rather have you screwing a fake doll than hooking up with a slut at the bar while I'm gone. But until then, I get Cathy for my daily commute. When I leave Thursday for a 2 week cruise with my girlfriends, you can play with her all you want. But until then, keep your dick out of her please! I'm going to be gone for 2 weeks and want as much time with my sexy man as possible. I'm a REAL girl. This rubber doll is just my replacement while I'm gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was pleased to hear he wasn't sentenced to spending his time with this family stuck in the passenger seat of a car. He was purchased so the husband had something to play with while his wife was gone. Brad had no idea what day it was but hoped Thursday would come fast. Until then, he'd be riding along with Maddie pretending to be an occupant so she could drive in the HOV lane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie carried her carpool toy into into the master bedroom. Brad assumed she was going to stuff him away in a closet for the time being. But instead, Brad started to get turned on realizing what was happening. Maddie stripped down to her bra and panties and propped Cathy up against the wall. She compared their bodies to one another and felt silly for talking to a sex doll. But given how realistic Cathy looked, she felt the need to speak. As if she was giving a snarly remark to a real woman, Maddie sarcastically laughed as she pointed out, \"...I figured you'd come with enormous breasts. You know us REAL girls don't have perfect hourglass figures like that...shapely hips and ass....or a huge set of tits like you do...\" Brad got aroused as Maddie grabbed a handful of his silicone butt with one hand and used her other to touch her own comparing them, \"Wow? Technology has really advanced. Your ass feels so lifelike. Better you than me. Billy is going to have a blast once I leave for vacation and can have anal whenever he wants.\" More jolts of pleasure ran through Brad's rubber form as Maddie crouched down to investigate Cathy's crotch. She ran her fingers around the sex doll's vagina folds impressed with how realistic it appeared, \"...Oh come on? You have fake pubic hair too? Of course the manufacturer shaped in a really cute landing strip.\" Maddie sighed knowing she was overdue for some self maintenance around her own womanhood. Unlike a sex doll, she was a real woman and had to constantly groom her body. Next, Maddie looked at Cathy's breasts and cupped them both in her hands while rolling her eyes saying, \"I've never seen such a huge set of perky boobs. This is so unfair. They just spring back into place defying gravity...\" Maddie cupped her own breasts for comparison and lifted them. They sagged back down once she let go.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Brad thought this was going to turn into a lesbian encounter. He wanted to be touched again so bad. Maddie stopped her curious exploration and laughed at herself realizing she was jealous of a rubber doll, \"Well Cathy...The good thing is we are the same height. You should fit into most of my clothes.\"  Brad's excitement level went up. When he learned he'd be stuck in the passenger seat of a car he forgot that he'd have to wear clothing. He got aroused knowing he was about to be dressed up in women's attire again. He recalled how alluring the material of his wife's clothing felt against his rubber body while wearing Karen's outfits at home . His sensory inputs were running wild in anticipation of wearing items in Maddie's wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie seemed to slip into giddy-mode now that she had a doll to dress up. She hadn't done something like this since she was a little girl and still played with barbies. But instead of tiny doll clothes, she'd be dressing up a full sized doll with her normal clothing. She opened her top drawer and pulled out a pair of panties and a bra. She held them in her hands saying, \"I suppose undergarments aren't necessary. Nobody will ever see them while I'm driving..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was yearning in anticipation and tried to scream, <i>\"Nooo! Don't throw them back! Put them on me! I wanna feel them against my body!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie almost discarded the bra and panties but knew her husband would appreciate taking them off once he was alone with Cathy. She decided to dress her new doll properly for her husband's sake and started pulling her underwear up Cathy's rubber legs. Brad was relieved thinking, \"<i>Hell yea! If I'm going to be stuck in a car for a few days I may as well have something sexy touching me!</i>\" He had a few orgasms while Maddie affixed the matching bra and panties to his sex doll form. He concentrated on how snug the panties and bra felt on his rubber crotch and nipples. It sent waves of pleasure throughout his fake veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie surveyed her closet, \"Hmm? You need to look like you are going to work just like me. I guess that means you'll be wearing a skirt-suit like I do.\" Brad was going crazy seeing the items she laid out. He was excited that Maddie was considering every detail to pull off the image of a fake passenger in her car. His body pulsed in arousal as she pulled a pair of pantyhose up his legs. The nylon material felt tantalizing against his legs. Next, Maddie dressed her doll in a short business skirt suit. Brad loved how silky the inside of the skirt felt. The material of all the women's clothing he was wearing began sending him into a euphoria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few orgasms later, Brad realized Maddie was curling his hair for a more professional look. She added a necklace and clip-on earrings for effect. Lastly, she grabbed her lipstick and formed Cathy's lips from the 'O' position into a more subtle smile. Brad got excited, \"<i>Oh yea! Smear that makeup on me! Give me tons of it!</i>\" Brad's sensory inputs relished the feeling as Maddie intently applied makeup. Knowing her fake companion had to pass as a real woman for any cameras, she meticulously used all of her products to complete the image. She even applied mascara and eye shadow. Brad enjoyed constant orgasms with each touch of a brush to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie popped Cathy on a chair to examine any missing details, \"Oops. Even though nobody will see them, a girl can't travel without shoes.\" Brad's senses throbbed and pulsed while she slid a pair of heels on his pantyhose clad feet sending him over the edge. He nearly blacked out after having so many orgasms in such a short period of time. He didn't mind being dressed up as a prop for now. The feeling of women's clothing snug around his body turned him on constantly. He knew Maddie would leave on Thursday and Billy would finally have the chance to abuse their new sex doll. Brad hoped he'd dress him in provocative lingerie for their pounding sessions. That way, he could feel the alluring material of women's clothing against his body while Billy stuck his cock inside all of his holes. Until then, Brad would be Maddie's doll. He knew REAL women never wore the same thing two days in a row. It would help with suspicious traffic cameras if Cathy had wardrobe changes everyday. Brad got more aroused knowing he'd be dressed up in lots of Maddie's outfits until Thursday...whenever that was... </span></div></div>",

Brad, anxiously awaiting her departure, heard the door close and her car pull away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly entered the bedroom with a predatory look in his eye. \u201cFinally, it\u2019s just the two of us.\u201d, he said as he approached Brad\u2019s doll body. Billy took a handful of Brad\u2019s breasts and massaged them as he sat down next to him on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s make you a little more comfortable Cathy. That bra is way to restrictive.\u201d, said Billy as he slowly unbuttoned Brad\u2019s low cut blouse. Brad would have been bucking and moaning if he had the ability to move. The pleasure was beginning to overtake him as his breasts popped free of their confinement. Billy put his mouth around one of his erect nipples, sending shivers all through Brad\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly wasn\u2019t content to stop there. He continued to remove all of \u201cCathy\u2019s\u201d clothing. After Brad was completely naked, he examined Brad\u2019s pussy and explored it with his finger. \u201cDamn, you are pretty close to the real thing. We\u2019re going to have a lot of fun! Now, on your knees you little slut.\u201d, said Billy as he picked up Brad and placed him on his hands and knees with his mouth open. Brad watched as Billy unbuckled his pants, revealing a rather large erection. Billy rubbed his dick all over Brad\u2019s face. \u201cYou like that, don\u2019t you Babe? Yeah... I bet you do. Now suck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly jammed his dick into Brad\u2019s open mouth and began thrusting. Brad was loving every minute of this as he watched Billy\u2019s dick slide in and out, his balls slapping Brad on the chin. \u201cNow this was what I was designed for and I\u2019m finally being put to good use.\u201d, he thought as he glanced up to see Billy\u2019s smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not yet Babe.\u201d, said Billy as he removed his penis from Brad\u2019s mouth with a loud plop. He walked around and messaged his ample ass cheeks for a moment and then rammed his dick into Brad\u2019s asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad lost all sense of time and who he really was as Billy fucked him silly. He explored every hole multiple times over the next hour, finally falling on the bed exhausted. Brad\u2019s orgasms eased up as he found himself lying on his back, with his tits falling to each of his sides and his legs lifted and spread apart. \u201cWow, That was unlike anything I\u2019ve ever experienced!\u201d, thought Brad as he remained in that vulnerable position. \u201cBeing a sex doll is really fucking kinky, but I kind of wish that I could move to better participate.. Maybe when I get back, Karen will let me be a flesh and blood version of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thought struck him as odd since he referred to this body as his. He identified with being a simple fuck toy and took great pleasure in being one. He didn\u2019t want to be stuck as a doll forever, but he certainly didn\u2019t want to be bad in his old body any time soon. He wondered when Karen would turn him back? In fact, he wondered how long he\u2019s been a doll? Time was hard to judge as an inanimate sex doll. He guessed a week, but wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cI wonder if Karen is watching through my eyes via the machine? She could easily do that, as well as track my location.\u201d, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly grabbed Cathy and slung her over his shoulder. \u201cTime to watch the game Babe. You can keep me entertained if the game gets boring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy loved the feel of her tits flopping around as Billy walked down the stairs. Maybe Billy would titty fuck her this time! Her pussy tingled as she pictured herself with Billy\u2019s dick getting lost in her tits. \u201cI\u2019m such a slut!\u201d, thought Cathy as she waited for her next adventure.</span></div></div>",

It was amazing! You must have cranked up my sensitivity quite a bit. Being a sex toy was unexpectedly exciting. Waiting around for someone to interact with me was a huge turn on. And those tits! Boy was it fun to have someone play with them! However, I think a shorter amount of time would have eliminated some of the boredom between getting fucked!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren laughed a bit. \u201cI could monitor your \u201cvitals\u201d the whole time and you were loving every minute of it! I had some fun when you were gone as well. I think I\u2019ve got the hang of this thing now. I shared our little secret with my Sister though. I couldn\u2019t risk transforming myself all alone and if something went wrong, we could have both been stuck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, why don\u2019t I have my clothes on this time?\u201d, said Brad looking around for something to cover up with. He eyed a robe on the table and wrapped it around his body. As he stepped on an unfamiliar object, a loud yelp made him jump and fall onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be Brenda.\u201d, said Karen with a giggle as a large black lab got up on all fours. \u201cShe wanted to try it out for herself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad knelt down and pet Brenda on the head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Brenda.

It\u2019s best to keep up appearances and have a good cover story. We\u2019re watching him for a friend.\u201d, said Karen with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s cut to the chase. I demand sex. You\u2019ve been gone far too long and these new tits aren\u2019t going to play with themselves!\u201d, said Karen as she opened her robe to expose her new anatomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they weren\u2019t hard to notice!\u201d, said Brad. \u201cThey are almost as big as mine.\u201d, he said as he nudged his wife playfully. Brad pulled his wife close and explored her new body with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren stopped him and looked toward the dog on the floor. \u201cLet\u2019s take this somewhere more private.\u201d, she said as she blushed a little.</span></div></div>",

Her platinum blonde hair reached her well proportioned bubble butt. Large, innocent blue eyes and pouty lips gave her a clueless look that would make it difficult for anyone to take her seriously. She was unbelievably short, around 4\u201910\u201d and couldn\u2019t walk without a an exaggerated sway to her oversized hips. Her tiny waist made her already enormous breasts seem even larger. Two gigantic mounds of flesh extended from her chest and jiggled back and forth, causing her to grab her tits to keep them from swinging wildly. The cute butterfly tattoo on the small of her back completed the look. She had a body built for sex and Karen couldn\u2019t wait to explore every inch of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow babe! You really outdid yourself. We could make a ton of money with that body at the strip club!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like fun!\u201d, said Brad as he let out a giggle. The squeaky voice that came from his lips surprised even him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god! You sound like a total airhead! Aren\u2019t you adorable!\u201d, said Karen as she walked up to her new bimbo girlfriend. Karen admired Brad\u2019s naked body and reached out to feel his breasts. \u201cNot that anyone will pay any attention to what you have to say when they are looking at these.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooooh! I ahhhhhh... oh, yeah....\u201d said Brad, stumbling over his words as the pleasant tingling sensation made him shiver a bit. Brad walked over to the full length mirror to admire his new body. He lifted up his heavy, full breasts and did a little hop. He giggled again as his breasts jiggled. He turned to the side to get a good look at his perfectly shaped ass and smacked it, giggling again. He could now see Karen in the mirror standing behind him, sporting a huge erection. Brad smiled and slowly opened Karen\u2019s robe and gasped at the size of her new tool. He was going to have fun with this and play his character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wrapped his dainty hands around Karen\u2019s dick and licked it from the base to it\u2019s tip. Brad\u2019s soft, pillows lips closed over the tip of Karen\u2019s penis, causing a moan to escape from her lips. With a loud plop, she released her huge penis, looked her in the eyes and said, \u201cYummy!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad took in as much of his \u201cman\u2019s\u201d penis as he could and bobbed up and down with a slow rhythm. He went gently at first, but began to quicken the pace. Karen was having difficulty standing as Brad sucked her cock like a pro. After a few minutes of this, Brad released her dick with another loud plop and directed her back on the bed. Brad climbed on top of Karen, rubbing his huge tits on Karen\u2019s groin. He then climbed up to Karen\u2019s ear and nibbled on her earlobe, whispering in her ear...\u201dPlease play with my big titties.\u201d Brad then lowered himself on Karen\u2019s cock, moaning loudly. as Karen played with his nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love being your slutty little fuck toy! Oooooooh my pussy is so wet! Oh gawd!!! I\u2019m so fucking horny right now. Yes! YES! YESSSSSSSS!\u201d, said Brad as Karen grabbed his ass and pumped into him faster and faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, both Karen and Brad orgasmed as Karen blew her load into Brad. Brad was screaming by this point, lost in the pleasurable multiple orgasms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally spent, Brad relaxed and plopped down next to Karen with a huge smile on his plump sexy lips. Karen teased his nipples a little more, causing Brad to sigh contentedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never knew women had it that good!\u201d, said Brad as he ran his fingers along Karen\u2019s broad chest. \u201cLife would be so easy in this body! I bet I could get anything I want by putting myself on display.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really? Well there.... hmmmm... \u201cCindi. Yeah, that\u2019s a good name. You\u2019ll get to have the full experience this weekend.\u201d, said Karen with a predatory smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what you think on Monday.\u201d</span></div></div>",

He had given her a general idea of the woman he wanted to become, but left a lot of the details to Karen. After all, he wanted to have a little bit of a randomness to his new body. Karen laughed as she noticed his erection tenting his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take care of that for you.\u201d, said Karen as she pushed the button. Moments later, a short, very curvy Latina woman stepped out of the booth. She smiled as she hefted her new breasts. \u201cMuy Bien!\u201d, said Brad with a confused look on his face. \u201cI don\u2019t speak Espa\u00f1ol.\u201d, he said in a very thick accent. \u201cOoooo, nice addition!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad walked over to the mirror to examine his new body. Long, dark hair went all the way down to his ass. He saw Karen behind him towering over him. \u201cHow short did you make me?! I wasn\u2019t expecting such a drastic change.\u201d, said Brad as he turned to admire his very full ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c4\u20198\u201d.\u201d, said Karen as she pat the new woman on the head. \u201cI have to say, you\u2019re going to turn a lot of heads in that body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren picked up a bag off the table and handed it to Brad. He examined the contents of the bag and found some rather plain panties and a bra, along with what appeared to be a maid\u2019s uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brad dumped the contents of the bag on the table, Karen entered the booth after a quick terminal entry. Brad looked surprised when he saw his body walk out of the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren laughed when she saw Brad\u2019s reaction. \u201cWell, you weren\u2019t using it. Besides, one of us has to be around to keep the farm running smoothly. Now Maria, go get dressed. You have a lot of cleaning to do. You know where the supplies are, but this will complete the look.\u201d, Said Karen as she handed Brad a feather duster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad walked up to Karen and took the duster. This was unexpected, but he was already enjoying the role playing. \u201cYes Master Brad! Should I start in the bedroom?\u201d, he said as he posed sexily and ran the duster along his breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll save the bedroom for last. You will start in the downstairs bathroom and work your way upstairs.\u201d, said Karen with a stern voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d, said Brad. He had hoped for a quicker payoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...?\u201d, said Karen waiting for a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Master.\u201d, said Brad with a little curtsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood girl! Now, better hurry up since Thomas, Rick and Kevin are coming over to watch the game. You\u2019ll be expected to make us snacks and refreshments.

He grabbed a bucket and some various cleaning chemicals and started with the downstairs bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad stood on his tippy toes to see his new face looking back at him. He smiled seductively at himself and blew himself a kiss. \u201cDamn, I\u2019d love to have those big soft lips wrapped around my...\u201d, he thought momentarily until he remembered that those were now his very own lips and well... he was short one cock at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body seemed to know what to do and he got down on his hands and knees and started to scrub. His huge tits were constantly getting in his way, and although they were nice to look at, he wished that they were a few sizes smaller, at least at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about mid day when Karen found Brad cleaning the guest bedroom. \u201cIt\u2019s time for lunch Maria.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad stood up and smiled. He was happy to finally have a break and rest his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have the usual. There are some new groceries in the  fridge. You can serve me in the living room.\u201d, said Karen casually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Master.\u201d, replied Brad, disappointed that he was to see to Karen\u2019s needs before his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad sighed deeply and stretched his back after he finished the bedroom dusting. \u201cDamn, I\u2019m exhausted and my whole body hurts.\u201d, he thought as he sat down on the bed and rubbed his legs. His stomach rumbled loudly, reminding him of his hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting away his cleaning supplies, he made his way down to the kitchen and grabbed himself a sandwich. He was exhausted and wanted nothing more than to lie down on a soft bed and go to sleep. After cleaning up his mess, he went to find \u201cthe Master\u201d. He found a snoring Karen, lying on the recliner. There were empty beer cans everywhere and the TV was showing the week\u2019s football wrap up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad moaned and cleaned up the mess in front of him before retiring to the guest room. He removed his restrictive maid uniform and breathed a sigh of relief. His breasts swayed a good bit when he moved Now that they weren\u2019t restrained by the horribly uncomfortable bra. Realizing that he had nothing else to wear at the time being, he slid his panties off and collapsed onto the bed. He was too exhausted to dig through Karen\u2019s closet to find something that fit. Besides, his body wasn\u2019t a great match for her size. Brad caressed his breasts and smiled. A yawn escaped his mouth as he rested his eyes and quickly fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

The woman was an exact duplicate of his current one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad had a huge smile on his face as Karen climbed on top of him and bent down for a passionate kiss. Their breasts squashed together as their soft lips connected. Karen kisses lower and lower, causing Brad to squirm as she worked her way to her destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad loudly moaned as his doppelg\u00e4nger used her tongue on his clit. \u201cOooooooohhhh!

Knowing that he matched his wife in every way made the exchange all the more exciting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued their sexual exploration for most of the morning, finally deciding that it was time to get up and start the day. After a very erotic shower together, Karen reminded Brad about today\u2019s plans to meet their friends for an early dinner. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to change back mi mujer sexy.\u201d, she said to a disappointed Brad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both put on a robe and made their way to the shed.</span></div></div>",

Love You!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad watched until Karen was out of sight and quickly ran out to the shed. He was dying to transform into a familiar form from last week so he could have a little fun with his more exotic form. Once inside the shed, he brought up the Maria profile and stared at the settings. He smiled as he made a few changes and eagerly stepped into the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMoments later, a beautiful, but more mature \u201cMaria\u201d stepped out of the machine and cradled her slightly sagging breasts. Brad thought it would be more fun to adjust his age a bit to experience his time as an older woman of her mid to late 40\u2019s. Maria\u2019s older form packed on a few more pounds on her already large bust and ass but her slight imperfections only made her all the more desirable. Eyeing the bag on the table, he emptied it\u2019s contents and picked up the bra, hoping it still fit his slightly larger form. Next, he threw on the bright yellow sundress and examined himself in the mirror. A hot Mexican MILF seductively stared back at him. Her breasts seemed even larger now that the bra held them up at a higher angle. The dress perfectly hugged her curves and left little to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad made his way back to the house, eager to try out some of Karen\u2019s sex toys, especially her new vibrating dildo.

So good to see you!\u201d, said Harold, gritting his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello! So nice to meet you Tara!\u201d, said Brad as an awkward silence gripped the rooms \u201cSo how do you know Harry?\u201d, asked Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that Harold never mentioned me. I\u2019m his ex wife. The one that got away and left poor Harold with a broken heart. I still feel horrible about leaving you in that state, but we had drifted apart. I\u2019m glad to see you back on the wagon! Good for you!\u201d, said Tara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I should buy you a drink for releasing this guy back into the Wild.\u201d, said Brad as he put his arm around Harold and drew him close.   \u201cAnd is this your son?\u201d, asked Brad as he gestured toward her boyfriend he guessed to be in his early 40\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is my boyfriend!\u201d, said Tara coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, good for you! You two make a lovely pair. I hope you\u2019re not upset, I can\u2019t be the first person to think such a thing.\u201d, said Brad as he turned back to Harold who was grinning like an idiot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara\u2019s scowl said it all as she stormed back to her table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad could feel Harold\u2019s heart beating faster as he lowered his hand to his thigh. Brad could smell his dates cologne as he leaned in closer. Harold put his arm around his date and the two shared a moment as they gazed into each other\u2019s eyes. Harold moved in closer and kissed \u201cMaria\u201d. A moan escaped Brad\u2019s<br>\r\nlips as Harold\u2019s hand moved down to Maria\u2019s ass. Brad wanted nothing more than to take Harold to a motel and tear his clothes off while they did naughty things to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Tara and her friend stormed out of the bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d I do?\u201d, asked Brad as he tried to collect himself. His close proximity to Harry had stirred something inside him. The logical part of his mind told him to put some distance between him and Karen\u2019s Dad, but he realized now, how much he craved experiencing sex with an experienced male partner. Harry imagined Harold exploring inch of his sexy female body. His nipples got hard as he pictured himself riding Harry\u2019s cock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d, whispered Brad in his sexy accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold\u2019s interest in the game suddenly faded as he strode up to the bar to pay their tab.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Turning into a middle aged version of his Maria body for kicks, getting caught in this body by his wife and father-in-law and having to pretend to be his own maid, and then going to a bar with Harold and drinking a lot before running into Harold's ex and then helping to shame her by...'<i>Oh God I made out with my father-in-law.</i>'.  Brad said his eyes jolting open with a rush of energy at this thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Brad rustled around in his bed, he noticed something moving beside him.  Afraid of what he was about to see, Brad slowly turned his head, and there under the covers next to him was his wife's father next to him in the guest room bed.

Brad's eyes went wide, he couldn't believe his wife had just caught him in bed with her own father.  But instead of being shocked or even angry like he expected, Karen had a huge smile on her face.  What's more, she was holding a trey filled with toast, eggs, and delicious smelling bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast in bed?  I should have had a tree fall through my house ages ago.\"  Harold said with a laugh at his own joke as Karen came up with the trey and put it on the bed.

Brad had always felt a little awkward with how comfortable Karen and Harold were with making sex jokes around each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok Maria, I don't mind.\"  Karen said still laughing, \"After all, seeing you and dad stumble into the house and go straight up to bed while ripping your clothes off was a nice sight.

Hell, dad, I'd rather see you in bed with Brad if it meant you were getting over that bitch Tara.\"  Brad did at least laugh a bit at this inside joke between the two of them as Harold said, \"Hah!  I can't believe it but I might actually agree with that.  In fact, now that you say it...damn, this is the first time I've had sex since the divorce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold finished off his toast before turning his full attention to Brad, \"But damn, if you aren't the best way to break out of a slump.

I'm glad I helped you get over that bitch.\"  Brad said, and he did actually mean that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn straight!\"  Harold said victorious as he grabbed some bacon and held it to Brad who took the meat from his hand with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation died down as Harold and Brad finished their breakfast in bed and Karen went back downstairs.  Harold got up and asked 'Maria' if she wanted to shower with him, but Brad said he needed to talk to Karen.  Harold was disappointed, but didn't say anything else as he went to the bathroom and the second the door closed Brad went downstairs to see his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin from ear to ear Karen said, \"Who knew all it took for you to finally get along with my dad was for you to become an older woman.\"</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s never been one for lasting relationships, especially after his previous marriage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked up at Karen and rubbed tears from his eyes. \u201cSo you\u2019re really not mad. I mean, I wanted to have sex in this body, but figured it would be you when you returned. I certainly didn\u2019t set out to spend the evening fucking Harold. We actually do get along quite well and I hope it\u2019s not awkward when I see him in my male body. He\u2019s actually pretty fun to be around and we did have a good time last night.\u201d, said Brad as his mood brightened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Brenda is sneaking in some clothes that should fit you better. The will at least make do until we fill out your wardrobe a bit more. You\u2019re going to look great in one of those skimpy maid outfits.\u201d, said Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad chuckled as he adjusted his clothing a bit. \u201cIn all seriousness, I could use a better fitting uniform. Well, I suppose I can put up with Brenda\u2019s taunts for a few hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to say, you really out did yourself with this body. Though I\u2019m surprised you made yourself so much older. It\u2019s kind of sexy though. Once Dad is gone, maybe I could become a better match for that body.\u201d, said Karen as she hungrily took in her husbands curvaceous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded his head as he pulled himself together. \u201cI have to admit that I like being a woman quite a bit. Maybe we could trade our normal bodies for a while so you can experience things from a male point of view. Also, it will give you a better perspective on how your Dad treats me as your husband.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled and gave Brad a hug. \u201cThose things really do get in the way.\u201d, said Karen as she playfully hefted one of Brad\u2019s breasts. \u201cCome on, I think I hear Brenda\u2019s car.</span></div></div>",

Sighing knowing what his wife wanted him to do, Brad said, \"I'll get it mam.\"  And Brad made his way to the front door and opened it to Brenda wearing the biggest smile Brad had even seen since Brad and Karen's wedding years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...<i>Maria.</i>\" Brenda said barely holding in a laugh, \"I hear you're getting along VERY well with my dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to address the situation with Harold any more than he had to, Brad ignored the remark and just said, \"I understand you have something for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda nodded and passed Brad the duffle bag, \"It's just some sweats so you don't have to wear the uniform out.  I don't really know your size and probably don't have anything to fit you, but we'll take care of that when we go out shopping,\"  Brenda said stepping into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going shopping?\"  Brad asked as they entered the living room where Karen and Harold were waiting, Brenda hugged and kissed her father before addressing Brad again, \"Of course we're going shopping, it'll be a girls day out.  I need to get some new shoes, Karen needs a new dress, and since you've done such a good job around the house, and since you're dating our dad we should get you a thing or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad obviously looked a little uncomfortable as Harold said, \"Now girls, if Maria doesn't want to go shopping with you, she doesn't have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you just want some more one on one time with her.\"  Karen said giving her dad a joking elbow to the side, \"Besides, once you see what we get Maria you'll be glad we got it for you, hell you could say it's going to be just as much a gift for you as it is for her.\"  Karen gave a wink to her dad who laughed and looked at his bedmate from last night, \"Sorry Maria, I tried, but when these girls want to do something I just can't stop them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled!  Maria, you can change out of your uniform in the car.  Let's go before all the good sales are taken!\"  And before Brad could protest, his wife and sister in law were using him out the door for a day of shopping.  When the three got in Brenda's van, and Brad started changing out of his maid uniform into some grey sweats Brenda provided he said, \"So what in the world did you mean by 'it's just as much a gift for Harold'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren rolled her eyes, \"Isn't it obvious, since you're going to be Maria for a few more weeks you need clothes that fit, including underwear.  And I know that shop we're going to is having a sale on lingerie so we're definitely getting you at least one set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already got a bra and it's doing good enough.\"  Brad said adjusting the bra he'd been wearing since he'd transformed into Maria.  But Karen shook her head, \"Brad, that's one of my mine, and in case you haven't noticed you've made yourself much more gifted upstairs than me, that thing is barely holding your girls in and trust me, after wearing an ill fitting bra for a weeks, you'll be begging me to take you bra shopping.  We're doing you a favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, fine, but lingerie?  Seriously?  I've seen you wear that and there's one reason to wear that stuff and it's just to look sexy, something that's not exactly my priority right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren sighed, \"Brad, how does it make you feel when I wear some of my nicest, silkies, and sexiest lingerie I've got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it, you know that.\"  Brad said feeling like he was about to step into a trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I love that you love it.  And I'd love for my dad to feel that feeling too.  He hasn't had a woman go out of her way to dress sexy for him since....I don't know, maybe our birth mom?  Tara sure as hell didn't I can guarantee you that.  And dad's had plenty of short term girlfriends who he just loved and left long before they could reach that stage of a relationship.  Just...I know my dad would love it if a woman made herself look and feel sexy for him.  You know what I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad didn't know Karen could get so emotional and serious about lingerie, but Brad still saw problems, \"Ok, say I agreed to this, doesn't dressing up like that for your dad imply that this is more serious than a casual thing?  I like your dad more than I did yesterday, but that doesn't mean I want to be in a relationship with him.  And if a girl dressed up in lingerie for me, I'd want to marry them, or did you forget about that part when we were dating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda brushed off this concern, \"You're being paranoid Brad, dad doesn't want to get married again and doesn't want a serious relationship.  Now let's get you some sexy underwear!\"  Brenda said pulling up to the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long and successful shopping effort.  Within the 3rd hour stuck in a dressing room with unending supplies of clothes thrown at him, Brad was beginning to master the mysteries of putting on and off his own bra by himself.  And dozen bras and panties, a few skirts and tops, and one see through red set of lingerie later, 'Maria' had a wardrobe good enough to last while Harold was staying with Brad and Karen.</span></div></div>",

Harold turned his attention from the TV and looked toward Brad, who smiled and dropped his robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold\u2019s jaw just about hit the floor as he looked at the vision in front of him. Brad pushed him back as Harold tried to get up. He seductively crawled over to where Harold was lying and climbed on top of him. Harold reaches up to feel his breasts as they hung down and Brad moaned loudly. After a few minutes, he started kissing Harold\u2019s body as he worked his way down and unbuckled his pants. Brad stared at the large member in front of him and hesitated for just a moment. Harold made him feel sexy and he wanted to pull out all the stops tonight. He lowered his head and began the best blow job that Harold ever had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two lovers continued well into the late hours of the night, getting to know each other on a very deep and intimate level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold held \u201cMaria\u201d tightly as they finally ran out of energy. Right before Brad drifted off to sleep, he heard Harold whisper the words... \u201cYou might be a keeper.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Harold's contractor had finally finished the repair work on his house and he was going to move back into his home tomorrow.  But Harold was a little disappointed with this news, he'd enjoyed living with and getting to spend time with his daughter again, and he <b>really</b> enjoyed the company of Maria.  The two of them had been sharing a bed for the last month and Harold was not looking forward to spending his nights without her again.  And Brad and Karen could tell Harold was a little reluctant to leave under the circumstances, so they decided to send him out in style.  Karen was going to begin preparing a small feast for Harold's last meal with them, and 'Maria' and Harold had talked about surprising each other for their last night together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad had left with Brenda to get cooking supplies and another special set of lingerie for the special night.  Brad had been a bit weirded out about the whole sleeping with his father-in-law thing, but the combination of having female hormones coursing through his brain for a month, plus the fact that he was really seeing some of his wife's favorite traits in her father made the experience a positive one.  Although he was ready to try the tricks he learned for his father-in-law with Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Karen was chopping up vegetables, Harold made his way into the kitchen and kissed his daughter on the cheek.  \"I'm going to miss all of this, it's been nice having people in the house again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be silly dad, Brad and I can come visit any time.  But don't worry, we'll call ahead first in case you have one of your many lady friends over.  I know you've gotten along with Maria, but I bet you're ready to get back on the singles scene again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know darlin', I'm getting a little too old to be flirting with all the girls at the bar, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonescene!  Who are you and what have you done with my dad?\"  Karen joked, \"I hope the veggies are chopped up enough for Maria, I've never been a fan of doing my own cooking, hell it's one of the perks of when I married Brad...and hired Maria.\"  Karen added at the end to keep up the illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold laughed himself, \"Well, if I have my way you might have to fend for yourself until your husband gets back from this never-ending work trip he's on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren looked at her dad confused, \"What do you mean by that dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold fidgeted a little bit before he said, \"I've given it a lot of thought, and Maria is a special girl.  I haven't felt this way about a woman since...maybe ever.  So, tonight after dinner when we're alone in the room, I'm gonna do it.\"  Harold said as he pulled out a small velvet box and revealed a diamond ring, \"I'm going to propose, and hopefully she's just as crazy about me as I am about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren's brain froze for a second, never in her wildest dreams did she think her dad would want to get married again, especially with how his last marriage ended with Tara.  \"But dad...you're not meant for married life, you know that!  You like being single too much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because I never found someone as special as Maria.  You remember before you got married and I gave my doubts?  The way you described how you felt about Brad, well, I feel that way about Maria.  So, hopefully she'll say yes, and I'd love it if you were ok with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren didn't say anything as she marveled at her husband's ability to somehow seduce members of her family into wanting to marry him.  \"Dad...I just...are you sure this is what you want?  This is what will make you happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely!\"  Harold said,  \"And it may be awkward, but I'm willing to share her.  She can keep working here if you really want her to and she wants to.  I mean, it's not the first time your mom would cook and clean for you.\"  Harold said with a hearty laugh that Karen shared as she wondered how the heck she and Brad were going to get out of this.</span></div></div>",

It looks like it was made for that body of yours.\u201d, said Brenda as she followed Brad\u2019s gaze to the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled briefly before looking down at the floor. \u201cToday is my last full day in this body. Harold would love that dress though.\u201d, he said before a tear formed in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaria? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d, asked Brenda with a surprised look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing.

They had just got in the car when Brad finally lost control and started crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda hugged Brad and waited for him to calm down enough where he could discuss what was bothering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese damn hormones! I just can\u2019t control myself sometimes. We can go now, I think I\u2019m better now.\u201d, said Brad as he wiped his eyes and checked his makeup in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I know what\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen you this happy in years. Sure, you\u2019ve been happy, but O don\u2019t think that I\u2019ve seen that face look remotely sad until just now. I know you love Karen, but I really think that body suits you better than your male one.\u201d, said Brenda sincerely. \u201cYo don\u2019t want to give it up do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrad looked up at Brenda and hesitated a moment before nodding his head. \u201cYou\u2019re right Brenda. You always have been good at reading people. I don\u2019t want to go back to my old life anymore, but I don\u2019t want to do that to Karen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Dad?\u201d, asked Brenda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad began to tear up again. \u201cThree nights ago, I told him that I loved him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. Well, did he say anything back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, no. He just smiled and was quiet for a long time. He hasn\u2019t brought it up since then. I\u2019m afraid you were right about him. He\u2019ll be moving on now that his house is back in order.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda held Brad\u2019s hand and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Maria. Dad is quite a charming man, but really not the settling down type. You never know for sure though with him. I mean, you should give it a chance and see where things go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Karen?\u201d, asked Brad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaren loves you and her Dad. She\u2019s been so happy to see you two get together. Don\u2019t you worry about that right now. I know my sister well, and I think she has already seen the writing on the wall. It\u2019s only a short step for her to admit it to herself. You are much happier as Maria than you ever were as Brad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled at Brenda. \u201cThank you Brenda. It helps more than you could know to talk about this with someone. Could you imagine trying to talk this over with the a therapist? You see, it all started when we found that transformation machine...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women had a good laugh before Brenda started the car and began the drive home.</span></div></div>",

Brenda had warned Brad that this set was a few sizes to small for Maria's body, but he didn't care.  It was the sexiest looking set the store had and for his last night together with Harold, Brad wanted to make it a memorable one.  As Brad observed Maria in the mirror, careful not to breath too deeply or move to swiftly, he didn't think he could make this body look even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if this is my last time as Maria, damn it I'm going out on top...and bottom.\"  Brad giggled to himself as he opened the door to the bathroom and made his way to the guest bedroom where Harold was waiting.

What's going on?\"  Harold looked up at Maria with a serious look in his eyes, Brad felt a chill down his spine, was Harold about to break up with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Maria...you look, just wow.  I want to just get up and rip that right off you...but I need to talk to you first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never been one for words, why start now?\"  Brad said moving to the bed hoping to get Harold's mind back in his pants, surely he wouldn't be able to break up with her once she was done with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Maria, I need to say something to you.  I've been thinking about it for a while, and now might be the last chance for me to do this the right way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"  Brad asked finally resigning to hearing what Harold had to say.  Harold got up and began to pace around the room, \"I've never been good at this, and I've done it more times than I'd like to admit, but...ah screw it.\"  Harold approached Maria with purpose and before Brad realized it, Harold was down on one knee.  \"Maria, will you make me the happiest man alive and marry me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wanted to see this body naked and have hot, passionate sex with his new master. He still had four hours to clean and prepare snacks. Maybe he could just order pizza? One of his breasts popped free of it\u2019s lacy prison and almost threw him off balance. He let out a squeak as he grabbed his tit and gently stuffed it back into his uniform, then went looking for Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren was in the recliner, relaxing with a trashy romance novel.

Brad slowly teased her with his tongue as she closed her eyes and moaned. Brad wrapped his lips around her cock and quickly picked up his pace. Karen bucked as Brad brought her closer and closer to orgasm. Finally, as she thought she was going to pass out, an orgasm erupted through her body as she shot her load into her horny maid. She just relaxed and enjoyed the after glow as Brad sucked up every last drop. He was fingering his pussy as he did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough Maria, now back to work!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Master!\u201d, said Brad as he straightened up his uniform and fixed his hair. \u201cI\u2019m here to serve!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled as she watched Brad\u2019s ass jiggle as he walked away.

Karen cleared her through as Rick looked up to meet \u201cMaria\u2019s\u201d eyes, blushing a bright red. Brad knew that he was certainly Rick\u2019s type of women. Out of the whole group, he was also the only single man in the room. Brad smiled broadly and set the tray down on the table, making sure that he gave Rick a good view of his tits as he bent over. \u201cThis is going to be fun!\u201d, thought Brad as he realized the power he held over the group. He gave Rick a subtle wink before heading back to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad spent most of the night fetching beers and food for the guys. He spent most of the evening flirting with Rick. A few times during the evening he had \u201caccidentally \u201c bumped into Rick, making sure to brush his tits against his chest the first time, and his ample ass the second time. He knew Rick was doing his best to hide his erection at times during the evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, as he was cleaning up in the kitchen, he could faintly hear Karen in the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend... I\u2019m sure she would like that... She only works a few days a week for us, She could certainly accommodate you... Uh huh... I\u2019ll put in a good word for you Rick!\u201d, said Karen in his male voice. He could barely make out what she was saying and couldn\u2019t hear the other side of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing in there?\u201d, thought Brad, suddenly worried. \u201cIs she setting me up on a date!? With Rick!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys said their goodbyes as the party wrapped up. Rick gave Brad a warm smile as he walked by. \u201cIt was nice to meet you Maria! I hope we cross paths again soon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was the one blushing now as Rick turned on the charm. \u201cSi! It was nice to meet you as well. Have a pleasant evening.\u201d, Brad\u2018a thoughts drifted to Rick\u2019s lean body and, larger than average, penis. He was staring at Rick\u2019s crotch as he was daydreaming about his friend\u2019s body. After Karen cleared her throat, he snapped out It and looked up to see Rick smiling. He had obviously been busted staring at Rick\u2019s big bulge. Brad, blushing even more, looked at the floor and hurriedly left the room.</span></div></div>",

Rick is going to hire you out for the week.\u201d, said Karen as she sat next to Brad on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled and looked up at his wife\u2019s male face. It was odd to see himself from an outside point of view. \u201cDid I earn my reward tonight?\u201d, asked Brad submissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, the night isn\u2019t over quite yet. You still have some cleaning up to do.\u201d, said Karen with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad gave Karen his best pout and lightly ran his fingers along Karen\u2019s large penis. \u201cIs it really hot in here, or is it just me?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad reached the zipper on his back and slowly unzipped his uniform and let it fall to the ground. Moments later, his skirt followed suit. He now stood almost naked in front of Karen, clothes only in a bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaked housekeeping? I like that idea very much. Now, tell me... Would you rather your reward come from my female body, or would you like to spend the night with your own body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s no need to change back just yet. I want to see what a female orgasm feels like\u201d, said Brad in his heavy accent. \u201cAfter I clean up, of coarse. In fact, I think I\u2019d like to stay in this body for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood girl! Now take that plump booty of yours into the kitchen and get started!\u201d, commanded Karen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad reached down to collect his clothes when Karen reaches to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, leave them. I like your current outfit a lot more. By the way, you! Also, you\u2019re going to be in Rick\u2019s service tomorrow. I saw the way you were looking at him. He could really benefit from getting laid. I doubt that he\u2019s had sex since his wife left. In fact, you have my permission to do anything you\u2019d like to with him. I think the female experience will be good for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled and wandered toward the kitchen to clean up so his night of adventure could finally begin. Karen gave him a playful smack on the ass as he walked by.</span></div></div>",

He could hear snoring from outside the door. Opening the door confirmed that Karen was fast asleep on the bed. A few gentle nudges were met with an irritated dismissal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was horny as hell and certainly wasn\u2019t going to be able to sleep until he dealt with his urges. With a loud grunt, he left and made his way to the guest bedroom. He closed the door and walked over to the full length mirror. \u201cI finally have a chance to get a good look at this body!\u201d, he thought as he did a strip tease for himself. His slowly slid his panties down as he looked at his amazing ass in the mirror. Next, he removed his restrictive bra and had a sigh of relief once his breasts popped free of their cotton captor. He admired the naked beauty before him and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet Rick would pay anything to see this!\u201d, he said quietly. Images of Rick\u2019s naked body flooded his mind as he recollected his embarrassing moment earlier. He could feel himself getting wet as he played with his nipples. He wondered what it would be like to have a man caressing them and he thought of Rick. Ever so slowly, his hand inched down to his pussy as he imagined Rick\u2019s hands exploring his curvy body. The first moan that escaped his lips was quiet as his finger penetrated his pussy. Slowly at first, he began to slide his finger in and out while the other stimulated his clit. As the tempo increased, so did the volume of his moans. Brad fell back into the bed and got lost in his fantasy. \u201cOooooooh... yeah. Don\u2019t stop!\u201d, moaned Brad. \u201cOh RICK! OH YEAH! FUCK ME HARDER RICK! I love that BIG... MAGNIFICENT... COCK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad lost control as the first orgasm hit. He squirmed around on the bed, basking in the afterglow of his first female orgasm. As the euphoric feeling finally started to subside, he opened his eyes to see Karen, in his original body, looking down at him from the doorway.</span></div></div>",

He was going to be treated like a stranger and as much amazing role play sex with his wife sounded, that wasn't quite going to scratch the itch he had right now.  But since he wasn't able to get that across, Karen just heard her husband didn't want her.  A surprised and then an ugly look came on Brad's old face.  \"You don't want me?  All right.  Fine.

Rick would be here shortly to pick him up and he still had to smooth things over with Karen. \u201cNot before I fix my makeup though.\u201d, thought Brad as he looked in the mirror. Once he finished up, he went downstairs to search for Karen, who was nowhere to be found. It wasn\u2019t until he looked out of the window that he noticed one of the vehicles was gone. He tried texting her and still didn\u2019t get a response. Frustrated, he gave up and was going to eat some breakfast when he heard a car coming up the driveway. Hoping it was Karen, he ran outside, only to see Rick getting out of his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d, said Rick as he got closer. \u201cReady to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad tried to stall. \u201cI haven\u2019t had breakfast yet. Can you give me a few minutes?\u201d He was hoping that Karen might come back if she thought he had already left for Rick\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter yet, I haven\u2019t had breakfast either. We can stop on the way. My treat!\u201d, said Rick enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad realized the futility of the situation and agreed. After he retrieved his bag of extra clothes, Rick opened the door for him like a gentleman and waited until Brad was seated before gently closing it. Brad pulled the seatbelt over his large breasts and realized he had to place the strap between his cleavage, emphasizing their size even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad tried not to think about Karen and gave Rick his best smile. He knew what kind of women Rick likes and could start seducing him at their breakfast \u201cdate\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick made small talk with Brad during the drive to the diner. Once there, Brad focused on talking about Rick and flirting with him. By the time breakfast was over, he believed that Rick had a pretty good understanding of how attracted \u201cMaria\u201d was to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they arrived at Rick\u2019s House, he showed \u201cMaria\u201d where the cleaning supplies were and a quick tour of the house. Brad made sure to rub his body against Rick whenever the opportunity presented itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Brad got to work. The machine seemed to give his body certain skills associated with cleaning and would need it based on the state of Rick\u2019s house. It wasn\u2019t until around 5 in the afternoon that he had finished the last of the cleaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! This place looks amazing!\u201d, said Rick as he looked around the room. \u201cHow about you let me take you to dinner as a special thank you! It\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled and accepted Rick\u2019s invitation. He was really enjoying the attention that Rick was giving him. It was exciting to be treated like a real woman and had completely forgotten about his status with Karen. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about where this date might go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad changed into a yellow sundress that hugged his curves in all the right spots. He touched up his makeup and slipped into some heeled sandals. After a quick adjustment to his hair, he went to find Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick stood there admiring Brad\u2019s curvaceous body as he  sauntered sexily into the room. He could tell that he had Rick\u2019s undivided attention. Also, it helped that his kids were with his Mom for the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they arrived at the restaurant, Rick informed the hostess that he had reservations for two. Brad was enjoying all the hungry looks that he was getting from the males and jealous looks from their dates. An attractive woman walked by and slowly examined his body from head to toe, obviously interested in him. She gave him a wink as she \u201csqueezed\u201d by him, rubbing her body against his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad had finished his second margarita when the check came. After they left the store, Brad grabbed Rick\u2019s hand as they walked toward the car. \u201cLet\u2019s go watch the sun set over the lake!\u201d, said Brad, trying to extend the evening and make his move. Rick smiled and let Brad lead him to a small park bench where they had a great view and we\u2019re in a very secluded spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad leaned into Rick\u2019s shoulder as he ran his hand up his thigh. He could see a bulge tenting in his pants as he teased him with his light touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick leaned over and slowly kissed \u201cMaria\u201d on the lips. Lightly at first, then much more passionately. Brad moved his hands up and focused them on Ricks crotch. He gasped as Rick\u2019s hand started to caress her right nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Brad straddled his body over Rick\u2019s lap and unbuckled his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaria... we shouldn\u2019t. Not here at least. What if someone...\u201d, said Rick before Brad places his finger over his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was quiet as his hot date freed his penis from his tight pants and licked it. A moan escaped his lips as she wrapped her lips around it and began to suck. Rick could do nothing but sit back and let \u201cMaria\u201d continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was amazed at how long Rick lasted before he blew his load. \u201cThat bodes well for later!\u201d, he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back to my place!\u201d, said Rick as he helped up his date and buckled his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was a walking wet dream And certainly a woman that he would like to have sex with. He wasn\u2019t sure how long he would need to serve as Karen\u2019s maid, but found his new position enjoyable. Something about being a sexy servant aroused him in ways that he never thought possible. His hand lingered on his breast as he slowly rubbed it. He only paused only briefly before he took his top off and unclasped his bra. He grabbed his flopping tits with his dainty hands and smiled. He slowly started to tweak his nipples, causing a sexy moan to escape his lips. He didn\u2019t get far before he heard a male voice clearing his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaria... I don\u2019t pay you to play with yourself. Back to work now.

Karen looked down at his breasts and felt him up, causing another moan to escape his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease let  me get back to work now, Master Brad.\u201d, said Brad reluctantly, but playing along. Brad carefully picked up his clothes and expertly put on his bra to contain his two new assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren winked at him before saying, \u201cMaria, the boys will be here around 7:00. I want you to finish up here and start prepping the food. I\u2019ve placed the menu on the table, but you will need to run to the store fans purchase the ingredients.

His wide hips reminded him, with every step, that he was no longer Brad. The feeling of his breasts swaying Back and forth made him horny as his high heals clicked on the concrete. He could feel the men staring at his tits and ass as he made his way down the street, toward the grocery store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arrival, Brad struggled a bit with the shopping cart and began moving through the store. He only now realiszed that it was difficult to read the English labels on everything, but still managed to complete the list. He decided to have a little fun and flirt with the handsome cashier who rang up his order. He was surprised at how naturally the flirting came to him, but realized that he was more than a little attracted to this man. He didn\u2019t have to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad blushed as he took his change and retrieved his bags from the end of the belt.

Karen had brought him food occasionally, but made him stay in the shed out of fear of being discovered by the farm hands. Brad didn\u2019t have much to do, aside from surfing the internet and masturbating. He had succumbed to his more primal instincts and admired some pictures of some hot female monkeys while he took care of some urges.

He found himself WANTING to please Karen and be a good girl. His dog instincts where certainly influencing some of his actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was introduced to many dogs on the trail and he quickly became proficient at greeting the other dogs in the proper manner. All the hikers talked about how beautiful his coat was. He beefed with pride at every compliment and wagged his tail almost uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were about a mile into the trail when they met a man with another golden retriever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, she\u2019s a beautiful dog!\u201d, said a tall athletic man as he approached Karen and Brad. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi!

You wouldn\u2019t happen to be looking for a stud?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSammy certainly is a handsome boy! I bet they would have the most adorable pups!\u201d, said Karen as she winked at Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was the word \u201cpups\u201d that snapped Brad out of his drifting mind. It reminded him of his current gender and his ability to have puppies. That mesmerizing scent from Sam woke him up to the fact that \u2018ole Sammy might be getting a bit too friendly. He made sure not to turn his back on the very handsome dog. </span></div></div>",

He really loved Karen\u2019s sexier body and was anxious to explore it more once he was the same species again.

Karen and Brad relaxed in front of the tv until it was time to go to bed. He followed his former wife up the stairs to the master bedroom and watched her undress. Her modified body was on complete display as she threw off all her clothes. Brad wished that he was still human so he could spend the night fucking his beautiful wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what you see?\u201d, said Karen with a wink. \u201cYou still have some time left before you\u2019re equipped to satisfy this body.

If you were outside when it happened, you would think that you\u2019ve always been a woman and your memories would adjust to that fact.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? So our friends won\u2019t know the difference?\u201d, asked Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot if they aren\u2019t in the room\u201d, answered Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we waiting for?\u201d, asked Brad as he headed toward the shed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren reviewed the manual once more with Brad, and although there wasn\u2019t much information to glean from it, they were confident that the process could be reversed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren\u2019s finger hovered over the execute button as she looked at Brad and asked, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad pushed her hand down on the button and smiled broadly.</span></div></div>",

Linda and I headed back up to the house. We need to get going soon if we are going to catch our plane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked at his now pink phone with heart shapes on it. Karen looked over his shoulder and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad opened up his Social media app to get a glimpse at his new life and name. He did a double take when he saw the photo at the top of his wall. He was wearing a wedding dress standing beside a dapper Rick, in a tuxedo. His first name was Cathy and his last name matched Rick\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my GOD! I\u2019m married to Rick! I had just assumed that you and I would still be married.\u201d, exclaimed Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at least you married your best friend. I don\u2019t even know this Linda woman.\u201d, said Karen as she held up her phone to show Brad. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck like this for at least the next month. You\u2019d better get used to the idea very quickly.\u201d, said Karen as they headed toward the house. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we expected, but it will be a fun month. We both get to experience our new lives with other people who don\u2019t have a clue about our true past. It will be much more...authentic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick met Brad just outside the door. \u201cWhoah! You\u2019re going to need a new wardrobe with those breasts! Not to say you weren\u2019t already beautiful before you used the booth, but damn!\u201d, said a wide eyed Rick. \u201cIt\u2019ll be an interesting honeymoon.\u201d, said Rick as he kissed Brad. \u201cI can\u2019t wait To see you naked!\u201d, whispered Rick in his new wife\u2019s ear and grabbed her much curvier ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren\u2019s wife, Linda, nudged Karen in the side. \u201cJoe, was that your idea?\u201d, she said in an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled back and tried to act casual. \u201cHoneymoon? Damn, what did I get myself into.\u201d, thought Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSave it for the honeymoon! You can ogle her body later.\u201d, said Linda as she lightly smacked Rick on the back. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a plane to catch?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was a very attractive woman with a slight Spanish accent. She had a nice body with some pleasant curves, but most of it went to her amazing ass. Her skin had a deep tan color and her hair was jet black, braided into a single long pony tail. She was rather tall for a woman, and certainly towered over Brad. Of course EVERYONE towered over Brad in his current form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right. Come on Cat! Paradise awaits!\u201d, said Rick as he looked at his watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave a good time!\u201d, said Linda as she gave Brad a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren gave Brad an awkward smile as Rick ushered Brad to the car.</span></div></div>",

The belt rested deep between his rather large breasts and just emphasized how large his enhanced breasts were. Every pothole caused his breasts to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may have gone a bit overboard with these things.\u201d, said Brad as he noticed Rick staring at them. \u201cEyes up here!\u201d, he said in a slightly annoyed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick smiled at his bride. \u201cI promise to make it up to you Honey! You know... tops are optional at the beach we\u2019re going to.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad couldn\u2019t believe the situation he was in. His was now his best friends wife, on their way to their honeymoon, where he would be fucking his new husband several times a day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad scrolled through some of the wedding photos on his phone. Damn! I\u2019m fucking hot in that dress. Rick is a lucky man. He continued to scroll past pictures of friends and family. He saw Karen giving the toast as the best man and chuckled at the brides made dresses. He didn\u2019t think that the dress complimented any of the bridesmaids bodies. He felt bad that he made them wear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept scrolling, and found a picture of Rick proposing to him at halftime at the championship game. \u201cWell, at least that answers one question.\u201d, he thought as he noticed his face paint and home team jersey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his headphones on and went to listen to music. When scrolling through the videos he ran across an interesting one. He saw himself in skimpy lingerie swaying sexily to music in the background. Rick was down to his boxers and with the noticeable tent in the crotch area, was ready for action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad turned down the volume a bit and tilted his screen away from Rick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Rick was standing up massaging his breast with one hand while deftly maneuvering the other around his back to unclasp his bra. He heard himself moan in the video as Rick sucked on one of his nipples. It wasn\u2019t long before his female self tugged Ricks boxers down And kneeled on the floor. She cupped his balls with one hand and slowly teased his dick with her other one looking up to watch Rick\u2019s reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad felt a little hot under the collar at this point. That was him on the video and it was as hot as any porno he\u2019s ever watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as she parted her lips and start sucking on Ricks rather large member. After a few minutes, she released his penis with a plop and pushed him back on the bed. She was wearing crotchless panties as she hovered over his erection, slowly teasing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to fuck me hard!\u201d, she said as she got closer and whispered in his ear. \u201cI\u2019m your dirty little whore. Just your little fuck toy to use however you want.  I need your big hard dick in my slick, wet pussy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad blushed at the dirty talk, but kept watching. Rick smacked her ass and caused her to moan. \u201cMore!\u201d He slapped her playfully again and pushed upward into her cunt and made her moan even loader. She was now riding his cock as Rick reaches up to play with her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick looked over at his wife and asked what she was watching. This caused Brad to jump, pulling his headphones out of the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH MY GOD! Fuck me harder! Oh, you\u2019re SOOOO big! OHHHHH! OH YES! FASTER!\u201d screamed the woman in the video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad fumbled with the phone trying to shut the video off, finally stopping the extremely loud audio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRick smiles and winked at Brad. That gives me some ideas for tonight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad pictured his huge breasts bouncing wildly as he straddled Rick, bobbing up and down on his huge cock. screaming dirty words, begging him to fuck him harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince this was the situation he was in, he might as well embrace it. There were worse things than being married to your best friend. Watching football would certainly be a lot more interesting as he pictured himself wearing a jersey and nothing else, going down on his husband during half time. He smiled at Rick and blushed. He couldn\u2019t wait to play that scene out for himself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a lot like any other conversation they had as friends, with one small difference. Rick was undressing him with his eyes and had his hand on his left thigh, gently caressing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was starting to see the upside of his new reality. He was an extremely hot woman who was married to a great guy and friend. They still enjoyed doing the same things together but just liked to fuck afterwards. He had yet to be with a man yet and was hoping that he could pull it off. What if he was really bad at it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple waited impatiently as the luggage was being unloaded from the plane. Once it finally arrived, they quickly ran outside to catch a taxi. Brad only briefly noticed how beautiful the scenery was since his attention was mostly focused on Rick and getting him out of those clothes as quickly as possible. After a speedy checkin, they tipped the bellboy and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick held his new wife tightly and gave her a passionate kiss. Brad impatiently felt for Ricks belt and unbuckled it with record speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa Babe! Slow down a little. I want to get a look at that new body of yours a little at a time. It\u2019s not every day that your wife\u2019s already smoking hot body gets magically altered to porn star like proportions.\u201d, said Rick as he explored Brad\u2019s much larger ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled and tied his best to slow things down. He turned on some familiar music on his phone and started to do a strip tease. Rick sat back on the bed as Brad sauntered over to him, rubbing his butt against his crotch as he unclasped his bra. Holding his hands over his tits, he looked back to see Ricks lustful gaze. Turning around slowly, he dropped his hands and let his breasts go free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn!\u201d, was all Scott could say as he reached out to feel his wife\u2019s enlarged breasts. Brad moaned as Rick licked a nipple and rolled it with his tongue. Things escalated quickly from there as their two bodies intertwined on the bed. Their sexual escapades tonight made their previous video seem tame by comparison.</span></div></div>",

The last thing he wanted is to have animal control find him and place him in the zoo. It was illegal to own a spider monkey as a pet and didn\u2019t want to risk being seen. He spent a large chunk of time watching the television that Karen brought him. He was also a little shamed to admit that he passed most of the time masturbating when Karen wasn\u2019t around. He was amazed at how sensitive his penis was and how quickly he recovered. He also spent some of the time reading the manual and had a pretty good understanding of its functions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Brad, it\u2019s time. I\u2019ve given you an extra half hour, just to be sure.\u201d, said Karen as she directed him toward the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad gave a thumbs up with his foot and Karen activated the machine.

Man, that was certainly the most bizarre thing to ever happen to me.\u201d, said Brad. He hugged his wife and felt her modified body\u2019s tits pressing up against his chest. He gave his wife a passionate kiss and began to lift her shirt to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet Brad... Lets take this back to the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, Brad fell back on the bed, exhausted. You know O love your original body, but this one is really fun to play with.\u201d, he said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled and tried to reposition her breasts in a more comfortable position. \u201cI\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have these monsters all the time. They are great in the bedroom, but really get in the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad reached over and played with his wife\u2019s nipple. Karen smacked his hand away and said, \u201cThese things are all you focus on. You know, we could give you a pair as well. Hell, we could give to the whole package and you can deal with them. I also would love to see what a blow job is like from the other end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could accommodate that wish.\u201d, said Brad optimistically. \u201cOr, I have some other ideas that you might find interesting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d, said Karen excitedly.</span></div></div>",

He pulls out Karen\u2019s favorite battery powered dildo and heads to the shed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few minutes Babe. I want to try something a little different.\u201d, said Brad as he put on a robe and headed out to the shed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad grew more excited as he thought about his upcoming adventure as a little plastic sex toy. His erection was rock hard as he finished scanning the device. After setting the delay to 20 minutes, he entered the machine. He paused momentarily, thinking of all the things that could go wrong with this little stunt, but the risk made it even more exciting. After slamming the button the door closed and the machine did it\u2019s work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad exited the booth, grabbed his soon to be twin, and headed back up to the bedroom. He stopped on the way to masturbate one last time in the bathroom to relieve his anticipation of his upcoming transformation. It would be a few days before he had any control over his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked at his watch and headed into the bedroom where his wife was reclined on her back, smiling sexily at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady for another round?\u201d, she said as she pushed the covers off of her, revealing her amazingly curvy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t need any time to recover in a few minutes.\u201d, said Brad as he lay next to his wife with the dildo behind his back. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy being up close and personal in that pussy of yours.\u201d, he said as he lightly ran his fingers across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren moaned and looked over at Brad as he quickly changed shape. His skin took on a plastic look and he quickly diminished in size. She recognized the two didos sitting on the bed and was momentarily confused. She picked up one in each hand and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm... I wonder which one of you is Brad? I kind of lost track when the transformation happened.\u201c, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad still had all of his senses, but could no longer communicate with his wife. He thought it would be even kinkier if she didn\u2019t know which one was him. It would be a huge turn on to be used or watch as the real dildo was seeing some action. He knew that Karen would make sure she both dildos saw plenty of action and his twin couldn\u2019t be transformed by the device, so his identity could easily be determined at a later date. His body tingled as Karen gripped him in her hand. Her tits looked incredibly massive from his much smaller size. It was really an odd sensation to be turned into a piece of plastic with a few electronics inside. His vision was oriented toward the his tip. He wondered what it would feel like when Karen flipped his switch and hoped that she would use him first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren set down the real dildo where it could see what was happening and pushed Brad between her tits. Brad\u2019s mind was overwhelmed by the sensations of rubbing against his wife\u2019s very full breasts. She held him up to her face and kissed him once before she flipped on a switch and Brad began to vibrate uncontrollably. He watched as Karen placed him at the tip of her vagina and teased her clit a little with his \u201cface\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut me in! Damn it, push me into that sweet, sweet pussy!\u201d, thought Brad. He forgot his own name as Karen finally fulfilled his wish and plunged him into her, slowly moving him in and out. As she picked up the pace, Brad couldn\u2019t focus on anything except the long massive continuous orgasm that he was having. After what seemed like an eternity, Karen pulled him out and placed him on the dresser, covered in her juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a minute for Brad to regain his grasp on reality, but he eventually remembered what he was. A cheap little sex toy. A sentient and happy cheap little sex toy. He watched as Karen played with his twin for a while, jealous that it wasn\u2019t him as she sucked on the dildo, pleasuring it with her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Karen took both of the dildos to the sink and rinsed them off. \u201cThat was certainly unexpected. I\u2019ll play along with this little fantasy, but he\u2019s going to owe me BIG time!\u201d, thought Karen as she put both of the dildos up to her face and smiled.  \u201cYou like that, didn\u2019t you? I have to say, that was pretty amazing. I never expected that you would want to become a little plastic dick. Well, maybe not so little. I might have to keep you like this for a while or even upgrade you to the new model. Oh yeah, now that\u2019s a good idea. How would you like that? You like being a little fuck toy, don\u2019t you, DILDO? You\u2019re only good for one thing, but boy do you do it so well. Goodnight Dildo.\u201d, said his wife, right before she unceremoniously threw him into the drawer and closed it. All he could do is sit here until she used him again or changed him back. The severity of the transformation ensured that he wouldn\u2019t be human again for at least 3 days. \u201cI might have made a mistake changing into this form.\u201d, thought Brad as he contemplated his existence as a vibrating, plastic penis. The last thing Brad heard was a giggle and fading footsteps.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had lost track of time in the drawer and had no idea how long he\u2019d been Karen\u2019s dildo. She had used him quite a bit since he took this form, and the experience of being used had been amazing. The time he spent in the drawer, however, was painfully boring. His twin was currently in use while he sat alone in storage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottom of the drawer felt coarse against Brads smooth plastic sides. He was still adjusting to being an object and not a flesh and blood creature. The feeling of having no limbs or ability to move was still very odd to him. Most of all, his inability to breathe really made him feel out of sorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformation booth was an amazing invention. He wondered over the last few days how much his uncle got to enjoy it before he passed. What if it stopped working? Would he have they have the ability to fix it? He was good with electronics and was a bit of a tinkerer himself, however, that skill would be useless in his current form. He would probably be stuck as a sex toy for the foreseeable future.The thought of being stuck gave him a little chill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was really starting to freak himself out when light flooded his storage area. \u201cTime to turn back, Brad. I know it\u2019s you because I already tried to transform my real dildo into you. She started to walk towards the shed, but paused and headed for the bedroom instead. \u201cHow about one more round now that I know it\u2019s you?\u201d, said Karen with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren used Brad so long that his batteries had actually ran out. He wondered what would happen if Karen replaced them. They were a part of him, so it might be a little complicated to transform back into a human missing his parts or having other ones put into me. He didn\u2019t ponder this long though since Karen figured it was time to have her husband back and walked him back to the shed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren entered Brad\u2019s human preset into the machine and set Brad down on the bench inside the booth. After one more adjustment, she activated the machine. Brad felt warm again and gasped as he realized that he had to breath again. He flexed his fingers and limbs as he exited the booth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, that was certainly a Surprise! How did you like the experience?\u201d, said Karen as she checked out Brad\u2019s altered body. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, but I made a few changes to your body. I was pretty lonely these last three days and figure you kind of owe me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cit was fun, but I\u2019m glad it\u2019s over with. You could have at least turned on a tv for me to help pass the time.\u201d, said Brad playfully as he stepped over to the mirror to examine his body. He was a lot slimmer than he had previously been and a bit more muscular. He was an incredibly fit version of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad!\u201d, said Brad, admiring his new form. \u201cIt appears that my clothes adjusted to my new form.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen everything yet!\u201d, said Karen as she ran her hand along his crotch. Brad felt his penis becoming erect, but something seemed.... well... different. The bulge was way larger than it should have been and still growing. He quickly unbuttoned his pants to release the give his penis more room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d, asked Brad as he pulled down his pants. His jaw just about dropped when he saw the gigantic, porn star sized penis attached to him. He smiled a bit as Karen grabbed hold of it with her dainty hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about we go try that out?\u201d, she said impatiently. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I had a real dick in me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad embraced her, then picked her up to carry her to the bedroom. She felt light in his hands with his new found strength. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything I\u2019d like to do more!\u201d, he said with a smile.</span></div></div>",

She had no idea what her dear husband had planned, but all the preparations had been made for a trip. The details were all in an envelope on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief moment, Karen walked out of the booth and gasped! He tits were absolutely enormous, as were some other parts of her body. She made Jessica Rabbit looks flat chested and the slightest movement made her very aware of their presence.\u201c I look like some porn star!\u201d Squeaked Karen in a high pitched voice. \u201cI sound like one too! I don\u2019t even own a bra this large. Hell, I\u2019d probably have to have one custom made! And I barely look 21!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled at her and kissed her passionately. \u201cLet me help you out with that.\u201d He said as he walked into the booth and pressed the button. Once the machine finished, she waited for Brad to walk out, but the booth appeared empty. Confused, she walked up to get a closer look and say a black piece of fabric on the floor of the booth. She lifted up her new sexy bra and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now, what do we have here you little pervert.\u201d, said Karen as she held the bra up to her chest. Slowly, she slipped the soft fabric over her bouncing tits and managed to clasp it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad saw himself in the mirror and would have a huge erection if that were even possible. He was snuggly holding his wife\u2019s impossibly sized breasts as her new bra. Every little move caused him to feel pleasure. He tested his ability to squeeze her breasts slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what now? I\u2019ll go.... WOW!\u201d, said Karen as she felt her bra massage her new chest. That\u2019s, like..... ooooooooooh... don\u2019t stop!\u201d, said Karen as she held onto the table.\u201d Once the sensations finally subsided, she rubbed her bra and giggled. That\u2019s a nice feature! Okay then, let\u2019s see what you had planned.\u201d, said Karen as she opened up the envelope. </span></div></div>",

They'd planned it for months to get away on a long weekend to catch up with her college roommates.  After taking care of her husband yesterday as a monkey, she'd completely forgotten about it.  Karen told Brad, \"Damn.  I guess I'll have to wait a few more days to experiment with the transformation booth.  I'll be gone until Sunday evening.  Don't do anything stupid while I'm gone.  If I'm not around to keep an eye on you, our maid might throw you in the garbage if you turn yourself into an inanimate object.  Or, if you try out another animal you might get loose and caught by animal control and end up at the pound or in the zoo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded while crossing his fingers behind his back.  He was thrilled to find out his wife would be gone for so long.  He was too embarrassed to tell her what he really wanted to try with the transformation booth.  Now he could find out what being a woman felt like in privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, Karen packed up and was gone.  Brad licked his lips and hopped into the transformation booth.  Once he was an exact duplicate of his wife, he did the first thing any man would if they suddenly had boobs.  He played with them for an hour before slipping into the bathtub for some fun.  He fingered himself and had so many orgasms he lost count.  The water had become almost ice cold after spending so much time in the tub.  He finally got out and figured he'd get dressed in some of his wife's clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drying off, he wrapped a towel around his body like he'd seen his wife do plenty of times.  He smiled in the mirror speaking with her feminine voice, \"Well hello KAREN.  I can't wait to dress you up in your sexiest clothes.\"   <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s4.pics.vc/pics/n/424/0a0/62b/5ce/4240a062b5ce0360d22d233cc9b9b665.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s4.pics.vc/pics/n/424/0a0/62b/5ce...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter slipping into a matching pair of his wife's bra and panties.  The first thing he noticed about wearing women's undergarments was how tight they felt.  Wearing a thong was certainly a new feeling.  He adjusted his panties and smiled in the mirror saying, \"Your boobs look great in this sexy bra...KAREN.\"  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s5.pics.vc/pics/n/d6d/4c3/37e/328/d6d4c337e3285ac32237d729a79f132b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s5.pics.vc/pics/n/d6d/4c3/37e/328...</a>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a blue set that he wanted to try.

He liked how the spandex material hugged his wife's curves and held her breasts up firmly.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/2f/2f/5b/2f2f5b5e6f9008a8c13a4fa1eef55d46.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/564x/2f/2f/5b/2f2f5...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he found a lingerie set Karen wore for his anniversary.  5 minutes later, he sat down on the bed after figuring out how to get it on, \"That was a tricky little thing to slip into.\"  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.pornpics.com/pics/2017-01-08/253435_03big.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn.pornpics.com/pics/2017-01-08...</a> <br>\r\nIt was well worth the gymnastic's feat.  He loved seeing how alluring he could make his wife's body look.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a valentines outfit and couldn't resist slipping it on.  He checked out how sexy his ass looked in the mirror striking a pose.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s4.pics.vc/pics/n/282/b15/420/5f6/282b154205f6ea49e8e149568b5f193f.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s4.pics.vc/pics/n/282/b15/420/5f6...</a>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying out another set of his wife's belongings, he struck a pose in the mirror, \"Mmmm.

He carried a clothes basket of the items he'd soiled while masturbating to the washing machine.  He passed a mirror and struck a pose thinking how amazing his wife looked wearing something as simple as shorts and a top.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s4.pics.vc/pics/n/cc0/101/3b1/ac7/cc01013b1ac745d6d869797ab10c4cdc.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s4.pics.vc/pics/n/cc0/101/3b1/ac7...</a> <br>\r\nHe stripped down to throw the items he was wearing in as he got an idea.  He always heard the motion of a washer could help turn a woman on.  He started it and hopped on top.  Within moments, he was screaming in another orgasm.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s4.pics.vc/pics/n/6ac/c2e/2d7/bbb/6acc2e2d7bbb16bdec2409d961cb3e58.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s4.pics.vc/pics/n/6ac/c2e/2d7/bbb...</a>  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Karen wouldn't be home for another few days so he figured he'd stay like this for now.  After spending yesterday in Karen's body, he was learning so much about her that he never knew.  He was excited to surprise her when she came home now that he knew her most sensitive spots.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked through the house, he suddenly heard the door open and looked over his shoulder in shock.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s5.pics.vc/pics/n/5b7/1a6/4b6/8d8/5b71a64b68d8472c4aebb2600a4844a6.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s5.pics.vc/pics/n/5b7/1a6/4b6/8d8...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe REAL Karen came inside stunned to see her own body standing there in a pair of her sexiest lingerie.  She quickly figured out there was only one possible way her twin could be standing there.  Brad had obviously been experimenting with the transformation booth.  Karen giggled, \"Well hello....ME.\"  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s5.pics.vc/pics/n/9c0/860/f33/545/9c0860f33545e8e3ff54053a0a688194.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s5.pics.vc/pics/n/9c0/860/f33/545...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was embarrassed to have been caught in his wife's body. He let out a nervous reply, \"Oh shit!  I was just....Ummm....I can explain....I mean....What the hell are you doing home so early anyways?\" <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s5.pics.vc/pics/n/942/ead/45c/349/942ead45c349ba9d69de3c06869b3faf.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s5.pics.vc/pics/n/942/ead/45c/349...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren giggled at her twin, \"I ditched the girls weekend.  I couldn't keep my mind off our new transformation booth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was beet red after being caught like this.  He tried running away, \"I'll be right back...I'm just going to transform back to normal quick...\"  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s5.pics.vc/pics/n/e0f/a83/05f/936/e0fa8305f936c9fe9cfd3685cc60733d.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s5.pics.vc/pics/n/e0f/a83/05f/936...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren stopped him, \"It's okay honey.  You don't need to feel embarrassed.  I'm super curious to find out what having a penis feels like.  I'm flattered for your first female experience you chose to become me.  In fact, it's nice to see myself from a different prospective. I'm thrilled how great my ass looks in those panties.  I wouldn't mind a little fashion show sometime to see how I look in my other clothing.\"  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s5.pics.vc/pics/n/b0d/932/a7e/c64/b0d932a7ec64eacf84a5cb82a4fb1278.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s5.pics.vc/pics/n/b0d/932/a7e/c64...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was relieved his wife wasn't mad he'd been lounging around the house in her body.  He spent extra time putting all her clothing back into her closet so it looked like nothing was moved. He didn't want to tell his wife that he'd tried on every single thing she owned already.  He shrugged his shoulders acting nonchalant about the offer, \"I'm cool with that.  I always wondered what it felt like to wear a dress.\"  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s5.pics.vc/pics/n/ed7/8e8/0ee/0dc/ed78e80ee0dc74e9b32252baf189d9a4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s5.pics.vc/pics/n/ed7/8e8/0ee/0dc...</a>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren laughed, \"You mean to tell me after spending nearly two days in my body that you didn't try on any of my clothes?  You've just been walking around in my lingerie the entire time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad figured there was no point in lying to his wife.  He laughed and replied, \"Okay fine.  I've worn some of your dresses.  Actually...I tried tons of your clothes on.  FYI, your black cocktail dress looks amazing on you.  So does the blue, red, striped and polka dotted one.   I'm not a huge fan of your pencil skirts. They were really hard to walk in.  You can't get a full stride while wearing such a tight skirt.  You also need some bigger sports bras.  They are so tight on your boobs they squish them together like crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren chuckled, 'That's how they are supposed to look.  Did you happen to try on any of my fancier bridesmaid dresses or formal gowns?  I'm still trying to figure out what to wear to my cousin's wedding next weekend.  I\"m not even sure if they fit me anymore.  In fact, now that we have a transformation booth, we could do a simple body swap and YOU could be the one who gets all dolled up and wears one of my fancy gowns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad liked the idea of going into public as each other.  He nodded, \"Most of your fancier dresses in the front of your closet still fit.  As you start going towards the back of your wardrobe, I could't squeeze into that pink one with ruffles on the sleeves. The zipper wouldn't go up all the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wore that to prom. I was in high school then.\"  Karen laughed, \"That was before I had a boob job and nature happened to my thighs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad understood, \"That explains why the last ten dresses or so didn't fit either.  I figured they were old ones you wore when you were younger.  However, the one in the way back that's in a protective bag still fits.  You know, the really fancy white one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren tried to recall her closet organizing skills and what dress Brad was referring to.  She let out a giggle suggesting, \"Oh no.  You didn't try to squeeze into that flower girl dress I wore when I was a little girl did you?  There's no way that would fit me now.  You'd have to transform into a much younger version of me if you want to wear that around.\"  Karen realized anything was possible now that they had such a magical device, \"In fact..It might be cute to see my old self wearing that adorable dress again. We'd have to travel out of town for that adventure.  I couldn't get away with telling people around here that you are my daughter. Everybody near us knows we don't have kids.  OR...I just tell people you are my niece visiting or something? Then we could stay local.  Nobody would question that.  Ohhhh... I could do your hair in pig tails like I used to wear them all the time.  We'd have to go shopping for some other clothes.   You couldn't just walk around in my old flower girl dress the entire time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad interrupted, \"Whoa.  Hold on.  I'm NOT becoming your little girl version.   It's exciting to find out what it's like to be you now.  I love having tits and an adult pussy that I can play with.  How would you feel if I made you turn into me when I was that age and ended up with such a tiny dick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren giggled, \"Ohhh.  That sounds fun!  Not everything we do with the transformation booth has to be about sex.  I think it would be a blast to be kids again and go to the park.  I was always jealous that the boys got to play on the difficult equipment while us girls played jump rope.  It would be nice to switch things around this time and re-live those days.  Plus, if you plan on going into the world inside my body, you might want to learn some things about women.  There's no better way than to learn from the start.  If you socialized with other little girls you'd learn how our minds work faster.  I don't want you embarrassing me in public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad rolled his eyes, \"Whatever.  We can discuss that later.  Anyways...NO.  I didn't try on your flower girl dress.  I was talking about your wedding dress.  It still fits you perfect like the day we were married.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren sighed happily, \"Awww.  I can't believe I still fit into that thing.  Go put it on!  I want to see how I look in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad blushed, \"I can't exactly do that until tomorrow.  I had a carrier pick it up this morning and bring it to the dry cleaners for overnight service....Which by the way was a total rush answering the door in your body.  That guy totally checked me out...Anyways, I spilled wine on it last night while watching the game.  I was hoping it would be cleaned and hung back in the closet before you knew anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sat around in my wedding dress watching a game?\"  Karen giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad winked, \"So?  I had to wear something.  After how long it took to get on, I wasn't going to take it off.  It was really difficult to get into with all those straps in the back and the accessories that were in the bag.  I wore all your wedding lingerie underneath too.  That was even more tricky to slip into!  I can't believe I tore it off of you so quickly in our hotel room after our wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren recalled their wedding night.  She got a fun idea and snickered, \"Once I have your dick, I'm totally wearing your wedding tuxedo.  We never got any good pictures of us that day.  We could easily recreate the moment.  Since you already agreed to becoming a younger version of me, I trust you won't mind becoming me when I was 20.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad liked the idea of becoming his wife on their wedding night, \"Hey! I didn't agree to anything about becoming a little girl.  However, I'd love to test out your 20 year old version.  That was right after you got your boob job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren asked, \"So you <i>have</i> been in public inside my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of.  I only answered the door for a few seconds to send off your wedding dress to the dry cleaners.\"  Brad replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured you wouldn't have the balls to go venture outside in my body.\"  Karen smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad grabbed his crotch joking, \"With your body I don't have ANY balls.\"  Brad rubbed the outside of his wife's borrowed panties and outlined his vagina.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren got turned on seeing her husband enjoying her womanly parts, \"You know what?  We have a unique opportunity here.  I could really teach you some things about my body.  It's been since college since I experimented with another woman.  But given we are twins, a lesson in my anatomy would be much easier to teach you while we are the same person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad waved his finger motioning into the bedroom.  He was hoping for some girl-on-girl action someday with the transformation booth.  He had no idea it would happen so soon.  He gave a sexy smile, \"Come on Karen.  Let's experiment.\"  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s5.pics.vc/pics/n/0e5/3ff/768/7ec/0e53ff7687ec30a99e330aee954dccc3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s5.pics.vc/pics/n/0e5/3ff/768/7ec...</a>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled, \"Okay...Karen.

After a brief clanking of the machinery, the booth opened to reveal a confused looking Brad, still in his human body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel any different.\u201d, he said as he examined his body in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because I hit the delay button. Okay, now its your turn to design my body, we\u2019ll have a bit of time before you change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad quickly went to the control panel and entered in his wife\u2019s changes. As Karen tried to look over his shoulder, he blocked her view. \u201cNo peeking!\u201d, he said sternly. Go ahead and hop in. Your new body awaits!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren cautiously entered the booth, not so sure about it now that she was the victim. She entered and was startled by the sound of the door slamming shut. Moments later, she walked out of the machine, feeling a much heavier weight on her chest and hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWowies! I look like a freakin\u2019 porn star!\u201d, said Karen as the squeaky voice caught her off guard as she covered her mouth. \u201cYou could have anyone and you chose some bleach blonde bimbo porn star. Nobody will take me seriously in this body!\u201d, she said as she held up her massive breasts to examine them and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad lowered his pants showing his huge erection, causing Karen to gasp. She immediately dropped to her knees and smiled, and began stroking and licking his rather large appendage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to try out some of those mental modifications that you mentioned.\u201d, said Brad. \u201cDon\u2019t worry though, I set the mental modifications for just two hours. Hopefully we have enough time before my transformation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup!\u201d, was all that Karen said before sucking on her husband\u2019s dick like her life depended on it. It wasn\u2019t long before Brad finished and his porn star wife managed to swallow every last drop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYummy!\u201d, said Karen as she cuddled up to Brad on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what am I going to turn into?\u201d, asked Brad as he reclined peacefully on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah. You\u2019re going to be a cow. A female cow.\u201d, said Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA what!? I thought you said Cow. The female type?\u201d, asked Brad with a concerned look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah silly. I think all cow\u2019s are female. Male cows are bulls. I wanted to try an animal with a lot more... bigger. I also wanted to try milking a cow who will stand still. The others don\u2019t help very much and I want to get gooder. I thought you could help me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad sighed. \u201cHow long before I turn?\u201d, he asked as he ran his hands along his wife\u2019s curvy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s already started silly! You have cow ears! It won\u2019t be long now.\u201d, said Karen as she played with her husbands large furry ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad jumped off of the bed and ran for the door. He didn\u2019t think a full size cow would have much luck navigating down the steps to get outside. By the time he reached the bottom of the stairs, he was covered in fur. He  continued to run out the door, toward the pasture. With great difficulty, he managed to open and close the gate before he fell to all fours. A few minutes later, his body was completely indistinguishable from the other cows.</span></div></div>",

Walking on all fours was tricky, but his new vision was the most difficult change to adjust to. His full udder swayed as he continued walking Along the field.. His New, massive, bovine body seemed to move a lot slower than he expected. It was almost time for milking, and his udder was heavy with milk, but he wanted to check on Karen from the edge of the field. Moments earlier, he was a middle aged man. He thought how crazy it was that he was a common dairy cow. Capable of producing lots of milk and baby cows. That last thought had him looking over his shoulder for Max. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Max is in the other field by himself. There was no danger of becoming his next mate as long as he stayed out. \u201cI have no desire to be his next conquest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn\u2019t seen Karen around, but wasn\u2019t surprised. It would be a few more hours until the mental modifications would wear off. His short little romp with his wife and her new porn star body had totally been worth losing his humanity for a day or two. \u201cI could be this way for a couple of days due to the size difference and radical species change. In his haste to modify Karen\u2019s body, he hadn\u2019t got a good look at the booth\u2019s terminal. He guessed that he could be stuck like this for Two or three days. \u201cI bet Karen won\u2019t be able to tell me apart from the rest of the herd. It\u2019s a good opportunity to play a prank on her. I\u2019m going to MILK this opportunity for all it\u2019s worth.\u201d, thought Brad as he mentally chuckled at his last thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad approached the edge of the fence and noticed some activity at the house. Karen, dressed rather provocatively, was flirting with one of the farm hands named Geoff. \u201cOh crap!\u201d, thought Brad. \u201cHer bimbo mind is still going to be in control for the next hour or so. I hope she doesn\u2019t...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new cow\u2019s eyes widened as Karen ran her hands along Geoff\u2019s crotch and lured him inside the house where they could engage in more private activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad slowly walked away and mingled with the rest of the cows that were now heading to the barn to be milked and fed. His wife was most likely having sex with Geoff and he was at least partly, imostly, if not entirely to blame.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He also felt annoyed because that should have been him enjoying a bedroom romp.  But there was nothing Brad could do about it now.  He was stuck in the barn chewing on hay, which was oddly really satisfying to chew on.  Brad managed to zone out while eating until he noticed Geoff was back in the barn a few hours later getting back to work with a bad case of bed head and what looked like a handprint across his smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Oof, I'll bet when the bimbo effect ended she wasn't happy.'</i>. Brad thought, but then remembered that a slap might be getting off easy.  Brad shivered a little bit as he thought, <i>'Ok, maybe sex starved bimbo wasn't a great choice for a first surprise transformation.'</i> A few hours later the farmhands left for the day and Karen went out to the barn.  Brad saw that Karen was back in her normal body, well mostly normal, she seemed a lot more muscular than before.  She seemed to be taking a moment to look each cow in the eyes probably trying to figure out which one was you.  Trying to stay calm Brad just chewed his straw, dropped a cow patty at his hooves, and tried to look like the other cows.  He'd try to communicate with Karen later, he just figured now wasn't the best time with Karen at probably her most mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Karen just looked at the cows and didn't even say anything to them.  Although with her new muscles she did impressively pick up a bail of hay with one arm and spread it out to all the cows before leaving.  <i>'She'll have cooled off by tomorrow and hopefully the timer will let me turn back to normal.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the next day would come and go without so much of a second look from Karen outside of doing standard things she did for all the other cows.  <i>'My timer must not be done yet.'</i> Brad reassured himself.  But then the next day came and then the next without Karen even acknowledging him once.  And Brad was starting to go a little stir crazy.  He could only eat so much hay and grass while making himself paranoid with wondering what Karen was planing.  It didn't help that his udders were actually starting to ache since he hadn't even been milked yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after a full week of a cow's life, Karen came into the barn and made a little announcement to all bovine present.</span></div></div>",

Karen had a hard to read look on her face as she approached the first cow and set herself up and gave a tug at one of the cows teat.  Brad watched as the white liquid shot out of the cow's udder and Brad thought that it might be awkward but it would sure be a relief.  Brad's own udders were feeling quite full and were feeling really uncomfortable.  Karen finished up with the first cow and moved on to the next.  And the next.  And the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad kicked at the straw at his feet in anticipation, as Karen was getting closer and closer he felt like his udders were about to burst.  He was breathing heavily making the dust in the area spread out all over.  Finally, after much anticipation Karen came up to Brad.  Looked him in the eyes, and without saying anything got down and grasped Brad's teat and pulled.  Brad wanted to complain that Karen was being too rough with him, but after a few tugs the flood gates opened and the milk began to pour.  Brad breathed a sigh of relief, he had no idea how satisfying this would feel.  His tail was whipping back and forth wildly as the satisfationed spread through his body.  After a few tugs though, Karen stopped.  Brad let out a soft moo, he really felt like he wasn't done yet but Karen finally said her first words in a week as she said, \"Was it good for you too Brad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad's eyes went wide, <i>'How'd she know it was me?'</i>. Karen moved in front of Brad with a satisfied smile and held up a glass of pink liquid.  \"When I put you in the Booth I made sure that you would give out strawberry milk, it's why I haven't let the farmhands milk any of you or your new friends for the last week.  Couldn't risk them finding out about you.  Besides, I needed some time to cool off after you messed with my head.  Although it was a pretty hot body you gave me I must admit.\"  You breathed a sigh of relief that Karen didn't seem that mad.  Maybe a little annoyed, but not mad.  \"Come on, get in the outdoor part of the booth, I've got a surprise for you.\"  You followed your wife to the specialized secant of the booth for large creatures and waited as Karen entered some settings that you couldn't read.

His massive breasts pushed up against hers as he let out a very soft moan. He moved in for a kiss but was blocked by Karen\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast. Cindi. I need to make a few adjustments as well.\u201d, said Karen as she moved toward the terminal to select her new form. Moments later, a tall, sexy red head stepped out of the booth. Although she had some large curves, they were much more believable than her husband\u2019s current form. She also towered over Brad with her new height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad\u2019s smile broadened as he approached Karen. He was denied once again when she placed a hand on her husband\u2019s expanded chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going clubbing tonight. You\u2019re going to love it!

We can do whatever you want. I don\u2019t think I have the equipment to satisfy your needs though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad checked his thoughts and nothing appeared out of place. He still found Karen sexy and didn\u2019t really feel any attraction to men.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCare to help me get dressed?\u201d, asked Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a bimbo, Cindi.\u201d, said Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad felt a euphoric tingle run through his entire body in reaction to Karen\u2019s last words.

A few minutes later, he found Karen sitting at the bar, fending off some sleazy guy\u2019s advances. \u201cThere you are!\u201d, chirped Brad. \u201cCome with me, there\u2019s someone I want you to meet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad dragged Karen quickly towards the entrance, causing one of his breasts to pop out. His face turned crimson as he quickly tucked it back into place. Two men across the room were grinning ear to ear, having witnessed the incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Karen! I learned my lesson. Can we PLEASE go home now? I almost left with that douche to let him fuck my brains out, even when I got my mind back. I\u2019m just too fucking horny to keep myself under control!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really? Okay, okay... let\u2019s go home. Maybe I can do something to quench that libido of your.\u201d, said Karen with a suggestive look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brad opened his eyes and stretched his legs. He looked down to see a large muscular arm wrapped around his chest. He wiggled a little bit and heard a very contented moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Babe! You were on fire last night!\u201d, said a familiar male voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of last night flooded Brad\u2019s mind. He remembered Karen transforming into the guy at the club that was hitting on him. He also remembered saying his trigger phase willingly, several times. Memories surfaced of him screaming and riding a man\u2019s cock while he tried, unsuccessfully, to keep his enormous tits from bouncing around. They had even slapped him in the face a few times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Uh, yeah. I guess we\u2019re even then, huh?\u201d, asked Brad in a quiet voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know where you learned to suck a cock, but you are quite gifted when it comes to that.\u201d, said Karen as she played with his nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad swatted Karen\u2019s manly hand away and sat up on the bed. He remembered a lot of things from last night, most of which were quite embarrassing but not out of character for some sex starved bimbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe alcohol really messes with my head. I\u2019m a lightweight in this tiny body.\u201d, responded Brad as his face turned beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren grabbed a hold of a breast with one hand and an ass cheek with the other. \u201cTiny wouldn\u2019t be the word I use to describe you.\u201d, chuckled Karen. \u201cWhen you used the trigger word on yourself, I couldn\u2019t believe it. But after you begged me to turn into this guy, we\u2019ll I have to say I enjoyed it quite a bit! You were just so damn enthusiastic!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad picked up an enormous bra and struggled to put it on. \u201cOkay, okay... You had your fun. Let\u2019s go back to the booth. I want to change back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaren out on a robe and walked over to Brad. \u201cHow about one more quicky before we change you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad, trying to keep his dignity, tied a robe around his porn star body and headed toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren was the first one to step out of the booth. She looked down at her familiar body and sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to do that again some time. Now, get your gorgeous ass in the booth so we can take care of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad quickly entered the booth and waited for the familiar sound of the machine. Moments later, he stepped out of the machine and gasped when he looked down. His giant breasts were still there. He looked in the mirror and opened his robe to confirm that he was still in the same bimbo body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t change me!\u201d, exclaimed Brad as he stomped a foot, causing his oversized breasts to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I certainly did. I just set it to delay. \u201cYou seemed to enjoy yourself a little too much last night. I wanted to give you a chance to make it up to me. I hope you are as enthusiastic about your new body.\u201d, said Karen with a taunting smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, so what\u2019s it going to be?\u201d, asked Brad in a worried tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say that you\u2019d better move your sweet little ass outdoors before it starts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad ran outside quite hastily and prepared for the worst. He knew that it was at least too early for any of the farm hands to be here. The sun was just beginning to rise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad felt his robe rip as he quickly gained mass. His hands fell to the ground as they quickly transformed into hooves. He gasped as he felt his breasts slide down past his stomach. He looked over to Karen to ask her what was happening, but all that came out of his now thick lips was a \u201cMoooooooooo?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a damn cow again.\u201d, through Brad as he took an exploratory step and felt his udder away. \u201cA big fucking cow who needs to be milked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren out a harness on him and led him to the milking area. \u201cDamn! You\u2019re going to be quite the producer this week! That udder is probably ready to burst!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad gave Karen his best glare as he let her lead him to be milked. Although he wouldn\u2019t admit this to Karen, being stuck as a cow, for a few days, wouldn\u2019t be all that bad. Getting milked was quite pleasurable and it was probably going to be a long process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they arrived at the barn, Karen attached the pumps and closed her new prize cow in the stall. \u201cEnjoy!\u201d, said Karen as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later Julie opened the door and led him out of the stall. \u201cHey there! You must be April! You\u2019re a cutie!\u201d, she said as she ruffled the hair on Brad\u2019s large head. Let\u2019s get you back to the pasture. There\u2019s some fresh grain in the feeder for ya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad lumbering body walked toward the pasture and through the gate. He wandered over to the feeder as Julie closed the door. \u201cI bet you and Max will get along great! You go have fun girl. I\u2019ll hear all about your budding romance later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad raised his head and looked at his surroundings. He wasn\u2019t in the larger field. Julie has placed him in the other pastures with all the other cows to be bred with Max. </span></div></div>",

He only had glimpses of Karen though out the day as she saw to her duties on the farm. Brad was beginning to get hungry and he noticed some fresh hay in the trough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was had his head in the trough when he felt a sudden, heavy weight on his back. Max had finally found his mark when Brad\u2019s defenses were down. A confused moo escaped Brad\u2019s thick cow lips as he felt Max\u2019s penis slip inside him. He tried to escape, but it was useless. Max was way stronger than him and had already managed to penetrate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassment turned to curiosity as he gave into his situation. The experience was unwanted, but not unpleasant. He was indeed beginning to enjoy it as he Found himself pushing into Max\u2019s thrusts, forcing him deeper into his cunt. He heard himself moaning as Max\u2019s tempo increased. Then all of a sudden... his body convulsed slightly as he felt a tingle run through his own body. Every nerve in his body caused a euphoric wave to crash over him. It only dawned on him afterwards that the crazed cow sounds he heard were coming from his own lips. The orgasm faded slightly before another one hit him. Not as strong as the first, but it still felt heavenly. He was basking in the afterglow when Max unceremoniously pulled out of him with a \u201cplop\u201d and walked away, searching for his next conquest. It was only then when he saw Karen looking at him, with a surprised look on her face, mouth agape. She walked closer to Brad, examining his features in the fading light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrad? That is you!\u201d, said Karen laughing uncontrollably. \u201cI thought Max would just paw at you a few times, but I never thought... you know. You look like you REALLY enjoyed that! Max was in so deep his balls were slapping on your backside! You didn\u2019t even make it a day. This should be a very interesting week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeek!? A whole fucking week!?\u201d, he tried to say but only managed to make mooing sounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe a little longer a week. You may be stuck as April for a BIT longer than that. Oh yeah, and I kind of told your niece that she could maybe show you at the state fair. You\u2019re quite a magnificent cow, and I think you\u2019re a contender to take home the blue ribbon! I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s going to take me up on the offer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad hung his head and wandered back out into the pasture. \u201cMaybe Max has enough stamina for another go.\u201d</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This interactive story is relatively new, so I\u2019m working out some of the issues with it now. Rules and storylines may be slightly tweaked. I feel it\u2019s a pretty solid foundation, so I think I\u2019ll stop tinkering with it for now, other than adding more storyline options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad and Karen are a happily married couple in their 40\u2019s. They are both in great health and are semi-retired due to a large monetary inheritance, from his Uncle, that came with the farm. The farm is home to all kinds of animals, and they have a small staff to help them keep things running smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad - Brad is the nephew of Jack Watson, a talented amateur inventor whose early inventions brought him fame and fortune. Brad is the only Heir and acquired the whole estate after his uncle\u2019s death. He is in relatively good shape, although he could stand to lose about 40 pounds and get rid of his beer gut. He shares his uncle\u2019s curiosity as well as his desire to invent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren - Karen is Brad\u2019s wife of 20 years. She is a very attractive woman with lots of curves and wavy red hair. She isn\u2019t as slim as she used to be, but the weight has gone to the right places. She is always looking for her next adventure and is excited about running a farm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda - Karen\u2019s older sister. She is in excellent shape for her age and quite beautiful. She is very close to her sister and would do anything for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie - One of the farm hands who helps take care of the animals. Julie is in her early 20\u2019s and works at the farm to help pay for college. She has worked at the farm since graduating high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTransformation Booth Rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The Booth can transform anyone into anything, as long as it isn't magic or super hero type powers.<br>\r\n__<br>\r\n2. Inanimate objects can have access to all or specific senses. Harming an inanimate object will have no effect on a successful transformation to the user\u2019s original form. As long as a small piece of the object still exists, it can easily be returned to the user\u2019s normal body. Any pieces that are not in the booth disappear from existence once the user is restored. There is an option to create a user \"token\" that contains the user's body data. This token can be used to bring the user back to their original body without having their transformed one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. The Booth has a timer feature to delay the actual transformation to happen at a specific time once you are outside the Booth. This allows the user to be in a more convenient area for the transformation to happen. Also, while the electronics and equipment are all located inside a building, there is a platform outside the room that can be used to transform or scan larger objects. If the user transformed into an Elephant, they would need to use the outdoor area to change back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. The interface for the Booth consist of a small LCD screen, a small keyboard, and a large scanning area. If the user prefers, they may scan a living being or inanimate object and store it as a preset. The terminal also has access to the internet if the user would like to find images for their desired transformation. There is an option to have the terminal to track the user's whereabouts and even transmit their vision and hearing (if that option has been implemented). These options have to be enabled so the user has privacy if they want it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. The device will not transform an inanimate object into a living one unless the object was a person that used the device. When any transformed object or living being is placed in the scanner, the machine will display their base stats on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. The machine has a duration setting. This is used to make sure that the transformed body or object can stabilize its new form before altering it again. If the user overrides this feature, it can act in very unexpected ways. For example, the person may revert successfully, only to return to their transformed object or being at a random time in the future. The machine will configure the time automatically, based on the transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. It is possible that Brad\u2019s Uncle is still alive, or has been transformed by the machine. The details of his accident were a little sketchy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reserve the right to modify or delete any additions that I see fit. I will periodically add new characters to the above descriptions, or some may evolve out of future additions added by you. Please use good grammar and check your spelling on any additions. I\u2019m also certain that new device rules will evolve over time, out of necessity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
