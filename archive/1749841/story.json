You do not need to be able to see where your going, you just need to imagine the place where you need to go. If you have never been to a place before, and you think about it, an image of the place comes into your head, so you can teleport there, this also helps as it is a current image, so you can see guards, weapons and anything that might be there. Your story starts as you are walking home from school. You see that your way is blocked up ahead by a boy in a blue costume. \"Are you Nathan?\" said the boy. You nodded. \"Pietro Maximoff\" he said, holding out his hand \"We would like you to come and join our group, we believe your teleporting abilities will be a considerable asset\" You took his hand and shook it. \"What is your group called?\" </span></div></div>",

You ran over to the truck and quickly tried the door. It was locked. You quickly remembered your forcefield. You made a small one expand inside the lock. The lock broke. You opened the door. You realised why the girl hadn't moved. There was a small fire in front of her. You quickly created a forcefield around the fire. \"Come on\" you say to the girl. \"I'm stuck\" she said. You noticed that her seatbelt was trapping her. You expanded a forcefield inside her seatbelt and broke it open. \"Come on\" you say, offering her your hand. She took it. It was then that you realised that she was wearing leather gloves. It was to be expected since it was the middle of winter.

Bobby was right behind you to provide cover. The rest of them fanned out behind them. You put up your hand, signalling them to stop. You moved forward. Suddenly, several identical men attacked from all sides. You used Johnny's power to take several of them out. Looking around, you watched your companions take out the rest of the men and one of them fell to the ground and didn't vanish. \"Looks like we defeated him\" you say \"Who was it?\" \"Multiple man\" said Xavier \"I saw him on Cerebro before we left\" \"Lets keep going\" you say \"If Multiple Man is here, we need to be on our guard, Magneto already knows we're here, be on your guard\" You flew into the air to look for Magneto. You saw him in a clearing ahead. He was surrounded by several people including two of the people you had fought before on Liberty Island. Also there was a woman in red and a guy in a blue costume. There was a large man in a brown suit and a very fat, large man. There was also a man in a green cloak and a strange, silver face. After going down, you told the X Men and the Fantastic Four what you had seen. The X Men knew most of the villians Magneto had gathered. They didn't know the green cloaked one. The Fantastic Four did, however. \"It's Doctor Doom\" said Reed \"He's our oldest enemy, he can shoot lightning, we barely defeated him last time\" \"Well, you have help this time\" came a new voice. Everyone looked around to see a guy in yellow and red armour. Behind him was a guy in American colours, a guy in a red costume and a silver helmet, a girl in yellow with wings, a guy in black, a guy dressed as Thor and a guy in pink, carrying a bow.  \"Iron Man\" he introduced himself \"Myself and the Avengers are here to take them down, two of our number, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch are already in the enemy camp\" \"Which ones are they?\" you asked. \"The one in the blue and the one in the red\" said the guy in American wear \"Captain America\" he said.

You saw Reed Richards, on his own dance floor, throwing his arms all over the place. You saw Bobby freezing the air over the glasses, causing ice to rain down into the cups. You watched Tony Stark throwing bottles into the air and shooting them. As one arcs towards you, you put a forcefield around the bottle. The blast is deflected into the ground and you catch the bottle. As you are about to drink it, the bottle flies out of your hand and into Jeans, across the other side of the room. \"Your too young to drink, Nathan\" said Jean, placing the bottle on the table. Several of the assembled heroes chuckled at this. You shrugged and went to grab some food from the food table. \"You are truly a force to be reckoned with, young Nathan\" said a voice from behind you. You looked around. A man with a red cloak and a hammer at his belt was standing behind you. \"Your Thor, right?\" you say \"Your one of the Avengers heavy hitters\" \"Correct\" said Thor \"I have heard that you will be temporarily joining the Avengers\" \"You've heard right\" you say \"The X Men are feared and hated, just a few months separate from the X Men has shown me that, while separate from the X Men, people don't see me as a mutant, but as a hero\" \"You have a good heart, Nathan\" said Thor \"The Avengers will be lucky to have you, if we're not disbanded by SHIELD, that is, Maria Hill has been trying to get us working for SHIELD for years\" You turned to watch as Wolverine, unable to open a bottle of beer, slashes it off with one of his claws. Both you and Thor laughed. \"Some people just have no patience\" you say. \"You think he's impatient?\" asked Thor \"Try getting the Hulk on a bad day\" You tried to think of a retort to this, then realised Thor was probably right. \"Good point\" you say. You then went back to mingling with the other heroes. Looking over to where The Human Torch and Hawkeye were arguing. It looked like they were about to fight. Although you were curious about how that fight might turn out, you decided that a party was the wrong place to do it. You quickly stepped between them and put a separate forcefield around each of them. \"Enough, guys\" you say \"You can tear each other apart in the dojo later, but for now, drop it\" Hawkeye lowered his fists and so did The Human Torch. You lowered the forcefields. You glared at both of them. They turned their backs on each other and went off in opposite directions. \"It's normally me who has to be peacekeeper\" said Sue. \"It helps that my forcefields negate their powers\" you say, shrugging \"Also, check this out\" You hold out your right hand and a fireball appears in it. \"You got Johnny's powers?\" said Sue. \"It's temporary, twenty four hours, at a rough estimate for how long I kept the forcefield up\" you explain</span></div></div>",

As you sat down, you became aware that the room, which had been noisy a minute ago, had gone deathly quiet. The next thing you noticed that everyone was looking at you. They had a strange fear in their eyes. For a few moments, you sat there, feeling a bit uncomfortable at being stared at. \"Wanna play table football\" you asked X 23. \"Yeah sure\" she said, following you over to the table. Everyone in the room was still staring at the pair of you, warily. You wondered if it was because of your father. You heard the door to the games room open and the red headed girl that you saw earlier came in. She came over to the two of you. \"Hey, Nathan right?\" she said. \"Yes\" you say \"I never actually asked you your name, X 23\" \"Laura\" she said. \"I'm Jean\" said the red head \"How are you liking the school?\" You paused to spin one of the handles, sending the ball into Laura's goal. \"It's great\" you say \"Really interesting, learning about mutants, how long have you been here?\" \"About three years\" said Jean, looking at everyone else in the room, curiously. \"You wanna go outside, we're trying to get some people together to have a game of basketball\" \"You up for it Laura?\" you say. \"Yeah\" she said. You and Laura followed Jean out of the room, leaving the hundreds of eyes still staring at you behind. \"Sorry about the others\" said Jean \"Most of them have lived in fear of Magneto and his brotherhood for some time now, and now you come in with the same powers... They think your the same as him\" \"How did you know that\" X 23 asked. \"I'm telepathic\" said Jean \"Are you O.K?\" \"I thought that since many of them have been judged because of their mutant powers, they wouldn't judge others in the same way\" you said, sadly. \"It's alright, me and my friends won't judge you for your powers\" said Jean \"In fact, we're playing mutant basketball, where we use our powers to play\" You had reached the basketball court. On the court was a tall boy with red shades, a small, blue elf like thing and a girl with a ponytail. \"Scot Summers\" said the boy in the shades, shaking your hand. \"Kurt Wagner\" said the blue elf, shaking your hand as well. It was only when you looked down to shake his hand, that you noticed that he only had two fingers and a thumb. \"Kitty Pryde\" said the girl with the ponytail, also shaking your hand. \"So, what's the teams?\" you asked them. \"You two get Kurt\" said Scot \"Me, Jean and Kitty are on the other team\" The blue elf walked over to you. \"What can you do?\" you asked Kurt. \"I can teleport\" he said. \"Right, lets win this thing\" you said.</span></div></div>",

The ball changed course and she caught it. Now, she was on the attack. She shot. Kurt teleported to catch it. The ball seemed to go around him and through the hoop. There was five minutes left. You passed the ball out to X 23 and she shot from a point that she would never score from. As the ball fell short of the hoop, Kurt appeared in the air and caught it. He shot. And scored. Your team had won. \"Your pretty good\" said Scot, panting \"I didn't quite catch what your power was\" \"I can control metal\" you say \"Laura has an adamantium skeleton, that's what I was controlling to make her fly and score goals\" \"Have you ever heard of a mutant called Magneto\" said Scot. You nodded \"He's my father\" you say \"Unfortunately, most of the mutants here judged me by my fathers actions, they don't even want to know me\" \"Well, I think you're a great guy, Nathan\" said Scot \"You stick with us, the rest'll come round eventually\"  </span></div></div>",

They all shook their heads. \"Lets go help him then\" you said, climbing out of the window. As you climbed out, something buried itself in the wall next to you. It was a ninja star. \"Jean, can you tell how many of these ninja's there are\" you asked Jean, who had climbed through the window behind you. \"At least seven\" said Jean. Looking around, you saw that all of your friends had come out of the building behind you. \"O.K, stay close to me and get ready too take them down\" you say, as the stars started flying at you. They all stopped in the air. Then, the stars went back in the direction they came. You heard cries from all directions, then several lasers came from Scot's direction. Then, Kurt vanished and you heard another cry as he kicked one of the ninjas. You heard a slash, and then silence. Kurt and Laura walked over to them. You heard a groan over to the left. You ran over to find Logan lying unconscious on the ground. As you got to him, he stirred and sat up. \"What happened?\" he said. \"You were attacked by some sort of ninjas\" you said, showing him one of the ninja stars. He examined it. \"I know these stars\" he said \"These stars are from the ninjas that work for the Silver Samurai\" \"Silver Samurai?\" you asked, looking around at everyone.

Several of the other mutants nodded and a few of them prepared themselves for a fight. \"I guess I have no choice\" said Magneto. He then flew into the air, using his armour to lift himself.

Laura, Rogue, Nightcrawler and the other mutants dropped to the ground and attacked. You used your powers to catapult Laura towards Magneto. You also put a magnetic field round her to stop Magneto from doing the same. She sunk her claws into his leg and that made him lose concentration and fall.

The blast that should have been coming out of the robot just built up until the robot's head exploded. \"Laura\" you say. \"Nathan\" she said, relieved and ran over to you. As she neared you, a large fissure opened in the ground and she fell in. You concentrated on the metal inside her body, lifting her up onto the same side of the fissure you were on. \"What are you doing here?\" she asked. \"This is just a memory\" you explained \"You were trapped in a coma on Genosha, me and my sister rescued you\" \"Then, what are you doing inside my mind?\" she asked. \"I came to try and break you out of this coma\" you say \"We need to find Magneto's source and destroy it\" You quickly contacted the Professor.<i> \"I found her\"</i> \"<i>Very good, Nathan, I think I may have found the source</i>\" and a picture of a map appeared in your head. \"This way\" you say, taking X 23 by the hand and leading her out one of the doors and up a few corridors. Until they had to stop. In front of them, were several of the same robots that had attacked you before. \"You want to take this one, or shall I?\" you asked X 23</span></div></div>",

The effort it took to do this drove you to your knees. \"I can't do that again\" you say \"It'll kill me\" \"Here\" said Laura, putting her arm around you. You put one arm around her and she helps you up. \"This way\" you say, heading off down the corridor where you had just destroyed the robots. In front of you, was a door. According to Xavier's map, this would lead to the source of Laura's coma. You pushed the door open. Inside, was a box behind a shimmering cylinder. You tried to touch the cylinder, but it threw you back to the wall. Laura touched it and her hand went right through it. She walked through the cylinder and opened the box. Out of the box, came a multitude of unpleasant memories for X 23. Her time in the Hydra research base, her treatment by some kids when she got out. She collapsed on the ground when she saw a woman being stabbed by her claws, tears running down her face. \"Laura, you can't let your fears control you, neither your past\" you say \"Remember who you are, your not that person anymore, your one of the X Men, we're your family now\" Laura looked at you, her eyes now determined. She turned back to the source, brought out her claws and chopped it up into little pieces. The forcefield vanished, followed a few minutes later by both you and Laura.</span></div></div>",

Kurt reappeared with the rest of your team. \"Laser, can you distract the men in there\" you asked. Laser nodded and his arms turned red. Two long lasers appeared in his hand and he threw them at one of the men. as it hit, it also went around him and spread to two others. You ran for the girl as Kurt vanished and attacked more of the men. You quickly went over to the ball and opened it. The girl inside, who had been suspended in mid air, dropped to the ground. You caught her before she hit and lifted her gently out. Laser ran over to you and defended you as the men started shooting at you. \"Nathan to Scot, we rescued the captive mutant being forced to control the Sentinels, where should we go for extraction?\" you asked. There was a few seconds of silence before Scot replied. \"That's a negative on extraction, we're pinned down here, some U-Men with technopathic powers are controlling the Sentinels to attack us\" said Scot. \"U Men?\" you asked. \"No time to explain just now, you need to get here\" said Cyclops. You shouted to your companions. \"We'll need to find our own way out, Kurt, can you port?\" In answer, Kurt teleported next to you and teleported all of you out of the building.

You went inside the jet and checked the controls. They seemed pretty basic. One said 'open hangar door' You pressed it and the door above you opened.

As she picked it up, it beeped. \"We're recieving a message\" said Rogue. \"Put it through\" you say. Magma pressed a button and two familiar voices sounded. \"Come in X Jet 456\" it was Jean and Storm. \"X Jet 456, recieving\" you replied. \"Nathan?\" asked Storm \"Why are you flying the jet?\" \"A man called William Stryker attacked the mansion, I got some of the students to safety\" you say \"Where are you, i'd prefer not to talk through the communicator\" As you spoke, an area of the sky started to rain.

You and your companions followed quickly behind. \"Gambit, can you take out the guards?\" you asked. Gambit took out several cards and, after charging them, threw them towards the guards. They exploded, causing the guards to dive to the side. The Professor took no notice, but kept moving towards the door. It opened revealing a strange room. It looked suspiciously like Cerebro. \"Network, what's that machine the Professor is inside?\" you asked. \"It's exactly the same as Cerebro\" said Network \"Stryker must be going to use it to kill all mutants\" As she said it, she collapsed to the floor, clutching her head in pain. The rest of your team were similarly compromised. You quickly activated your powers. The pain seemed to go away for your teammates. \"What just happened?\" asked Sarah. \"I fear, exactly what you thought was going to happen\" you say \"Cerebro is targetting all mutants, my powers took away your powers, making you human, we need to get to the Professor before we become the last mutants alive\" You and your friends ran towards the doors to Cerebro. You pressed a button on the side and ran inside. You extended your influence over the boy in the wheelchair. It was then that the Professor seemed to realise what he was doing. He turned, the illusion gone, then used a telepathic command to put the boy in the wheelchair to sleep. \"We need to get out of here, Professor\" you say. He nodded and his wheelchair moved towards you. You and your companions took up defensive positions around the Professor and you removed your power block on your companions.</span></div></div>",

Every item of furniture in the room was missing at least one leg, the windows were covered in a substance that looked like human saliva. In fact, you were surprised, when you looked down, to find that the ropes binding you weren't falling apart at your slightest movement. Not for the first time, you wished you had an offensive mutant power, one that ight allow you to escape this predicament. Somewhere behind you, you heard a door open and soft footsteps walking around you. Looking up from where you were tied up on the floor, you saw a brown haired girl wearing red. You tried to speak, it was only then that you realised you were gagged. Realising this, the girl shot a small glowing ball at the gag. It untied itself and fell to the ground. \"Who\" your voice cracked from misuse. You cleared your throat, before you could continue, the girl answered. \"My name is Wanda, I imagine you have many questions, I will try to answer them as best I can\" \"Did my companions escape Alkali Lake?\" you asked, a little anxiously. \"I don't know\" said Wanda \"The Brotherhood all got out safely, but I don't know who else made it out\" Still worried about your friends, you asked. \"Why was I kidnapped?\" Wanda frowned. \"I was told your power turned mutants human, Magneto wanted to suppress your powers until he had turned Stryker's Cerebro on the humans, killing them all\" \"You don't believe that\" you said. \"If that's all he wanted with you, why are you still here, his attempt to kill all the huumans on Earth failed, your friends stopped it, you shouldn't still be held prisoner\" \"It seems as if you are doubting your father\" you say \"Have you ever had these doubts before\" Before she could answer, the door behind you opened and you heard a familiar voice. \"Get out of here, Wanda, Magneto wants to speak to the prisoner\" It was Pyro. Wanda shot a look at, who you thought to be Pyro, a look that would have made Iceman melt into a puddle on the ground. Then she stomped out. Another man- not Pyro- came round. He was quite old and was wearing a red helmet and a cape. You snickered. \"A cape, seriously?\" The man looked annoyed. He shot his hand out at a metal object across the room. You did nothing. He shot it between your legs. \"The only reason you are still alive is that my daughter seemed to like you, as far as we're concerned, since your mutation can't be detected, your as good as human\" said Magneto, a tone of anger in his voice. His statement surprised you. \"Wanda likes me?\" you asked, unsure if you'd heard right. \"We're all as surprised as you are\" said another voice, as a truly revolting sight hopped into your view \"Wanda was only really ever interested in me\" \"Oh yeah, i'll believe that\" you say, sarcastically. You heard a deep voice snicker behind you. \"Shut up, Blob\" shouted the revolting sight, then jumped out of sight again. \"Sorry about that\" said Magneto \"Toad has never had a chance with Wanda really\" \"So, again, why am I here?\" you asked.   </span></div></div>",

You quickly concentrated on your task of sawing through the ropes binding you, after a few hours of this, the door opened again. You recognised the sound of Wanda's boots as she walked around to face you. \"I met your little stalker\" you said. \"Toad?\" said Wanda, wrinkling her nose \"If I had a quarter for every time he's tried to make a move on me, my room would be full to the brim with quarters\" \"Magneto came by to see me, we had a bit of a chat\" you say. \"What did he say?\" asked Wanda. \"He asked me to join the Brotherhood\" you say \"I told him i'd consider it, i'm going to decline\" \"Why don't you want to join us?\" asked Wanda \"You could be so much more with us\" \"Do you have friends here, Wanda?\" you asked.

It was then that you realised your mistake. You had attacked the Brotherhood's leader in front of most of the Brotherhood. You ran out of the room and just kept running. You met Wanda on the way and she joined  you. \"Which way?\" you ask. Wanda took the lead, leading you down a flight of stairs and out of the house. You both just kept running until you reached the road and you were surprised to find Scot Summers in his car. \"Nathan?\" he asked \"Scarlet Witch?\" \"No time to explain, you have to give us a lift back to the mansion\" you say.

Xavier smiled as it got to the end. \"And what would you like to do now, Wanda?\" said the Professor \"Would you like to stay here and be my student?\" \"I came here because I believe my father had a mental block put on me, I wish it removed, I also have a crush on Nathan -she turned red at this- could you do this for me\" asked Wanda.

You seemed to be both in Wanda's mind and out of it simultaneously. You watched as a memory version of Wanda was subjected to experimentation. In the real world, Wanda's powers started acting up, causing things in the room to snake towards Xavier. \"Wanda\" you said, feeling her pain \"It's allright, i'm here, nothing you see here can hurt you\" Wanda's mind and the room you had been treating her in calmed down. \"Don't let go\" said Wanda \"I don't want to feel alone\" Then, as you and Xavier got rid of the last of the walls around her mind, both you and Wanda woke up. \"Nothing in your memories can hurt you\" you say, as Wanda looks at you \"Your safe\" \"Thank you for staying with me, Nathan\" said Wanda \"I was afraid i'd have to face my memories alone\" \"You won't be alone anymore\" you say \"I can promise you that\" You got up, gave her a hug, which she returned, then said to her \"You should rest now, your in good hands\" \"I know\" said Wanda, weakly.

It was Jean that spoke first. \"We can't send her back to the Brotherhood, her life would be hell there\" \"Can we trust her if she stays here, though?\" asked Scot \"She's a loose cannon, she's dangerous, she could jeapordise us\" \"When we all discovered our mutant powers, weren't we all called the same thing?\" you say \"Would you send Wanda away for the same reason mutants are rejected by humans?\" Scot remained silent. You then addressed the assembled mutants. \"This school is supposed to be where mutants can come and live in peace without the constant prosecution of the outside world, do we really want to send Wanda back to that world, Wanda got me out of that house, I'm in her debt, i'm afraid if she goes, I would have to follow, I still owe her\" \"That's enough, show of hands, who thinks Wanda should stay?\" said Xavier.

Several guns came out of the walls on all sides. A glowing seal started to draw itself on the ground of the Danger Room. One of the guns fired. Wanda stood on her toes and twirled, like a ballet dancer. The laser blast bent round her and shot back to where it had come. The guns were destroyed. The other guns, realising the session had begun, started firing. You watched closely. As the lasers entered the seal, they slowed down. Wanda, in her uninterrupted dance, kicked the lasers away towards the exact same guns they came from. None of them missed their mark, and you knew why. From her foot as it hit the laser, a small, red bolt of energy enveloped the bolts, affecting the probability in Wanda's favour. 'Test 1 complete' said the Danger Room computer 'Test two commence' One of the Danger Room walls collapsed into the ground. Standing in the doorway, was Wolverine. His claws were unsheathed. He ran stealthily towards Wanda. Her eyes were still closed. She had no idea what was coming. You pressed the P.A. \"Wanda, look out!\" She opened her eyes in alarm. Her alarm was enough to expand the hex bolt, throwing Wolverine into the wall. 'Ability test complete' said the Danger Room computer. Wanda looked up to your vantage point and smiled her thanks, then left the Danger Room where she came up to the control room. \"That was brilliant, Wanda\" said Kitty \"I've never seen ballet used in combat\" \"It's a trick I learned early on, it helps to calm the mind and gives me better control of my abilities\" explained Wanda. \"That was very good, Wanda\" said Xavier \"I think you are ready for some team training, as one of the X Men, I want you all here at 4.00 for the team training excercise\"</span></div></div>",

Network's eyes turned blue, as did the eyes of the Sentinels. \"All right\" you say to the team that was going in to rescue Gambit \"You guys follow the Sentinels back in, but then get out of their line of sight, Network will have to relinquish her control over them\" The team nodded. Wolverine and Cyclops led the team into the factory, following the Sentinels. Suddenly, Network's eyes turned back to normal. \"They're on their own now\" she said. \"You can't brood on it\" you say \"We have our own job to do\" You, Network, Iceman and Magma went off in the opposite direction to the entrance. You were headed for the back. You had a feeling that the most important part of the factory would be at the back. If you could shut that down from the outside, the infiltration team would have an easier job. You found the quarter you were going to shut down, and concentrated again. Several lights on the roof winked out. A mass of Sentinels came from the roof. You knew that there were too many for Network to control. \"Magma, create a shield of solid magma around all of us, Iceman, try to keep the rest of us from being baked by Magma's power\" Magma started to construct the rock that should stop the Sentinels from noticing them. Iceman let cold air come from his hands, it was too hot for him to make ice. His cold air did the trick, though. Soon, the shield was created. And not a moment too soon, as they heard the first thud that told them a Sentinel had landed on the ground. </span></div></div>",

You decided to start your search for mutants there. It turned out you weren't very far from Westchester, and the man dropped both of you off in the city centre. The next course of action was more tricky: how to find out where mutants were losing control of their powers and try to help them. The best way, you thought, to do that, would be to ask around. You also had another problem: You had no money. You had taken nothing when you left the island, and couldn't even pay the man who had taken you from the shore to here, how were you supposed to find a room that would  take you with no money? <br>\r\n\"First things first,\" you said \"We need to find somewhere to sleep.\" <br>\r\nAmara nodded, and said: \"I know just the place.\" <br>\r\nAnd to your surprise, lead you into a disused factory area of Westchester.

He was wearing jeans and a t-shirt.<br>\r\n\"Amara, I'm giving you permission to use your powers in this field,\" you said, on a whim, just to see if it would work. Amara immediately tried to summon magma. It worked. <br>\r\n\"Capture him,\" you said \"Get my bag back, but don't kill him if you can help it.\" Amara, now in her Magma form, threw two magma bombs at the guy rifling through my stuff. He immediately dropped the bag and tried to run. Amara ran in the path he was running, running her hand along the floor. A wall of cooled magma was now in the boys path, about half the size of him. He tried running the other way, but was too late, his legs slammed into the wall, and he fell over. Magma quickly put a couple more walls on either side of him, making all the walls higher, so he could not simply jump over them. <br>\r\n\"We don't want to hurt you, my friend,\" you said \"We just want to talk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to me?\" asked the guy \"Why don't my powers work?\" <br>\r\n\"You are in a null field of some sort,\" you said \"Created and maintained by me, no powers work here.\" <br>\r\nThe guys gaze turned to Magma. <br>\r\n\"I seem to be able to allow people within the field to keep their powers,\" you explained \"Now, why did you try to steal my bag?\" <br>\r\n\"My parents kicked me out,\" said the boy \"And my little brother too, we've been living on the streets, using our powers to survive, please, we've not had food in weeks, we're just trying to fend for ourselves.\" <br>\r\n\"I don't blame you,\" you said \"But we're in the same boat as you, we're here because we don't have anyone either, we came to help mutants who are in a similar situation, who feel abandoned, angry, alone, we want to help them find a place where they don't have to be hated for what they are, I can help them to come to terms with their power, you, my friend, could help with that, and your brother.\" <br>\r\n\"O.K,\" said the boy \"I'll have to go get my brother, though, he can help.\" <br>\r\n\"Go on,\" you said, retracting your shield as you took up your bag \"There's nothing of value in this, anyway, return, and you could gain something out of this encounter yet.\" <br>\r\n\"I will,\" said the boy, and vanished into thin air. </span></div></div>",

have I done what am I doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou my boy are a mutant\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat me a mutant I am not a mutant none of my family has been a mutant\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be the mutant gene can activate at any time\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026.. how?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name? \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack\u2026 jack Hughes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack I would like to do some tests to see if you are truly a mutant\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStorm do it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm shocked him with lightning and then in an instant he grew to 11 feet tall and his muscle mass quadrupled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026 what happened\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou transformed\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems that your body absorbs electricity expertly and uses the energy to accelerate muscle and bone growth\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPossibly not many mutants have more than one power that stems off or has a certain theme that is consistent to their main power\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what should I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry focusing the excess energy and direct it through your hands and think about a thunderbolt and try to create enough energy to create lightning and throw it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack took a few try\u2019s but eventually he manifested a bolt of pure lightning in his palm that was six feet long an one foot wide and he threw it at the target dummy and it exploded in an instant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow I feel powerful\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should let\u2019s see if you have any more powers\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more trail and error he found out he had the power to fly and he was able to pulse the energy he absorbs through his veins to triple all his current powers and the ability to shape his electricity it swords axes and even guns<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow jack you don\u2019t have to say yes but please join us here at our school and learn to control your powers even join the x-men\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean it would be cool but I have a life my parents\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can talk to your parents and sort out schooling here and I\u2019m sure you could make friends here, if anybody found out you were a mutant\u2026 well we know how people think about mutants at the best you would be ridiculed at the worst you may be abused attacked and maybe worse\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk I\u2019ll join you guys can we go back to my home and get a few things, talk to my parents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStorm, kitty, cyclops come with me and we will return to Australia\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, kitty, and cyclops all boarded the plane along with jack and the professor to talk to jacks parents<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to jacks home his parents were beyond worried asking what he was doing with the X-men<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor stepped in: \u201cmiss Hughes\u2026 your son is a mutant\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 jack?... a mutant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes he is mutant\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat proof do you have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease come with us outside\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all walked outside and storm summoned a lightning strike and hit jack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Jacks mother cried out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust wait mrs Hughes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen when the lightning stopped coursing through his body he grew to 11 feet and his muscle mass increased again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy gosh jack what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI transformed using my mutant abilities\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout 6 hours\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrs Hughes, mr Hughes please let jack study and learn under my tutelage, learn how to control his powers, he will be accepted and cared for there by people who are also mutants a place with no discrimination\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he has a life here and school he is about to finish his last tests for year 11\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are a school first and a community second we can resume his schooling I myself am qualified to teach; math, science,English, geography, history and we have others at the school who are experts in other fields\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess but we could still talk to him right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes we have the x-plane he could be here in less than an hour, also he can fly we don\u2019t know how fast he can fly yet though\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes he can but one thing, does he want to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mum I do at least I think I do\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow collect anything you need anything with sentimental value that you might need\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack got a duffle bag and pack things like family photos his phone, laptop and a few changes of clothes along with a few other things <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ready professor\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack said goodby to his parents and boarded the plane and sat down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack you will be under the tutelage of storm due the fact that your powers are so similar and connected and as of right now you can only access your abilities through her striking you with lightning however due to the way we found you surrounded by lightning you may have the power to conduct electricity without first being struck by lightning\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMakes sense\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry jack you\u2019ll be fine I\u2019ll help you to master your abilities and hey maybe you have a future in electrical engineering\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm yeah\u2026.thanks\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry jack we will give you a jumpsuit that is able to withstand your growth and electric resistant\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I\u2019ll need that\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked down at this jeans that were basically shredded and his shirt was the same<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he arrived at the manor he was directed to a room of his own and told to settle in before dinner<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then finally reverted back to his regular size and changed into some tracksuits and a sweater<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He pushed them open without any effort and motioned me to step inside. \"Try to relax, kid.\" Smiling slightly, he said. \"You're safe here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he walked away as I slowly walked into a spacious office setting. \"The real question is how safe is everyone with me around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I have faced people with far more dangerous powers than yours, young man.\"</i> Calmly a voice stated in my head. <i>\"All you lack is training.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said that?!\" Startled, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, an electric pencil sharpener transformed into a little robot, waving its spinning blades in a defensive manner on the table where it rested. On another table, a stapler transformed in a similar manner, holding a staple like a boomerang. I smiled slightly at this, knowing that any mechanical device could become a protector only I doubted these little guys could do much against a serious threat if I were attacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Allen.\" Came a calm voice. A bald man in a strange hovering wheelchair emerge from behind a desk. \"My name is Charles Xavier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, Xavier waved his hand and the two machines returned to their natural state. This came as a surprise and a shock to you. \"How did you do that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavier smiled. \"You are not the only one with unique gifts in this world, Allen.\" Calmly, he said. \"I built this school to help young mutant understand and control their mutant abilities so they can make a positive impact upon the world.\" He paused, seeing your uncertain expression. \"Here, everyone will know your name but we do allow a nickname that suits your abilities. \"I suggest Mech.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that suits me as well as any other name.\" Shrugging, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavier nodded. \"Welcome to Xavier's school for the gifted. I will have a senior member show you to your dorm room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the door opened and you saw someone enter. It was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your friend Jane, who had recently gained the power to control the emotions of people around her, was listening intently to the teacher as usual. Ever since she got her powers, it had become a lot easier to concentrate in the maths class. Apparently, when she was interested in something, every other person in the room would also be drawn to it too. She had told you that she felt every emotion she made other people feel. Behind you sat Steve, your best friend. He could duplicate himself and also teleport. A strange combination, but it had worked to his advantage with the school bullies who previously picked on him. Suddenly, every metallic object in the room started to vibrate. It bent and twisted, flying towards the door and sticking there. Then, a fireball burnt a large hole through the wall. Several small creatures made of fire rushed into the room, followed by three people. One wore a purple cape and red armour as if he had just stepped out of medieval times. He was floating a couple of inches off the ground. The second of the people had on an orange suit, the colour of fire. He had a pack on his back with two hozes attached from it to his arms. The last was a female, and looked the most obscure. She wore a white suit and had a blue face, red hair and blue skin over the rest of her body. <br>\r\n\"Give us the mutants, or die where you stand,\" said the guy in the orange suit, conjuring a fireball in his hand. <br>\r\n\"We'll come,\" said Jane, and together, she and Steve walked towards the people who you recognised as the Brottherhood.</span></div></div>",

At the guys throat. \"Logan, calm down, lets go\" you said to him, in a calm voice. You heard a click and looked round. The barman was holding a shot gun. \"Get out of my bar, freak\" Logan brought his other hand up and sliced the gun in half and walked out, you following him. You beckoned to the girl to come too. She followed you at a distance. You and Logan got into the truck. They pulled away. You heard the trailer bumping as if there was someone in it. Logan heard it too. He got out.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, a fire started in the back. You quickly cut the rope and climbed into the front of the truck. \"Come on\" you said to the girl, who you heard was called Marie. She tried to move.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You followed Storm through a number of halls and corridors, seeing children and teenagers from all walks of life going about what seemed to have been their normal routine. Storm kindly greeted a number of young people who passed them as they walked with a 'good morning' but no one addressed you at all. Seeing your concern, she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are new here, Jon.\" she said. \"All of them have come to us, seeking help and shelter, give them time to know you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sigh escaped your lips as you nodded. \"Where will I be staying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In an isolated wing of the mansion, for now.\" replied Storm, wincing. \"Your power can permanently physically damage a person, it is only a precaution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to sob. \"Alone again.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm stopped walking and placed her hands onto your shoulders. \"We all feel alone here, at first.\" she told you. \"I can control the weather, summon a hurricane over a desert town.\" she paused. \"Can you imagine how alone I felt when I first came her and met professor Xavier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was stunned, and fearful. \"You can control this power, right?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrom sighed. \"I can now.\" she replied. \"As a child, I was constantly in fear that my village would kill me every time a strong rain storm came without warning.\" she then smiled kindly again. \"I know you are afraid but I promise you that Xavier will help you find control and a purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at that. \"then there is hope.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jon, there is always hope.\" said Storm, walking with you again. \"Never forget that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued to walk, you noticed that there were fewer and fewer 'students'  running about until you saw no one. Finally, Storm stopped in front of a door. \"This will be your quarters until you learn to use your powers with more control.\" she said. \"Ironically, these were the quarters I was given my first year here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was?\" you asked, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm smiled and opened the door, pointing to a faded mark on the ceiling of the main room. \"Although it had been painted over, you can still see where I had accidentally summoned lightning inside the room.\" she told you. \"I have no doubt that you too will leave a mark of your own, to share with future students should you decide to remain as a teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she quietly left you to settle in. \"Storm...\" you called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped, turning to you. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm returned your smile. \"You are welcome, Jon.\" she said. \"Your supper will be brought to you shortly and the professor will begin your control lessons in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched Storm as she then left you then entered your quarters, closing the door behind you. The room looked much like any college dorm with three rooms. There was the main room where you would sleep, eat, study, and so on, there was a bathroom, and a small kitchenette with a microwave and refrigerator. Walking further in, you found that all of your luggage, what there was of it, had already been moved into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home, Jon.\" you said to yourself, shedding a tear. \"So begins my new life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, there came a knock on your door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You guessed it was a place for the students to relax and talk between classes. Inside a number of people, around your age, were sitting and standing around talking and laughing amongst themselves. Rogue, with a small but mischievous smile, released your hand and gave you a light shove, causing you to stumble forward, into the room. Everyone paused, turning to you, as Rogue stepped in beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, this is Jon, he is new here.\" said Rogue, introducing you. \"He's a bit shy and needs some friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne boy stepped forward. He was slightly shorter than you with black hair and yellow eyes. What threw you on guard was that he had blue, furry skin, pointed ears, and a long tail. In all, he reminded you of a demon. Only you did not run as you believed that your power made you a bit of a demon as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Xavier's school for the gifted!\" he said, politely offering his hand. \"I'm Kurt, AKA Nightcrawler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pause, you took Kurt's hand and shook it. \"Thanks for the welcome.\" you said, releasing Kurt's hand. \"Sorry, I don't have a secondary name, I just got here today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what can you do?\" asked another boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to see a tall, muscular boy with brown hair, wearing dark red sunglasses. \"I can manipulate the nervous system of any living being.\" you replied. \"I still don't have full control over it. Xavier is helping me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy nodded. \"I'm Scott, AKA Cyclops.\" he said. \"I would simply call you Neuro, as the word pertains to the nervous system, the basis of your mutant power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it for a moment then nodded. \"Neuro, I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others came closer, introducing themselves, treating you like any normal person they may happen to meet on a random street corner. This caused you to tear up to the point of almost sobbing. Rogue, seeing this, smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Jon?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" you said, rubbing at your eyes. \"It's just that it's been so long since I felt... welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt smiled. \"We all went through that.\" he said. \"Get used to it here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then gave you a firm pat on the back. Only, as he did, you felt a surge run through you and feared that something would happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm sorry, professor!\" you stammered. \"It was an... an accident, I promise you it was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavier laughed kindly. \"Relax, Jon.\" he said. \"Apparently, your ability to manipulate the nervous system gives you the power to augment one's mutant power, allowing Kurt to teleport several people instead of only one or two within close range.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could also be dangerous, professor.\" said Scott. \"If Magneto gets wind of Neuro's powers, he might try to recruit him into the brotherhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's first deal with helping... err...

She had suffered many heartbreaks due to her power and now, she meets a boy who is immune to her voice who truly likes her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Could this be real?\"</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your hand touched hers, in a shy handshake, fireworks went off in both your minds and the world around you ceased to exist for a moment.

You dribbled around Scot and took a shot. The ball bounced around the ring and then went through the hoop. The croud erupted with cheers. Fire, ice and other powers were thrown into the air in celebration. Now, Scot knew how good you were, he was taking no prisoners. This time, he started with the ball. He dribbled past you and shot. You jumped and caught the ball, then started dribbling again. Heading for Scots goal. You shot again, and again it went in. 2-0. Scot still looked confident. There was still plenty of time. Both of you returned to the center of the court and you tossed him the ball. He started dribbling again. You tackled him and dribbled towards his goal, scoring again. 3-0. You caught the ball as it came out and jumped up, doing a slamdunk. 4-0. Then Scot interrupted your fifth shot and started dribbling fast towards your goal. This one you knew you couldn't stop, even with powers. He scored. 4-1. You returned to the center. Scot passed you the ball and you started dribbling down the court, heading, again, for Scot's basket. You shot. and the shot went in. Then as the ball came down, you caught it and jumped up, doing another slam dunk. 6-1. You passed the ball to Scot. The crowd was on the edge of their seats by now. Scot was the best basketball player they knew and now he was being beaten. Scot attacked your goal with fury. He dribbled down the court, scoring again, followed by another goal. Then he shot again, but you caught the ball, dribbling back down the court. You scored again. The score was now seven, three. You passed the ball to Scot. He attacked your basket again. He shot and scored. 7-4. You caught the ball as it came out and you dribbled around Scot and dribbled down the field, scoring twice more. 9-4. You tossed the ball to Scot. He dribbled up the field and scored. 9-5. You dribbled up the field. Scot blocked youyou tried going right. He blocked you. You tried going left. he blocked you again.

What the guy didn't know was that losing control of your anger, meant using your mutant powers. You concentrated on keeping your powers under control. Then, the guy pushed you down onto the ground. You quickly thought \"Jean, help me\" Then the guy picked you up and slammed you against the lockers again. You had no choice, you had to use your powers. The guy was thrown backwards into the lockers. You turned to his cronies. They ran for it, thinking you had thrown him. Then, Jean, Scot, Sarah and Kurt arrived. \"Are you O.K?\" asked Jean \"I got your message\" \"Yeah\" you say \"Did you use your powers?\" asked Sarah \"Yes\" you said \"I'm not sure what I did to him\" Suddenly, the guy got up. His eyes were glowing green. Green light shot from his eyes at you. You dived out of the way and the wall behind you exploded. The beam did not stop. \"Jean, can you stop his beams\" you say. Suddenly, the beams stop. \"Thanks\" you say \"What the hell happened?\" \"I'm not sure\" said Jean \"We should get him to the professer.

You watched, horrified as the flabby features of his body melted away to smooth hairless skin. His enormous belly shrank and flattened as the rest of him shrank as well. You swallowed hard, seeing his hair become a light brown before growing at an incredible rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Incredible!\"</i> you thought. <i>\"Minx is really changing hi into a little girl!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Frederick, looking more like a Fredia, was struggling to pull you along and stopped to see what was wrong. A short, feminine scream escaped her lips as she saw how huge you suddenly were to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get so big!?\" she asked, startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed, noticing her new voice, then looked at herself and screamed again before turning to Minx, annoyed. \"What did you do to me!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for a response, she fell to her buttocks and began to cry and wail like a child having a major tantrum. \"What a drams queen.\" said Minx, walking up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long will he... err... she be like that?\" you asked, wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minx shrugged. \"It depends upon weather of not Xavier can help me.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Minx, startled. \"What do you mean?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinx turned to you, teary eyed. \"I don't know how to undo the changes I make to reality.\" she replied. \"Until I learn how, 'Fredia' will have to get used to being my little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"Here I thought my powers were scary.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinx sighed herself. \"Will you help me?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Great, thanks, later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her cell phone and turned to you grinning. \"It's all good, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, you and Kat arrived at the mall.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You blushed as she smiled at you and Kat but that changed after she spoke. \"I remember you being such a shy child, Kitty.\" she said, gently. \"You've matured a lot in the passed year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat blushed as you hid a smile, not wanting to be targeted next. \"Please, call me Kat.\" she said. \"Kitty is too... girly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing wrong with being a tomboy.\" you said, touching her shoulder. \"A tiger is a big 'kitty'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat glared at you for a moment, causing you to lift your hand before she smiled. \"I prefer the name Kat, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine.\" you said. \"No problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat giggled. \"Relax, I don't bite.\" she said. \"Let's get started with a few rules about fashion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rules?\" you asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat nodded. \"Rule number one.. Always match your belt with your shoes.\" she said. \"For you, I'd work with easy to match colors like black or dark brown.\" she paused. \"For the casual look, with sneakers, I'd use a cloth material for the belt as you will likely wear blue jeans with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense.\" you said, nodding. \"Keep it simple, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally.\" said Kat. \"Second rule, when dressing up for your date with Sarah, make sure the tie you pick compliments your shirt.\" she giggled. \"Don't go to your date looking like a clown, she's liable to smack you around for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled. \"Good point.\" you said. \"Rule three?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The third rule regards pleats and flat-front trousers.\" said Kat. \"I recommend the flat fronts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Fine by me, you're the expert.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm giggled and Kat turned to her, slightly annoyed. \"He was complimenting me, storm.\" she protested. \"Don't laugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was not the compliment I was referring to.\" replied Storm, smiling. \"It was the irony, I've seen your wardrobe when you first came here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat blushed but smiled as you countered, \"It could have been worse than mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moving on.\" said Kat. \"The fourth rule is about your socks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... socks?\" you asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat nodded, smiling. \"You may think they are comfortable but, trust me, you will not be popular in school if you keep wearing pink socks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed brightly \"I forgot to separate my whites from my colors.\" you said, shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat and Storm giggled before Kat continued. \"They should match or, at least, compliment your pants.\" she said. \"We'll get you a few pairs while we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" you replied to Kat's further giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, we're here to help you.\" said Kat, still giggling. \"The last rule is to just be yourself. If you act like someone you are not, it will only turn a girl off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" you said. \"So, should we get started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat shook her head and gently urged you to sit down near a changing room. \"We'll get the outfits and styles for you.\" she said. \"You just try them on and tell us if you like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kat and Storm walked off, giggling and talking while you sat and waited...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Right now, you are relaxed and calm but you also need to learn to control your powers while under duress so you do not accidentally change reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I've been doing all my life.\" said Minx, tearing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only locally, Minx.\" said Xavier. \"Fortunately, you have had the inner sense to make all those relating to the people you changed to not notice a difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neuro noticed Fred's change into Frieda.\" said Minx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon is a unique case.\" said Xavier. \"He will be needing a lot of my attention in the next couple of weeks as he is building up to a very powerful ability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinx swallowed hard, knowing you had nearly fallen into the hands of the brotherhood. \"What kind of ability?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavier sighed. \"A power similar to mine, the ability to control the full capacity of the human mind.\" he replied. \"If I so desired, I could have all of your abilities, though not all at once. Although it will take years, as Jon is very young, he will eventually have this power as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinx turned pale, almost to the point of becoming ghost like, as she understood the true nature of your power. She fell back into her chair, looking at Xavier in shock. \"Magneto nearly got that power.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magneto does not know Jon's potential.\" said Xavier. \"He only knew of his ability to 'copy' other people's powers.\" he then moved his chair closer to Minx and placed a light hand onto her shoulder. \"Magneto and I have the same goals, we simply have different ideas as to how to reach them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, Magneto is not evil?\" asked Minx, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is evil in every one of us, Minx.\" replied Xavier. \"It is up to us, as individuals, to decide which way to lean more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Xavier left his office as Minx sat with much to think about.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Bobby and Marie sat across from you. \"If you like, Marie, I could shut off your power for the night\" you say \"Xavier just taught me how, but I can't do it indefinitely\" \"That would be great!\" said Marie. You concentrated on Marie. \"That's your power off\" you say. Bobby took off one of her gloves and held her hand. She closed her eyes, enjoying the feeling of Bobby's hand on hers. The limo stopped.

Yeah, it was perfect. The table was close enough to the dance floor for viewing, but also positioned in an area that gave a little privacy. As you slowly strolled over to the table, you feel the appreciative glances from the spectacularly other women. Although you were a little embarised by the attension, you were waiting for one woman, Sara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Sara stood at the entrance, searching the club. You stood out from the croud, being to her much better looking than any one else in the building. This pleased Sara, for she was stunning herself. Sara made a quick stride to catch up with you before you reached the table. After reaching you, Sara gently touched your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Sara moved closer to you as they sat next to one another in the cozy booth. She loved listening to the easy conversation between Rogue and Bobby. Sara just adored your eyes that just seemed to draw her in. As you listened to the conversation, you shyly brushed the soft tendrils of curls from Sara's brow. Sara giggled, loving the contact the shy manner of it. You smiled in your boyish way revealing white teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         You and Sara intertwined wrists to exchange sips from our glasses filled with water. \"Why don't we dance\" suggested Sara. \"Great!\" enthused Bobby pulling Marie onto the flore. You shoot your sister a woried look which she only managed to regester as she dissapeared into the mass of bodies. \"Lets go\" Sara said holding out her hand. \"I'm not sure thats the best idea\" you said embarisment plain in your voice. \"Why\" she asked rasing one eye brow. \"You'll laugh\" you said blushing slightly. A sly smile spread acros Sara's face. \"Try me\" she said playfully. \"I can't dance\" you say blushing fiercely, looking down at you shoes. As you predicted, she laughed. But you didn't mind. Dispite being imune to her power, to you her laugh was beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"I'll lead\" Sara said that sly smile still on her fance. Hip-Hop filled the club once again as D.J. Leon showed off his turntable skills. Sara guided you onto the floor. The music was pumping! Hips twisting. Fingers popping. Heads bopping! Bodies spinning. Everything was moving! Maby because of her power, but Sara realy was an exelent dancer. YOu just went along for the ride. Every now and again we would catch a glimps of Marie and Bobby. My sister gave you a grin which you returned whole hartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         The music slowed. You and Sara drer closer. Sara wrapped her fingers closely around you neck. You were startled but as she laid her head on your chest, you let the cares of the past weeks slip away. Hips swayed. Eyes met. Couples moved in unison. Sara spoke your name. She looked up into your eyes, which were wanting. She moved her fingers from your neck onto your chest. After the last song, D.J. Leon thanked everyone for coming out, and the resteraunt cleared.</div></span></div></div>",

And you gently connected mouths for a kiss. Your head spun and your heart beet increased, but you could cair less. Right now you were in heaven. As you finally released each other the heat of the moment hung in the air. \"Well, goodnight\" Sara said backing into her room. You were too stuned to reply.

I believed it was a mutant yet to come into their powers and so I wated for it to grow stronger. However, last night I naticed that the signal had grown much stronger. I investigated and I realised it was a camp of mutnats. So many mutants in one place meens a potential teem and a potential allie.\" \"Couldn't it be Magnito and his teem?\" asked Scott. Quite a reasonable question thought Jon. Xavier shook his head. While I did notice that one mind was shrouded from me, the minds of the others were not those of the brotherhood.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do we leave then\" asked Sara giving you a sidelong smile. \"Now\" sead Logan entering the hanger along with them. Everyone piled into the X Jet and straped themsleves in. It would take time to reach Greece.</span></div></div>",

When they reached the waters edge Xavier called across the water, \"We meen you no harm. Plese come out. I would like to speak to you. With no warning what so ever there was an explosion from the water. A huminoid reptilian creatur sprang at their flank, closely followed by green spheres of engergy. From a newly opened hole in the side of the cliff came a girl surounded by roots and vines, a girl singing like Sara, and a weard guy with a multi-collered aphro who was dancing. Aparently each of these had their own powers and soon a fight broke out with so much confusion Jon was unable to use his powers. He might hert his friends by mistake. He cought slight glimpses of his frends, like Scott fighting with the repitle. Luckily Sara and Marie were on the ball. They pushed Jon into a cluster of bolders. Jon then senced a preseance far over head. It was much more powerfull than anyone he had ever felt besides the Professor. </div><br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">Then a huge voice boomed from over head. \"<b>THAT IS ENOUGHT</b>\"! Everyone stoped and looked up. There on top of the cliff face stood a boy, about 17 years old, flanked on ither side by two men. The boy was leen and tough looking with a shock of dark hair and a long lance in his right hand. The men on ither side were less defined but both were strong looking.</div><br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">\"<b>FALL IN</b>\" the boy boomed again. At once their attackers withdrue and lined up at the shore line. The boy stepped over the edge of the cliff and glided down twords the line. Yes he floted down while standing ram rod stiff. \"What is the meaning of this. I told you to stay below untill I returned. I leave for 12 hours and I have to turn around half way out to sea.\"</div></span></div></div>",

As you said it, a shadow crossed across the path in front of you. You heard a strange, crackling noise and a glowing, humanoid shape fizzed into being in front of you. A lizard creeped up behind you and morphed into a strange lizard humanoid. You heard a sound like a sword from a sheath and saw a small boy with three claws on each hand. You saw a strange looking girl next to the lizard girl. Then, several lions appeared out of nowhere around you, led by a man. \"We're surrounded!\" you say to Siren and the others. \"What do you want?\" you shout to the group that surrounded you. \"We want you to come with us\" said one of the guy with the lions. \"Why?\" you say \"What have we done to you?\" \"Nothing\" said a voice behind you \"We just want to talk\" Then you felt yourself hit by a large amount of energy.

You felt the floor below you get cold. Then Iceman stood up behind you. He had what looked like an icicle in his hand. He sawed through the ropes binding you to Siren and Rogue and you all stood up. \"There's a door\" you say, pointing. You all head for the door. You suddenly found a bottle of water in your pocket. \"Iceman, if I pore this water in the lock, can you freeze it to make a key?\" you said. \"I could try\" he said. You poured the water into the lock and Bobby froze it. You turned the frozen water and the door unlocked. There was no guard outside. \"That's strange\" you say \"Why would they leave us unguarded?\" \"We didn't\" said a voice from above. A two boys dropped from the ceiling. One extended two claws from his wrists and charged. The other vanished. You heard Rogue cry out and fall to the ground. You quickly concentrated on the charger. He fell to the ground, unable to move. \"There seems to be a teleporter here too\" you say \"Bobby, ice all around us, so that they'll slip if they try and do what they did to to us what they did to Rogue\" Iceman nodded, icing the floor around you.

You poured what was left of your water on her face and she awoke\" \"Can you walk?\" you said to her. \"Yes\" she said. \"Go and touch him\" you said, pointing to the unconscious boy on the floor.

They were taken upstairs to a magnificent dining room. There was a fancy table adorned with goblets and expensive looking cutlery. Dinner would be served shortly, but now you had time to talk with the man and the children. \"So, who exactly are you?\" you asked. \"I am Darren Stark\" he said \"I am known as Elemental Man, my powers are to create and transform my body into any element\" This man was powerful. \"What about your kids?\" asked Bobby. \"They are not my kids, I took them in after their parents kicked them out to live on the streets\" replied Darren. \"You said your name was Stark, is that any relation to Tony Stark?\" asked Siren. Darren nodded. \"We're related, but we've never met, he's always 'busy'\" \"When did you pick up these kids?\" asked Sara. \"I picked up Lizard-Girl first, her powers had manifested and she was being chased. She ran into the lab of Dr Kurt Connors, some of the serum he had been working on came onto her, her shape shifting powers adapted to the serum and now she can change into any reptile she wants\" said Darren.
