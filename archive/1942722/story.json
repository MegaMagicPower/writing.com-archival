Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as you listen to your chemistry teacher, Mr. Brent, drone on about your instructions. There were only four days of school left, why is it he's making you do work? Four more days, you remind yourself, four more days until you are a senior and one year from being out of here for good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try your best to at least get this experiment right. And A could really help your grade in this class. No matter how hard you focus, however, you can't quite mzke out everything the teacher says. It's always been hard to hear from the back of the classroom. Plus, with no one around you close enough for you to ask for help, you have to wing most of your experiment. Now did he say 30 milliliters of sodium bromide or was it sodium chloride? Guessing, you pour in the sodium chloride. Suddenly, the solution splashes all over you, covering you and your clothes. Damn, you really liked that  shirt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one seems to notice the splash, which is good. You'd hate for Mr. Brent to yell at you again for spilling something. You grab some paper towels and wipe down your desk, cleaning the fluid from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you clean, you notice the towel appears to be growing bigger... what brand is this? You look around in amazement as you see everything around you growing larger and larger! What's happening?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you realize the world isn't growing, you're shrinking! The solution you spilled seems to have shrunk you! Luckly you got it on your clothes too, you'd hate to be naked in class!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you stop shrinking you realize that you are now about three inches tall in a world of giants! What to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know you have to find someone to help you, but who?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's Julian who's not too far away. He is a little short, but obviosly still huge compared to you. He has tan skin, is very muscular, and wears black framed glasses. He can be a bit childish, but he would be sure to help<br>\r\nyou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's also Shayne. Shayne is fairly tall and has a lean build with tan skin. He's very kind and is openly gay. You think he'd help you, but you're also pretty sure he has a crush on you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a jock type guy named Daniel close by. He's huge compared to normal students in both height and muscle size, but isn't very bright. He has pale skin. If you want someone who could protect you at your size he'd probably be a good bet, but who knows what someone that size could do to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Brent may help you. He's in his mid thirties, is pale and a bit thin. He's a teacher who students don't seem to respect, but you've always bee good in class. He would help, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could always go out into to halway too and look for someone there. But who knows who you'll bump into...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr who'll bump into you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can't help but notice that his usual boyish grin has gotten wider and that he had a very lustful look in his eyes. His face was like a billboard to you, and suddenly you find yourself being aroused once more. Damn this guy is hot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I spilled some chemicals on myself and I need your help!\" you say, your voice shaking a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I help?\" You notice that Julian's whispering now, probably due to some nearby students shooting him funny looks. \"I don't know,\" you reply, growing agitated, \"I guess that you just should keep me safe for now until we figure out how to make me big again.\" You sit down in Julian's palm. \"If we can figure out how to make me big again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Well I obviously have no way of helping you right now, but how about I put you in my poket for now and when I get home we'll try to figure some things out there?\" You sigh in relief. \"Thanks Julian. I was worried that I'd find a squish everything small kind of person, but instead I managed to find a sweet, helpful guy.\" Julian blushed bright red. \"Don't think anything of it!\" And with that, Julian lowered you into his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nice and warm in there. You found some lint and made a pillow with it. Soon you found yourself fast asleep only to be occasionally disturbed by Julian occassionally patting you on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later you were woken up by Julian removing yoi from his pocket. You looked around and saw yourself in a nice car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured that you didn't need to stay in there while I drove home, hon.\" Julian winked at you. Your heart raced but at the same time you felt a knot in your stomach. \"Well, I'll be honest with you Gordon, I've been admiring you from afar for too long now. What I have now, is what I've always wanted, you. So I'll still help you if you really want it, but I won't be in any hurry. What I want to know is, do you love me back?\"</span></div></div>",
