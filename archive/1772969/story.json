He never suspected that anything significant would happen to him. Yet, something very significant most certainly was going to happen to him today. As Jack walked down the sidewalk, he passed by a dark alleyway. Out of the corner of his eye, Jack saw a flash of blue light from down the dark alley. Curious, he walked into the alley. As soon as he entered it, Jack was stunned by what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHovering inches off the ground right in front of him was a colossal swirling vortex! It was almost as tall as the massive buildings on either side of it, and Jack could only stare in awe at the huge portal to who-knows-where. Suddenly, as Jack was standing there in a daze, a huge hand reached out of the portal and grabbed him! The massive fingers that were easily twice as long as he was tall wrapped around his entire body, and with a gentle but firm grip pulled him through the portal. Jack squeezed his eyes shut in fear, as he was certain that whatever had grabbed him was surely going to kill him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he soon felt himself being released from the grip of the massive hand and placed carefully onto the ground. Jack hesitantly opened his eyes to see just what he was captured by, but he never expected what he saw: towering over him with a tender smile on her face was a beautiful young woman, no less than 250 feet tall! This massive girl wore a <span class=\"cpink\">pink</span> tanktop and a <span class=\"cblue\">blue</span> mini-skirt, and her long<span class=\"cyellow\"> blond </span>hair flowed gorgeously down her back. She was wearing a pair of <span class=\"clteal\">light blue</span> flipflops, and her massive toes each had <span class=\"clred\">bright red</span> nail polish applied to them. As Jack looked closer, he realized that her fingernails also had this same <span class=\"clred\">red</span> nail polish as well. She was truly a figure of beauty, and her ample bosom was simply icing on the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet despite this probably 19 year old girl's undeniable beauty, Jack couldn't help being terrified by her. The smile on her face did nothing to calm him down, as the only thing that he could imagine at the moment was how easily she could crush his pathetic body into paste beneath her enormous feet. After all, no matter how pretty she was, Jack was nothing but a bug compared to her sheer size. He simply couldn't think of her doing anything but crushing him like one. Just then, the giantess reached out toward him with her hand. Jack instinctively curled into a ball and began begging for his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Miss, don't hurt me! I'll do anything you want, just don't kill me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's hand quickly receded as she heard this. She then spoke to him with a noticeable hint of sadness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurt you? Why would I ever hurt you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then noticed Jack shaking in fear, and immediately panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Did I really scare you that much?! Oh, I'm so sorry! You must absolutely hate me now, Master! Please forgive me Master, I will readily accept any punishment that you choose to give me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack lifted his head up and searched the room, looking for this person that the titaness had referred to as 'master'. However, as he looked around, it became apparent to him that he was the only one in the room aside from the girl herself... But she couldn't have been talking to him, could she?! He had to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... Who exactly were you calling 'master', Miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why you of course. Do you see anyone else in this room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no... But me? Your master?! HOW?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear! I completely forgot to explain the circumstances! Stupid, stupid, stupid!\" She said, smacking herself on the head with each 'stupid' at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Miss, just explain to me what's going on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Master, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a second. Please, just call me Jack. It feels weird having someone as huge as you calling me 'master'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, Jack. Oh, and I'm sorry I didn't introduce myself sooner. My name is Julie, and I shall be your loyal guardian from this day forward. Anyway, allow me to explain. You are now on the planet Macroterra, a parallel world exactly opposite the world you know as Earth. With the exception of the identical wildlife to your home world, ours is a world inhabited solely by giantesses. As for why I brought you here, it's part of a tradition on Macroterra. You see, every hundred years, we select one man from Earth and bring him to Macroterra to serve as our king. You have been chosen to rule as our king, Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?! Me?! The king of an entire planet?! But why me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple, Jack. Our king is always selected based on one defining condition: they must have a pure heart. You have proven to fit that criteria better than anyone else we have observed, and as such, I was selected to bring you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... Okay, this is just too much... First of all, how <i>did</i> you bring me here in the first place?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll find that our technology is a fair bit more advanced than that of your home planet. We have the concept of inter-dimensional travel mastered, making transport between here and Earth a rather simple feat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... Well what did you mean by that 'guardian' bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see Jack, the first one who makes contact with the new king upon his arrival on Macroterra is assigned to serve as the king's guardian. It is now my duty to show you around our world, teach you anything that you need to know about our culture, explain the details of your job to you, and most importantly ensure that no harm should ever come to you. In essence, I am now your loyal right hand who shall stay by your side for the remainder of your life as king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... This is sure a whole lot to take in... So I'm seriously the new king of your entire planet? This isn't just some kind of joke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Master Jack! I would never attempt to deceive you! I ensure that everything that I have told you thus far has been the truth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Julie, I believe you... But this is just crazy... I've never had anything special about me in my entire life, and now I'm leader of a whole planet that I've never even heard of?! It's just... Wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand if you need a moment to take all this in, Master...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... And I thought I told you that you could just call me Jack...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes... My sincerest apologies...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Julie, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack then sat down and began to think things over. What would he do first now that he was king of an entire planet?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oh, I mean Jack!\" Julie said, blushing as she corrected herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe motioned for Jack to follow her through a giant door, and as it opened, Jack's mouth dropped open in awe at the sight. The world outside was even bigger than the inside of the building. Gigantic multi-colored birds flew around singing a very abnormal tune. Instead of the normal bird whistling the birds actually sang proper words, but their voices were very high pitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Welcome Master to your home, Enjoy your land and all the glow\"</i> They sang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gasped in shock as he heard the birds singing like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh those are the KoKo birds they have human minds when it comes to singing, a myth has it they can tell the future and they sing like normal human birds when someone dies, although it has never happened before...\" Julie explained. Jack just nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked further outside and noticed several other gigantic women and young girls, and as they walked by, the girls all bowed saying \"Welcome, Master.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie led Jack around the area until it was sunset, but the strangest part was the fact the sun was a deep blue color instead of the golden glow he was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, It is getting late now. I advise for you to go to your chambers if you don't want to be eaten alive by any of the nocturnal predators of our planet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, okay then...\" Jack replied, nervously looking toward the bushes as he swore he heard a low growling coming from behind one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie then carried him to what appeared to be his new sleeping area, and it was huge! She placed Jack down on the floor to allow him a chance to admire his new quarters. The room had an appearance that fitted its description as the bedroom of royalty, but it also had a cozy aura about it. The walls were painted with a pattern of black &amp; gold, and furniture with matching colors adorned the entire room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Julie? A little help with the bed?\" Jack asked, trying to climb into the gigantic bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Jack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly picked him back up and placed him into the bed. Jack thanked Julie for her assistance before she left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew...\" Jack said as he sat down on the gigantic plush pillow. \"I kinda miss being back home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack let out a sigh before trying to get to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jack listened to the flowing creek beside the palace, he wondered what would be in store for him in this new world. He wasn't used to being a king of anything, let alone an entire planet of giantesses. His parents would be worried, and his job manager would get frustrated with him if he was absent for more than one day. All his friends would probably wonder where he'd gone. They would never know that he was no longer be a resident of Earth, but of Macroterra instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Jack realized that although it might take a while to adapt, being a king might not be so bad in the long run. After all, Julie and all the other women he had seen were all beautiful beyond imagining. Not only that, but they all seemed to be loyal and compassionate as well. On his way here, he had seen many inventions that would have made Earth's greatest technology seem like children's toys by comparison. He was surprised he made it to the palace at all, gaping at everything along the way. Now that he thought about it, their technology was far more advanced than that of Earth's. If he could take some of their medicine back home he could become the hero that cured all diseases known to man, or he could end world hunger with seeds that grew a limitless supply of fruit. Feeling the soft silk of the bedsheets beneath him, Jack couldn't even count all the new opportunities that had been opened up to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, how would he even get back home? He could've sworn the portal had closed behind him when he entered it... Then again, how was the portal even created in the first place? Surely if these giant women could open a portal to a different world once, they should be able to do it again. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I'll just hangout here for a while and decide what I really want to do later...\" Jack thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he nodded off and, he made a vow to become the greatest king Macroterra had ever seen. With that, he watched the bright blue moonlight start to fade, more and more, until it was complete darkness. </span></div></div>",

Everything's so huge and I just want to get out of here. Please help me!\" He got frantic and loud at the end. The door opened and the light flashed on. Julie stood in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mast- Jack, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The man started running back in sheer terror as Julie approached. Her eyes grew wide in surprise. She must not have noticed him come in the portal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Julie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the lights on, Jack finally got a good look at him. He had a very thin, but not unhealthy body. He was wearing jeans and a sweatshirt with Yellowstone plastered on it. He had shaggy black hair, and it turned out the man was only about 16. He started to stutter out a few words but gave up the futile attempt. Julie approached him and reached down. She grabbed him and brought him to her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't do anything to you, just tell me your name please.\" Her voice was soft and non-threatening.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm Zach.\" the man said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwas clearly still scared but managed to get those words out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Zach, how did you get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He swallowed deeply, still unable to get over Julie's massive size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was behind the portal and it pulled me in.

Now is the new king of a race of titan sized woman. He couldn't help but feel unsure of his new role. He had never so much as lead a scout troop before. Let alone an entire planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon his fears got the best of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What if I fail? What if I accidentally start a war?  What all the plants die, thus leading to the fall of the planet's economy? Not to mention Macroterra would become a barren wasteland!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment someone entered the room, causing Jack to cry out in fear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack! Are you okay?\"  It was none other than Julie, the first giantess Jack met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, I'm sorry if I woke you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Julie. I couldn't sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sighs before he closed eyes. \"I don't think I'm fit to be king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie's face fell a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why would you even think that?\" she asked, as her gigantic body drops onto the bed beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for one thing, I don't know anything about being a ruler. I have absolutely no experience. What if I screw up so badly that I ruin your whole world?\" Then Jack felt something large, yet soft, rub his back gently. It was Julie's finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this seems like an overwhelming challenge, but you will have help. Me and the others will teach you everything you need to know. Beside, you already know the most important thing a king needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a heart of gold,\" she smiled. \"Also you're quite handsome too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack took a double take after what the giantess just said.

She was intrigued by the relationship between men and women. For the past few years she and the council studied Jack. From what they had seen, Jack was pure of heart. He would always help those in need. Even if they were total strangers. This quality was what Julie liked the most about him, and it even led her to develop a crush on him. So when she was chosen to be his guardian, she was overjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived at her chambers and looked inside her closet. \"I screwed up the first time I met Jack. Now I have to make a great second impression on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Jack's room, Jack was still on the pillow waiting for Julie. <i>I wonder where she is?</i> He thought. Moments later his door opened, and Julie entered the room. Julie wore a <span class=\"cbyellow\">yellow</span> nightgown which showed a good amount of cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello little master, do you like what you see?\" she spoke with a seductive grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, you look beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, little master.\" she replied as she climbs into bed and covers herself with her bed sheets. \"Good night little master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Julie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie grabbed Jack and pulled him close to her, and within a matter of minutes, the two fell asleep in eachother's embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Who Wakes up first?</div></span></div></div>",

He didn't know what to say. Sure she was beautiful and nice. On the other hand, he barely knew the giantess. Not to mention he was soon going to be King, and she his servant. Would a relationship between them even be possible? Plus there was the size difference that they would have to overcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie, I would love to have a relationship with you. You are truly a wonderful woman. But could we please take slow? I'd really like to get to know you more before rushing into anything.\" Jack replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" She grinned. It took all her will power to keep her from jumping for joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then,  an another giantess step in. This woman looked to be a few years older than Julie, but she was still the exact same height. Her was hair dark <span class=\"cbrown\">brown</span>, and was tied up in a bun. Her eyes were <span class=\"cbgreen\">green</span>. She wore a <span class=\"cmaroon\">red </span>dress shirt and white pants. She also had <span class=\"cbgreen\">green </span>glasses and <span class=\"clred\">red </span>high heel shoes. she was holding a clip board in one hand and a pen in another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">She tells them Jack has a meeting to attend to. </div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jack lay on the pillow, head reeling from the day's events, a howl shattered the silence around him. He sprung to his feet, glancing around nervously in both directions, then smacked himself on the head as Julie had done earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, you sissy, that's coming from outside... It's nothing to be scared of...\" he muttered to himself as the howl rang forth a second time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack raised his head to peer out a window by his bed, watching as dark clouds rolled past a moon unfamiliar to him and obscuring it. But from what he could tell, it appeared to be full. Jack slowly eased himself back onto the pillow and shuddered as the howl met his ears for a third time. He cringed and clamped his hands over his ears, and although he could no longer hear the howl, his curiosity was eating him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the warning Julie had given him, Jack was tempted to go outside and find whatever was making the howling, just to shut it up if anything else. He lowered his hands and took a deep breath before crawling to the edge of the bed. Designed for someone of a much greater stature, the ground was quite a ways off. Jack frowned and looked around for another means of descent, his eyes finally resting upon the covers of the bed. They lay draped over the bed, and they dangled off the ground slightly. Jack gulped as he gripped them in his hands, and he almost gave up and went back to bed before a fourth howl prompted him to do otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHand-over-hand, Jack used all the strength he could muster to lower himself to the ground. By the time he got there, he collapsed and fell onto the ground, gulping lungfuls of air. He staggered to his feet and rested his hands on his knees, eyes locked on the door. Jack regained his composure before dashing across the wooden floor, glistening in the moonlight, and slipping underneath the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world awaiting him on the other side of the door rendered Jack speechless. The trees and bushes rose high above him, their canopies disappearing into the darkness. Even the grass was almost as tall as him. He stumbled forward and widened his eyes, taken aback at how it differed from the environment of earth. He pushed his way through the grass and forged a path through, into the forest. At one point, he even noticed a few ants the sizes of horses to him scurry by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easy to lose track of time in the wilderness of Macroterra, and this finally struck Jack. He didn't even know how long he'd been outside, but he knew it had been a long time. He started to turn back, but then realized he didn't know where \"Back\" was; he was hopelessly lost. He staggered through the darkness, thrusting the blades of grass out of his way frantically in an attempt to find his way back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie?\" He called. \"Julie! Where are you? I'm lost! Can you hear me?\" He already knew the answer to his last question; there was no way a 250-foot woman could hear him, but apparently, something else had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ear-splitting howl resounded from somewhere behind him, the very same howl he'd been hearing earlier. Jack froze as he heard the leaves behind him rustling, and whipped around to face whatever it was. To his horror, a paw stepped out from the shrubbery, then another, and then the head of the largest wolf he'd ever seen. The wolf was as black as the night itself, with grey paws and belly. It must've been at least 100 feet tall; it would've been big, even for Julie. For Jack, it was an utter monstrosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf slowly paced towards him, its lip curled in a menacing snarl. It was glaring directly at him, clearing the short distance between them unsettlingly fast. Jack backed away from it worriedly, nearly wetting himself in the process. It finally struck him that it would be very easy for someone like him to die in this universe of giantesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Jack stumbled and fell onto his back, crying out in pain. The wolf lunged forward and stood directly above him, saliva dripping from its mouth. A massive paw landed on either side of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice doggy?\" Jack whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen to Jack next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack ran through the large forest as fast as he could with a 100ft wolf running after him. Jack knew that the wolf was to large to outrun, the only thing keeping jack alive was the fact that the grass, which towered over him in ease, was hiding him in the shadows, also the fact that it was night outside also increased his chances of survival. Jack zigzagged through the grass, trying to confuse the wolf. Jack hated his stupidity, how could he go exploring through a jungle he knew nothing about. He wished that he listened to Julie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was getting exhausted, he had managed to dodge the wolf \ud83d\udc3a for 5 minutes so far but he couldn\u2019t keep it up. Jack running through the woods sees a towering figure ahead of him. This figure completely dwarfed him and even the wolf itself, jack was feeling comfortable, maybe just maybe it was a building from the city, and if it was then he could get help. Jack ran closer and closer to the towering figure, it wasn\u2019t a building. Jack only a few feet from the figure covered in darkness finally was able to make out its form. Jack soon realizes that this figure was a women, and this women was even bigger than Julie. Julie stood about 250 feet tall, but this women was 300 feet tall. The women had long Black hair that came down to her waist, and dark black eyes as she looked at jack running towards her, and she wore amor that made her look almost like a amazon warrior, but the amor was more advanced, jack could tell seeing as how it had glowing purple lines that formed their own separate patterns. The women also wore a SyFy looking gun around her waist and a large metal sword \ud83d\udde1 on her back. Who ever she was, she was jacks best chance for survival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women runs towards jack with booming footsteps. Jack watches her black armored boots come closer and closer to him. Honestly jack couldn\u2019t help but wonder is this women going to step on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Hey! Hey! Slow down your going to step on me!\u201d Jack yells with his eyes closed  as the women runs closer to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack opens his eyes as a few minutes pass, and sees that the women had stepped over him as she runs towards the wolf. The women holds up her right hand, and a large staff appears As if by magic, as the women grabs the staff the very tip generates large amounts of electricity. Jack could see that The women was fast and was obviously trained, she moved swiftly as she attacked the wolf with her electrified staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle was over in a few seconds. The wolf let out a huge yelp as it was electrified by the women\u2019s staff. The wolf falls down completely knocked out, which totally surprised Jack. The voltage in that staff was so strong that even though it was far away from him, his hair on his arm and in his head stood up from the static electricity. Jack knew that if that staff even grazes him, he would be instantly killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women who was staring at the wolf for what seemed like a eternity, finally looks at jack with cold eyes. The women walks towards jack, her footsteps shaking the ground below jack, making it difficult for jack to stand up. The women kneels down on the ground a few feet away from jack. Jack being so close to the women was able to make out her face a little better, especially with her kneeling down. The women had a X shaped scar on her right cheek, other than the scare the women was pretty in jacks opinion, the women was as pretty as Julie, but unlike Julie this giant women scared him. The women was battle hardened, cold, like she saw the whole world as her enemy, and was ready to attack at a moments notice. Jack couldn\u2019t help but back away as he looked the women straight in the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour majesty, please let me bring you back to the castle.\u201d The women says colds, bowing her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women puts her right hand down on the ground, the staff she was holding disappeared as if it had never existed. Jack was not so sure if letting this women pick him up was the wises decision, but he didn\u2019t want to be attacked by anymore wild creatures, so against his better judgment he slowly walked into the open palm of the giant women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride was surprisingly comfortable, as the women walks through the forest. It didn\u2019t take the women long to reach the city, the woods seemed to fade away as the large trees where replaced with large buildings. You sat comfortably in the middle of the women\u2019s gigantic palm, jack would glance up at the women\u2019s face as she walked. The women didn\u2019t look at him at all her eyes remained forward, it was as if jack wasn\u2019t even worth her time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the women walks through the big open streets jack realizes that their where a lot of women out on the street, none where as tall as the women holding him. As jack passed these women they bow their heads in respect. Many of them who\u2019re smiles on their faces as they looked at jack, and many more whispered to one another and giggled, jack couldn\u2019t help but wonder do these women ever sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women holding jack soon makes it back to the castle that rested in the middle of the city. It was just as grand as the first time jack had laid eyes on it. In the middle of the front golden gates was Julie, and she looked upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCatherine thank god you found him.\u201d Julie says as she runs towards the women holding jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018So her name is Catherine?\u2019 You think to your self as you look at the women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie while looking at Catherine wears a smile on her face, but as her vision shifts to you, her face becomes stern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in trouble.\u201d Jack whispers to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack knew that look all to well, his mother would give him that look when ever he was in trouble. Looks like their was trouble in paradise. </span></div></div>",

Jack sat down crisscross inside Julie\u2019s open palm, looking up at her face, which didn\u2019t even glance to look at him. Julie was pissed and jack knew it, and the one thing he didn\u2019t want to do was make this giant women anymore angry than she already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn their way to jacks bed room chambers, jack saw many giant doors and many different hallways that went all in different directions of the large castle. He couldn\u2019t wonder where those certain hallways and doors led. Jack always had a heart of a adventurer this was pretty obvious as he continued to stare at these hallways and Doors filled with mystery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe that we have all have had enough fun for today don\u2019t you think, my lord.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack turns around to see Julie looking down right at jack with irritated eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh yea sorry.\u201d  Jack say with a little wimpier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie and jack after a few minutes finally make it back to jacks kingly room. Julie walks towards the bed and gently places jack on the top of the sheets. Jack standing on top of his bed stares at Julie who towers over him as she stands on her two feet staring down at jack with a stern look. Jacks bed almost reached up to Julie\u2019s hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGulp\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was feeling a little afraid. He had just met Julie and already he knew she wasn\u2019t the kind of person you wanted to get angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie after a few seconds of standing up looking down at jack finally gets on her knees. Julie brings her giant face a few inches away from jack. Julie was so close that jack could feel her breath run through his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack what you did was very dangerous.\u201d Julie says letting out a little sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Julie I didn\u2019t know how dangerous the forest could be.\u201d Jack says rubbing his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looking at Julie\u2019s mountain sized face sees something he didn\u2019t expect to see. Tears, tears started to run down Julie\u2019s face, tears that were able to completely drench jack with water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would I have done if something had happened to you.\u201d \ud83d\ude2d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was taken back from Julie\u2019s reaction he had never had anyone other than his mother care for him to such a extent. Jack walks towards Julie\u2019s right hand that was resting on the side of the bed and pats one of Julie\u2019s giant fingers that towered over him with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTheir, their I\u2019m alright Julie, so please don\u2019t cry, ok?\u201d Jack says with a little smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack could tell that Julie wanted to yell at him, but she was obviously watching her tone because she cared about him a lot. In truth jack felt flattered and honored to have someone like Julie in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I\u2019m alive thanks to Catherine.\u201d Jack says thinking back to the giant amazon that was even taller than Julie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie had finally stopped crying and was staring down at jack with eyes filled with peace. Julie wore a small smile on her face as if she was willing to let today\u2019s little incident slide, which jack wanted more than anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes we are very lucky that Catherine was their to protect you.\u201d Julie says with a relieved tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is Catherine anyway.\u201d Jack says a little curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looks down at jack with a little surprise, the question was a little unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCatherine is the leader of the Royal guards.\u201d Julie says with a little smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe royal guards? What are those.\u201d Jack asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe royal guards are the guards that are charged with guarding The planet. They are the first line of defense when it comes to the throne.\u201d Julie says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack finally was beginning to understand Catherine\u2019s role when it came to this new Society. But their was still something that bothered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJulie?\u201d Jack asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm?\u201d Julie asks as she lowers her face even more to be on jacks level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do I get the feeling that Catherine doesn\u2019t like me?\u201d Jack asks as he looks up at Julie, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie stares at jack for what seems like a life time. Julie wore a worried look as if she was hiding something that was about to be revealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack, Catherine\u2019s past is filled with pain, so much pain that she has learned not to trust anyone, not even me.\u201d Julie says with sadness in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease let\u2019s just leave it at that my liege.\u201d Julie says with that beautiful smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk.\u201d Jack says to tires to press the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let\u2019s get you into bed.\u201d Julie says picking up jacks tiny form and placing him on the pillow, that was to big for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie places the covers over jacks body and walks out towards the bedroom door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night my king.\u201d Julie says with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Authors notes)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey guys I hope you guys like the story so far.

Blades of grass swept in from either side to surround him, and he fought his way through as they leaned towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tripped over small pebbles on the ground, but he maintained his footing and kept forging ahead, determined to do whatever it took to save himself. The wolf then howled again. Judging by its volume, Jack hadn't gotten very far from it. He wondered why it hadn't got him yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen is struck him. The darkness was his ally! The wolf could barely see ahead of its own muzzle; it was relying solely on scent to track him down. He might actually have a chance after all! Jack, filled with a new found hope, pressed onward. He dashed across the ground, shoving clumps of grass aside and leaping over any obstacle that got in his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do this,\" he assured himself, breathing heavily. \"Everything will be alright.

You're just small. Maybe its a result of the different laws of physics between our two dimensions. As for my life... well, there is not much to say. I was merely a servant in this palace before I was appointed your guardian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tradition of choosing a king began in the aftermath of a devastating war. A long time ago, we used to have men on this planet. But although our world advanced like yours in many ways, women's rights was not one of them. Our societies stayed extremely patriarchal well past the modern age, and became increasingly tyrannical against women. So women started organizing in secret.. making plans... and eventually, one night, we wiped out the entire leadership of the dominant male government in a surprise attack. But we overreached... and killed every male on the planet in our thirst for revenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut we didn't know what kind of rule we wanted, and so we women fought among ourselves for control. Without the males, we could not reproduce, and so our population started to fall sharply. After years of bloodshed, just when it all seemed lost, a figure... a goddess... appeared from the heavens and stopped our civil war. She made all of the survivors a deal: she would use her powers to restore our population number to before the war, advance our technology so that we could see other worlds, and give us eternal life and youth. In return, each year, we would have to pick a man from your world, Jack, to rule over us, and we would have to do whatever he said or else, as the Goddess warned, the disaster that almost destroyed us would return again with a vengeance. To educate the ruler, a guardian is randomly selected from a raffle holding all the names of the ladies on this planet. I was simply lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack took a moment to let Julie's statements sink in. He then stood up and asked, \"Julie, I want you to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Um pardon if this comes out wrong but don't the women get lonely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie nodded her head, \"Well we do sometimes but we make do as best as we can.  With the advancements in technology we can do many things that were never possible.  Life for the most part is very enjoyable but it can be lonely.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack now understood that he was in charge of a super advanced world with a race of beautiful giants!  Now Jack was a good guy so he didn't want to take advantage of anyone but based on Julie's wistful voice they probably wanted him to have some sort of relationship with them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course given the size difference there were going to be a few challenges.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack mustered up his courage and asked, \"Julie if it was possible would you like to... well you know be with a man... like me?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie's face erupted into a full fledged smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that would be wonderful!  You are the first man I've seen in ages.  You are not turned off by my huge size?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack shook his head, \"Your perfect, in every way!  Well I'd love to get to know you on a more intimate basis.  If your willing I'm more then willing!  And I guess I should let you know ahead of time I do have some fantasies, anything you are uncomfortable with just let me know OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie giggled, \"Oh my I'd love to hear what turns you on!\"  </span></div></div>",

You might think it's weird.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I wouldn't think that!\" said Julie. \"Please don't be shy, Jack. You can tell me anything. You are the ruler here, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack took a deep breath and decided to let it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a submission complex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looked puzzled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Submission complex? What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that I like to be dominated,\" said Jack. \"Specifically by women. I like it when they're in control and I'm sort of helpless to their whims.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie nodded slowly. \"I think I understand,\" she said, then giggled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny about it?\" asked Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Julie, \"I think it's funny that you're supposed to be the ruler of my people, and yet you like to be ruled over instead. It's kinda ironic, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded and couldn't help but chuckle himself. \"Yeah, it is, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's nothing to be ashamed of,\" said Julie. \"Everyone has their own special characteristics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, there's actually one more thing,\" said Jack. \"You see, I also have a foot fetish. I think women's feet are a big turn-on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie raised an eyebrow. \"Really? That's interesting. I've never thought about something like that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since I'm spilling all of this out, I suppose I should also say that your feet are very attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie simply smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you, Jack. That's very kind.\"  She then wiggled her toes in front of him, and Jack blushed again.  \"Tell me, Jack... What exactly do you like about women's feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a little bit hard to answer. It's just like any other body part. When you're attracted to it, you don't really stop to ask why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But do you like all women's feet, or is there something particular you look for?\" asked Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there are certain things I look for,\" said Jack.  \"For one thing, I like women with big feet. And usually as a result of that, I like to go for tall girls because they're more likely to have big feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie just giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, from where you're standing, I'm probably the tallest girl with the biggest feet you've ever seen! No wonder you like them so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack continued blushing. \"You could say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie smiled.  \"I'm glad I found this out about you, Jack. It's nice to know your ruler on a personal level.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then noticed that Jack was blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be embarrassed,\" she said. \"Trust me, I have no problem with what you've told me, and I'm sure the other women would be very accepting too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a minute to think.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to think of it, I have an idea,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Jack.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then starts explaining to Jack, slowly so she makes sure he can understand everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you like my feet, for this hide and seek, your only hideouts would be my shoes... I mean, all my shoes ! I have a great collection, so you'd have plenty of places to hide. I'll slide my feet in them to try to find you, and if I do, I take you out with my toes. If I don't, I keep looking for you. You can of course leave a shoe to hide in another, for example, no need to remain in the same one !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tells him with a playful grin.

Soon enough, Julie walks back in and smiles down at her little ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done, we can start in my room, Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Jack let Julie pick him up and walking back to her room. Once there, he could see a lot of shoes on the ground, many pairs. Boots, sneakers, flats, all kind of shoes a woman would wear. Julie giggles a bit and sets Jack down on the ground while removing her flats and wiggling her toes a bit as a friendly tease, causing him to blush once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm gonna count to 100. Then I'll start looking for you~ Ready ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready !\" says Jack, both confident and excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Julie turns against a wall and finally starts to count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looks around the pairs and decides to go to...</span></div></div>",

Here's your new Master, Jack...\" Julie said, pointing to the currently fallen Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Betty said, then her green eyes widened \"Master! sorry for making you fall!\" She said, bowing on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, it's no problem really...and call me Jack..\" Jack awkwardly said, managing to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty smiled, her white teeth showing \"Sorry bout' that, I was managing the red roses...\" She explained, pointing to a cage, full of blooming roses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have roses on this planet?\" Jack inquired, looking surprised at the roses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not naturally. I specialize in getting plants from earth over to our world... I also helped get some of the earth's bees over here as well. They make such delicious honey...\" Betty explained, pointing to a giant wooden box in the garden, from which a buzzing sound could be heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Betty. Where do you come from? You have a bit of a accent...\" Jack asked the Brunette, who was currently folding the giant ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came from a distant land called Danosia... It never had a summer and it had hardly any food... Defiantly doesn't help when you love plants like I do...\" Betty sighed before continuing. \"Well, at least that's the glory of Macroterra. Just like your home planet earth, it has many different types of environments. I moved out here the first chance I got, and I must say that I'm enjoying myself now more than ever. I do kinda miss my family back home, though...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, sorry to hear that..\" Jack said, noticing the sad look on the Brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, Jack. You can go off and meet some other Giantesses. I have to plant some more Poapu seeds anyway...\" Betty smiled, waved, and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I do something wrong?\" Jack asked Julie, who was smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you didn't. It's just that Betty can get a little emotional when it comes to her homeland. Do do you want to go see anyone else? Or do you want to go back in the palace to have your Dinner?\" Julie asked.</span></div></div>",

Julie carefully enclosed Jack in her hands and walked down a hall over to what seemed to Jack to be a gargantuan table fit for... well, a king. Jack found a small chair his size near the center of the table and jumped down to sit on it. When he was seated, he felt a tremble across the table. Somebody else was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, five ladies turned up to claim the seats on the table. They were wearing evening gowns and had stunning looks. They sat down at the table, their eyes straight on Jack, the tiny new king of Macroterra. Their faces were practically emotionless, and their stares made Jack feel nervous, as though he was being examined as a man by these ladies. He was anxious to find out who on earth... err, Macroterra these women were, but decided to simply keep quiet and wait patiently. He'd find out soon enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie took her own seat and introduced the women: \"Your Majesty, King Jack, may I introduce the five Royal Viceroys of Macroterra.\" Each lady with an evening gown then smiled gently and stated her name: Samantha, Troy, Cassandra, Martha, and Artemis. Julie continued, \"Your majesty, these women are, after you, the most powerful individuals in Macroterra. They enforce your will throughout the five continents of this world and rule in your stead over the various territories of this planet, and they answer only to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for this knowledge, Julie. I will be sure to make good use of it in the days and weeks to come. Now is there anything to eat?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white haired, blue-eyed Viceroy, Troy, replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my king. What will I have the servants prepare?\"</span></div></div>",

But since she was pretty adamant about him being king, he thought it would be best to ask about this role. After all, he had no idea how long he would be here, so he might as well get used to the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if I am king,\" Jack started, \"then what am I expected to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie simply smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your job is to ensure that peace and harmony exists throughout the kingdom. You must be a good and fair ruler for us. That is why we choose a king that is pure of heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... But to ensure peace and harmony, what exactly must I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Within your land, you must treat the people fairly and kindly. We are peaceful by nature, but we do not allow ourselves to be pushed around. As for things beyond the kingdom, you are expected to keep the peace with other lands,\" said Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, there's others?\" asked Jack. \"How many?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few,\" said Julie. \"More of this will be explained back at the castle.

She was using a white lab coat, a pair of black frame and square edge glasses, a ponytail with brown hair and blue tips surely a dye used some time ago, and semi-transparent black stocking, ended in a pair of white flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Samantha I need to ask you some questions about some of the inventions you gave to me\" Julie said starting to squeeze Jack's body a little while she was distracted wasn't painful was more like some kind of massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course witch are you questions.?\" Asked the Asiatic woman now known as Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well can I use the thermic-glue in organic life and if its easy to clean too.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh those are some strange questions but let me see, first is easy to unstuck if you try to, that way you can use it yourself without danger or just use it in temporal purposes, also is easy to clean and isn't toxic either so yeah is completely organic friendly by the way why you asked.\" Samantha said frowning her brows a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I need to show you but is there somewhere I can sit, is necessary for me to show you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm well ok follow me the\" Said Samantha guiding Juelie to another room that looked like a doctors office with two guests chairs, one comfiest chair probably for the doctor, and one medical bed for superficial medical checks. \"well sit anywhere\" said Samantha while she was sitting in the doctor's chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Jullie said also sitting on the medical bed raising her legs to the bed too. \"you see I was the lucky one finding our new ruler, and he asked me to travel between my toes so...\" Julie was interrupted because.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha got up, approached and bowed before her new ruler \"sorry my king I didn't noticed you there\" said Samantha in total submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Jack unstuck himself from between Julies toes and get into the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, no, no don't worry I didn't expect to become the king out of nowhere anyway and please call me Jack I just can't live with so much formality and presure all the time.\" Said Jack with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I will call you Jack From now on, its true that you wanted to come here in Julie's shoe.\" Said Samantha  very interested in what you gonna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack became red as a tomato  not expecting that question \"sorry I know that is strange, I sholdn't ask for such a thing its just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah calm down there isn't any problem with your request actually I think its kind of cute, the reason I asked is because I'm working in a special type of shoe and maybe you would like it, of course I didn't expected to someone traveling inside one of them, so I'm gonna do some changes but I think that the final result would be of your liking\" winking suggestively to Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway if this on what you used the thermic-glue dont worry everything its ok, and I see that you gift to him the prototype of the micro-Comunicator I didn't expected that the king used my prototype already what do you think Jack it's useful.?\" Asked Samantha intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I can hear and talk normally its very useful but isn't so advanced.\" Said Jack sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we know that your people have headphones and everything, the special thing about yours is that for us it is a kind of micro technology that means many components in miniature and also is almost indestructible,\" said Samantha smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if everything is right then we should continue with our tour.\" Said Julie looking at Jack with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was surprised when he look at Julies feet seeing that her toes where wiggling expectantly of their new companion he without hesitation join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two woman above giggled with the scene and said theirs goodbyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and when the special shoes are ready I will send them to you, our Majesty\" Said Samantha before Julie take's you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie continues to tour the main areas of the castle at the end, Julie introduces Jack to another woman who seemed a little younger, this happened in the main garden area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman seems to be around nineteen and also looked taller than Julie 280 feet or so, looked a little like north Europe viking warrior, with mostly white hair shoulder length with purple highlights, also was wearing leather clothes mostly, some kind of explorer costume, with finger less gauntlets, white and brown blouse and shorts, and a pair of knee high boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Emily I need to present you someone.\" Julie said grabbing Jack from between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Jack our new ruler and ...\" Said Julie interrupted for a second time in a presentation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow really,? so cool let me see him closer\" Said this new woman called Emily taking forcefully Jack without waiting for any permission from Jack who get dizzy by the sudden movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah he really is tiny and so cute who is our new itsy bitsy ruler who?\" Emily said with baby tone, caressing, stroking, and poking with great enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful he is our new king and even if he is this tiny he isn't a baby, you should respect him.\" Said Julie with authority,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily stopped of caress Jack letting him to get back to his feet in middle of Emily palm. \"Sorry my majesty I was entranced by your handsomeness I will be more careful\" Emily said with an embarrassed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry actually was fun and please call me Jack\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so little Jacky you liked how I played with you.\" Emily said gesturing menacingly with her other hand at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem, Emily, what I told you a moment ago, if the king allows you to pet him is fine, but that should wait after our tour, and not immediately because he probably needs to rest after this long day, I also recommend that you tell him what it is your role here, \"said Julie still with an authoritative aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"jeez relax a little bit. I'm an ambassador who constantly travels between factions to keep the peace and an explorer to find new tribes and even forgotten civilizations. But with my work as ambassador and you being the new king, we're probably going to travel together often, so nice to meet you Jack \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Emily I will look forward to work with you.\" Said Jack a bit nervous after the complete experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok we need to keep going so give me back Jack please.\" Said Julie extending her hand to Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly Emily give Jack back to Julie and she started to place Jack back between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing\" Emily asked confused about what Julie was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing Jack asked to take the tour between my toes so im putting him back there.\" Julie said casually<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really mmm interesting.\" said Emily with a smirk surely thinking in future possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they said their goodbye's to each other. Some time later after more presentations and explications about the realm Julie took Jack to his room letting him in his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here you can rest, Your Majesty, I mean Jack rest well because tomorrow you will have your first real duty and you will choose whether to help Samantha with some inventions of her or go with Emily to resolve a dispute between some farmers on the outskirts of the kingdom Anyway, if you need anything, I am in the next room, you can call me through micro-Comunicator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night jack slept with many things in his head the next morning he decided to...</span></div></div>",

So he had stayed and helped her  support his little brother and sister, Coop and Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked up Julie whom had a kind smile on her face. \"Jack, is there anything you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I have a request. I want you to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was interrupted when the was opened and an another giantess step in. This woman was a few years older than Julie. She was the same height as Julie. Her was hair dark <span class=\"cbrown\">brown </span>which was tied up in a bun and her eyes were <span class=\"clgreen\">green</span>. She wore a<span class=\"clred\"> red </span>dress shirt and white pants.

For one thing please don't call me master, just call me Jack. And second, I request you bring my family here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth giantesses were silent after Jack made his request. Julie had a concerned look on her face like he had suggested to something bad. But Sandra only had a frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid we can't do that. We have rules against taking sentient being from others worlds and bringing them here. You are the exception to the rule because you were chosen to be king.\" She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As your king, I demand you bring my family here and now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie reluctantly reached into her pocket and pulled out a silver ball which was the size of a cow to Jack and placed it in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put your hand on this device and think of the people who you want to bring here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did as he instructed and thought of his family.

As he walk around he decided to walk in the garden in the park. As he walked he look around. It was getting late and there was no one around. He then saw a glowing rock in the middle of the pond. Jack looked at the rock and could make out a line of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What makes a man a fair king?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason Jack said. \"Wisdom to rule and a heart to understand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he said this the glowing rock sent a beam of light in to the night sky. Jack took a step back as the light opened, showing a swirling vortex. He had little time to enjoy the light show when a dark hand came out of it and grabbed him. He tried to fight the grip as the hand enveloped him and pulled him into the portal, which quickly snapped shut after the hand was inside. The rock then went back under the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack woke up in a field. As he looked around he could feel someone watching him. As he stood up, he felt as if he was tossed in a dryer set on high, and then proceeded to have a one too many drinks. As he moved he could make out things.<br>\r\nGrass, a lake, a few trees, a girl that the size of a mountain, some acorns scattered around...

He got about a few feet before he was picked up in her hand. She used only the amount of pressure she needed to pick him off the ground, being sure to use a soft grip so as not to hurt him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop moving around so much.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack laid out on his bed, another day of work done. It wasn't that he thought work was boring, his life was very normal, I mean sure he stopped to feed any random animal he found but that was the only somewhat special thing about him. Sighing, he just stared at the ceiling wondering if he should maybe go to a bar or something to escape the routine of his life. Deciding to take a nap, he started to fall asleep when a sound like an explosion sent him shooting about a foot in the air as he quickly looked around for the source of the noise. He turned just as the air in front of the door to his room literally ripped itself apart in a jagged white line. That white line slowly started to spin upon itself until it became some swirling blue vortex. That's when the voice appeared in his head, it sounded female and honestly kind of bored as it spoke. \"You have been chosen, you must enter the portal, however you will be tested, if you cannot enter the portal your memory will be wiped and you will remember none of this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack just stared at the swirling vortex for a second, annoyed that some random voice was not only telling him what to do but that it was already underestimating him. He stepped onto the floor and instantly it felt like there were weights attached to each of his limbs. He slowly started half walking/half dragging himself towards the portal, as he reached about halfway to it even though it wasn't far he suddenly felt more tired then he had ever felt in his life. However the voice appeared in his head again this time actually encouraging \"come on, you can make it.\" The voice instantly woke Jack up and he pushed himself till he was standing right in front of the portal, however he wasn't sure he had the energy to make it through. He head the voice again \"go, just one last push\" it shouts at him sounding almost frantic. Summoning all the strength he had left Jack threw himself through the portal the feeling of sleep overcoming him as he fully entered and he fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack woke up slowly to the sound of a soft voice singing what he could only assume was a lullaby. He slowly got up the first thing he saw was he was laying on some sort of furry carpet but he froze as his vision slowly traveled upwards finally locking eyes with the one singing. She was a vixen; that much was evident from the black fur on her hands and feet, white on the tip of her bushy tail, and redish-orange everywhere else including her face. However, she still looked quite human. Jack could tell her body was slim and well taken care of, as even under the fur he could make out her body creating an hourglass shape. Her furry form was covered in what looked like a pair of khaki shorts and a purple t-shirt that was doing a very poor job of containing a pair of perfectly round F-cup breasts. She had a small honestly quite cute muzzle and small black ears sticking out of the top of her head, however the thing you noticed the most were her eyes. They were a light icy blue and they stared straight at you. The final thing Jack figured out was her size, he was gently pushed over by her smallest finger telling him the vixen had to be all of 250ft tall and one of her fingers was bigger then he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen started to sing the same lullaby and her finger started to gently stroke his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What is she doing\"</i> he thinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to calm you master, I wouldn't think it would be easy being transported across dimensions\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?! Did you just-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Read your mind?\" she says finishing your sentence. \"Yes. Just to let you know, master, I can read your mind as well as project my thoughts into yours. It'll help me take care of you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack slowly started to sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If she wanted to hurt me, she would have already\"</i> he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then felt the furry digit move to let him get into a sitting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Macross, the name's derived from your word for really large animals, as well as the fact that all of our kings have had to cross dimensions.\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, about that, why do you keep calling me master?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, because your our new king of course! Doesn't this sound familiar?\" she says the final bit directly into his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe instantly recognized it as the same voice that showed up in his head that weird vortex appeared. Jack just sat there staring up at this giant Vixen <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait, wait, wait... Are you telling me that I'm supposed to be your king?\" he asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods slowly and smiles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You passed the test, so you get the crown\" she says a large smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is a human the king of a race of giant, pardon the phrase, furries?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our Goddess Aleera fell for a human once about a thousand years ago and he was the kindest and most generous king we ever had. That, and the fact that Aleera kind of developed a thing for humans. She decreed that from that point on each of our leaders was to be a human male who she had personally chosen and who had shown the determination to come here\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack simply nods slowly. It made about as much sense as anything else in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you are?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, I'm so sorry...\" she says as she holds her hand out and bows to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Vera, your personal adviser, guard, and hopefully I will become your trusted friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says the last bit with her head raised, and a quite cute smile spread over her muzzle. Jack just nods again, and he then takes a few seconds to look around. He was in a castle, that much was evident given that there was a four-poster bed that could hold 4 Vera's. One wall of the room was an open balcony with only translucent silk drapes separating the balcony and the room. All around the room were masterfully carved pieces of furniture all fit for something Vera's size and all looking like they had been painstakingly carved out of 1 piece of wood. The door was much the same but it was adorned with an ornate drawing of what looked like a unicorn girl holding up another human. Jack's gaze fell back on Vera, who smiled down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you like your bedroom?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-this is all mine?\" he replies stunned and Vera gives off a small chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is, master! Why? Is anything not to your liking?\" she asks, her tone growing somewhat nervous at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, this is more than I could ever dream of having...\" he says before pointing at what looked like a small jewellery box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's about as big as my bedroom back home\" he says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera walks over and lifts the box up for a second before smiling and putting it down <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, welcome to the lap of luxury master! Don't worry, we'll all take excellent care of you!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack just sits down the calmness from before disappearing as his mind tried to make sense of everything <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't do anything to deserve this... Why was I chosen? I'm just a normal guy...\" he says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jack's mind was flooded with images of every animal he had ever helped, as well as visions of how he showed each of his colleagues respect; even Jim, who admittedly was a total ass just because he was the boss' son. The next thing he knew, Jack was staring at Vera mostly eye to eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, you are kind, patient, forgiving, and you treat even those who are not human with respect and dignity. That is why you have been chosen.\" she states. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack just nods once more in reply, still having trouble taking in all that was happening in such a short time, before....</span></div></div>",

Despite that she did not drop him. Jack heard the Unicorn's girly voice (and propably the reason of the light)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- Is he here yet? -</b> Suddenly the light appeared again and the person disapperad. Before Jack could ask anything again a flash appeared yet again.<br>\r\n<b>- Is he here? -</b> This time the flash was not that hurtful of the eyes becouse this time the unicorn apperead on the opposite side of the room. <br>\r\n<b>- Is he here? -</b> Right afther that the scene repeated a few times. She was dissaperaing and reapering asking the same question looking in every corner of the room, on the balcony, in the closet and under the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Vera had enough and said<br>\r\n<b>- Incta!</b><br>\r\nThe uncorn startled a bit and turned to annoyed Vera. Jack now could see how the Unicorn looked like. Jack guessed she was about 200 feet. She had pure white fur with a long mane with the same color. She was wearing a black tank top with a reaveling her well toned stomach. Her Breats were at a FF cup. Her cleavege was barly contained in her tank top. She also wear black shorts that were reaching her knees. She had long and quite well built muscle on them. With wide hips and a round butt. Vera continued<br>\r\n<b>- Didint i tell you to not teleport like that! Giving me and our master a heart attack!<br>\r\n- Sorry, sorry but got so excied!</b> - Said Incta jumping in place a few times <b>- So he is here. Where? Where! WHERE!</b><br>\r\nVera lifted Jack standing on her Palm. Incta with a cute smile looked for a while at Jack. Suddenly she gradually frowned and rise her eyebrow<br>\r\n<b>- That's him? -</b> She said with a dissapointment in her voice<br>\r\n<b>- Something wrong? -</b> Jack asked<br>\r\n<b>- Defiently something wrong. Our. Master. Ss so Cute! -</b> this time she returned to her cheerish attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera sighed<b> - You put so much effort on this little show.

No need for such...<br>\r\n- Not only cute but also modest - </b>said Incta raising her head <b>- You will be a great master.

Nothing would make him stand out in a crowd at all, yet he was destined for something unbelievable: he was chosen to be the king of a race of giantesses! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1) no killing Jack<br>\r\n2) no futa<br>\r\n3) no giant males<br>\r\n4) the giantesses can have just about any type of personality you want, but if Jack tells them to do something (or not to do something), then they have to listen to him <br>\r\n5) the giantesses average about 250 feet tall, but I'll allow them to be anywhere from 100 feet tall (in the case of a very young girl) to 300 feet tall (since some people are a lot taller than average)<br>\r\n6) the technology on their homeworld is quite advanced compared to earth, and they have mastered inter-dimensional travel<br>\r\n7) they may or may not have super powers, and they may have a human appearance or be furries (this will be chosen at the start of the story)<br>\r\n8) Jack is supposed to be a nice guy, so I don't want to see him abusing his powers. This includes sending the giantesses on a mission to take over the earth, forcing them to be his sex slaves against their will, etc. (that's not to say that he can't have sex with them, but I just don't want him to be getting portrayed as the bad guy)<br>\r\n<i><b><u><br>\r\nIn order to improve the reading experience, I'll try to correct any spelling and grammar mistakes I find.
